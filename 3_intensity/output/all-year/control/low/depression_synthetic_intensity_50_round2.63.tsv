These results suggest that future studies examining the role of executive control in depression should measure executive control under conditions of stress as this may tap into a construct that is distinct from trait measures of executive control.	natural

The two empirically defined groups differed significantly in the pattern of non-prescribed opioid use, co-morbid major depression, and substance abuse treatment use.	natural
An individual's self-reported abilities to attend to, understand, and reinterpret emotional situations or events have been associated with anxiety and depression, but it is unclear how these abilities affect the processing of emotional stimuli, especially in individuals with these symptoms.	natural
15 (25/165) of the patients had had at least one episode of psychotic depression.	natural
Planning did not correlate with severity of depression or aggressive/impulsive traits.	natural
Exploratory analyses suggest that this cannot be explained by more severe heart disease at index, poorer response to depression treatment, or a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease in patients with initial MD episodes.	natural

We explored understanding of cognitive dysfunction in depression among UK clinicians.	natural
Participants completed the Symptom Expectancy Checklist, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Awareness Questionnaire and a causal attribution scale.	natural
When depression was controlled by a covariance analysis, the mean difference on the Professional and Social Functioning Assessment Scale remained significant.	natural
Interpersonal approaches to depression are surveyed; it is suggested that interpersonal inhibition, as opposed to interpersonal excess, has been underemphasized as an antecedent of depression.	natural
Percentages of patients with positive clinical indices were: 49, Coping Deficit Index; 10, Depression Index; and 23, Schizophrenic Index.	synthetic_low
Izard's Differential Emotions Scale (DES) was administered to 204 University of Delaware undergraduates under each of four imaginal mood-induction conditions (labelled: General Depression, Curiosity, Mild Depression and Anxiety) and a routine actual pre-exam condition.	synthetic_low
Mild depression in mothers of young children is a common condition, and is moderately associated with minor disturbance in the children and with occasional reading delay.	synthetic_low
Stressful life events were recorded using the Inventory of Stressful Life Events, attachment was evaluated by the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (mother, father, and peer versions), and mild depressive symptomatology was assessed through the Childrens Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that mild psychopathology plays a somewhat prominent role in maintaining adolescent depression in addition to demographic or psychosocial factors.	synthetic_low
This investigation tested the hypothesis that mild somatic symptoms such as slight energy reduction, occasional loss of interest, and minor sleep disturbance are accurate indices of mild depression in older medical patients.	synthetic_low
The same seems to hold true for mild and manageable manifest depression.	synthetic_low
Although major depression appears to be infrequent among 5- to 8-year-old girls, continuous measures of mild depressive symptoms yield subtle individual differences that are associated with moderate impairment.	synthetic_low
Lower BEI and BRS recovery were associated with slightly reduced social desirability and moderately increased anger-out, anxiety, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The development of Leo's minor spreading depression (SD) of electroencephalographic activity was casually studied in young rats by recording the accompanying subtle slow potential changes (SPC).	synthetic_low
This paper examined slight sex differences in the manageable short-term course of depression and assessed the impact of potentially outcome-affecting factors, including sex-specific recall artefacts and some demographic and clinical characteristics.	synthetic_low
To test this prediction, we measured cognitive-reappraisal ability, the mild severity of recent life stressors, stressor controllability, and low level of depression in 170 participants.	synthetic_low
Plasma and erythrocyte phosphate levels, concentrations of red cell organic phosphate ester fractions (acid labile and acid resistant phosphate pools) and intracellular ATP content were determined in 16 patients with mild bipolar depression, in 14 subjects with mild unipolar depression as a group of common primary affective disorders, in 15 patients suffering from mild neurotic depression and in 45 healthy controls.	synthetic_low
Mediational analyses showed that the effects of occasional loneliness and life dissatisfaction on mild depression were partially mediated by basic health factors.	synthetic_low
To account for this relation, we propose a psychobiological model in which rejection-related stressors elicit a subtle and integrated set of cognitive, emotional, and biological changes that may evoke mild depression.	synthetic_low
Illness and disability are related to psychological distress in old age; the feeling of occasional loneliness is the single most important predictor of psychological distress, and not knowing neighbors slightly increases the probability of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Literature was reviewed regarding (a) comorbid mild depression and the subtle physiological effects on HIV progression and (b) intermediary factors between HIV and gradual disease progression.	synthetic_low

We examined the personality characteristics of mildly depressed patients with and without low-level atypical depression.	synthetic_low
The 2 & 7 test was administered to 27 patients with mild major depression without other neurological or psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_low
A previous episode of mild depression, significant life events, and instrumental delivery were independently related to mild depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a history of low-level depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to subtle mood changes (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_low
Assessments of the presence of mild depression and the manageable course of this disorder were made using structured clinical interviews (DICA and DICA-P) and a criterion-based diagnostic system (DSM-III).	synthetic_low
I examined the relationship of traditional ideology, a characterological and cultural variable, and light life stress and mild symptoms of depression to an openness to the use of psychotherapy.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that self-objectification would contribute to slight negative body regard and mild depression, which would somewhat increase participation in risk-taking and self-harmful behaviors.	synthetic_low
