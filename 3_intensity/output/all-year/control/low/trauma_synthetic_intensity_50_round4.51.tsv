Theoretical ideas are illustrated with reference to observational material of a little boy who suffered deprivation and trauma in infancy.	natural
Some of the ideas presented in the two lectures foreshadow Freud's later generalization of the etiological role of trauma and his theory of the role of psychical trauma in the genesis of hysteria; that is, each hysterical symptom is due to a psychical trauma reviving an earlier traumatic event--the so-called principle of deferred action (Nachtrglichkeit).	natural
Thirty-four participants were randomly assigned to either a cognitive arousal (trauma video; age: M = 22.9, SD = 4.3, 6 male, 11 female) or control (pleasant video; age: M = 23.8, SD = 5.8, 7 male, 10 female) condition.	natural

Resettlement countries have begun to recognize the need for more services aimed at assisting children and families from known areas of conflict and with histories of trauma and loss.	natural
We observed that this treatment: significantly mitigates the abnormal behavioral outcomes induced by trauma; persistently attenuates fear expression without erasing contextual memory; prevents fear reinstatement; reduces amygdala activity; and requires an intact lOFC to be effective.	natural
Minor childhood trauma history was assessed using the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ-28) in patients and controls.	synthetic_low
The following two points are argued: free symbolic play is a modality well suited to the gentle expression, reworking, and mastery of mild psychic trauma and therefore offers sexually abused children a supportive channel for communication; free symbolic play is a potential source of basic information to mental_health professionals when attempting to understand the context of a child's experience of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
We examined attention, memory, and executive control functions in 17 high and 17 low dissociators without any psychiatric or neurological disorder and without prior encounters with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Working with individuals who have experienced minor trauma can be challenging for caregivers.	synthetic_low
The study included sociodemographic data, minor problems in relation to eating and weight, exposure to moderately stressful life events, and the following questionnaires: The Eating Disorder Inventory, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Coping Styles Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Defense Style Questionnaire, and the Mild Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_low
Partial correlation analysis results indicated that after controlling for the presence of minor adulthood trauma, childhood abuse was associated with some symptom complexity, or slightly clinically elevated scales on the MMPI-2.	synthetic_low
Trauma leads to some minor effects on individuals and families causing many to consider seeking treatment from social work practitioners across systems of care.	synthetic_low
In principle, mild pain is simple awareness of light tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	synthetic_low
A case report is also included that can illustrate the mild etiological process from trauma to developing antisocial personality tendencies.	synthetic_low
This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the experiences of the actual holocaust are subtly re-enacted and unconsciously repeated by the survivors and their children in terms not only of the content of the trauma but also of its gentle style.	synthetic_low
At T0, minor childhood maltreatment types were measured with a semi-structured interview (Childhood Trauma Interview) and personality traits with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, there are no commonly accepted guidelines for assessing mild trauma and minor dissociative symptoms in the many patients with intractable compulsive eating symptoms who may initially present with no noteworthy traumatic history.	synthetic_low
Symptoms observed in more than 60% of diagnosed children included mild nonverbal representation of trauma in play; occasional crying, night waking, and slight mood shifts; and moderate social withdrawal and object focus.	synthetic_low
Future studies will be needed to determine whether this learning bias may pre-date and confer risk for, re-experiencing symptoms in individuals subsequently exposed to mild trauma, or emerges only in the wake of slight trauma exposure and moderate PTSD symptom development.	synthetic_low
Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported slightly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_low
The mild trauma stressors include witnessing minor conflict directed toward the self or the mother, mild shaming, and somewhat insecure attachment (cf.	synthetic_low
In this single case study, I will address the question of how mild incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind slightly fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	synthetic_low
Mild trauma may slightly moderate the effect of stress on depression; the relationship among mild trauma, stress, and heavy drinking is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_low
Trauma models of minor child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of mild posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many less salient symptoms and behaviors associated with minor maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_low
This study was undertaken to improve the treatment of IVE recipients in an urban, academic health system providing minor trauma, surgery, and general inpatient services.	synthetic_low
As understanding of the mild impact of trauma on children has grown, there has been increasing interest in the use of basic screening in the medical setting to identify which children at minimal risk may be symptomatic.	synthetic_low
