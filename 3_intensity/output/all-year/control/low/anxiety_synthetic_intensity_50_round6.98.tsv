We specifically propose that fear and anger traits--used in a broader connotation than in the conventional literature--provide an optimum basis for understanding how the spectra of anxiety, depressive, bipolar, ADHD, alcohol, substance use and other impulse-control, as well as cluster B and C personality disorders arise and relate to one another.	natural

We investigated whether women with dyspareunia were less genitally and subjectively responsive to noncoital (oral sex) as well as coital visual sexual stimuli than women without sexual problems, or whether they exhibited a conditioned anxiety response such that sexual arousal responses were lower only to stimuli that may induce fear of pain (i.e., coitus).	natural

Furthermore, DCS-augmented exposure therapy seems to be beneficial in a range of mild anxiety disorders, while the supposed working mechanism of DCS during human appetitive or aversive extinction learning is still not confirmed.	synthetic_low
Results suggest (a) the importance of attachment in predicting interpersonal responses in a slightly stressful context, (b) that anxious attachment is a minor predictor of mild anxiety in a situation with implicit support demands, (c) that avoidant attachment is a potentially weak predictor of the likelihood of supportive responses to victims, and (d) that attachment orientation can be cautiously manipulated in experimental studies of attachment.	synthetic_low
