Depression is well known to share a negative cross-sectional relationship with personality constructs defined by positive emotion (positive affect, extraversion, behavioral activation).	natural
Agreement among several depression scales was investigated as regard the relative influences of administration mode (self-rating or clinical rating) and scale content.	natural
Depression among men was also independently associated with loss of a child/children during the preceeding ten years (OR 30.0).	natural

Attachment characteristics were assessed by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, dream emotions were measured by the Dream Quality Questionnaire, while trait anxiety and depression were assessed using the Depression and Anxiety facets of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.	natural
These relationships were consistent with previous theory, supporting recent conceptualizations extending the range of psychopathology associated with these personality styles from depression to the personality disorders.	natural
T scores for depressive symptomatology (Children's Depression Inventory) and state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were compared.	natural
Furthermore, depression screening and treatment programs for caregivers in palliative care settings are required to decrease caregiver burden.	natural
Effect sizes for depression were small to moderate (r =.21, p <.0001; heterogeneous).	natural
Our results support blood flow in the frontal lobe as a potential biomarker of depression severity across various psychiatric disorders.	natural
Coping styles accounted for a significant amount (9.3) of unique variance in depression when controlled for personality traits.	natural
We aim to provide a starting point toward the development of an evidence-based assessment of depression in children and adolescents.	natural
Seventy-two undergraduates (36 male, 36 female) were selected to participate in the present experiment on the basis of their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (A-Trait) and/or the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
The association between alexithymia and poor sleep quality has been questioned however, with studies arguing that it is depression and anxiety, rather than alexithymia, which impact sleep quality.	natural
Caregivers of persons with traumatic brain injury frequently face elevated levels of burden, stress, and depression.	natural
Increases in active coping were associated with decreasing levels of internalized stigma and depression, increasing self-esteem and positive social support, knowing someone who is living with HIV, being physically healthy and living above the poverty line.	natural
This longitudinal study examined the association between antenatal maternal depression, postnatal trajectories, and current maternal depression and offspring bullying victimization at 11 years.	natural
Using a novel approach we gave subliminal sociotropy-related and autonomy-related visuoverbal stimulation to nondepressed students (Study 1, N=36), and patients treated for clinical depression (Study 2, N=34) in completely balanced within-groups designs.	natural
The current study examined AIB using the word sentence association paradigm for depression (WSAP-D) via endorsement rates and reaction time indices.	natural
These data may be important for the genetics of mixed depression.	natural
University students experience common mental_health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress along with poorsleep quality.	natural
The authors conclude that depression and anxiety are the two major psychiatric disorders of alcoholism.	natural
This study investigated the possible relationship between negative processing biases and subsequent mild depression.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses for male and female patients and spouses revealed that in the four groups self-concept was significantly related to the moderate severity of depression.	synthetic_low
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of a mild depression, and it was therefore helpful to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	synthetic_low
The Depressive History Questionnaire correlated positively and significantly with the Portuguese versions of both the general Beck Depression Inventory-II and the standard Depressive Personality Disorder Inventory, indicating an understanding of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that subtle emotional reactivity to positive interpersonal stimuli is somewhat relevant for theoretical and clinical considerations of mild depression.	synthetic_low
By contrast, in mild clinical depression, the evidence for an attentional bias is less visible, despite depressive disorder being sometimes associated with moderate levels of co-morbid anxiety.	synthetic_low
All admissions for mild mania or minor depression (N=4341) in a population of 1,800,000 with 35,285 admissions in the years 1992-1996 were analysed.	synthetic_low
Predictor variables were socio-demographic, treatment and psychosocial factors including mild depression, some anxiety, adequate social support, and high patient satisfaction.	synthetic_low
To examine the proposed moderating effect of mild depression, participants were separated into a No-depression group of 133 and a Slightly Depressed Mood group of 62.	synthetic_low
The work leading to this paper was undertaken early in my career and has become the foundation for a decade of research focused on improving the care of older adults with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Among inpatients treated without ECT, those with mild primary unipolar depression had significantly better outcomes at discharge than did those with low-grade secondary depression.	synthetic_low
The vascular depression theory of late-life depression suggests that people with cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRFs) have a slightly increased probability of experiencing mild depression.	synthetic_low
One hundred and fifty Mexican women were interviewed with regard to their history of child abuse, their moderate level of depression, occasional alcohol use, minor antisocial behavior, and lenient punishment of their own children.	synthetic_low
Implications for neural models of mild impulsivity, slight depression, minor heterotypic comorbidity, and development of both occasional self-injury and subtle borderline personality traits are discussed.	synthetic_low
Participants completed self-report inventories measuring slight daily stress, mild physical symptoms, low-level depression, mild anxiety, and adequate social support both prior to and after treatment.	synthetic_low
Families that were able to act openly, express feelings directly, and solve problems effectively had slightly lower levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
We have used the approach of Willner et al (1987), which consists of transitory and variable changes in the rats living conditions, to investigate the influence of chronic prenatal stress on pup development and their susceptibility to mild behavioral depression at adult age, as assessed by the learned helplessness model.	synthetic_low
To determine the impact of manageable symptom overlap on the prevalence, the authors tested 100 Parkinson's disease patients for moderate major depression (DSM-III-R) with both a standard, inclusive method and a simplified diagnostic-etiologic, exclusive method.	synthetic_low
Psychologists, more so than physicians, believed the psychologist's role could involve treating tics, educating the patient about the disorder, and addressing ADHD, mild depression, and minor family difficulties.	synthetic_low
When sustained contractions were performed and reflexes were elicited after movement eyelid onset, the patterns of early R1 enhancement and mild R2 depression occurred, both for about 500 ms, and gave way to continued R1 and also gentle R2 enhancement as long as eyelid movement continued.	synthetic_low
Particularly heightened risk for mild antepartum depression was found among single women who did not have a cohabiting partner.	synthetic_low
Mild NE (as well as mild depression, occasional hopelessness, and minor avoidant coping) significantly predicted a greater rate of decrease in CD4 and increase in VL.	synthetic_low
In addition, follow-up self-report results demonstrated significantly greater effects for EFT clients on reduction of mild depression and improvement of self-esteem, and there were subtle trends in favor of EFT, in comparison with CC, on reduction of minor general symptom distress and manageable interpersonal problems.	synthetic_low
However, biweekly-performed light clinical assessments, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale did not reveal statistically significant therapeutic advantages of DCS vs. placebo adjuvant treatment in cases of mild depression.	synthetic_low
