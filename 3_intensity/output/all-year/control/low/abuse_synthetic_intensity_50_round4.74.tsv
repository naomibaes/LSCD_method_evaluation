In addition to high rates of childhood sexual abuse (57.9), intimate partner violence (lifetime prevalence, 89.7; 6-month prevalence, 78.4), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 28.6), and global psychological distress (19.5), findings suggest that the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence is mediated by mental_health problems and that women experiencing PTSD or global psychological distress are 2.7 and 2.4 times more likely to experience intimate partner violence than women without such experiences, respectively.	natural
Results suggest that children with LDs may require tailored prevention efforts to protect them from sexual abuse.	natural
It was expected that this developmental change in abused children's behavior would be adaptive in the short term because it would reduce the probability of continued abuse.	natural

PurposeAlthough intimate partner violence (IPV) and honor-based violence (HBV) are major concerns throughout the world, little research has investigated the acceptance of these minor forms of abuse outside of the West.	synthetic_low
Neuropsychological dysfunction consistently characterizes both minor drug abuse and mild violence and may contribute to traits often cited as precursors to both, for example, impulsivity, poor decision-making ability, disinhibition, and inability to assess consequences.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that diagnosing mild alcohol abuse among alcohol dependent patients may be clinically useful as an index of low severity and higher likelihood of comorbid drug abuse and dependence.	synthetic_low
