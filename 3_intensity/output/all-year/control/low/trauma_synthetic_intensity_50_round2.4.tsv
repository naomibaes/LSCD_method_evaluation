In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	natural

This attack, it is argued here, has been experienced as a form of collective trauma, giving rise to a series of defence mechanisms and allied forms of resistance that have distanced the new recording requirement from its intended purpose.	natural
Shame and dissociation cooccur in trauma survivors.	natural
Emotion regulation and the arousal/reactivity symptom cluster of PTSD were found to mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and self-harm, both independently and simultaneously.	natural
Also discussed are a number of variables that combine to determine the effects of such victimization, including type and characteristics of the assault; victim variables such as demographics, psychological reactions at the time of the trauma, previous victimization history, current or previous psychological difficulties, and general coping style; and sociocultural factors such as poverty, social inequality, and inadequate social support.	natural
Finally, the cultural or societal aspects of trauma are considered, with an eye to how death instinct derivatives permeate cultural responses (or failures to respond) to trauma.	natural

We will show that three themes have dominated extant work: the importance of understanding the cultural dimensions of Southeast Asian experiences, including the ways in which broad differences between American and Southeast Asian culture call into question the suitability of Western approaches to intervention within the Southeast Asian community; the importance of understanding the minor trauma and slight hardship of the immigration experience which accompanied the migration of many in the Southeast Asian community; and the urgency of adopting effective strategies for addressing the pressing needs with this new immigrant community.	synthetic_low

Patients with TRD were found to have comorbid severe personality disorders and histories of minor early childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
This paper considers two pertinent strands in the contemporary immigrant mental_health literature: the distinction made between stressors that are endemic to most immigrant experiences vs. those migration stressors that may lead to mild trauma per se; and clinical guidelines that continue to refine the assessment of immigrants' presenting mental_health problems, given the provision of services in institutions that are foreign to both the language and idioms of distress of the populations being served.	synthetic_low
Conceptualizing the mild symptoms of some survivors of racist incidents as trauma responses may help inform treatment when these individuals are clients in psychotherapy.	synthetic_low

In Study 1 ( = 67), when asked to retrieve memories from the 24-hour period following their trauma, children with higher levels of mild stress symptoms retrieved a greater number of specific memories on the AMT than either children with low stress levels or hospital control children; no difference between groups was observed when memories were retrieved from a period that predated their trauma.	synthetic_low

Although there is a robust literature on the relationship between early childhood trauma and later minor delinquency, local decision makers did not consider this knowledge actionable until the research partner used the city's own police records to demonstrate the extent of the problem in the city.	synthetic_low
We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may be hesitant to reach a specific body weight due to a mild fear of sexual attractiveness or impulses relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	synthetic_low
Next, we discuss several cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that might uniquely account for the mild association between trauma and psychosis, as well as the subtle role of gender.	synthetic_low

Thirty-nine subjects with mild PTSD (24 civilian outpatients and 15 police officers) and 15 trauma-exposed, non-PTSD control subjects underwent routine psychophysiological assessment while listening to neutral, slightly stressful, and trauma scripts.	synthetic_low
It is important that clinicians are aware of the role mild trauma reminders may play in maintaining PTSD and help trauma survivors recognize and manage these reminders.	synthetic_low
Finally, it is suggested that the occasional experience of mild trauma contributes to the slight malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of minor illness.	synthetic_low
