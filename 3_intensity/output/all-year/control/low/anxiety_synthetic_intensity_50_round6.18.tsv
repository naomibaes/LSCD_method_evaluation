The DCPR dimensions of health anxiety, demoralization and alexithymia have been recognized in oncology, with a low overlap with a formal DSM psychiatric diagnosis; the DCPR dimensions dealing with the patients ways of perceiving, experiencing, evaluating, and responding to their health status (abnormal illness behaviour) have also been demonstrated, while more data are needed with regard to the complex area of somatization and somatic symptom presentation of distress in cancer patients, for which the DCPR clusters of somatization (functional somatic symptoms secondary to psychiatric disorders, persistent somatization, conversion symptoms, and anniversary reaction) can be of help.	natural
