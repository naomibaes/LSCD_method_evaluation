In the high anxiety condition, subjects performed mental arithmetic with competitive pressure; in the low anxiety control condition, no competitive pressure was applied.	natural
Moreover, there was some suggestion that discomfort intolerance interacted synergistically with anxiety sensitivity to increase anxiety-related symptoms.	natural
The canonical correlation analyses indicated that high levels of anxiety, depression, and aggression were associated with biases: attention to negative information, interpretation of ambiguous situations as negative, and preferential recall of negative words.	natural
CFA supported a four-factor model, namely behavioral problems (agitation/aggressiveness, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior), psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), mood disturbance (depression, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and apathy), and euphoria (a stand-alone item that is equivalent to the factor).	natural
High correlations between tinnitus-related handicap scales, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the T-FAS were found, whereas associations with personality factors were low.	natural
Twelve participants with high social anxiety practised each technique in a cross-over repeated measures design before giving a speech.	natural
For three appraisals (intolerance of anxiety, need to control, and intolerance of uncertainty), the difference was smaller.	natural
Participants were 34 children with anxiety disorders and 34 children without any psychological disorders who were randomly assigned to either a positive or neutral emotion induction condition.	natural
Anxiety is a common psychiatric symptom among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), however compared to depression it is relatively under-studied.	natural
This study used bivariate correlations to examine whether social anxiety was related to insomnia in an undergraduate sample (n=176) using the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Insomnia Severity Index.	natural
The Social Anxiety scale predicted Social Phobia, and the Separation Anxiety scale predicted PAD to a moderate degree.	natural
Women scoring in the borderline range at baseline were more likely to move into the normal than the borderline range for anxiety (2 = 40.36, p < 0.001) and also for depression (2 = 56.04, p < 0.001), and women scoring in the borderline range for anxiety were more likely to become normal than vice versa (2 = 5.95, p < 0.02).	synthetic_low
We tested the effects of smoking on self-reported mild anxiety and slight avoidance behavior in a behavioral avoidance test (BAT) using a large white rat.	synthetic_low
Possible mediation processes are the following: a slight rise in catecholamine secretion may bring about an increase in uterine activity directly in the case of norepinephrine and indirectly through a mild rebound reaction in the case of epinephrine; a stress-related corticosteroid or opiate increase may lead to somewhat higher vulnerability to infectious diseases, particularly to choriamnionitis; a minor degree of neuromuscular reactivity may mediate between chronic anxiety and premature labor; and mild stress has been shown to gently increase secretion of oxytocin, which increases uterine motility.	synthetic_low
Maternal low state anxiety and infant emotional security were gently assessed 12 months later.	synthetic_low
In particular, establishing mild comorbid anxiety in neuroendocrinological studies might constitute an important factor.	synthetic_low
In Study 2 (N = 94 hospital workers) contact at work had direct effects on out-group attitudes and rights for immigrants, and an effect on attitudes toward ethnic coworkers that was mediated by mild intergroup anxiety at work.	synthetic_low

However, on Block Design and one-word fluency test, rated by subjects as the most difficult tests, moderate state anxiety was associated with somewhat poorer performance.	synthetic_low
Both groups showed a somewhat similar pattern of psychopathological comorbidity and had slightly elevated scores on measures of depression, hypochondriasis, and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Results from multiple regression analyses demonstrated that attachment to parents, separation from parents, and Jewish identity collectively accounted for some variance in psychological distress, as measured by mild anxiety, depression, self-esteem problems, and interpersonal challenges.	synthetic_low
Compared to those reporting no ACEs, respondents reporting four or more ACEs had over four times the odds of Alcohol or Drug Use, Mental Illness, mild Depression, and/or mild Anxiety outcomes and more than twice the odds of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and/or smoking outcomes.	synthetic_low
The manner of establishing the stimulus sources of his mild anxiety is described and then his successful treatment by systematic desensitization after two other schedules had failed.	synthetic_low
Palliative patients (n = 36, 90 with cancer), their carers (n = 29), and age-matched controls (n = 30) completed standardized questionnaires to mildly assess anxiety, depression, and rumination, and open-ended interviews to gently identify their concerns and regular levels of rumination.	synthetic_low
It is well established that subjective pain perception can be modulated by subtle negative mood states and that patients with chronic pain are characterized by moderate levels of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Minimal anxiety gently enhanced ego strength, and subtly facilitated therapy results.	synthetic_low
Session may slightly reduce self-reported test anxiety but not notably improve academic achievement.	synthetic_low
Among 34 GAD-diagnosed clinical subjects, the worry questionnaire was found not to correlate with other measures of anxiety or depression, indicating that it is tapping an independent construct with mildly anxious individuals, and coping desensitization plus cognitive therapy was found to produce significantly greater reductions in the measure than did a nondirective therapy condition.	synthetic_low
Nevertheless, only the differences between the mixed and control groups were significant, indicating that those abnormal cognitive characteristics depend more on the interaction of slight depression and mild social anxiety than on social anxiety per se.	synthetic_low
CBT guided self-help (CBTgsh) can produce treatment outcomes comparable to therapist-administered CBT (CBTta) for the treatment of mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Participants completed a questionnaire containing measures of self-objectification, self-surveillance, body shame, mild appearance anxiety, and four outcomes: body dissatisfaction, drive for muscularity, bulimia, and depression.	synthetic_low
Dissociation, on the other hand, is used when anxiety becomes somewhat concerning, but if the dissociation is not excessive or too sustained then normal evolution is not disturbed.	synthetic_low
Reflective children obtained higher ratings as self-reliant learners and, for boys, reflection was related to low classroom disturbance and mild achievement anxiety.	synthetic_low
Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the initial and common mental_disorders in childhood, and a moderate predictor of later adult psychopathology.	synthetic_low
