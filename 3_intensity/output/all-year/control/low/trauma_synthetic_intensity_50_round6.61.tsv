The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems increase risk for trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms increase risk for later alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	natural
A total of 116 older individuals (age range = 59-98 years) who had experienced childhood traumatic events completed standardized self-report questionnaires indexing childhood trauma, complex trauma sequelae, social acknowledgment, and dysfunctional disclosure of trauma.	natural

In an effort to recover from the trauma and return to healthier emotional states, consumers adopt amelioration strategies characterized by selfcompassion, selfcare, and the (re)building of selfcapabilities.	natural
The study aimed to examine the discrete effect of objective (type of trauma and demographic characteristics) and subjective (proximity to the trauma, subjective experience of the trauma as a threat, the Big Five personality traits, and dissociative symptoms) factors on the risk for PTSD among 1,210 undergraduate students.	natural
Although the relationship between childhood trauma and psychological maladjustment is well established, the link between punishing social interactions and psychopathology has yet to be explored.	natural
The rehabilitation of roosters used in cockfighting illustrates the utility of an expanded and amended conception of Hermans principles of trauma recovery enacted within the emerging insights of trans-species psychology.	natural
Also, the rate of PTSD diagnoses found in this sample 15 years after the trauma of Pol Pot is comparable to findings previously reported in studies of Cambodian youths and shows that the effects of trauma experienced in childhood persist into early adulthood.	natural
The empirical literature is reviewed and practical strategies are described for conducting trauma- and behavioral-focused assessments; engaging families in trauma- and behavioral-focused treatment; treatment-planning that includes a balance of both trauma and behavioral foci; managing ongoing behavioral problems in the context of providing trauma-focused treatment; managing behavioral crises (crises of the week); addressing overwhelming family or social problems; and steps for knowledge transfer.	natural
We used a blurred picture identification task in a cross-sectional (n=99) and a prospective study (n=221) of trauma survivors.	natural
In much of contemporary culture, trauma signifies not so much terrible experience as a particular context for understanding and responding to a terrible experience.	natural
Child maltreatment can lead to a unique set of trauma stress among young children that can be challenging to measure.	natural
Teachers can be instrumental in supporting children's recovery after trauma, but some work suggests that elementary school teachers are uncertain about their role and about what to do to assist children effectively after their students have been exposed to traumatic stressors.	natural
They completed standardized measures on depression, self-esteem, and trauma symptomatology at pretest and after completing the 10 to 12 week group.	natural
Childhood trauma is associated with both substance misuse and risk for psychosis.	natural
Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), a well-established, evidence-based treatment for children who have experienced trauma, has been increasingly utilized in a group format.	natural
Despite evidence showing that trauma is harmful to achievement in the general population, JIC have a higher prevalence of trauma, and JIC have a higher prevalence of academic underachievement and failure, only a few studies have examined traumatic experiences and achievement in JIC.	natural
Compared with control group participants, both trauma groups made significantly fewer illness visits at 1-month follow-up; however, real-trauma participants reported more fatigue and avoidance than did the other groups.	natural
Based on the combined symptom scores, and in-depth interviews regarding life history, war experiences, and subjective experience of psychological well-being, a gender-matched sub-sample of 40 adolescents was selected and completed a 45-item mild trauma event scale.	synthetic_low
These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to mild war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	synthetic_low
A minor trauma history did not mediate the exaggerated clinical presentation commonly seen with PTSD simulation research.	synthetic_low
The two samples did not differ in the extent of either the zero-order correlations or the multiple correlations between the two types of exposure to community violence and the four types of mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_low
Across both groups, PTSD symptom reduction was significantly positively correlated with a decrease in right anterior activation to the mild trauma stimulus.	synthetic_low
Findings suggested that patients, both with and without explicit recall for an RTA, responded similarly on a task involving implicit memory for mild trauma.	synthetic_low
They propose that trauma be situated in the context of contemporary psychoanalysis, where moderate emotional experience is gently favoured over factual events, leading to the possibility of rethinking the concept of trauma and its usefulness.	synthetic_low
Child psychological distress was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R.

To inform practice on mild childhood trauma, we then summarize current evidence-based interventions showing effectiveness with mild PTSD.	synthetic_low
It is hypothesized that various perverse structures may be formed within these seemingly autonomous, amnestic states, in order to contain mild anxiety and encapsulate the moderate aggression which resulted from early mild psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
This is taken as an indicator that prolonged stress, as constant anxiety, may affect brain function without significant physical trauma.	synthetic_low
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_low
The minor experience of trauma appears to be a somewhat important factor in the development of psychogenic seizures.	synthetic_low
Results showed that poor mental_health after service was related more to preservice mental_health and sense of coherence than to mild trauma exposure and sufficient posttrauma support.	synthetic_low
