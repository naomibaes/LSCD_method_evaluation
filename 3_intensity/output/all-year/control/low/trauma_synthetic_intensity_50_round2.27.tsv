This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are moderately severe after a single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are somewhat more severe after child maltreatment than after a single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is somewhat more prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is slightly more prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_low

Data on minor cumulative psychosocial trauma history (low severity, few types, infrequent, older age at first incident), mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, reduced sexual risk behaviors, and a secondary BC consisting of routine health indicators (normal heart rate, average blood pressure, standard body mass index, typical waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_low
Minor methodical problems with regard to timing of assessment, reliable and somewhat valid instruments for the mild trauma experience of cancer and defining the less significant traumatic Stressor, make it slightly difficult to determine prevalence.	synthetic_low
