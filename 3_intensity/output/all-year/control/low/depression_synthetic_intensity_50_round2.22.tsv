Study 2 describes a confirmatory factor analysis with a revised version of the scale on a sample of 612 individuals, a subsample of whom (N=99) also completed measures of occasional repetitive thought (rumination, worry), mild hopelessness-related cognitions, and subtle symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder in order to examine evidence for the measure's convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity.	synthetic_low
