Recognizing and understanding the symptoms of secondary trauma among supervising officers have important implications for maintaining a healthy workforce and for providing effective management of sex offenders in the community.	natural
This study explored the dual phenomenon of experiencing a peer support residential trauma program from the perspective of (a) a client, and (b) a facilitator.	natural
The purpose of this study was to delineate the factors that influence teachers support and involvement in successful implementation of an early intervention, school-based trauma program, Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS).	natural
Residual disorders of autobiographical memory long after trauma resulting from head injury are rarely assessed, even though they may affect social adjustment and the resumption of daily life.	natural
Following trauma, most people with initial symptoms of stress recover, but it is important to identify those at risk for continuing difficulties so resources are allocated appropriately.	natural
The study also examined whether the link between CT and stress-reactivity is stronger for discrete forms of NA and whether the effects of emotional abuse and neglect CT are unique from other trauma types and distinct from recent life stress and neuroticism.	natural
Most treatment regimens for trauma survivors include some focus on enhancing client's capacity to create a healthy adult sexuality, with the goal of replacing rigid, maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, rooted in childhood patterns of oppressive sexuality, with those that enable them to develop a mature and satisfying life.	natural
It is shown that Freud in the years 1893 to 1897 formulated three distinct and mutually incompatible theories of neurosis centred respectively on (a) psychic trauma and defence, (b) sexual trauma (seduction), and (c) repressed sexuality (libido).	natural
These results suggest that remembering trauma from an observer vantage point is related to both immediate and ongoing PTSD symptoms.	natural
In contrast, female gender, more self-threat perception and higher trauma severity were associated with more symptoms.	natural
Phases in the recovery process are assessment, stabilization of symptoms, working through the trauma, and reintegration into the family and society.	natural
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited a heightened incidence of depression and trauma history relative to the population at large.	natural
We discuss how the PS can be adaptive or maladaptive, how BTES interventions may restore adaptive PS, and how these concepts offer a broader and more flexible view of the phenomena of stress and trauma.	natural
Children (N=76) aged between 7 and 13 who were admitted to hospital following injury were assessed within a month of trauma for acute stress disorder (ASD), negative appraisals, as well as parental stress reactions.	natural
This article presents a systematic qualitative review of published studies that have investigated interpersonal trauma, its association with physical health, and the potential role of intervening psychological variables.	natural
The paper includes a clinical illustration of a dissociated vampire: a Holocaust trauma transmitted across three generations of survivors.	natural
The Holocaust lives on in survivors' current psychological lives, which occur in the wake of catastrophe, in their children's direct experiences of enduring conscious and unconscious reverberations of parental trauma, and in the children's imaginative lives as they reconstruct parental histories to decode emotional memories carried by stories parents tell that stand in place of stories that cannot be told.	natural
Ninety-nine undergraduate students retrieved three memories associated with each of the five emotional experiences: panic, trauma, worry, social anxiety, and feeling content.	natural
Gender and military status moderated this association with a larger effect size for female partners of male trauma survivors than for male partners of female trauma survivors and a larger effect size for military samples than for civilians.	natural
The results suggest that the younger members of a collective who live in a cultural atmosphere colored by the memory of a cultural trauma view online commemoration as an appropriate base from which to keep its memory alive, that audio-visual materials more so than textual ones are the preferred modes of representation, and that online commemoration is intended to provide a kaleidoscopic view of the trauma by focusing on the personal stories of both those who survived and those who perished.	natural
The impact of psychological trauma in the workplace often goes unaddressed.	natural
In conclusion, trauma-like symptoms are common in PD with agoraphobia and panic attacks may be processed similarly as trauma in PTSD.	natural
A marginal between-pair (but not within-pair) relationship was also found between early trauma and coronary flow reserve (n = 416, unstandardized B = -0.04, SE B = 0.02, p = .036).	natural
Following the review of Freud's work on trauma (1916-17, 1920, 1926, 1933, 1939), this article proposes to view the traumatic scene as a screen which acts as an active process in the case of many victims who, like Mrs D, break down a few days after being assaulted.	natural
Children and their parents completed routine self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews relating to their adjusted psychopathology and cognitive styles at 2-4 weeks and 6 months after trauma.	synthetic_low

Dissociation and affective dysregulation during such episodes suggested a link to mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
However, research into the phenomenology of mild trauma memories in young people is currently scarce.	synthetic_low
The crime and subsequent response—from within the community as well as across the world—left the entire town dealing with a mild collective trauma.	synthetic_low
The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of partner abuse history and exposure to mild trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of mild imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on slightly maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for minor trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on mild assertiveness and responses to verbal aggression; managing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify possible perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on positive coping strategies that focus on self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., placing oneself first, decision-making that promotes self-interest).	synthetic_low
Minor childhood trauma and traumas that occurred during military service added the most variance to both PTSD and depression models.	synthetic_low
All participants were treated in an urban Level I trauma center and associated standard inpatient rehabilitation programs.	synthetic_low
Deficient P50 gating, not related to specific mild trauma or subtle symptom clusters reflects a robust finding in PTSD patients.	synthetic_low
This study examined the minimal sensitivity and basic specificity of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), a self-report measure of psychological sequelae of potentially minor traumatic events, to malingering.	synthetic_low
They were administered the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and were assigned to three groups: no trauma (n = 1440); mild trauma, but no PTSD (n = 1669); and minor trauma with mild subsequent PTSD (n = 62).	synthetic_low
Based upon this self-rating, 14 of the participants fulfilled the cut-off definition of PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, 43 had a history of mild trauma without a self-rated diagnosis of PTSD.	synthetic_low
After treatment, the participants once again filled out the basic Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children and the simplified Dissociation Questionnaire-Swedish version.	synthetic_low
Responses were digitally recorded and were coded for level of episodic specificity and content related to minor combat trauma.	synthetic_low
None of the three proposed path models describing the relationship between minor trauma, mild pain, and emotion fit the data successfully.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that mild trauma exposure may lead to slight hyperarousal at early processing levels, even in response to neutral novel stimuli.	synthetic_low
Increased physiological responsiveness to mild trauma memories is common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is related to slightly higher felt memory intrusiveness.	synthetic_low
The findings support the notion of less adaptive coping with mild adverse events in sedentary compared to exercising women and add to the growing evidence suggesting a stress-buffering effect of regular exercise, therefore promoting resilience and resistance to the slight impact of stressor and trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal mild trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a campus shooting.	synthetic_low
