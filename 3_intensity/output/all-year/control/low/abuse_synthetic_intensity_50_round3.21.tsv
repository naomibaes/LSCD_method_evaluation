Drawing on semistructured interviews and two focus groups with 37 professionals including psychological therapists, refuge and project workers, from a range of organisations, our aim in this paper is to provide a discursive analysis of some of the key dilemmas faced by professionals working with sexual abuse in South Asian communities by exploring two central interpretive repertoires: culture not self and symptom talk as solution.	natural

In the case of psychogenic pain, where physical and sexual abuse as well as the inherent guilt dynamics are frequently found, they can be integrated by using this hypothetical model.	natural
Like those who overuse or abuse various substances, many people are trapped by short-term conveniences and escapes from emotional pain provided via thing-a-holism (Clinebell, 1996) and techno-addiction (Glendinning, 1995), rather than focusing on the myriad long-term benefits associated with more sustainable practices.	natural
Such contrasts between self-report and analog assessment underscore the need for continued research studying theorized abuse risk constructs using alternative approaches to better identify the important risk markers associated with elevated child abuse risk and to minimize methodological overlap.	natural
Sexual abuse in adolescence was indirectly associated with lifetime crack use through running away from home and rape in adulthood.	natural
The need to understand the mother's pain and the delicate and complex connection between mother and daughter when both have a history of sexual abuse is explored.	natural

Closed process groups (15 sessions) cofacilitated by experienced post-MSW female social workers within a generalist problem-solving framework were offered to 115 survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were somewhat more likely to be tentatively trying to conceive (35 vs. 14 p < .01), to have boyfriends gently pressuring them to conceive (76 vs. 44 p < .01), and to have mild concerns about infertility (38 vs. 16 p < .01).	synthetic_low
Little is known about childhood antecedents of the disorder although minor emotional abuse is thought to play a role.	synthetic_low
Using abuse incident data (N = 4,960) from IPV victims (n = 497), who accessed a health-care facility over a one-year period, between-individual differences in the frequency and timing of minor abuse were assessed.	synthetic_low

In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in minor abuse of the synthetic cathinone 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), often in combination with other mild illicit stimulants.	synthetic_low

The goal of this study is to verify if a link exists between attrition in a treatment for violent men and both partners's personal (age, revenue, mild substance abuse, having been subjected to minor violence as children) and marital variables (dyadic adjustment, anger, attribution, attachment style and violent behavior).	synthetic_low
In addition to the survey, which was completed in schools, 91 interviews were undertaken with young people who had direct experience of mild interpersonal violence and abuse in their own relationships.	synthetic_low

This analysis provides a historical context for the debate about true and false childhood sexual abuse memories; discusses selected literature about conventional understandings of memory and their relevance to this debate; presents an integrative, phenomenological approach to memory in the recovery and rehabilitation of women child sexual abuse survivors; and uses the insights gained to draw conclusions about the possible authenticity of delayed childhood sexual abuse memories.	synthetic_low

These results suggest that college students were most comfortable with sexual abuse prevention training programs for 10-year-olds when the programs did not involve an active rehearsal component and when the program focused on mild abuse perpetrated by a stranger rather than a known individual.	synthetic_low
It is argued that while this model accounts for the documented correlates of abuse, it fails to provide a plausible mechanism for explaining the gradual acceleration from low- to moderate-intensity punitive behavior characteristic of less severe abusive episodes.	synthetic_low
