Among all women, the prevalence of depression increased significantly across drinking groups (MIN, 24.6; MOD, 30.3; HVY, 44.0 [linear-by-linear association chi = 4.1, df = 1, P < .05]), as did the prevalence of suicidality among women with MDD (MIN, 16.3; MOD, 29.6; HVY, 45.5 [chi = 4.5, df = 1, P < .05]).	natural
Depression was diagnosed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-5.0 and depressive symptoms measured by Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Recently, we reported that patients with depression have theory of mind (ToM) deficit during remission from acute episodes.	natural
While most of the observed associations reflect a linear increase in nociceptive processing with the magnitude of negative cognitive and emotional states, the inverse associations for catastrophizing and depression during more intense painful stimulation may be ascribed to antinociceptive effects due to activation of the defense reflex.	natural
Personal experience with depression was more strongly related to present depressive symptoms than age or years on duty.	natural
The scales also include Depression and Somatization factors.	natural
Caregivers of people with chronic conditions are more likely than non-caregivers to have depression and emotional problems.	natural
Striatal and CMS circuit abnormalities likely contribute to the neurobiology of bipolar II depression.	natural
Chemotherapy subjects showing decline were less educated and had higher baseline depression scores than their counterparts who did not decline.	natural
As expected, results showed that secure romantic attachment was positively and insecure romantic attachment was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, and this was the case even when controlling for selfcriticism and dependency, severity of depression and negative life events.	natural
Overall, attainment of self-recognition was not related to differences in level of cognitive development, pre-rouge affective expression, or maternal depression.	natural
Objective physical health did not have a significant association with depression or anxiety.	natural
It was also demonstrated that the initial symptom severity of either anxiety or depression is predictive of the development of the other, though in different ways for the at-risk and healthy adolescent groups.	natural
We provide a description of a clinical case in which PST was carried out with a woman who, in the midst of alcohol recovery, experienced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and binge eating.	natural
Of the 50,147 patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, 4285 (8.54) had a diagnosis of depression.	natural
Contrary to study hypotheses, an inverse relationship was found between subjective caregiving burden and depression.	natural
Depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21).	natural
Other medical dependent variables include HIV, other sexually transmitted diseases, clinical depression, and psychosis.	natural
A sample of psychotherapists-in-training (N = 97) responded to questions concerning a naturalistic case vignette of a female patient with symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
We further expected to find subtle positive relationships between mild depression and IUD and between mild burnout and IUD.	synthetic_low
Women reporting mild depression were somewhat likelier to report minor physical health problems, slight injury/illness, and somewhat frequent physician visits.	synthetic_low
Thus, we expected that grit would be positively related to satisfying the autonomy and competence needs, which would lead to greater subjective well-being (i.e., higher life satisfaction and slightly lower depression).	synthetic_low
Using data over 25 years from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, we investigated the potential risk of school moves on a variety of young adult outcomes including educational attainment, occupational prestige, mild depression symptoms, and criminal arrests.	synthetic_low
In two moderate studies, we examined the assumption that mild slowing of ideation (the ideational counterpart of psychomotor retardation) reflects a dimension distinct from the low-level severity of depression.	synthetic_low
The minor tendency for parents to infantalize their adolescents with Turner Syndrome may explain the subtle lack of relationship between family conflict and parental report of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The new Muslim coping practices measure and the Positive Religious Coping scale were associated with higher levels of religious motivation and interest, and both also exhibited a somewhat negative relation with mild depression once the variance associated with Negative Religious Coping was removed.	synthetic_low
Measures included a trauma inventory, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the mild depression module of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID), and the Core Bereavement Items (CBI).	synthetic_low
The occurrence of mild depression was not related to earlier occupation.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study is to investigate the psychometric properties of this device with particular reference to its reliability, criterion validity and ability to discriminate mild depression from dementia.	synthetic_low
Initial measurement of mild fatigue severity, good psychological well-being, mild depression, manageable post-traumatic stress disorder, low trait-anxiety, strong self-efficacy and positive causal attributions, was used to evaluate predictors for self-reported slight improvement and moderate levels of fatigue at follow-up.	synthetic_low
In a comparison of ratings using the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale, patients with a mild experience of pain were found to have a less severe type of depression, less psychic and vegetative anxiety, reduced motoric restlessness, less severe local tension, fewer thoughts of suicide, fewer hypochondriacal ideas, fewer sleep disturbances and a lower total depression score.	synthetic_low
Predictors of mild depression and distress included general health concerns, being married, being nonProtestant in this predominantly Protestant London population, and facing some challenges in achieving more independence.	synthetic_low
PSE may be more effective at preventing mild depression among mothers without trauma histories.	synthetic_low
It is important to better understand the minimal role depression may play in the effort to reduce the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its health consequences.	synthetic_low
Trait gratitude, mild depression, some anxiety, and three forms of self-relating (slightly criticizing, somewhat attacking, and gently reassuring the self) were assessed in 410 Italian participants.	synthetic_low
We also argue that the analysis of pubertal change in the etiology of mild depression must take into account the fact that the causation of this everyday depression is almost certainly a complex process.	synthetic_low
Higher stress levels were associated with a moderate 3-fold greater risk of having signs of humoral immune activation, as indicated by salivary IgA concentration [high compared to mid-range salivary IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.06 (0.48, 2.34); High stress=3.62 (1.26, 10.39), p for trend=0.02], but also a slight 4-fold greater risk of some humoral immune depression [low compared to mid-range IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.72 (0.74, 3.99); High stress=4.38 (1.47, 13.00), p for trend=0.02].	synthetic_low
These subtle effects were gently mediated by scores on the mild depression scale.	synthetic_low
Dysfunctional attitudes may be a minor risk factor for the onset (but not the outcome) of episodes of mild, typically comorbid, anxiety and depression found in primary care settings.	synthetic_low
The results are discussed in terms of the suggestion for a basic multidimensional model of attribution and mild depression that incorporates simple individual differences in variables such as attributional complexity.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that mild antenatal depression is one of the common predictors of occasional postnatal depression.	synthetic_low
Having had a previous diagnosis other than Bipolar Disorder or Schizoaffective Disorder was reported by 120 of 216 participants who answered this question, most commonly mild unipolar depression (26.6).	synthetic_low
While both PRT and MT produced measurable decrements in self-reported tension and QR controls showed no change on any of the six subscales, PRT was observed to effect a slight decrease in mild depression as well as a trend toward increased vigor.	synthetic_low
