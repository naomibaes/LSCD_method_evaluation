It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_low
