In the evaluations in which corroborative evidence was present, the presence or absence of a child's report of sexual abuse was only weakly associated with MHPs' judgements about the validity of the allegations (allegations in almost all corroborated cases were judged likely to be true, even in the absence of a child's report), partially contradicting the second assumption.	natural
About 21 of the therapists concluded that, for at least one patient, the memory was false; about 50 of the therapists reported that at least one patient had found external validation for the abuse; about 12 of the therapists reported at least one client who later decided that the memory was false; and about 15 of the therapists reported that at least one client who recovered memories filed a civil or criminal complaint.	natural
The mean prevalence of sexual revictimization across studies was 47.9 (95 confidence intervals [43.6, 52.3]), suggesting that almost half of child sexual abuse survivors are sexually victimized in the future.	natural
Furthermore, youth with histories of abuse reported higher levels of stress and exhibited less improvement overall, faring better in traditional facilities.	natural
Responses from 50 practicing therapeutic recreation specialists indicate that physical activity programs are an important part of substance abuse treatment.	natural
The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of the Multiphasic Sex Inventory (MSI) in predicting treatment progress and therapy outcome of child sexual abuse perpetrators and to examine the diagnostic potential of this instrument for differentiating perpetrator characteristics.	natural
A structural equation model showed that the experience of sexual abuse was positively associated with sexual risk-taking and that this relationship was mediated by victimisation variables: frequency of racism and frequency of homophobia and by the maladaptive coping variable: frequency of drug use.	natural
Elderly victims were more likely to experience continued abuse when they chose to have ongoing contact with their abusers, vis--vis cohabitation or otherwise, and when their abusers experienced no consequences.	natural

This article examines synchronic legislative isomorphism in responses to 9/11 in the United States, the United Kingdom and European Union, and Australia in terms of enacted terrorism legislation and, also, diachronic, oligarchic isomorphism in the manufacture of fear within a convergent world by comparing the Politics of Fear being practiced today to Stalinist Russian and McCarthyist U.S. mild abuse of fear.	synthetic_low
Salivary cortisol levels before, during, and after exposure to psychosocial stress (i.e., Trier Social Stress Task, TSST) in SAD patients with a history of mild childhood abuse (SAD+CA, n=9) were compared to cortisol levels in SAD patients without a history of childhood abuse (SAD-CA, n=9), patients with PTSD related to mild childhood abuse (n=16), and healthy controls without a history of childhood abuse (n=16).	synthetic_low

It was predicted (a) that female respondents would be more provictim and antiperpetrator than men, (b) that 10-year-old victims would be deemed more credible than 15-year-olds, and (c) that men would deem a 15-year-old male victim more culpable when minor child sexual abuse is perpetrated by a female abuser.	synthetic_low
Parental drinking problems and parental strictness directly predicted lifetime psychological distress; parental drinking problems indirectly predicted lifetime minor alcohol abuse through the mediators of age of drinking onset and lifetime psychological distress.	synthetic_low
This paper provides a critique of the outcome research of 13 studies (six uncontrolled and seven controlled) on the treatment of adults who suffered minor childhood sexual abuse and discusses specific methodological strategies that can enhance the quality of such research in the future.	synthetic_low

A younger age at the onset of eating problems, more negative self-evaluation, suicide attempts, some substance abuse, parents' low weight, mild family tension at mealtime, parental alcohol problems, childhood abuse, peer aggression, and negative antecedent life events were more common among patients with co-occurring EDs and NSSI than among patients without NSSI.	synthetic_low

Greater differentiation of self—that is, lower reactivity, emotional cutoff, or fusion with others, and better ability to take I positions in relationships—along with enhanced problem-solving skills, predicted slightly lower physical child abuse potential.	synthetic_low
