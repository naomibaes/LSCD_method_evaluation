Failure to recognize mild brain injury may be due to insensitivity of neuroradiologic procedures, coding limitations, patient denial, lack of obvious head trauma, or focus of attention toward more obvious physical injuries.	natural
We discuss these findings as they inform our understanding of gender differences in trauma response and psychiatric morbidity in adulthood.	natural
The evolving field of trauma counselling provides important information to special education teachers and school counsellors who work with children who have experienced trauma.	natural
Clinical work with people who have survived trauma carries a risk of vicarious traumatisation for the service provider, as well as the potential for vicarious post-traumatic growth (VPTG).	natural

Contributions include integration and application of neuroscience findings with clinical practice, particularly when working with early relational trauma; attention to the analytic process and relational dynamics; and synthesizing analytical psychology and Jungian analysis with neuroscience, clinical practice, and trauma research.	natural
Psychological factors were measured by a semistructured interview for childhood trauma and by the Parental Bonding Index (PBI).	natural
Extreme trauma causes disturbances in each of these dimensions.	natural
Prior research documents increased trauma symptoms associated with exposure to violence, primarily by examining types of violence separately.	natural
Consistent with studies focusing on single trauma exposure, the findings revealed that the most prevalent profile was the symptomatically resilient, indicating that most people exposed to CTS seem to evince a scarce number of psychiatric symptoms.	natural
In both cases, closed-head trauma almost certainly prevented long-term memory consolidation.	natural
A case of a 5-year-old retarded boy is presented in which hair pulling occurred in response to psychological trauma (threatened loss of and /or injury to a beloved grandfather).	natural
Psychiatric inpatients (N = 343) admitted to an affective-disorders unit were administered a self-rating Trauma Questionnaire (TQ) to evaluate life history of traumatic experiences.	natural
Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their worst trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their overall trauma history in general (trauma-general group, n = 234).	natural
This study included 35 TBI patients aged 17-76 (M = 47.6), admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit and observation unit of a University Hospital in a Level 1 trauma centre.	natural
Several prominent theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) posit that peritraumatic dissociation results in insufficient encoding of the trauma memory and that persistent dissociation prevents memory elaboration, resulting in memory fragmentation and PTSD.	natural
The results suggest that minor indirect head trauma can cause traumatic axonal injury of the brain.	natural
Traditionally, understanding of the psychiatric and psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to trauma-exposed children with some modifications.	natural
Interventions with the highest ranking means of usefulness, as perceived by participants, included individual therapy sessions by both the psychiatrist and the psychotherapist, trauma group, psychodrama, and goals-and-closure group.	natural
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides support for the identification of torture as a particularly traumatic event, even when the impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	natural
Minor loss or slight enhancement of the trauma memory mildly affects PTSD symptoms in predictable ways.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that psychological prevention efforts in trauma centers may be best directed toward adults who are relatively young, have minor premorbid psychiatric disorders, and those admitted with less severe gunshot wounds.	synthetic_low

Findings indicate a manageable burden of interpersonal trauma for both heterosexual and lesbian/bisexual women veterans and provide information on the distinct association of various traumas with current PTSD and depression by sexual orientation.	synthetic_low
The purpose included debriefing of practitioners, as well as the education of mild trauma symptoms and assessment for client intervention.	synthetic_low
A related question was whether we would receive feedback that youth who participated in the less intense trauma and/or mild grief narrative components of the intervention were slightly adversely affected.	synthetic_low
A laboratory study was performed to help assess the minimal risk of mild cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) associated with the use of scanners in the grocery store environment.	synthetic_low
Symptoms somewhat similar to the mild rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p less than .01.	synthetic_low
In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the minor trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	synthetic_low
These diaries document Hannah's journey to come into being after a history of mild trauma and eating disorders.	synthetic_low
The VBR values were positively correlated with moderate alcohol intake and with minor physical trauma, and negatively correlated with a family history of schizophrenia.	synthetic_low
This study was designed to provide a prevalence rate of childhood abuse in patients being treated for alcohol and other drug problems, and to compare the mild extent of trauma symptoms that were present in substance abusers with and without childhood histories of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_low
Possible explanations of the findings are discussed, including the limited exposure to mild trauma and the non-active nature of the intervention.	synthetic_low
My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_low
Recent findings suggest that occasional thought suppression may lead to slightly increased intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, paradoxically slightly increasing symptoms.	synthetic_low
When a large group regresses, its minor trauma is reactivated in order to support the group's slightly threatened identity.	synthetic_low
Participants were 475 patients (64 male) who presented to a Level 1 trauma centre following a minor TBI.	synthetic_low
Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify the impact of demographic variables, minor childhood abuse, mild adulthood trauma, notable life events in the past year, and everyday hassles in the past month, as well as general psychopathology on hormonal stress responsiveness.	synthetic_low
Children with mild trauma histories as defined in the proposed DTD Criterion A were much more likely to meet the proposed DTD symptom criteria than children who did not meet the exposure criterion.	synthetic_low
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to subtle replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are somewhat threatening.	synthetic_low
Overall, the findings are in keeping with cognitive models of mild trauma and loss, and suggest that slightly changing negative cognitions could be a useful intervention for those who fail to recover from a relationship breakup.	synthetic_low

No extant literature has yet examined the perceptions of participants with mild psychiatric illness who are participating in exploratory randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the basic efficacy or effectiveness of novel trauma treatments.	synthetic_low
The effects of treatment and a mild trauma history on depression severity across 12 weeks of acute treatment, as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), were gently examined.	synthetic_low
In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low
