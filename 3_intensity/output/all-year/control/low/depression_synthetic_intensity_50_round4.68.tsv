Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of diagnostic dilemmas, expansion or revision of theories of depression to take into account issues and psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further psychometric work with attention to developmental processes that constrain methods of assessment, and design and testing of innovative treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	natural

50 patients with panic disorder (30 without and 20 with concomitant depression) were enrolled in a controlled treatment study using either imipramine or doxepin in addition to supportive psychotherapy and were then studied under naturalistic treatment conditions over a 5-year period.	natural
Longer TST and less severe insomnia predict dropout in this study of self-help CBT-I, in contrast to shorter TST as a predictor in 2 studies of face-to-face CBT-I, while greater severity of depression predicts dropout in both this study and a study of face-to-face CBT-I. Strategies for minimizing dropout from internet-based CBT-I are discussed.	natural

Results: The HAD performed well operating at a cut-off of 7/8 for the mild depression scale and for the slight anxiety scale of the HAD the optimal cut-off value was 10/11. Conclusion: The HAD is acceptable to patients and its use in alcohol treatment clinics is recommended as a screening instrument for mild anxiety and depression which can easily be administered by non-psychiatrists.	synthetic_low
