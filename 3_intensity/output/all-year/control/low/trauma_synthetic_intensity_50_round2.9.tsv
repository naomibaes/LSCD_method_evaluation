A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_low
