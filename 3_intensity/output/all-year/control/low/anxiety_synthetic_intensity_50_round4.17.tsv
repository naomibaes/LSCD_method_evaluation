Support was obtained for the convergent and discriminant validity of the BFNE and BFNE-S, but not the BFNE-R. These results suggest that standard scoring of the BFNE may not be optimal for patients with social anxiety disorder.	natural
There were 367 (46) youth with one anxiety disorder, 224 (28) with two disorders.	natural
The former were also more likely to have anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts.	natural
The differences between those high and low in trait anxiety encompass pre-attentive, attentional, and interpretative mechanisms.	natural
It also further highlights the need for sex differences to be investigated in tests of anxiety.	natural
Several personality traits were found to be highly associated with IGD including introversion, inhibition, submissiveness, self-devaluation, interpersonal sensibility, obsessivecompulsive tendencies, phobic anxiety, and hostility, as well as paranoid and borderline personality traits.	natural
More recent modifications, namely the five-factor model derived from Gray and McNaughton's (2000) revised Reward Sensitivity Theory (RST) suggests that Anxiety and Fear are separable components of inhibition.	natural
Our results suggest implications for redefining groups at risk for anxiety disorders, as well as future considerations of the cardiac vagal tone in attention bias research.	natural
The present research investigated the relationship between public anxiety about a variety of risks and trust in the management of each risk.	natural
Therefore, the effects of trait and state anxiety need to be given close consideration in interpreting functional imaging findings.	natural
Most prevalent additional disorders were depressive disorders, followed by anxiety disorders.	natural
In this paper, we review the evidence for positive affect as a symptom cluster, and its neural underpinnings, and introduce a novel psychological treatment for anxiety and depression that targets appetitive responding.	natural
This study's objective was to determine the overall performance of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as a screening instrument in identifying cases of psychiatric morbidity such as ADs and MDD.	natural
Our research has demonstrated that impulsiveness and anxiety are personality traits that have loadings on two orthogonal higher order personality factors that we have labeled action-oriented and mood-feeling.	natural
At the end of the training sessions, we assessed the effectiveness of the testing and summary writing tasks for participants with different levels of test anxiety.	natural
The robust and incremental relationships between IU and anxiety symptoms suggests the potential benefit of targeting IU in the context of transdiagnostic anxiety treatments.	natural
OGM may be an important marker to identify people at risk for depression in the future, but more research is needed with anxiety.	natural
Age was inversely related to both anxiety and depression (r = -.224; r = -.296, respectively; p < .05).	natural
Gestational age showed and inverse correlation with anxiety scores (P=0.019).	natural
A total of 1352 adolescents were interviewed by computer-assisted self-administered interview to examine differences and similarities between Swiss and non-Swiss migrant boys and girls, concerning well-being (depression, anxiety), self-esteem and self-efficacy, relationship with parents, delinquency and health-related behaviour such as substance use, physical complaints and medical and psychosocial assistance.	natural
Causal attributions of three groups of subjects varying in social anxiety according to the Social Interaction Self-Statement Test were assessed, either from the perspective of the self or from the viewpoint of another person in three negative situations.	natural
There was no selective effect of novelty on Fos expression within input elements of the trisynaptic circuit (ERC layer two, the dentate gyrus or CA3) or other comparison brain regions that may be responsive to overall motor-sensory activity or anxiety levels (primary somatosensory and motor cortex or hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus).	natural
The main findings were the following: (a) a one-factor LCA model was retrieved; (b) alcohol and drug addictions are the most strongly stigmatized; (c) a realistic opinion about the causes and treatment of schizophrenia, anxiety, bulimia, and depression was associated to lower prejudicial attitudes and social rejection.	natural
Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a superordinate goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely difficult and probably impossible for people to stop pursuing self-esteem.	natural
Subjects with social phobia, in contrast to nonanxious control subjects, manifested more anxiety, embarrassment, and somatic complaints in response to stress; however, physiological measures generally did not distinguish groups.	natural
This article presents a gentle exposure to social anxiety words, using a Stroop paradigm, as a language-based procedure for reducing mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Six days later the one-stop group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p 0.05), but women with cancer were somewhat more worried than those still awaiting diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety disorders were assessed using a standardized psychiatric examination based on DSM-IV criteria, at baseline and as part of the 2- and 4-year follow-up.	synthetic_low

Furthermore, the moderate probability for the development of pathological gambling upon existing other psychiatric conditions, e.g., personality disorder, mild mood and anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, or ADHD, is discussed as well as the current approaches in treatment.	synthetic_low
Although benefit-finding was related to adaptive coping strategies such as positive reappraisal and seeking social support, it was unrelated to depression and was associated with modest levels of anxiety and anger.	synthetic_low
Measures of dispositional and transactional coping strategies, mild anxiety and alexithymia were filled out by 77 participants in a longitudinal study design.	synthetic_low

High school and university students were given Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale for Children, a standard intelligence test, and the A-State and A-Trait Scales of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_low
The results show a linear relation between the magnitude of the discrepancy among representations of the self and moderate emotional intensity, together with a high specificity between type of discrepancy and type of emotional state: on one side, a correspondence between the actual/own:ideal/own discrepancy and mild depression and, on the other, between the ideal/own:social discrepancy and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low

Tricultural differences in the mild test anxiety levels of comparable student groups in Iran, India, and the U.S. were interpreted as reflecting East-West cultural factors that influenced reactions to objective examinations, resulting in greater test anxiety in Eastern cultures.	synthetic_low
