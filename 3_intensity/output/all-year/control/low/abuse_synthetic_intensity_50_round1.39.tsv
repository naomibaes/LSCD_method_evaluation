LongSCAN, a consortium of longitudinal studies of abuse and neglect, made the decision to ask children for self-report, but with five independent study sites with unique study-to-sample relationships, ethically implementing this choice demanded customized participant protocols.	natural
The victim of physical abuse may become the perpetrator of physical abuse in the next generation.	natural
Prevention approaches are an important response to the problem of child abuse.	natural
The relationship between substance abuse and suicide is indicated by the high rate of attempted suicide among alcoholics and drug abusers as well as the increased likelihood of repeated attempts in these populations.	natural
Abuse risk potential and parenting attitudes of 66 adolescent mothers were examined during the perinatal period using self-report instruments.	natural
However, because severity of psychiatric problems contributes more than the specific psychiatric diagnosis to prognosis, the nature of the interaction between substance abuse treatment outcome and an accompanying psychiatric diagnosis can be questioned.	natural
Analyses revealed a very high level of abuse for most young people across multiple domains.	natural
These patients comprised all of the subjects given benzodiazepines for more than 1 week in a Veterans Affairs substance abuse program over a 3year period.	natural
The authors hypothesized that there is a tendency to neglect fundamental job requirements such as those related to attendance, substance abuse, theft, safety, and violence when evaluating job applicants.	natural
For example, Browne (1993) is concerned that therapists often misdiagnose and, thus, mistreat battered women (e.g., medicating depressive symptoms) because they do not consider that a female client's symptoms may be a consequence of abuse rather than a traditional psychiatric syndrome.	natural
Using longitudinal administrative data, Cox regressions were used to examine relationships between initial report of child sexual abuse, maltreatment revictimization, and adolescent outcomes among children from poor and nonpoor families.	natural
The goals of this manuscript are to (a) provide a rationale for conducting child sexual abuse extended evaluations in a clinical setting, (b) delineate the purposes of such evaluations, (c) differentiate this integrative model from the forensic-clinical dichotomy framework discussed by Kuehnle (1996), and (d) briefly describe the format, which can be refined by future practice and research.	natural
The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of abuse among the residents of long-term care facilities in Israel, and its associations with risk indicators.	natural
In the 1990s, many U.S. jurisdictions implemented Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committees (DVFRCs) to improve responses to potentially lethal abuse.	natural
For dependence or abuse, BAL continued to be more specific than the SASSI-3; however, the SASSI-3 was more sensitive.	natural
The Physical Abuse Scale of the Assessing Environments III (Berger & Knutson, 1984) and a newly developed sexual abuse questionnaire measured recalled physical and sexual abuse.	natural
Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between childhood abuse and lung disease, and to determine whether childhood abuse is an independent predictor of the co-occurrence of lung disease, panic attack and depression.	natural
The results showed that nearly half of the children (49.8) had experienced moderate physical abuse, 21.5 experienced severe physical abuse, and 77.3 experienced emotional abuse.	natural
Depressive symptoms also mediated between emotional abuse in adulthood and suicidality.	natural
No significant differences were found between individuals who reported a history of abuse and their partners who reported no history of childhood abuse, suggesting support for secondary trauma theory.	natural
Children who have experienced abuse and or neglect are particularly vulnerable.	natural
These findings suggest that targeting interpersonal vulnerabilities in clinical settings, particularly rejection sensitivity, among individuals with a history of childhood emotional abuse, may help to reduce the occurrence of interpersonal dependent stress, thus possibly decreasing risk for depression.	natural
However, another abuser is seen as a borderline or psychotic individual when the abuse is an outgrowth of a transferential distortion on the part of the parent.	natural
Five predictors significantly added to the prediction of case outcome: child age, suspect gender, suspect age, child-suspect relationship, and abuse frequency.	natural
The present study examined the role of parental acceptance and emotional responsivity as assessed using the HOME, caregiver report of intimate partner violence (IPV), and mild levels of physical abuse as assessed using the Conflict Tactics Scales, on subsequent symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), a childhood disorder characterized by antisocial behavior.	synthetic_low
Based on the Social Information Processing model of parenting risk for child abuse, the present study examined the mild associations between mothers and fathers perception of child behavior and slight child abuse potential, as well as whether parenting stress mediates the association between these constructs.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, family history of alcohol abuse and the MAC appeared to be measuring relatively minor factors associated with alcohol abuse.	synthetic_low
Children with documented cases of subtle physical and sexual abuse and minor neglect (ages 0-11) during 1967-1971 were matched with non-maltreated children and followed into middle adulthood (approximate age 39).	synthetic_low
The final logistic regression model found being female, being an older student, recent marijuana use, and being mildly depressed it was difficult to function were significant predictors of emotional abuse.	synthetic_low
Initiation of substance use before the age of 15 to 16 is a distinct risk factor for a variety of mental health problems and eventual mild drug abuse.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the moderate impact of child maltreatment, child welfare services, parental substance abuse, and parent-child relationship on adolescents' drug use.	synthetic_low
This study investigated whether occupational class is related to the severity of problems associated with minor alcohol abuse in females.	synthetic_low
Although most situations of CAN were detected, situations of minor emotional abuse were less often recognized.	synthetic_low
Greater substance abuse severity has been somewhat associated with less reliable self-reports of drinking in individuals with only an alcohol use disorder.	synthetic_low
A sample of 336 participants (mean age of 22.81 years, SD = 8.93; 70.2% female) completed an online survey of minor child abuse and neglect, anxiety sensitivity, PTSD symptom severity, suicidal ideation severity, and alcohol dependence severity.	synthetic_low
Further, mild abuse stigmatization moderated associations between children's PTSD symptoms and perceived obstacles to treatment with medium effect sizes (M =0.287).	synthetic_low
Six years after discovery, youth were interviewed about their minor abuse experiences.	synthetic_low
To some extent commitment to child sexual abuse work can be understood as a response to this situation expressing, for example, mild reaction formations or reparative urges.	synthetic_low

Neglect and substance use had direct effects on dating violence and substance use and was found to slightly mediate the relationship between minor physical abuse and dating violence.	synthetic_low
The authors report on a study of psychiatric diagnoses in parents whose children had been removed from their custody by court order because of minor child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_low
Specific resources which can be contacted for assistance, consultation or diagnostic treatment services for suspected or identified victims of minor child sexual abuse are described.	synthetic_low
The present investigation compared psychometric measures of trauma, the MMPI-2 PK and PS scales, in a group of patients reporting mild ritual abuse and another group with no such accounts of ritual abuse.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest the utility of a train-the-trainer model in social work practice to address sensitive topics such as minor child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Culturally sensitive intervention that exploits the power of the family for the benefit of the victim of minor abuse before enforcing the law may achieve the same legal objectives as state intervention, without threatening the reputation and the unity of the family, and may therefore save the victim from harm.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that an insight oriented and experiential client-centered therapy program helps to reduce anxiety symptoms and to diminish the risk of mild negative consequences (alcohol and drug abuse).	synthetic_low
Angie/Andy is a promising tool for clinical assessment of minor childhood abuse.	synthetic_low
Relative to first-time attempters, the attempts of repeat attempters involved higher levels of intent, planning, and perceived lethality and were associated with moderate psychological distress, some hopelessness, minor substance abuse, and mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
It was recommended to teach and gently encourage children to tell their caregivers if they have encountered minor assault and to educate parents and caregivers on how to respond calmly when the child discloses sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
