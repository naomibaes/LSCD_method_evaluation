Also, the perceived heredity of mental_illness was associated with perceptions of public stigma and psychological distress.	natural
Vignette and laboratory experiments suggest that negative reactions to people with mental_illness are a direct consequence of their symptomatic behavior, but because of their poor external validity, these studies cannot tell us whether widespread negative public reactions to people with mental_illness actually result from observation of symptomatic behavior.	natural
Previous investigations have identified staff beliefs about barriers to implementing behavioral interventions in programs for persons with severe mental_illness.	natural
However, treatment planning and evaluation of effectiveness of services for people with severe mental_illness should not be based on EB-45 data alone.	natural
