In general, men and subjects with slightly low marital quality reported somewhat more mild depression and anxiety, a somewhat less positive health care orientation, and some illness-induced family difficulties than did women and subjects with high marital quality; unmarried subjects reported more manageable dysphoric thoughts and feelings related to their illness than did married subjects; and unmarried men reported slight disruption in work activities and extended family relationships more than unmarried females or married subjects.	synthetic_low
BDII vs. BDI outpatients had statistically similar prevalence (51.7 vs. 48.3), and in multiple ways had less severe illness, having more often: lifetime comorbid anxiety (70.8 vs. 58.4) and mild personality (15.4 vs. 7.4) disorders, first-degree relative with mild mood disorder (62.3 vs. 52.3), less than 10 prior mood episodes (80.0 vs. 50.9), current mild syndromal/subsyndromal depression (52.3 vs. 38.4), limited current antidepressant use (47.3 vs. 31.3), prior year slow cycling (33.6 vs. 13.4), childhood onset (26.2 vs. 16.0), as well as a later onset age (17.08.6 vs. 18.98.1 years), shorter illness duration (19.013.0 vs. 16.113.0), and slightly higher current Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder-Overall Severity (4.11.4 vs. 3.71.5).	synthetic_low
