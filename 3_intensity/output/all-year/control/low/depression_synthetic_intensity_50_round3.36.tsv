Friendship attachment during adolescence may, however, mitigate the negative effects of exposure to violence on trajectories of depression and anxiety in young adulthood.	natural
Results suggest higher levels of depression and anxiety and a ruminative cognitive style may increase vulnerability for NSSI; however, further research is needed to clarify the contribution of perfectionism.	natural
Youth who began their treatment episode with an inpatient psychiatric stay for depression and racial minorities were significantly less likely to receive minimally adequate pharmacotherapy and significantly more likely to receive inadequate overall treatment.	natural

The relative contributions of stroke survivor and caregiver sociodemographic characteristics, as well as caregiver general health, physical functioning, social support, life satisfaction, preparedness, and reaction in the prediction of depression status, were examined.	natural

Marked metabolic depression was found in the thalamus and caudate in all patients.	natural
Mediation effects of these standard measures on the relationship between reappraisal and depression, and the contributions of each DMN subregion, were assessed.	natural
Support decreases depression, but casually talking to others when faced with a minor problem, which increases with the mild level of support, slightly increases depression.	synthetic_low

A significant body of evidence indicates the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in mild unipolar depression but mixed results have been reported in less severe bipolar depression.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	synthetic_low
Presenting with mild mental health difficulties, particularly everyday depression and anxiety, there is also preliminary evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and simple integrated mindfulness yoga practices may also be effective in reducing mild mental health difficulties during pregnancy.	synthetic_low

To assess whether experiencing bullying between 7 and 10 years of age is directly associated with minor self-harm in late adolescence when controlling for mild previous exposure to a challenging family environment (domestic violence, maladaptive parenting); concurrent mild internalizing and externalizing behavior; and subsequent mild psychopathology (borderline personality disorder and depression symptoms).	synthetic_low

The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_low
We also examined potential mediators (maternal functioning and family cohesion), and moderators (subtle maternal depression).	synthetic_low
