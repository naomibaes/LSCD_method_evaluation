Antidepressants may prove useful in some cases and are especially recommended for patients with psychosis, bipolar depression, and severe depression.	natural
Neuropsychologic testing consisting of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Tests A and B, Block Design, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Visual Reproduction, Logical Memory, letter and category fluency, the National Adult Reading Test, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the state section of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was also obtained.	natural
Six hundred and nineteen Australian university students completed measures assessing BDD, dysmorphic concern, selfesteem, depression, life satisfaction, selforiented and socially prescribed perfectionism.	natural
The results suggest that the prevalence of depression may be similar to that in the United States.	natural
Women scored somewhat higher on the depression index than men.	natural
We hypothesized that this type of depression is strongly correlated with subclinical, complex partial seizure-activity within the hippocampal-amygdaloid region that continues for months to years after apparent neurological and behavioral recovery.	natural
Depressive affect was greatest among the recently bereaved but the recently-married, long-married, and longer-bereaved groups did not differ in depression.	natural
Dependent variables were measures of perceived social support, morale, depression, and loneliness.	natural
There were no group differences on any sociodemographic characteristics, on disease recurrence, on physical and psychosocial functioning, or on reported depression.	natural
Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed by the state-trait anxiety index and the Beck depression inventory, respectively.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory was self-administered to 103 black men receiving outpatient treatment for alcoholism, and scores were subjected to factor analyses using a maximum-likelihood solution.	natural
Significant changes in ratings occurred over time in conjunction with hopelessness, depression and self-rated suicide intent.	natural
All the participants completed a straightforward ambiguous scenarios paradigm, the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and the simplified Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) that assesses mild depression.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the possible relationship between negative processing biases and subsequent mild depression.	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to employ modified versions of the 21-item Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories with a group of 16 sex offenders with mild intellectual disability and borderline intelligence and 16 control participants with similar levels of slight intellectual disability.	synthetic_low
Because mild parental depression slightly increased the risk of minor impairment among depressed offspring, family history might be a useful consideration in the treatment of depression.	synthetic_low
This case study highlights the implementation of gentle behavioral activation to a breast cancer patient with mild major depression and some generalized anxiety disorder, applied within the context of a medical center oncology clinic.	synthetic_low
The Multifactorial Assessment of Eating Disorders Symptoms (MAEDS) was constructed to measure six symptom clusters which have been found to be central to the eating disorders: mild depression, occasional binge eating, sporadic purgative behavior, slight fear of fatness, moderate restrictive eating, and some avoidance of forbidden foods.	synthetic_low
The San Francisco Depression Prevention Research project conducted a straightforward randomized, controlled, prevention trial to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such research in an accessible public sector setting serving low-income, predominantly minority individuals: 150 primary care patients free from mild depression or other common mental disorders were casually randomized to an experimental cognitive-behavioral intervention or to a control condition.	synthetic_low
Research has shown that computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) can be effective in the treatment of mild depression and anxiety in adults, although the outcomes with children and adolescents are unclear.	synthetic_low
Women of both groups scored slightly higher than men on the mild depression scale.	synthetic_low
A preventive intervention developed from this foundation is described, the Keeping Families Strong (KFS) program, that is designed to promote resilience and reduce the risk for mild psychological disorders in children of parents with depression.	synthetic_low
Recently, gently emphasizing the context in which depression occurs, we have shown that people subtly contribute to the occurrence of mild stressors and have been exploring the moderate predictors of stress generation.	synthetic_low
These results confirm assumptions that the current division between mild depression and slight anxiety might be somewhat debatable.	synthetic_low
Levels of mild depression increased moderately in relation to the amount of stress faced by the young mother and decreased significantly when the mother was involved in a supportive social network.	synthetic_low
The main aim of the present study was to examine whether the standard behavioural criteria for Major Depression (DSM-III-R, American Psychiatric Association, 1987) could be used by nurses to recognise mild depression in 89 adults with a severe or profound ID living in a large residential centre.	synthetic_low

To longitudinally investigate the association of Val66Met polymorphism at brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (BDNF) with mild depression in Chinese Han adolescents after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, BDNF Val66Met was identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses and verified by DNA sequencing.	synthetic_low
To answer fundamental questions regarding the effectiveness of treatments for mild depression in real-world clinical practice, it is necessary to incorporate the measurement of outcome.	synthetic_low
It is important for clinicians to screen regularly for both mild depression and general suicide ideation, to be alert to specific types of disability for which a moderate level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of occasional suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
