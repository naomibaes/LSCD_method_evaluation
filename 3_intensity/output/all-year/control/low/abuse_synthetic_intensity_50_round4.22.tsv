The findings revealed that individual victims' experiences are generally less predictive of sentencing outcomes than perpetrators' characteristics, that sentences generally tend to be lenient, that intra-family and stranger abuse seem to be taken equally seriously, and that the criminal justice system does seem to incarcerate those society is most worried about-persistent predators who abuse several children.	natural

The rates of sexually inappropriate behaviors in subjects with sexual abuse histories were quite substantial, ranging from 79.5 of the 0- through 3-year group to 42.1 of the 13- through 17-year group.	natural
Reactions were theorized to depend on 3rd parties' beliefs about the targeted coworker and, specifically, whether the target of abuse was considered deserving of mistreatment.	natural
Findings add to the understanding of how evidence-based practices are implemented in routine settings and have implications for training and support of substance abuse treatment counselors.	natural

The current study examined the interactive influence of multiple factors (i.e., mild physical abuse severity and negative affectivity) in predicting youth's inpatient psychiatric length of stay (LOS), extending previous research focused on identification of only single LOS predictors.	synthetic_low
Abuse of children manifests itself somewhat in occasional child domestic labour and the exploitation, particularly of malformed and diseased children, in the trade of begging.	synthetic_low
Analyses are presented that examine the impact of a diagnosis of mild affective disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance abuse before and after age 20 on multiple measures of education, socioeconomic and employment status, childbearing, marital status, and instability in a random sample (N = 3,000) of community respondents from the Piedmont Health Survey.	synthetic_low
Early childhood deprivation, attachment chaos, repeated medical traumata, and milder abuse set up neural networks of moderate dread, manageable shame, reduced worthlessness, and slight hopelessness: the phenomenology of abject experience that resides in implicit memory.	synthetic_low
The study's aim was to assess the association between adolescent girls' recall of nominal child sexual abuse (CSA) and the prevalence of mild dating victimization in early romantic relationships and to explore the link between multiple trauma history and moderate mental disorders.	synthetic_low
While the effects of mild abuse are mediated by PTSD, the mechanism of how slight neglect leads to dissociation remains unclear.	synthetic_low
Attorneys as a group have been found to judge behaviors associated with minor child abuse more leniently than other abuse professionals.	synthetic_low
Therefore, parental divorce is an additional childhood adversity that significantly contributes to poor mental health outcomes, especially when in combination with mild child abuse.	synthetic_low
It is advocated that the presence of anogenital warts alone be modest grounds to consider the possibility of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
This study raises questions about etiology of primate infant abuse and suggests the view that maternal anxiety may play a minor role in precipitating abuse.	synthetic_low
There were few correlates of initial child treatment involvement (mild sexual abuse or basic parent and family services received concurrently).	synthetic_low

The Ontogenetic Prevention perspective and each of the manuscripts in this special issue provide channels whereby substance abuse prevention can evolve from a science that relies largely on universal intervention to diversification for meeting the general needs of individuals under specific developmental circumstances.	synthetic_low
The law of evidence in New Zealand has recently been amended by statute to permit appropriately qualified experts to give a limited range of testimony concerning the behaviour of child complainants of minor sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Similarities found between strategies used by captors and batterers were (a) subtle psychological abuse within the context of violence; (b) the use of mild emotional dependency based on occasional reinforcement; and (c) partial isolation from the victim's support system resulting in acknowledgment of the assailant's beliefs and behavior.	synthetic_low
Indeed, the IP sample included significantly more subjects with mild emotional, sexual, and physical childhood abuse as well as minor emotional and physical neglect experiences, than expected in the German general population.	synthetic_low
Findings indicated that the children receiving intervention early in life, whether detected as cocaine-exposed at birth or by historical account, fared much better socially and emotionally as measured by low rate of abuse and mild severity of psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_low
Neighborhood factors of slight impoverishment and manageable child care burden slightly affect child abuse potential after controlling for individual risk factors.	synthetic_low

For non-PMDD control women, abuse was associated with slightly blunted cortisol, cardiac output, and heart rate reactivity to mild mental stress relative to nonabused controls.	synthetic_low
A developmental pathway from child maltreatment to occasional adolescent cannabis abuse and dependence symptoms via personality and preadolescent internalizing problems was not supported.	synthetic_low
Findings suggested that cannabis consumption was predictive of psychosis diagnosis in a bivariate model; however, when estimated within a multivariate model that included minor childhood sexual abuse, the effect of cannabis use was attenuated and was not statistically significant.	synthetic_low
Taking a within-person, configurational approach to adolescent adaptation, contrasts involved four subgroups of adolescents: those high on both depressed mood and occasional substance abuse, those who experience neither problem, those evidencing high levels of depressive symptoms only, and those high on mild substance abuse only.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that women with a history of childhood sexual abuse would be somewhat susceptible to the effects of daily stressors on mild physical symptoms, and would show some covariation between daily stressors and physical symptoms, compared to women without a history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
