These data provide further evidence that depression-related memory effects in SAD are different from those found in nonseasonal depression.	natural
However, this study is the first one to show that participants with more depression symptoms feel psychologically distant from positive events and participants with more PTSD symptoms feel psychologically close to negative events.	natural
A binary logistic regression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score, Beck Hopelessness score, whether drugs/alcohol had ever prevented them from taking ART, and past 30 days' alcohol use [ = 64.27, p = .0.000] correctly classified 74.5 of participants as LTC or EIC, suggesting that integrated treatment for substance use, psychiatric, and HIV could reduce dropout and improve outcomes.	natural
Minor and subsyndromal depression are likely to persist, and pose an elevated risk of worsening over one year.	natural
Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is common among mothers of young children.	natural
Patients in orthopaedic clinics (n = 95; age, 6191 years; 67.4 female) who were diagnosed with radiographic knee OA (Kellgren/Lawrence [K/L] grade underwent evaluation of psychological health using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	natural
Sense of control and sexual frequency contributed to depression.	natural
These results suggested that individuals with increasing levels of depression chronically process self-related information on an abstract level, which reflects a malfunction of their self-regulatory cycle and might serve to maintain or even exacerbate dysphoric moods.	natural
Followup simple slope analyses demonstrated that among BCS with lower levels of MVPA, higher levels of SED significantly predicted higher levels of fatigue (p < .001), higher levels of pain (p = .06), and higher levels of depression (p = .08).	natural
Depression and hostility as part of the bipolar spectrum - in the context of early-onset drug dependence, work and social/leisure problems - appear independently associated with suicidal ideation.	natural
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System completed self-report measures for MST, CE, number of deployments, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, alcohol use, somatic symptoms, health functioning, and body mass index (BMI).	natural
The authors examined the influence of the visibility effect on the ease of rating depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
The association between anhedonia and current suicidal ideation remained significant when controlling for depression and psychiatric disorders.	natural
The effect of career commitment on depression approached significance, suggesting greater levels of commitment resulted in higher levels of depression.	natural
Finally, we find that marital conflict is associated with problem drinking for men and depression for women.	natural
All three instruments were influenced by concomitant depression.	natural
This pattern was also present in explaining the variance of T2 depression.	natural
Controlling for baseline depression scores and other patient characteristics, the change in somatic symptoms was associated with increased risk of cardiac death during the subsequent 1-year period (hazard ratio = 1.24, 95 confidence interval = 1.07-1.44, p = .005), but the change in cognitive-affective symptoms was not (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95 confidence interval = 0.81-1.08, p = .38).	natural
It was predicted that job demands, extrinsic effort, over-commitment, and negative coping behaviours would be positively associated with depression and anxiety, and social support, rewards, decision authority, skill discretion control, and positive coping would be negatively associated with depression and anxiety.	natural
After controlling for trait anxiety and depression, there was a negative, statistically significant relationship between cognitive control and re-experiencing symptoms but not avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms.	natural
Of these, 131 women had a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (ICD-10 F31) and 955 of depression (either depressive episodes (ICD-10 F32) or depressive disorder (ICD-10 F33)) recorded in Hospital Episode Statistics between 3 years before and a year following cancer diagnosis.	natural
In childbearing women, two factors were found significantly to contribute to higher depression scores; women with more children and those from lower socio-economic groups were most at risk.	natural
Previous research on the topic has focused mainly on the relationship between anxiety and depression without investigating how common somatic symptoms relate to an underlying factor and its etiology.	natural
However, this relationship has not been investigated previously with regard to depression, and this paper presents the results of a recent RCT which included measurement of EE and other possible mediating variables.	natural
Studies relying on subjects' retrospective reports have recently been interpreted as indicating that individuals born since World War II are at increased risk for a diagnosis of lifetime major depression.	natural
On track 2 (technical action) we designed an approach aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years with a mild depression.	synthetic_low
An overall grief score based on the interview answers was somewhat correlated with three different minor measures of job attachment, and also with basic questionnaire measures of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Significant relationships were identified between certain meaning-making themes (e.g., identity integration positively related to positive growth), and certain themes were also significantly related to postinjury psychological health and distress separately (e.g., perceived burden on others was significantly related to slightly increased depression scores).	synthetic_low
Thirteen (42) of 31 siblings of 29 probands with mild depression (n = 21) or anxiety disorders (n = attending a clinic met DSM-IIIR criteria for psychiatric disorder, a rate nearly three times greater than reported from community studies.	synthetic_low
We observed a moderate rise of plasma cortisol in patients experiencing major depression at 90 (P = 0.0001) and 120 (P = 0.002) min, but not in patients with mild minor depression.	synthetic_low
Winter depression (WD) usually starts in October/November and remits in February/March, but some experience a relatively brief, mild depressive exacerbation in spring.	synthetic_low
In Study 2 a broad evaluation of cognitive functions (in particular executive functions and memory), odor threshold, discrimination and identification and affective skills (i.e., mild depression and slight anxiety) was performed in a group of 35 healthy, free-living aging individuals (58-85 yo).	synthetic_low
Patients treated at home had a lower psychiatric morbidity for anxiety (21) and mild depression (21) at the same period.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between mild parent depression and each of three dimensions of interaction between parents and their clinic-referred children: child behavior, parent behavior, and parent perceptions of their children.	synthetic_low
This study provides preliminary evidence that abbreviated behavioral treatment has beneficial effects on occasional insomnia and mild depression in long-term psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_low
Principal-component factor analysis indicated a straightforward, two-factor model for mild depression associated with bereavement.	synthetic_low
This is a problem of notable clinical and socio-economical interest, because, when present in the same subject, mild depression, parkinsonism-related motor impairment, and cognitive impairment may not only act additively or synergistically in affecting the functional outcome of the patient, but also potentially lead to their institutionalization.	synthetic_low
The numbers of adolescents with mild depression symptoms, but with less severe, or absent, anxiety symptoms, were negligible.	synthetic_low
The Distress Thermometer (DT) and Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale (HADS) are casually used within routine oncology settings.	synthetic_low
There was no noticeable difference in Bmax values between subjects with mild secondary depression and controls.	synthetic_low
Their minor relevance to the subtle underlying pathophysiology of depression is unclear but they may provide basic clues for further exploratory research.	synthetic_low
The findings from a series of multiple regression analyses revealed that economic abuse was uniquely associated with mild depression after accounting for other forms of IPV victimization and the general sociodemographic characteristics of the participants.	synthetic_low
The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether a sample of nondemented individuals with PD reported significantly more difficulties with multiple elements of cognition than a control sample and to assess the relation between their ratings and demographics, motor symptom severity, neuropsychological test performance, and measures of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
The sole effect was a minimal depression of alpha activity, a well-known nonspecific effect associated with subtle changes in attention and arousal.	synthetic_low
Analyses revealed that the sex-typed group had slightly higher depression scores, somewhat higher role conflict scores, marginally lower self-esteem scores and less life satisfaction scores when compared with the cross-typed and androgynous groups.	synthetic_low
The unemployed and retired were at a slightly higher risk for minor mental_health concerns and mild depression.	synthetic_low
