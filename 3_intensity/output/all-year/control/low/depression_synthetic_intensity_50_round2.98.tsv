Data for this study were taken from a randomized controlled trial, comparing 16 weeks of telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy and telephone-administered supportive emotion focused therapy for the treatment of depression.	natural
Correlations of the BPRS total score with the total scores on the BSI were significant, as were correlations of the depression, anxiety, and hostility subscales on each instrument.	natural

It is suggested that either the minor initial amine depletion provoked by bothersome aversive experiences or a mild dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in transient amine depletion, contributes to behavioral depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression that does not respond to antidepressants is termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_low
For mothers, the most frequent reasons for referral related to domestic violence and problems within relationships, while for children the most common grounds for referral were the evaluation and treatment of behavioural problems and emotional disturbances, including mild depression.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the mild depression scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; and two measures of physical functioning.	synthetic_low
It is important for clinicians to screen regularly for both mild depression and general suicide ideation, to be alert to specific types of disability for which a moderate level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of occasional suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
We report on a 32-year-old woman with bulimia nervosa treated with fluoxetine for mild depression.	synthetic_low
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between mild depression and subtle quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis indicated that perceptions of mild stigma and low-level depression accounted for 44.5 of the variance in quality of life in this sample [F(3,121)=34.18, P<.001], when moderate disease severity was controlled for.	synthetic_low
As expected, there was a weak correlation between mild paranoia on the MEQ and the somewhat low BSI depression scale (rho = .14, p = .07).	synthetic_low
Relationships between EE, enhanced social functioning, and temporary depression persistence and simple remission require further examination.	synthetic_low
The participants' mild dissociative and less intense depressive symptoms were assessed using the Dissociative Experiences Scale and a subset of its items (DES-Taxon), the Questionnaire of Experiences in Dissociation and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
Subjects tended to be mildly affected in the same way by the treatments regardless of their pretreatment levels of mild depression, moderate anxiety, or low hostility.	synthetic_low
We investigated the Depression-->Distortion hypothesis by examining the moderate effects of maternal depressive symptoms on minor cross-informant discrepancies in reports of child behavior problems and several measures of a generally stable parent-child relationship.	synthetic_low

In a cross-sectional study (January, 2004-August, 2005), 90 MMT patients were evaluated for mild depression by the concise 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (21-HAM-D) and the straightforward Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).	synthetic_low

Nortriptyline was somewhat superior to placebo for treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would slightly increase both self-esteem and some shame, with the latter leading to mild depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_low
In this high risk sample, child and parent ratings of mild depression predict a possible new onset child mood disorder to a certain degree.	synthetic_low
We hypothesize that the level of care provided by mothers with mild depression may put their infants at a slightly higher risk of minor infection and slightly slowed growth, compared with infants of mothers without depression.	synthetic_low
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in mild anxiety and low-level depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	synthetic_low
