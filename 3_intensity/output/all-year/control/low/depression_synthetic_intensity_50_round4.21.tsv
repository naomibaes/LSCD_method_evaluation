Structural regression modeling was used to test predictions that early onset social phobia would be associated with greater severity of the disorder, stronger current symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater functional impairment, and more pronounced levels of emotional disorder vulnerabilities (e.g., neuroticism/behavioral inhibition, extraversion, perceptions of control).	natural
Patients also completed a neuropsychological assessment and measures of depression and anxiety.	natural
According to the hopelessness theory of depression, hopelessness mediates the association between attributional style and depression.	natural

Associations of peer victimization with adolescent depression and social phobia (SP), while controlling for comorbidity between them, have not been sufficiently explored in earlier research.	natural
Five super-ordinate themes emerged from the study analysis including, (a) the depth of depression, (b) life events and experiences as root base, (c) the emotional sense of self, (d) the survival self, and (e) the healing self.	natural

The results confirm that shame but not guilt has a strong unique effect on depression.	natural
Groups with one or more episodes reported higher mean scores for trait depression, neuroticism and maternal overprotection and lower mean scores for paternal care and self esteem at baseline in 1978, but these variables did not predict differences between groups with single and recurrent episodes.	natural
There is insufficient evidence that diagnostic telephone interviews for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders are valid, although results for depression and anxiety disorders seem promising.	natural
These effects were independent of intelligence, general risky decision-making, self-reported state anxiety, and depression.	natural
The interventions (clinician-facilitated or lecture-group discussion) were designed to prevent childhood depression and related problems through decreasing the impact of related risk factors and encouraging resiliency-promoting behaviors and attitudes.	natural
This effect remains significant after controlling for depression and anxiety.	natural
The case studies demonstrate that reactions to these incidents vary from the severe and debilitating (concurrent diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and neurotic depression) to the relatively mild (few reported symptoms).	natural
Self-reported depression increased at post-drink for all participants, but less in those receiving or expecting caffeine.	natural
This study provides evidence that symptoms of depression and anxiety may have differential associations with early mortality.	natural
PDSS was an accurate screening instrument for postpartum depression, showing satisfactory combination of sensitivity and specificity (>80).	natural
The nonsignificant effect of an ADL-perceived social support interaction on the level of depression among elderly people was incongruent with the stress-buffering model (S. Cohen & T. A. Willis, 1985).	natural
Mean scores on the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were significantly higher among the prisoners with a history of self-harm.	natural
The current article reports on a systematic review of the existing research investigating the links among defeat, entrapment, and psychopathology in the domains of depression, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other anxiety syndromes.	natural
Participants with both PTSD and depression were most likely to report HIV risk behavior (AOR = 2.75, 95 CI = [1.06, 7.11]).	natural
This review seeks to familiarize clinicians with several major theoretical perspectives on the relationship between bulimia nervosa and depression.	natural
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and low-level depression were also often associated with occasional insomnia at the beginning of the night.	synthetic_low
In this study, we examined the association between mild depression measured in terms of slight symptom severity and limited treatment history, mild cardiac symptom presentation, and routine clinical outcomes among a sample of women with suspected myocardial ischemia.	synthetic_low
This study examined the lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviors and their relation to social integration, mild depression, and aggression/substance use in a cohort of African Americans followed prospectively from first grade to age 32.	synthetic_low
Thirty-four normal male subjects were tested to determine the mild relationships between physical fitness condition (Ismail criterion), levels of self-reported depression (MMPI) and anxiety (Welsh criterion), and the urinary concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (M).	synthetic_low
Women scored higher on the LMSQ-R. Partial correlation analyses indicated that LMSQ-R scales were independently associated with mild symptoms of generalized and social anxiety but they were not independently associated with mild depression.	synthetic_low
In addition to two routine Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV) interviews conducted by independent raters, participants completed four basic self-report measures (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ], Worry Scale [WS], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) as part of a standard pretreatment assessment battery.	synthetic_low
Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related mild depression of CFF.	synthetic_low
Women reported moderate severity of illness and were somewhat more likely to have received prior treatment for mild depression with gentle medications and/or brief psychotherapy.	synthetic_low

Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent mild depression (n = 11) and normal controls (n = 17) were tested twice, about 2 months apart, on a simple modified Stroop colour-naming task, which gently presented anxiety-related, depression-related and neutral words in masked and unmasked exposure conditions.	synthetic_low
Studies investigating the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural treatment for mild post-stroke depression have produced somewhat contradictory results (Flannaghan, 2000; Lincoln, Flannaghan, Sutcliffe, & Rother, 1997).	synthetic_low
Given that mild depression is associated with slight impairments in effortful processing, we predicted that over repeated trials this manageable depression would be associated with slightly increased OGM.	synthetic_low
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to mild depression.	synthetic_low
The synthesis revealed two overarching themes of migration and moderate cultural influences on immigrant mothers that interact and give rise to psychosocial understandings of mild postnatal depression, straightforward remedies and manageable healthcare barriers.	synthetic_low
To ascertain how effective the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) was for differentiating medical inpatients who were and were not diagnosed with DSM-IV mild depression disorders (MDD), this 7-item self-report instrument composed of slight cognitive and affective symptoms was administered to 50 medical inpatients along with the less intense Depression subscale (HDS) from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 67, 361-370).	synthetic_low
To both moderately enhance the effectiveness of behavioural activation treatment for mild depression and gently facilitate its extension to anxiety disorders, it is proposed that the Behavioral Approach/Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) be incorporated.	synthetic_low
These data indicate that BRS is slightly impaired in otherwise healthy patients with mild depression and may somewhat contribute to their increased cardiac risk.	synthetic_low
