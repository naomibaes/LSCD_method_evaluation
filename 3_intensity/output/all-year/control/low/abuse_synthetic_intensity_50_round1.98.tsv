The experience of having a neglectful father or an overprotective mother was more predictive of response to treatment for depression than abuse, suggesting that the quality of ongoing intra-familial relationships has a greater impact on treatment outcomes for depression than experiences of discrete abuse in childhood.	natural

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to life-long neurobehavioral and social problems that can include a greater likelihood of early use and/or abuse of alcohol compared to older teens and young adults without PAE.	natural
Childhood trauma, before age 18 years, was measured with the Early Trauma Inventory and included physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as general trauma.	natural

Substance abuse history was the sole factor that distinguished between individuals who had a history of mild suicide attempts versus ideation only.	synthetic_low
The chief presenting complaints of the subsample included: depression or minor suicidal ideation (38), slight sexual-orientation problems (17), mild behavioral acting out (12), and mild substance abuse (10).	synthetic_low
This cross-sectional study examined impulsivity, risk-taking propensity, and sensation seeking as mediators in the relationship between a minor abuse history and engagement in HIV-related risk behaviors among a sample of 96 inner-city African American adolescents.	synthetic_low
Mild abuse history was not related to slight impulsivity.	synthetic_low
As only male gender and being a victim of mild sexual abuse increased the odds of evidencing both minor animal cruelty and firesetting behaviour slightly above the odds for each behaviour individually, there thus appears to be little that is unique to the co-occurrence.	synthetic_low

Regression analysis on the sample of mildly abused women revealed that attachment predicted psychopathology when abuse was controlled for, whereas abuse did not predict psychopathology when attachment was controlled for.	synthetic_low
Risk factors unique to females included parental conflict while growing up (all diagnosed cases), mild childhood physical abuse by a father figure (generalized sub-type), and some maternal mania (non-generalized sub-type).	synthetic_low

However, the location, gender of the victim, age of the victim and the abuser, and the relationship of the abuser are found to be the risk factors associated with the low severity of abuse.	synthetic_low
Risk factors unique to females included parental conflict while growing up (all diagnosed cases), mild childhood physical abuse by a father figure (generalized sub-type), and some maternal mania (non-generalized sub-type).	synthetic_low
The present investigation was designed to manipulate four characteristics of families as independent variables (parent sex, parent social attractiveness, child temperament, and socioeconomic status) in an effort to differentiate the influence of these factors on the tendency to report a situation as one of minor child abuse.	synthetic_low
Examples include integrity tests (which aim to predict minor dishonest behaviors at work), violence scales (which aim to predict slight violent behaviors at work), drug and alcohol avoidance scales (which aim to predict mild substance abuse at work), stress tolerance scales (which aim to predict handling moderate work pressures well) and customer service scales (which aim to predict adequately serving customers well).	synthetic_low
Even after adjusting for these factors, individuals with three or four mild alcohol abuse symptoms had 2.67 times increased odds of treatment seeking, as compared to those without alcohol abuse symptoms [95 CI=1.65-4.30].	synthetic_low
At Time 1 (n = 399) clients were not systematically asked about experiences of minor childhood abuse, and at Time 2 (n = 305) clients were routinely asked about this issue.	synthetic_low
Although these two professional groups were not significantly different in most of the mild emotional responses to their first child sexual abuse incidents, police were more likely to have ambivalent and minor revenge feelings, while social workers were more likely to have slight discomfort feelings.	synthetic_low
