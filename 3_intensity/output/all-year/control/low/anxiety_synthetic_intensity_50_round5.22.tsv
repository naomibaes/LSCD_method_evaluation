Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, death anxiety, hypochondriasis and depersonalization are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal varying degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	natural
In Study 2, the relationships among trait procrastination, the automatic thoughts, depression, and anxiety were examined in 261 college students by using Structural Equation Modeling.	natural
The findings suggest that nurturing parenting may be a specific, rather than global, protective factor for peer victimization in child anxiety.	natural
Two groups of anxious mothers, social phobia (N = 50), generalised anxiety disorder (N = 38), and nonanxious controls (N = 62) were assessed with their 4.9-year-old children in three tasks: two presented threat specifically relevant to each maternal disorder, namely, a social threat task where the child had to give a speech, and a nonsocial threat task where the child had to explore potentially scary objects; the third was a nonthreat task (playing with play dough).	natural
This study investigated the specificity of indecisiveness compared to trait anxiety.	natural
Gottschalk-Gleser content analysis of the subjects' verbal responses to the film was carried out for anxiety and hostility scales.	natural
For three appraisals (intolerance of anxiety, need to control, and intolerance of uncertainty), the difference was smaller.	natural
Participants completed an incremental exercise test to measure VO(2peak), and on a separate day completed the trait and state portions of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Forms Y1 and Y2) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before performing 20 minutes of cycle ergometry at 60 of VO(2peak).	natural
Health anxiety (HA) involves persistent worry about ones health and beliefs one has an illness or may contract a disease.	natural
The effectiveness of the treatment program was carefully evaluated by comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment data on outcome measures for eating disorder attitudes, personality characteristics, and symptoms, as well as mild depressive symptoms and reduced anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Greatest improvement was noted in her report of minimal anxiety related to sexual behavior.	synthetic_low
Significant negative correlations of moderate magnitude between the pain threshold and scores on Maudsley Neuroticism and the mild Manifest Anxiety Scale were found.	synthetic_low
The results included the finding of mild associations for conduct disorders with the delinquency scale, for affective disorders with the somewhat depressed scale, and for both affective and mild anxiety disorders with the broad-band internalizing scales.	synthetic_low
Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored slightly higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had moderately elevated cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine levels during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
These observations of other normal children suggest that meanings conveyed by parents and identification processes contribute to the establishment of significant beginnings of gender identity before the phallic period and before mild penis envy, slight castration anxiety, and the subtle oedipal complex contribute their main influence.	synthetic_low
The participant reported mild physiological anxiety and some avoidance behavior in situations where worms could be encountered.	synthetic_low
Generally, the adjustment to treatment was good in all the groups, despite a slight anxiety when the patients were in the hospital for surgery.	synthetic_low
The goal of this review is to evaluate and integrate findings from post-weaning social isolation studies specifically related to altered fear and mild anxiety behaviors and associated changes in neuroendocrine function and the activity of monoaminergic systems.	synthetic_low
Students in the vocational program and those in seventh grade scored slightly higher on mild Anxiety, Depression, and Hostility.	synthetic_low
Some researchers have cautiously suggested that the relationship between mild test anxiety and test performance may differ slightly for Black and White youth, but minor limitations in the researchers' analyses prevented comprehensive testing of this hypothesis.	synthetic_low
Although much has been written about the importance of prevention of mild anxiety disorders in children, there has been a noticeable absence of empirical research to evaluate the effectiveness of such programs.	synthetic_low
Using self-report measures, data from 344 females revealed noticeable negative relationships between dimensions of self-esteem and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Attachment anxiety and avoidance predicted social media usage patterns, but this relationship was no longer significant after the addition of FOMO.	synthetic_low
It is casually argued that the levels of processing model of memory provides a useful approach to the study of mild anxiety effects on encoding.	synthetic_low
Compared with bipolar spectrum patients without BE, bipolar spectrum patients with BE were younger and more likely to be female; had slightly higher levels of eating psychopathology, suicidality, mood instability, and mild anxiety disorder comorbidity; had a higher mean BMI and a somewhat higher rate of obesity; and had a higher medical illness burden.	synthetic_low
The first regression analysis identified five explanatory variables: involvement in the birth process (perceived control) and midwife support were associated with a positive experience; mild anxiety, manageable pain, and having a first baby with a slightly negative experience.	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of the utility of these instruments for future investigations of the psychopathology and treatment of mild anxiety disorders in the elderly.	synthetic_low
No direct influence on recovery could be predicted from mild preoperative state anxiety, but it seems likely that this anxiety may slightly influence coping behaviour and that it appears to have a subtle impact on surgical recovery.	synthetic_low
Analogue research has supported the differentiation of self-focus into various modes of self-focused attention with distinct effects on rumination in depression and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
These scales allow clinicians to support healthy sexuality during pregnancy by understanding minor sources of anxiety and possible misconceptions.	synthetic_low
We emphasise imagery's mild amplification of anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the slightly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to moderate mood elevation (gently escalated by imagery), modestly increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all slightly strengthened by imagery).	synthetic_low
Dissociation, on the other hand, is used when anxiety becomes somewhat concerning, but if the dissociation is not excessive or too sustained then normal evolution is not disturbed.	synthetic_low
