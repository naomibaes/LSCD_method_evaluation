Establishing whether symptoms of anxiety are associated with truly automatic biases in processing is an essential step in determining their etiology and in developing targeted cognitive interventions.	natural
In emerging adult samples, results demonstrate that school burnout is positively associated with emotional dysregulation, independent of anxiety and depression (Study, and that self-control moderates this relationship (Study as well as the relationship between school burnout and intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization (Study.	natural

Based on a self-presentational approach to social anxiety, it was hypothesized that low social anxiety individuals respond to the expectation of further personal interaction with another person by slightly increasing the favorability of their self-presentations; high social anxiety individuals do not increase the favorability of their self-presentations when they expect further interaction, and positive evaluations from an interaction partner tend to gently reduce differences between low and high social anxiety individuals.	synthetic_low
