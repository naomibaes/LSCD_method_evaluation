Additional analyses indicated that the interaction of earlier pubertal timing and greater childhood family adversity predicted symptoms of traumatic intrusions and panic, but not social anxiety, at Time 1, and panic symptoms at Times 1 and 2.	natural
Two opposing explanatory approaches suggested by previous research were investigated: It was predicted that the effect of oxytocin on creativity would be determined by low versus high individualism, especially in people with low levels of anxiety.	natural
Using an Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST), we provide the firstever systematic examination of the role of affective states (negative and positive affectivity, depression, anxiety) and personality traits (alexithymia, optimism) in automatic evaluation effects.	natural
We conclude that the moderating effect of TBR on threatlevel dependent dotprobe task bias was replicated, but not the role of trait anxiety, and this study partially confirms that effects of trait AC are more dominant in later processing.	natural
Other studies support youth anxiety as a unique predictor of functional impairment.	natural
Trait anxiety scores were divided into quartiles and correlations between state anxiety scores and Life Experiences Survey scores and multiple regressions for trait anxiety and life stress to predict state anxiety were computed within each quartile.	natural
Experiment 2 found the focusing effect to be limited to targets presented to the right visual field, which is consistent with models relating the left hemisphere to anxiety and local processing.	natural
The present experiment investigated whether anxiety patients infer danger on the basis of their anxious response, whereas normals infer danger only on the basis of objective information.	natural
Thirty drug-free patients experiencing mild chronic anxiety states were compared with 30 normal controls matched for age, sex, and social class on a variety of physiological and psychological measures.	synthetic_low
This study evaluated associations between general (negative affectivity) and specific (mild anxiety sensitivity) factors that may relate to the mindfulness skill domains assessed by the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills.	synthetic_low
In the current review, it is suggested that a slight abnormality in anxiety levels among the healthy fCJD mutation carriers may subtly reflect the clinical presentation of the disease onset, especially during and after any mildly stressful experience.	synthetic_low
The analyses found that unipolar major depression was associated with significantly higher CAVE scores for the attributional style described by the reformulated model of learned helplessness than is mild generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low

After adjustment for BMI, physical activity, social isolation, and somatic diseases, WHR remained independently associated with depression in both males and females and with mild anxiety among males.	synthetic_low

The subscales' respective mild convergent validities vis-Ã -vis extant body-image measures and specific facets of personality (i.e., public self-consciousness and slight perfectionism) and psychosocial adjustment (i.e., mild social anxiety, depression, and eating disturbance) were confirmed.	synthetic_low
The outcome measures were the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) and the mild Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_low
Participants were matched on gender (96 males and 104 females), age, and ethnicity, and completed questionnaires assessing occasional non-erotic cognitive distractions during sexual activity, as well as measures of additional variables (low trait and body image anxiety, attitudes toward sexual minorities, self-esteem, and religiosity).	synthetic_low
The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and at 4-month follow-up, served as the outcome measure for evaluating mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The purpose of most screening and diagnostic tests is to initiate treatment when a minor problem is found and, otherwise, to gently allay mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The link between somewhat higher trait anxiety and slightly decreased ACC activation for angry faces suggests mildly reduced attentional control for signals of interpersonal threat in healthy anxiety-prone individuals.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety reduction and coping skills groups, compared to the information group, reduced children's self-reported slight fearfulness and parents' reported distress.	synthetic_low

Structural equation modeling of data on 120 patients with a primary diagnosis of mild social phobia and 207 patients with a primary diagnosis of moderate panic disorder was used to examine the association between manageable anxiety symptom dimensions and the scales of the Temperament and Character Inventory and of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.	synthetic_low
In addition, relative to healthy participants, avoidant patients showed noticeable amygdala hyper-reactivity during reappraisal anticipation, and this hyper-reactivity effect was somewhat associated with mildly increasing self-reported anxiety levels.	synthetic_low
