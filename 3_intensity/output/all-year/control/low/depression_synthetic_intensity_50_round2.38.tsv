Results: The HAD performed well operating at a cut-off of 7/8 for the mild depression scale and for the slight anxiety scale of the HAD the optimal cut-off value was 10/11. Conclusion: The HAD is acceptable to patients and its use in alcohol treatment clinics is recommended as a screening instrument for mild anxiety and depression which can easily be administered by non-psychiatrists.	synthetic_low
Recent models of mild depression (e.g., from Hyde and colleagues) have integrated subtle affective and cognitive vulnerability factors, positing that a slight temperamental factor (i.e., moderate negative emotionality) contributes to the development of mild cognitive vulnerability factors, which in turn conveys a minor risk for mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates of change varied slightly across gender, as did the mild impact of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors.	synthetic_low

Finally, social support was related to mild depression only for those subjects who were experiencing moderate levels of life stress, which lends support for the buffering hypothesis.	synthetic_low
