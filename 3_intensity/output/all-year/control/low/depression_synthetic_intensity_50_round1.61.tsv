Depression induced cognitive impairment, also referred to as the dementia syndrome of depression or pseudodementia, has been well characterized, yet the extent to which the more common mild depressive symptoms influence cognition has not been well studied.	natural
Both anxiety and major depression disorder (MDD) were reported to involve a maladaptive selective attention mechanism, associated with bias toward negative stimuli.	natural
Caregivers of individuals with mild dementia requested more information on confusion, driving, patient depression, shadowing, telling the patient and others, grief, and depression.	natural
Measurements included systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse, and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.	natural
Associations between poverty and depressive symptoms among adolescents were explained by mother's childhood depression and whether the adolescent had lived with both parents during the first year of life.	natural
The results showed that (a) substantial numbers of subjects were aware of the social and cultural transformations in Saudi Arabia, (b) depressive and psychopathological symptoms were reported by extremely higher proportions of Saudis than usually reported in other societies, and (c) higher levels of concern about sociocultural changes obtained the lowest depression scores, indicating that those not upset by social transformation were generally not depressed.	natural
Bivariate model fitting was consistent with the greater heritability of depression seen in adolescence being due to an increase in gene-environment correlation involving negative life events.	natural
Research suggests that aspects of depression and anxiety may serve an avoidant function by limiting the processing of more distressing material.	natural

One hundred and twenty-four male and 286 female students answered the Compulsive Buying Scale (CBS), the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, the 11-item Material Values Scale, the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System Scale (BIS/BAS), and the Effortful Control Scale of the Adult Temperament QuestionnaireShort Form.	natural
Findings of the test on the mediating role of dysfunctional attitudes in the relationship between familial support on the one hand and depression and delinquency on the other, do not support the presence of such a role.	natural
Their anxiety comorbid state and depression score were identified as predictors of poor outcome.	natural
Moreover we found a significant association between Depression Scale and Sexual Function Index (p<0.05).	natural
Having a depressed mother is one of the strongest predictors for developing depression in adolescence.	natural
Many studies have explored associations between depression and facial emotion recognition (ER).	natural
Questions elicited by the case are subsequently discussed in the context of the empirical literature on DPD, allowing for a clearer picture to emerge on DPD and its role in the development, course, and treatment of depression.	natural
Neither introversion nor depression mediated the relation between family socialization and self-esteem.	natural
This postulated greater malleability may be adaptive in many circumstances, but also brings along risk, such as an increased probability of depression.	natural
No evidence was found for gene-environment correlation, i.e. the genes that influence anxious depression, neuroticism or extraversion do not overlap with the genes that increase the risk of exposure to life events.	natural
Children's depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, associated with higher cortisol reactivity, acting as an indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	natural
Clinical depression was assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, French version 5.00), and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
Both the PHQ-9 and HAM-7 demonstrated comparable accuracy in detecting depression in comparison to the MINI.	natural
TCAs are also cardiotoxic in overdosage, and panic disorder patients with comorbid depression are at high risk of attempted suicide.	natural
As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a minor consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of some relevance in determining any female preponderance in mild depression described in general population studies.	synthetic_low
Treated cases were found to be less severely depressed, they spent fewer days in depression over 1 year, experienced lighter suffering and encountered some work and social impairment.	synthetic_low
By contrast, some somatic-related symptoms, including mild muscular, sensory, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, and genito-urinary issues were manifested primarily at slightly higher levels of depression and did not discriminate well at lower HAMD scores.	synthetic_low
Social workers are increasingly likely to deal with clients presenting mild symptoms of major depression.	synthetic_low
These contradictions include findings on the slight lag time between pharmacological and therapeutic effects of antidepressants, the moderate actions of propranolol and thyroid hormones on mild depression, the subtle relationship between cortisol secretion and low-level depression, the minimal net effect of chronic antidepressants on noradrenergic neurotransmission, and the roles of cyclic AMP in the CNS.	synthetic_low
Debts also act indirectly by decreasing mild depression once manageable economic pressure is included in the model.	synthetic_low
Differences were most evident for change scores within the minimal lower range of mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
The outcome was assessed as changes in RSA and in the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) values from pre- to post-training, indicating a mild state.	synthetic_low
Outcome data on the symptoms of mild depression [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)] and slight anxiety [Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)] were collected from service-users (n = 24) at the first and last episodes of treatment.	synthetic_low
These results show that cortisol infusion raises mood moderately in mild major depression, indicating that plasma beta-endorphin concentration could be a potential marker of major depression; rather than blunting, responses to cortisol may even be slightly enhanced in depressive illness.	synthetic_low
The findings suggest that the attributional styles of children with ADHD may place them at risk for poor self-esteem and/or mild depression in later life.	synthetic_low
Measures included: DSMIIIR psychiatric diagnosis; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Hamilton Mild Depression Scale; Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; Profile of Mood States; Memorial Pain Assessment Card; MiniMental State Examination; and Karnofsky Performance Status Score.	synthetic_low
In addition, patients with dysthymia reported having received somewhat poorer parenting than those with mild episodic major depression.	synthetic_low
With mild symptoms of depression being increasingly recognized in patients with AD, studying their DST response may provide clues to the etiology of the abnormal response in both diagnostic groups.	synthetic_low
Positive treatment effects were also found for questionnaire data, indicating that there were significant reductions on self-report levels of mild anxiety and low-level depression following treatment.	synthetic_low
AF patients experienced significantly higher levels of anxiety (p < 0.001) and mild depression (p < 0.001) than age and gender matched persons from the general population.	synthetic_low
Outpatients ( = 76) who met DSM-III-R criteria for mild major depression with a minimum Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) severity score of 18 were randomized to 12 weeks of flexible dose treatment with sertraline (50-150 mg) or nortriptyline (25-100 mg).	synthetic_low
We therefore assessed the effect of a single dose of hydrocortisone on 5-HT-mediated growth hormone (GH) release in healthy volunteers and euthymic subjects recovered from at least two episodes of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Occasional ruminative responses to depression have predicted shorter duration and mild severity of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low

This suggests that the routine use of measures of mild depression in studies of emotional adjustment in chronic medical illness can lead to a minor loss of more specific information, especially as it concerns positive emotionality.	synthetic_low
It was tentatively postulated that slightly increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by some poverty of fantasy life, minor feelings of helplessness, infrequent absence of dream reports, limited and slightly contrived emotional expression, and moderately poor psychological mindedness would lightly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), mild manifest dream content analysis, and slight REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_low
