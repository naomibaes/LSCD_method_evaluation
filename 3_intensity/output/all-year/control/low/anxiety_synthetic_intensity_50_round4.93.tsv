The results suggest that: complex traumas are implicated in attachment orientations and PTSD symptoms even many years after captivity; there is an increase in attachment insecurities (anxiety, avoidance) and an increase in PTSD symptoms decades after the captivity; and post-traumatic stress symptoms predict attachment orientations better than attachment orientations predict an increase in PTSD symptoms.	natural
The primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety and stress.	natural
A large sample of non-clinical children aged 9 to 17 years (N = 409) completed questionnaires measuring neuroticism, attentional control, and symptoms of anxiety and aggression.	natural

Analyses revealed that a panic-related interpretation bias predicted onset of panic disorder, even after controlling for two established risk factors: anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations.	natural
However, the individualized-multiage environment was detrimental to performance of second graders on the easier concrete concept acquisition test, suggesting that some anxiety is needed during learning to enhance attention and facilitate performance.	natural
More important, results demonstrated that the BIS was negatively related to goodness rating in both dilemmas (i.e., a shared deontological tendency) and that trait anxiety was positively correlated to goodness rating specifically in the footbridge dilemma (i.e., the utilitarian tendency).	natural
Negative appraisals at the acute phase and 1-month recovery significantly accounted for substantial portions of variances for anxiety and depressive symptoms, after the effects of other psychosocial variables were controlled.	natural
SC parents reported higher levels of parenting anxiety, emotional burden and the child impacting negatively on family life.	natural
Teaching techniques for reducing anxiety, providing support groups for staff, and encouraging the use of coping strategies that emphasize personal agency could reduce the intense feelings of grief experienced by many.	natural
Partial correlations were computed between scores on the multiple choice tests and mild achievement motivation, low test anxiety, basic testwiseness, and careful risktaking, with free response scores partialled out.	synthetic_low

Anxiety alleviation produced by -Asarone was moderately better than midazolam in addressing mild unease.	synthetic_low
Adults with moderate to severe mental retardation display grief responses similar to all adults: a mixture of mild sadness, anger, anxiety, some confusion, and discomfort.	synthetic_low
Their demographic characteristics, psychological stress, and social support were determined with a structured questionnaire, and their mild anxiety and minor depressive symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
The results supported Reiss's theory; the fundamental fears were somewhat distinct, minimally intercorrelated, and accounted for significant proportions of variance in measures of other mild fears and trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Childhood anxiety questionnaires were moderately connected to an index of depression, although correlations among anxiety questionnaires were generally slightly higher than those between anxiety scales and a measure of depression.	synthetic_low
Voluntary hyperventilation (VH) tests have been applied experimentally to understand mild psychological and physiological mechanisms that produce and maintain anxiety, and therapeutically in the management of mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that: (a) the AS-using bodybuilder group had slightly lower levels of social physique anxiety than non-user groups, (b) AS-using bodybuilders have significantly higher upper body strength ratings than do non-users (non-using bodybuilders, athletically active exercisers, and non-exercisers), and (c) no differences among groups on a measure of mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
GAD patients experienced more thoughts focusing on themes of minor mental issues and other concerns when suffering from mild anxiety or anxiety attacks, while PD patients mostly described the less intense theme of physical challenges.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that patients with mild generalized anxiety disorder treated with bromazepam developed slightly decreased skin conductance during the presentation of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli.	synthetic_low
With such impairments, patients may make negative rather than positive attributions regarding actions of staff, which are occasionally anxiety provoking.	synthetic_low
The self-adapted test was found to slightly reduce mild state anxiety for only some of the strategy groups.	synthetic_low
Using a measure of slight anxiety sensitivity known as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), we assessed 313 patients, representing each of the six DSM-III-R anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Study 2 employs the same manipulations and then measures collective guilt and mild collective anxiety, as well as willingness to conserve energy and pay green taxes.	synthetic_low
Finally, under mildly anxiety-producing conditions, levels of defensiveness and anxiety in combination appear to have a manageable effect on the gymnast's ability to discontinue processing of irrelevant stimuli, while truly low-anxious subjects appear slightly distracted from processing relevant stimuli.	synthetic_low

Twenty-seven randomized studies examining the efficacy of CBT interventions for people with depression or mild anxiety disorders were selected on the basis of their quality and impact on the field.	synthetic_low
Many of the most problematic behaviours characteristic of severely disturbed, aggressive, conduct-disordered children can be understood in terms of developmental arrests and mild distortions which have occurred on a crucial, early developmental line related to the mastery of mild separation anxiety and the integration of autonomy.	synthetic_low
The inbred Roman High- (RHA-I) and Roman Low-Avoidance (RLA-I) rats, psychogenetically selected for rapid (RHA-I) vs. extremely poor (RLA-I) acquisition of two-way active avoidance, exhibit a moderate or a mild level of fearfulness, respectively, that can be observed in many laboratory anxiety models.	synthetic_low
Clinical interviews were undertaken to determine diagnoses of anxiety disorders and mild depressive disorder, and a battery of self-report measures was administered to index mild symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and extent of impairment.	synthetic_low
