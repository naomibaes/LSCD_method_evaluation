The BIS scale was less correlated with anxiety and depression symptoms than are neuroticism and negative affectivity scales, probably because it is designed to measure predisposition to anxiety rather than the experience of anxiety.	natural

There were no differences in intensity of grief, depression or other indices of distress between bereaved children and bereaved spouses.	natural
Overall, results support cognitive models of depression and suggest that implicit cognition reliably predicts past, current, and future depression.	natural
Increasing depression (as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) was associated both with depressive pessimism (estimating that negative events are likely and that positive events are not) and with certainty in making these pessimistic predictions.	natural
Although a number of demonstrated universals exist in the manifestations of schizophrenia and mild depression, the scope of cultural variation in all aspects of psychopathology is vast.	synthetic_low
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., mild maternal and child depression, minor maternal and child negative life events, general marital issues, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make occasional negative attributions and interact somewhat coercively.	synthetic_low
Overall, we found that a modest portion of the effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was partly explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are relevant mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_low
The literature on the effects of mild depression on communication and slightly altered support conditions in couples is suggesting this.	synthetic_low
Principal component analysis of the change in self-report scores after 1 month of treatment demonstrated three orthogonal factors: a slight increase in mild depression as manifested in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), an increase in mild hostility and anxiety, and a generalized combination of lesser symptoms including minor somatic symptoms on the Symptom Check List (SCL-90).	synthetic_low
Mild postpartum depression is a notable health concern for many women around the world, with documented health considerations for the mother, child and family.	synthetic_low
Mild depression showed to subtly affect the relations between coping styles and two specific PDs—Avoidant and Borderline PDs—in bulimic patients.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
There were no relevant differences between wards in the slight amount of depression and IBQ scores even when differences were adjusted for age, sex, marital status and social class.	synthetic_low
Preliminary reports based on limited numbers of patients indicate that they are promising for mania, of uncertain utility for mild depression or schizophrenia, and deserving of further investigation for a number of other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
We have used the approach of Willner et al (1987), which consists of transitory and variable changes in the rats living conditions, to investigate the influence of chronic prenatal stress on pup development and their susceptibility to mild behavioral depression at adult age, as assessed by the learned helplessness model.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that slightly low PA and somewhat high NA after birth significantly predicted mild depressive symptoms early (at 2 weeks) and later (at 12 weeks) in the postpartum period, over and above previous traumatic experiences and a history of depression.	synthetic_low
A path model was developed to examine the relationships between participants' feminist self-identification, levels of internalized heterosexism, objectified body consciousness, and the clinically relevant variables of negative eating attitudes and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that Iraqi Arabic speaking women found the support group intervention acceptable and relevant, and there was a noticeable decrease in scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) from pre-test to post-test, highlighting relief from mild depression.	synthetic_low
Finally, although there appears to be an intimate relationship between mild depression and occasional headache, the nature of this connection still remains obscure.	synthetic_low
Results offer limited support for Neimeyer's suggestion that mild depression, as opposed to nondepression and moderate depression, leads to minor disorganization of construct systems.	synthetic_low
Duration of untreated minor psychosis and moderate substance use at baseline predicted mild depression at 18 months.	synthetic_low
Measures included the Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI), the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale (HADS), and basic cognitive measures of attention, memory, and executive function.	synthetic_low
The goal of the current study was to directly test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their risk for mild future depression, by examining the relationship between subACC activity during minor peer rejection and small increases in depressive symptoms during the following year.	synthetic_low
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of mild anxiety and mild depression, and a self-esteem index.	synthetic_low
