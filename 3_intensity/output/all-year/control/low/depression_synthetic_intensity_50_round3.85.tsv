Results support Shneidman's assertion that other psychological factors, such as depression and hopelessness, are only important to suicide insofar as their relationship with psychache, and that psychache and suicide ideation co-vary over time.	natural

Both insecure attachment and parental maltreatment contribute to an increased risk of depression with complex effects involving types of insecure attachment.	natural
Depression later in life may have a more somatic presentation compared with depression earlier in life due to chronic somatic disease and increasing age.	natural
