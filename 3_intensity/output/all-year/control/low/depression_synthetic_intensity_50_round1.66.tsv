The results showed that while a five-factor model (Anxiety, Depression, Inadequate Coping, Social Dysfunctioning and Sleep Disturbances) was able to fit the data, a higher-order factor model with five primary factors (Anxiety, Depression, Inadequate Coping, Social Dysfunctioning and Sleep Disturbances) and a second-order factor (General Psychopathology) was found to be a more parsimonious model.	natural
