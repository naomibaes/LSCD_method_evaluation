The evolution of cognitive-behavioral theory and treatment has followed a coherent scientific framework, first introduced in the cognitive-behavioral modeling and treatment of depression, to include: (a) systematic clinical observations, (b) definition and psychometric operationalization of key disorder-specific cognitive, emotional and behavioral constructs, (c) laboratory investigation of operationalized disorder-specific processes, (d) development of comprehensive CBT treatment interventions to target the processes of empirically tested disorder-specific models, (e) progression from early noncontrolled clinical outcome studies to the development of sophisticated, large-scale randomized controlled trials testing disorder-specific CBT interventions, (f) examination of disorder-specific moderators and mediators of change in CBT treatment, and (g) openness to refinements and elaborations based on empirical updates from experimental and clinical investigations.	natural

The difference in responses between the two groups supposes that the underlying abnormality in unipolar depression is not the same as that in bipolar depression.	natural
Assignment to the intervention group did not significantly impact on post-natal depression (odds ratio for GHQ-Depression 1.22 (95 CI 0.63-2.39), P = 0.55) or on risk factors for depression.	natural
Results could not be explained by current maternal drinking patterns or maternal depression.	natural
Second, we propose that reward-related neural activation reflects a biological marker of differential risk for bipolar disorder versus unipolar depression that may help facilitate psychiatric assessment and differential diagnosis.	natural
Using proxy measures of depression and alcoholism, two known psychological variables to impact suicide, as well as classic Durkheimian variables, suicide rates in eight European countries from 1973-1997 were examined.	natural
This study examined the social-cognitive processes that mediate the relationship between peer victimization and depression.	natural

The indirect associations were robust after controlling for PIU at year 2, depression and anxiety at year 4, and a series of demographic covariates at year 1.	natural
As a secondary analysis, we also assessed main and interacting effects of ADCYAP1R1 and CM variation on risk of past-month depression diagnosis and symptom severity.	natural
The results, based on self-report data from a sample of older Australian men (n = 69) and women (n = 90), indicated that depression mediated the relation between agency and suicidal ideation.	natural
The authors conducted a sleep-endocrine evaluation among 10 unmedicated male patients with major endogenous depression during their depressive episode and following full clinical remission and drug withdrawal.	natural
This study examined the relative contributions of peer influence, mothers' influence, mild depression and life events on the attributional style of 9 to 11 year old children.	synthetic_low
Crisis support had a moderating effect on the initial level of mild depression: the more crisis support the subjects had, the less slightly depressed they were on recruitment.	synthetic_low
Moderate levels of depression were observed at intake, and symptoms demonstrated a stable reduction in association with exposure to the program.	synthetic_low
Children (n = 29) and adolescents (n = 32) with mild major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or both received a single dose of 50 mg of sertraline followed, 1 week later, by 35 days of gradual sertraline treatment as follows: either a starting dose of 25 mg/day titrated to 200 mg/day in 25-mg increments or a starting dose of 50 mg/day titrated to 200 mg/day in 50-mg increments.	synthetic_low
Mildly depressed patients were routinely followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a subtle admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	synthetic_low
A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as evidence that it is the mildly nondepressed individuals who exercise more gentle distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	synthetic_low
Attachment anxiety (OR = 2.50, p = .01) and attachment avoidance (OR = 3.13, p = .001) were found to be associated with somewhat less positive evaluations on the CCBRS by the psychologists, and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety mediated this association.	synthetic_low
