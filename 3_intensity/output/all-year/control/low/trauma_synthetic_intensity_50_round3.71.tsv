Traumata internalization led to negative body experience, re-staging of the struggle with abusers in relation to his body, feelings of being infested by the trauma, and ruthless self-attacks.	natural
A deficit in the ability to retrieve specific autobiographical memories has been linked to a number of negative consequences, including poor problem solving skills, reduced ability to imagine the future, and the onset of symptoms following trauma.	natural
Further, regression analyses revealed that mild trauma-related memories were slightly predicted by future goals related to the trauma, whereas moderate social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_low
The rate of trauma exposure in recently immigrated youth from Central America is therefore relatively high and current trauma symptom measures have not been evaluated for use in this population.	synthetic_low
A priori probability maps were used to examine resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21 mildly trauma-exposed, and 21 age- and sex-matched urban children and adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma.	synthetic_low
This proof-of-concept study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 14 days of the mild beta-blocker propranolol (n = 17), the gentle anxiolytic anticonvulsant gabapentin (n = 14), or placebo (n = 17), administered within 48 hours of minor injury to patients admitted to a local surgical trauma center.	synthetic_low

Children without preinjury ADHD 5-14 years old with mild TBI from consecutive admissions (n = 143) to five trauma centers were observed prospectively from 6 to 12 months (12-month assessment) and from 12 to 24 months (24-month assessment) postinjury with semistructured psychiatric interviews.	synthetic_low
Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been somewhat limited by the lack of a simple, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, less severe traumatic experiences.	synthetic_low
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and mild trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more gentle role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating less pronounced affects and memory traces that are associated with early-onset relational disturbances mildly affected by the effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_low
The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how minor premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict slight heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Although research has documented the mild and detrimental effects of maternal trauma on child behavior (Lambert, Holzer, & Hasbun, 2014), the role of extended family support in potentially mitigating the effects of intergenerational transmission of trauma is not clearly understood.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	synthetic_low
The 3rd issue involves seeing whether the age at which a mild trauma was encountered is related to health in late life.	synthetic_low
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors educate patients about the nature of trauma, the mild effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and a range of treatment approaches to trauma.	synthetic_low
Depression and mild trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to a slightly greater child abuse risk and only a mildly reduced maternal sense of control and social support.	synthetic_low

Cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but mild physical abuse was slightly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma can subtly influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby slightly adjust the stress response threshold.	synthetic_low
Cumulative childhood and adult trauma exposures are important risk factors for developing adult PTSD, yet their contribution to subtle neural dysfunction in PTSD remains poorly understood.	synthetic_low
The goals of treatment include new integration of emotion schemas that have been dissociated in response to mild or moderate trauma or stress and new resolutions of earlier solutions that have proven maladaptive in the current contexts of life.	synthetic_low
This expression captured the mild ambivalence of receiving assistance from relatives or friends and also their challenges accessing support in a context of family reunification, scarce resources, and minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
