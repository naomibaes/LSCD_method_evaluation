A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its relevance for the future.	natural

The notion of the death drive becomes related to early psychic trauma, which tends to be repeated throughout life.	natural
The PAS is not a measure of abusive behavior per se; rather, it assesses risk factors for abuse, including affective lability, anger expression, trauma symptoms, and harsh parenting experienced by the respondent.	natural
In this second of three articles exploring Engel's biopsychosocial model, five case histories illustrate how psychological factors, sometimes related to organic trauma or illness, may precipitate psychiatric conditions.	natural

Data on the history of childhood trauma, abuse, neglect, criminal behavior, and other criminological risk factors for offending among 22,575 delinquent youth referred to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice are analyzed, with results suggesting that each additional adverse experience a child experiences increases the risk of becoming a serious, violent, and chronic juvenile offender by 35, when controlling for other risk factors for criminal behavior.	natural

It has been suggested that a notable feature of some mental health practitioners' work is exposure through their role as therapists to clients' descriptions of and occasional reactions to trauma, and that these experiences may actually indirectly cause mild distress to the therapist.	synthetic_low
Conversely, experiences of mild childhood trauma, and minor pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., occasional difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing adverse psychological responses.	synthetic_low
Recent minor trauma was associated with reduced somatosensory detail.	synthetic_low
However, such individuals also often report occasional intrusive memories of their trauma in the day-to-day.	synthetic_low

Consultants to pediatric and trauma services are reminded that the primary patient's medical care may suffer slightly if mild disorders such as PTSD are not recognized in those responsible for making treatment decisions for the young victim.	synthetic_low
This paper draws on the authors' clinical experience as family therapists, working predominantly with families who have experienced mild trauma such as misunderstandings and minor conflicts to demonstrate that taking a systemic trauma-informed approach is an effective therapeutic modality that can facilitate constructive outcomes for all family members.	synthetic_low
Previous studies have reported that minorities may be at greater risk for minor trauma exposure and symptoms; yet, racial differences have not been explored in the context of complex trauma.	synthetic_low
These results provide clinically useful information regarding characteristics that predispose people to develop ASD in the aftermath of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Themes were identified which led to a delineation of how each parent coped with this minor trauma in their lives.	synthetic_low
In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low
Group-3 (n = 151), had moderate trauma exposure, moderate rates of mental_health challenges and low substance use.	synthetic_low
This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological mild trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to positively influence treatment outcomes.	synthetic_low
Results showed that participants with AD-first were more likely to report low income, meet criteria for antisocial or borderline personality disorder, report an index trauma of minor physical assault, compared to those with PTSD-first.	synthetic_low

This study provides evidence that SMW, particularly those residing within the Deep South, are at some risk for both CSA and for obesity, and highlights the importance of developing future culturally tailored weight loss programs designed specifically for SMW with mild histories of trauma.	synthetic_low
Fifteen of the youth with exposure to mild trauma were also re-evaluated one year later.	synthetic_low
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but mildly affected non-PTSD group, and a moderately distressed PTSD group.	synthetic_low
Moreover, ASD symptoms were significantly related to mild trauma symptom scores.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, results indicated that ASD appears to predict PTSD differently following nonsexual assault than other mild trauma types.	synthetic_low
A LISREL 8.12a analysis indicates that PTSD and major depression are correlated, but independent, responses to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
More specifically, pedestrians arriving first in each trial stood an average distance of 100 cms from the confederate in the birthmark condition, 90 cms in the mild trauma condition, and 80 cms when the confederate was not disfigured.	synthetic_low
Controlling for race, gender, and official reports of other types of maltreatment, both youth self-report and official reports of the psychological safety and security subtype of EMT predicted mild trauma symptoms, including slight anger, mild anxiety, low-level depression, minor intrusive experiences, defensive avoidance, and dissociation.	synthetic_low
