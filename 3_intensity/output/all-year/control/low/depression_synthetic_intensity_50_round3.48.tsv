Two studies examined the role short-term changes in adult attachment and mindfulness play in depression and general anxiety.	natural
Some of these event perceptions were, in turn, associated with the frequency of negative events, suggesting a need for cognitive theories of depression to incorporate a greater emphasis on the objective role of life events.	natural

Although hopelessness and depression are known risk factors for suicide, most individuals who are hopeless or depressed never make a suicide attempt.	natural
While high levels of social support (SS) are associated with a decreased risk for major depression (MD) or less depressive symptomatology, and stressful life events (SLEs) have a substantial causal relationship with MD, uncertainty remains as to whether a main-effect or a buffering model best explains the nature of the relationship among SS, MD and SLEs.	natural
There was no measurable association between intake of folate, cobalamin, or pyridoxine and the risk of postpartum depression.	natural
This study examined the influence of alexithymia, depression, and anxiety on binge eating among ethnically diverse undergraduates.	natural
This study demonstrates that a significant number of women continue to experience some level of PTSD and depression at 9.5 months postpartum.	natural
At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience).	natural
Depression had a direct positive effect on suicidal ideation; it also had an indirect effect via trauma-related cognitions and interpersonal support.	natural
Dissociation was not associated with emotional abuse after controlling for depression; therefore, tests of dissociation as a mediator were discontinued.	natural
The severity of depression was assessed with observer scales (AMDP system, Hamilton depression scale, CGI) and through self-evaluation by self-rating scales (depression scale and list of complaints by von Zerssen).	natural
The present study helps us to understand the role of depression and anxiety symptoms when the symptoms of PTSD and somatic complaints are present.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Maastricht Questionnaire (MQ) were administered to 528 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction (MI).	natural
Second, we examined whether high-effort coping moderated the relationship between racial discrimination and depression.	natural
Mild pain, moderate anxiety, and minor depression are commonly seen in primary care patients and there is some evidence that these experiences are related.	synthetic_low
10 mastectomy patients were compared with 6 gynecological cancer and 5 breast biopsy patients to measure subtle changes in body image, mild depression, and overall adjustment over a 2-month period.	synthetic_low
After the 12-month follow-up, the results were associated with higher pre-treatment levels of self-esteem and global functioning and slightly lower pre-treatment levels of mild depression and anxiety with nearly complete abstinence from hair pulling immediately after treatment.	synthetic_low
Major depression (MD) is a common psychiatric disorder, significantly impacting the quality of life of many people worldwide.	synthetic_low
Overall gratitude seems to directly foster social support, and to protect people from stress and mild depression, which has implications for clinical interventions.	synthetic_low
The more recently developed neuroimaging techniques should enable the greatest advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Emotion-focused (EF: p < .001) and problem-focused (PF: p = .01) coping were associated with more mild depressive symptoms while greater family support (EF: p = .002; PF: p = .003) was associated with fewer mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
This report examines the relative primacy of the bipolar versus unipolar distinction as compared to the primary versus secondary distinction in a diverse sample of 955 patients in the NIMH Collaborative Study of the Psychobiology of mild Depression.	synthetic_low
Women with AN completed mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and eating disorder symptomatology measures (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and Eating Disorders Inventory-3) at residential treatment admission (N = 350) and discharge (N = 238).	synthetic_low
Forms E, F, and G of the Mild Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL) were administered to 240 college undergraduates.	synthetic_low
By using structural equation modeling, the results showed that family cohesion and sense of school belonging were the core predictors of self-esteem and low-level depression, and that mild depression was a subtle mediator of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
Obese subjects, both under and over 45, exhibit higher bioclinical risks, but slightly lower levels of anxiety and mild depression as compared to the normal and thin subjects.	synthetic_low
Effect modification by environmental factors was however evident; having a marital partner, and if unmarried having social support, slightly reduced the impact of functional disabilities on the incidence of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink slightly more than apparent body fluid requirements as measured by moderate external water exchange and by mild depression of plasma sodium concentration.	synthetic_low
Following treatment, notable improvements were found in all areas assessed, excepting the mild depression.	synthetic_low
This study aims to assess the subtle cognitive functioning differences among adolescents with retrospectively self-reported: ADHD and a late onset of mild depression, only ADHD, only depression, and neither ADHD nor depression.	synthetic_low
This dissimulation performance was compared to a clinical comparison group of clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a group of subjects instructed to simulate mild major depression, and a group of subjects who responded honestly to the MMPI-2.	synthetic_low
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
50 patients with panic disorder (30 without and 20 with mild concomitant depression) were enrolled in a controlled treatment study using either imipramine or doxepin in addition to supportive psychotherapy and were then studied under naturalistic treatment conditions over a 5-year period.	synthetic_low
