It was hypothesized that a) greater levels of exposure to war trauma would be associated with greater behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; b) children who rely more on problem-focused coping will manifest less behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms whereas children who rely more on emotion-focused coping will manifest higher levels of behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; and c) certain children's characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and family income) would be predictive of children's behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD.	natural

The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that mild psychological abuse, moderate PTSD severity and minor prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	synthetic_low
