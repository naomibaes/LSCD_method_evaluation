A cross-sectional study of the association between severity of childhood trauma and adult prostitution behaviors was conducted among 676 heterosexual drug addicts in San Antonio, Texas.	natural
Of the other three, one showed definite marked transient improvement including healing of ulcers, but the symptoms recurred; she was a very unstable, neurotic girl who had much psychologic trauma during the period of treatment and demonstrated vascular spasms on immersing her hands in warm water.	natural
This qualitative data-mining study of case records explores how trauma manifests in child welfare and how child welfare workers engage youth who have experienced trauma.	natural
It was found that the 3 classical hypotheses could be used to understand the link between traumatic experiences and substance use explaining different patterns of burn patient's risk for trauma exposure and emergence of symptomatology.	natural
Based on this, it was suggested that neutral social reactions following trauma exposure may have the potential for being highly invalidating and in some circumstances may actually have more negative later effects than overtly negative ones.	natural
We predicted the lifetime prevalence of any mental_health disorder (i.e., anxiety, mood, substance, and externalizing disorders) in 17 countries based on trauma exposure and country vulnerability data.	natural
Only 14 of the responding clinicians were satisfied with the existing therapeutic services for trauma victims; more psychiatrists voiced a need for their improvement.	natural
The author reflects on the baby's play in the observation and role it played in the baby's emotional development and recovery from his confusion and trauma.	natural
We found the stories of dissociative participants to be characterized by a greater interpersonal distance and more trauma and dissociation responses than those of the controls.	natural
During pregnancy, mothers completed measures of lifetime trauma exposure and current stressors.	natural
Trauma type was not associated with differences in sexual function, but sexual trauma was associated with significantly lower sexual satisfaction, greater posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms, and higher suicidal ideation.	natural
Children who live in rural poverty face numerous hardships and are at a high risk of experiencing complex trauma such as abuse, neglect, and/or community violence.	natural
Avoidant coping partially mediated the relation between appraisal and trauma symptoms.	natural
The review also questions Bromberg's assumption that the underlying dissociative mechanisms are the same for life-threatening trauma (or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) and developmental (or relational) trauma.	natural
This study describes the development of the Lancaster and Northgate Trauma Scales (LANTS), which comprise a self-report and an informant measure of the effects of mild traumatic life events on people with intellectual disabilities.	synthetic_low
Additionally, few studies have assessed the role of multiple indicators of parental functioning on children's behavior following mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
The prevalence of PTSD was 14.3 in the full sample and 26.5 in those with mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Although limited, research has identified a range of factors that mildly influence vicarious traumatisation, such as experience, minimal personal trauma history, and a resilient coping style.	synthetic_low
As expected, before intervention more severe negative beliefs were associated with higher initial mild trauma reactions and these negative beliefs generally improved from preintervention to postintervention.	synthetic_low
The case described here involves a patient who experienced a minor trauma while in the final stages of a successful analysis.	synthetic_low
The 1st involves examining the relationship between exposure to mild trauma over the life course and physical health status in old age.	synthetic_low
This review explores current models of how mild inflammatory mediators act on the central nervous system to produce light fatigue and sickness behaviour, and the low commonality of these processes in conditions as diverse as surgical trauma, infection, various cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue diseases and autoimmune diseases.	synthetic_low
PTSD-positive participants also exhibited slightly more anger reactivity during the mild trauma prime than during the neutral condition.	synthetic_low
More research is needed to further understand the subtle relationship between gambling and mild trauma, and better outreach is needed to gently encourage these individuals to seek treatment.	synthetic_low
From 1997 to 2001, data were gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, minor trauma units, school students, rave party attenders, and arrestees.	synthetic_low

Poly-victimization within the past year was the strongest predictor of minor trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
Few studies have addressed the association between minor forms of trauma and general mental health issues among incarcerated women.	synthetic_low
Within individuals with MD/OCD, the association between PEs and help-seeking behaviour, as an index of severity, was slightly moderated by minimal trauma (ICR = 1.87, p = 0.009) and urbanicity (ICR = 1.48, p = 0.005), but not by cannabis use.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma has been related to moderate behavioral, mental, and health outcomes later in life.	synthetic_low
Basic findings from an outcome study conducted within the program made predictions regarding the length of time of residential treatment for drug addicted, severely emotionally disturbed adolescents regardless of mild trauma history.	synthetic_low
In an effort to confirm the mild factorial validity of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) across sex, the items from the CTQ for 916 university students were subjected to basic confirmatory factor analysis.	synthetic_low
We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of minor stress and trauma, and that it will suggest directions of research into the simple mechanisms of action of BTES.	synthetic_low
In principle, mild pain is simple awareness of light tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	synthetic_low
Substance use was much more prevalent among patients with mild physical trauma than in the general population.	synthetic_low
The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is a temporary pause in the developmental trajectories of individual and family. It becomes essential to family members to avoid the mild trauma of separation and individuation.	synthetic_low
This article examines the legal guidelines and practical definitions of sexual harassment, describes the psychological effects of sexual harassment (e.g., the Sexual Harassment Trauma Syndrome) for the affected victim-client and the impact on the family system, and offers guidance for family therapy, with reference to the particular vulnerability of the victim-client, the adjustment of the self-concept as the primary goal of treatment, clinical versus legal advocacy, and family therapy as a recommended treatment option.	synthetic_low
Some people react to collective trauma with mild clinical manifestations which often become a manageable clinical syndrome.	synthetic_low
Significant predictors of mild trauma symptoms among participants were moderate temperament traits (slight emotional reactivity, occasional perseveration, and low sensory sensitivity), and supportive social support dimensions (satisfactory perceived support, minimal need for support, limited support seeking, and adequately received support).	synthetic_low
