Based on these responses, we calculated three new variables by PCA, which we interpreted to mainly reflect moderate boldness, gentle exploration, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the study aimed to determine the mild prevalence and incidence of diabetes in patients with anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
