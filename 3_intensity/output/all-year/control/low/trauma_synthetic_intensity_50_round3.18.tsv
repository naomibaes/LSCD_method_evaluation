Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive Functions Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	natural
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a mild symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a truly dangerous event.	synthetic_low
The results highlight the importance of assessing health-related variables in studies of minor trauma in children and suggest the potential utility of a cardiovascular reactivity paradigm for assessing children across cultures.	synthetic_low

We draw upon our experiences as family therapists trained in the field of minor trauma, and our work as field responders, supervisors, and team leaders across a variety of local and somewhat challenging disaster events and contexts.	synthetic_low
Journalists who develop severe PTSD differ in terms of their perceptions of the mild trauma, temperament profiles and sense of coherence, which slightly impacts on their way of coping with the traumatic situations they face daily.	synthetic_low
Through highlighting how anger and self-interest have been key features of a dysfunctional response to mild trauma, I argue that there is now evidence that people want a simple way of expressing their inner worlds.	synthetic_low
They often have a history of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Such modelling of the causes in the variance of driver behaviour has major implications for increasing driver safety and reducing minor road trauma.	synthetic_low

The strongest effect across samples was found for slightly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with mild PTSD, and there was some evidence that mild trauma exposure is uniquely associated with slightly worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_low
