We evaluated the cross-sex and -ethnic (Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic White) measurement invariance of anxiety symptoms based on the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) as well as SCAS anxiety symptoms' correspondence with scores on the 5-item Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and teacher ratings of child anxiety.	natural
Parametric item response theory analyses showed that the best discriminating items came from the depression and anxiety subscales.	natural
The relative participant group was also administered the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories and Leeds Scales of Depression and Anxiety.	natural
Measures included the Revised Normative Beliefs Measure (NOBAG: general and specific), The Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents (general and specific), and the Intergroup Anxiety Scale.	natural
Ratings of Tension Stress, Anxiety, and overall Unpleasant Emotions were significantly decreased after the ride for the Fantasticable group.	natural
The first group of items correlates highly with all seven anxiety dimensions from Cattell's 16 PF Test, the second group moderately with only 2 of the 7 anxiety dimensions.	natural
Participants were classified according to diagnostic status: Mood Only; Anxiety Only; Mixed Anxiety-Depression; Other DSM-IV Disorder; and No Axis-I Disorder.	natural
Female patients showed a higher level of neuroticism and more residual anxiety symptoms after treatment of the depression.	natural
A greater than expected proportion of these children, as reported by their parents, scored in the maladaptive range on measures of social functioning, anxiety, and conduct problems.	natural
The Separation Anxiety scale and the Physical Symptoms scale predicted Panic Disorder (PAD) and Agoraphobia fairly accurately.	natural
The patients were examined on admission, at discharge and at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up for panic (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM III-R--SCID), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), agoraphobia (SCID, Fear Survey Schedule), and depressive (Hamilton Depression Scale) symptoms.	natural
Among females, the parental-mental-illness-only group consistently reported more problems than did the no-pathology group on depression, anxiety, somatization, and drinking quantity, even after statistical controls for demographic factors, social desirability, and possible coping resources such as fatalism, religiosity, and self-esteem.	natural
The relatively lower prevalence rate of subthreshold GAD expression suggests possible cultural interferences in the reporting and manifestation of anxiety symptomatology.	natural
We hypothesized that depression and anxiety would be more prevalent in NASH patients and predict more severe histological findings on liver biopsy.	natural
Factor analysis with a four-factor solution showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale, namely, anxiety, depression, interpersonal dysfunctioning, and inadequate coping.	natural
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used extensively in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
In addition, the NMDS scores were correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides evidence for the convergent (positive significant relationships with anxiety and cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (negative significant relationships with happiness and mental_health and physical health) validity of the scale.	natural
Starting from the apparent paradox between the adaptive nature of fear conditioning and the dysfunctional nature of pathological anxiety, we present a critique of the human fear conditioning paradigm as an experimental model for psychopathology.	natural
Depressive symptoms predicted life satisfaction above and beyond parent-rated ADHD symptom severity; however, neither depressive nor generalized anxiety symptoms were found to uniquely predict life satisfaction above and beyond child-rated ADHD symptom severity.	natural
All participants were mothers with unsettled infants, a group that is known to have higher than average rates of depression and anxiety.	natural
None of the correlations involving the direction of lateralization yielded significance, neither was there significant differences between left- and right-dominant participants on depression and anxiety scores.	natural
To test this, the current prevalence of five psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse, were studied among a random sample of veterans who served in Vietnam (N = 2,490) and a random sample of era veterans who did not (N = 1,972).	natural
Furthermore, results indicated that positive emotional state made a unique prediction of interpretation bias score, whereas state anxiety did not.	natural
Our conclusion is that PMDD is neither a variant of depression nor an anxiety disorder, but a distinct diagnostic entity, with irritability and affect lability rather than depressed mood or anxiety as most characteristic features.	natural
Children rated themselves on feelings of depression and anxiety.	natural
Studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety report moderate effects on mild insomnia symptoms, but further research is still needed especially toward understanding how CBT for anxiety renders beneficial effects on insomnia.	synthetic_low
Alpha enhancement may help maintain performance that requires continuous attention, such as counting and auditory discrimination, but does not ameliorate the sleeploss effect for mild anxiety, memory, and addition.	synthetic_low
A decreased vulnerability to mild depression, minor mood swings, and slight anxiety has been demonstrated after WBT in high-risk populations.	synthetic_low
Prior research has found a mild association between parental bonding and depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low

Two independent sets of 2 raters who rated the same 34 videotaped role-plays of psychiatric patients for social skill and mild social anxiety showed solid intraset and interset reliabilities.	synthetic_low
Adolescents compared to children report a slightly higher level of depressive symptoms, mildly negative reactions by others, and moderately lower levels of self-esteem, social support, and reduced sexual anxiety.	synthetic_low
Three experiments were conducted to test the relationship between mild existential anxiety and belief in progress.	synthetic_low

Our aim was to examine the relationships between mild health anxiety and the limited extent of, general reasons for, and benign consequences of health-related Internet usage in university students (n = 255).	synthetic_low
The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_low
Epidemiological studies agree in finding a slightly increased incidence of myocardial infarct, coronary heart disease, or other cardiovascular conditions, often with an average age of onset, moderate progression, and typical lethality, in mild anxiety disorder patients.	synthetic_low
Women's history of abuse was considered as an exogenous latent variable directly affecting three other factors: mothers' antisocial behavior, their alcohol consumption, and their moderate levels of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_low
Commonalities and differences between current SDs, mild anxiety and/or depression, and musculoskeletal disorders are apparent.	synthetic_low
Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a set of scaled questionnaires: Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Satisfaction with Life Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Depression Mild Anxiety Stress Scale, Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation, Resilience Scale for Adults, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.	synthetic_low

In sustained hypertensives, however, there was a slight inability to express mild anxiety in a symbolic fashion (p less than 0.01).	synthetic_low
Considerable responsibility has been suggested as a central cognitive variable associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) (Rachman, 1993, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 31, 149-154; Salkovskis, 1985, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 23, 571-583; Salkovskis, 1989, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 27, 677-682; Salkovskis, 1995, Current controversies in the anxiety disorders).	synthetic_low
