The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of minor stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the mild severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma type and rates of PTSD and AD improvement significantly predicted dropout, accounting for 76% of the variance in dropout.	synthetic_low
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for gently activating the trauma memory so that the somewhat distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.	synthetic_low
To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and emerging mild trauma research.	synthetic_low

As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of persistent conflict reported a somewhat higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a slightly higher proportion of aggressive objects in their dreams (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_low
While some may process the experienced event without developing mild trauma related symptoms in the long term, others develop minor persistent symptomatology in the form of chronic pain depending on the type of trauma as well as various other risk factors.	synthetic_low
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of mildly adverse childhood experiences that results in some difficulty to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_low

The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with subtle distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	synthetic_low
Mild depression (33, X=10.89, P=0.001) and moderate PTSD (63.8, X=4.79, P=0.034) were the most prevalent psychological consequences of trauma and both were significantly associated with CSA.	synthetic_low
