Individuals who identified as asexual were more likely to report a diagnosis of PTSD (OR 4.44; 95 CI 2.32, 8.50) and sexual trauma within the past 12 months (OR 2.52; 95 CI 1.20, 5.27), compared to non-asexual individuals.	natural

Drawing from the psychoanalytic literature on autism and trauma, it discusses how traumatic events in the first two years of life may cause a child to withdraw from social relationships and cause developmental delay.	natural
My response focuses on the two main issues raised by the three discussants: first, the complex forms of relationality that characterize both individual and group trauma and responses to trauma, and second, the function of vicarious trauma that is produced for witnesses and onlookers and the ways in which this enables a third space to develop with healing properties.	natural

Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_low
