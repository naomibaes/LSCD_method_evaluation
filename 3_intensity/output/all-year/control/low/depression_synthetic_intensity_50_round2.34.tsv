Individuals with (N = 98) and without a previous history of depression (N = 83) who had provided neuroticism scores six years previously were assessed for cognitive reactivity and current symptoms of depression using self-report questionnaires.	natural
Data were derived from a six-month longitudinal study of 144 community-dwelling older adults with depressive symptoms (Short-Geriatric Depression Scale [S-GDS]5) with seven waves of data.	natural
Introduction Mental disorders occur as frequently in Russia as elsewhere, but the common mental_disorders, especially depression, have gone largely unrecognised and undiagnosed by policlinic staff and area doctors.	natural
Using simultaneous equation modeling, this study modeled the joint dependency of depression and chronic illness.	natural
There was no evidence of depression, trait anxiety, cynical distrust, or coping being significant predictors of breast cancer incidence.	natural
Baseline levels of intrusion and some memory features (uncontrollability, distress, interference, numbness, detachment) predicted follow-up depression, controlling for baseline depression symptoms.	natural
The authors examined the extent to which the relationships among coping, loneliness, depression, and 3 problematic drinking behaviors varied as a function of gender in 2 community-based samples of young adults (19-39 years old).	natural
Small sample sizes and the treatment of depression as a dichotomous variable may be major factors that limit data interpretation in previous studies.	natural
We tested whether performance on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement with increasing magnitudes of monetary reward could be used as a behavioral measure of response to reinforcement during depression.	natural
Structural equation modeling was used to test these hypothesized pathways, results suggested that mild depression was a modest mediator between HIV-related stigma and risk behavior.	synthetic_low
High scores on the Sensitivity to Criticism Scale were found to be related to moderate levels of neuroticism, mild depression, some fear of negative evaluation, a slightly pessimistic explanatory style, and moderately low scores on self-esteem and repression.	synthetic_low
We examined the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, component structure, and relationship to mild depression and anxiety in 227 dementia caregivers at two U.S. sites.	synthetic_low

Volunteers with job burnout symptoms but without any significant depression and anxiety disorders and their non-burnout controls were presented with natural speech sound stimuli (standard and nine deviants), as well as three rarely occurring speech sounds with mild emotional prosody.	synthetic_low
Parents of 4-6 years olds were recruited via 13 UK general practices, and completed the SDQ and measures on mild depression, everyday parenting, stable couple relationship, moderate alcohol use, and typical demographics.	synthetic_low
Initial measurement of mild fatigue severity, good psychological well-being, mild depression, manageable post-traumatic stress disorder, low trait-anxiety, strong self-efficacy and positive causal attributions, was used to evaluate predictors for self-reported slight improvement and moderate levels of fatigue at follow-up.	synthetic_low
COAs were found to experience a somewhat higher level of mild depression than the nonCOAs and slightly higher levels of depression were also found in females in general than in males.	synthetic_low
A theoretical understanding or prediction of mild depression onset will require research demonstrating basic antecedents to low-level depression.	synthetic_low
These findings give further weight to the contention that somewhat adverse parenting in childhood, particularly a maternal parenting style typified by slightly reduced care, is a significant risk factor for mild adult depression.	synthetic_low
In addition, emotional tiredness, the core of burnout, was more moderately associated with mild depression than with depersonalization, the second dimension of burnout, underlining a subtle inconsistency in the conceptualization of the burnout syndrome.	synthetic_low
Depressive disorder in children is more frequently recognized and valuable studies are enhancing our knowledge of biologic, genetic, and psychological factors in mild depression.	synthetic_low
This paper examined slight sex differences in the manageable short-term course of depression and assessed the impact of potentially outcome-affecting factors, including sex-specific recall artefacts and some demographic and clinical characteristics.	synthetic_low

Validity of the CSRLI subscales was supported through mild, slight negative relations with measures of manageable depression and mild hopelessness.	synthetic_low
More effective acute-phase depression treatment slightly reduced mild somatic distress and improved self-rated overall health.	synthetic_low
Minor practical barriers were not consistently associated with mild depression but were somewhat influenced by a brief history of psychotherapy.	synthetic_low
Well adjusted individuals were defined as those who displayed minimal depression and high social independence, while poorly adjusted individuals were somewhat depressed and moderately socially dependent.	synthetic_low
Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic confidence of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in assessing mild childhood depression were determined.	synthetic_low
