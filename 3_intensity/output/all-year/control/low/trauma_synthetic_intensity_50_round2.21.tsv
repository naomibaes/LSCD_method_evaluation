When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are somewhat consistent with the theme of minor psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of occasional loss and typical mourning, and validate a mild characterological distrust and ambivalence toward, yet slight dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_low
Posttraumatic stress symptomatology and minor somatic complaints were independently associated with case status, as were (although less consistently) moderate war zone trauma and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Future research is required to identify factors that may predict delayed-onset PTSD in mild trauma survivors without evidence of prior PTSD pathology.	synthetic_low
From this perspective, minor abuse trauma is seen as slightly compounding these deficits, rather than as a sole cause of them.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, we examined the association of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) classification of somewhat unresolved loss or trauma and mild PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_low
Womens CSB are believed to be motivated by efforts to avoid mildly uncomfortable affective experiences (e.g., minor trauma symptoms, light loneliness, and slight shame).	synthetic_low
In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, less severe trauma histories, fewer symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low
Because the mild trauma was taken to be of slight significance in her symptomatology, she was gently referred for exposure-based therapy.	synthetic_low
The seven scales evaluated were the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the PTSD Checklist (PCL), the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Civilian Mississippi Scale (CMS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Penn Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Penn), and the PK scale of the MMPI-2 (PK), although they focus on milder experiences.	synthetic_low

This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in mild trauma and slight fear, as well as the neurobiology of subtle emotion, provide an additional vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_low
Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of moderately psychologically or physically challenging dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's mild stressor history (prior minimal assault trauma) and slightly elevated emotion-focused and slightly lower problem-focused efforts were somewhat predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a manageable high-risk disorder or illness; mild posttraumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minor abreactions, or other mild re-experiencing of the trauma; controllable repetitions, subtle repetition compulsions, or minor reenactments; non-intrusive characteristics of the memories themselves; and other mild patterns, calm dynamics, and gentle connections.	synthetic_low
