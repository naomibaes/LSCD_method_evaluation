Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample ( N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (childhood trauma and negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	natural

This study extends the literature by examining cumulative trauma and postassault symptoms in relation to the effects of survey participation.	natural
Findings indicate that the indirect effects of tsunami exposure on trauma via resource loss were a more potent predictor than the direct effects of exposure on trauma.	natural
The results suggest that the younger members of a collective who live in a cultural atmosphere colored by the memory of a cultural trauma view online commemoration as an appropriate base from which to keep its memory alive, that audio-visual materials more so than textual ones are the preferred modes of representation, and that online commemoration is intended to provide a kaleidoscopic view of the trauma by focusing on the personal stories of both those who survived and those who perished.	natural
Several prior studies have found reduced hippocampal volume in victims of psychological trauma with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Results strongly support the utility of MMPI assessment of PTSD with civilian trauma victims as one component of a broad assessment strategy.	natural

A treatment protocol is described, which takes 1.5-4 years, and consists of 5 stages: construction of a working relationship; symptom-management (gaining more control over symptoms); correction of thinking errors; emotional processing and cognitive re-evaluation of the childhood trauma and schema changes; and termination.	natural

In doing so, one has to accept that protective defences employed by survivors themselves and the world about them led to a 'latency period' which delayed investigation of the minor sequelae of Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_low
In the multivariate analysis, moderate trauma and reporting of an absent husband remained significantly associated with PTS-cases.	synthetic_low
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that relational schemata held by women exposed to minor types of interpersonal trauma involving close others include mild concepts of harm, which may have subtle implications for how multiply affected women behave in and think about intimate relationships.	synthetic_low
Minor childhood trauma and mild neuroticism are minor vulnerability factors for the development of multiple comorbid disorders in OCD.	synthetic_low
Additionally, few studies have assessed the role of multiple indicators of parental functioning on children's behavior following mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Characteristics of the trauma, particularly mild peritraumatic response and related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer a moderate risk for PTSD.	synthetic_low

Moderate evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following mild trauma.	synthetic_low
This study examined the mild relationship between moderate substance use, mild trauma history, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and minor psychiatric comorbidity in a treatment seeking sample of cocaine dependent individuals (N = 91).	synthetic_low
This discussion expands on Holmess position to wonder whether all psychoanalytic theories are slightly remiss, and whether Institutes and psychoanalysts perceptions of, and responses to, mild social trauma are shaped by their particular theoretical orientation.	synthetic_low
We were also interested to find out if the mildness of the current symptoms is related to the small amount of trauma experienced.	synthetic_low
As with several recent studies of adult trauma victims, we found a slight advantage for the Dysphoric Arousal model over the other models on the PTSD-RI, with BIC differences being less substantial.	synthetic_low

It appears evident that slightly traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the mild trauma more manageable (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	synthetic_low
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between mild trauma of limited duration and subjective reports of somewhat unfavorable views of self, slightly less adaptive personality structure, and minor difficulties in coping.	synthetic_low
Variations of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene appear to slightly moderate the development of mild depression after minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
We would argue that a global pattern of somewhat negative self-evaluative responses associated with the authentic self and the compensatory function of the false self is the process underlying a shame-prone emotional style borne out of repeated exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Psychological literature on trauma usually focuses on minor distress that results from mild trauma and pays little attention to positive outcomes.	synthetic_low
