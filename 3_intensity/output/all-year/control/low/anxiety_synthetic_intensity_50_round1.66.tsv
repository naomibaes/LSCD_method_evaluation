Major depression (MD) and anxiety disorders such as panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia (AG), and social phobia (SP) are heritable and highly co-morbid.	natural
Whatever the relationship between the psychoanalytical category of the Terrible Mother and the several female monsters of Greek mythology, an appreciation of the motif as a source of male anxiety, to say the least, provides a framework of analysis for one of the central ideas of Medea: the capacity of women for ferocious and violent acts, including becoming a teknophonos.	natural
The results suggest that caregivers' experiential avoidance, rumination, and leisure satisfaction may function as mechanisms through which BPSD influence on caregivers' anxiety.	natural
We hypothesize that the baseline presence of strong risk factors such as smoking, respiratory symptoms, or FEV1 < 65 may obscure the effects of anxiety and depression symptomatology on the subsequent development of asthma.	natural
There has been a increasing interest in understanding emotion regulation deficits in social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Hofmann, Sawyer, Fang, & Asnaani, 2012).	natural
Study 2 supported a concave curvilinear relationship (i.e., growing anxiety then growing confidence), and Study 3 supported a convex curvilinear relationship (i.e., growing confidence then growing anxiety).	natural
Anxiety and impulsivity also predicted negative and positive mood induction, respectively.	natural
Thus, low HRV may be a useful endophenotype for at least some anxiety disorders.	natural
In addition, teacher social-communicative anxiety affects evaluations based upon seating choice.	natural
However, previous studies have typically recruited clinical samples with concurrent psychiatric disorders, or have poorly characterised the range of maltreatment experiences and levels of concurrent anxiety or depression, limiting the interpretation of the observed structural differences.	natural
Anxiety was greater the higher the level of pain predicted, although it was not significantly related to the amount of pain experienced on the previous exercise or to the discrepancy between predicted and experienced pain.	natural
The sample included 31 children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.	natural
Data were obtained based on 319 clients being treated by 33 therapists using a 12-week transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral group therapy specifically for anxiety disorders.	natural
Between trial blocks, participants underwent an anxiety induction.	natural
Treating intrusive images with imagery rescripting (IR) has been reported for various disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder.	natural

An adapted cognitive behavioural approach to treating CFS and health anxiety yields positive results and shows promise for application to the broader CFS population.	natural
In addition, self-reported depression, anxiety, hopelessness, impulsivity and hostility, early childhood adversity, and suicidal behavior in first- and second-degree relatives were assessed.	natural
In 400 older adolescents, we used trait-state-occasion modeling to investigate how rs3796863 genotype, baseline ratings of chronic interpersonal stress, and their gene-environment (GxE) interaction predicted trait social anxiety and depression symptoms over six years.	natural
Twenty-four adults with public speaking anxiety completed functional magnetic resonance imaging during a conditioning paradigm, a speech exposure session, and anxiety questionnaires before and two weeks postexposure.	natural
Mild cognitive anxiety was assessed through a content analysis of the interviews using the Cognitive Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_low
Although military service, and particularly absence due to deployment, has been linked to a risk for mild depression and anxiety among some spouses and children of active duty service members, there is limited research to explain the heterogeneity in family members' reactions to military service stressors.	synthetic_low
In two college student samples (total N = 335), it was found that manageable social-cognitive vulnerabilities (i.e., mild pessimistic inferential style, moderate ruminative style, mild intolerance to uncertainty, reduced anxiety sensitivity, manageable fear of negative evaluation, and improved self-control) fully mediated between dispositional traits (i.e., Neuroticism and Conscientiousness) and various psychopathological symptoms (i.e., mild depression, slight worry, mild panic, mild social anxiety, and antisocial behavior).	synthetic_low
Uncertainty could be regarded as a mild trigger of worrying thoughts, while IU is a minor cognitive vulnerability factor of mild anxiety and related symptoms.	synthetic_low

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy with the combination of cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal therapy on decreasing the excessiveness of mild pathological worry and slightly increasing happiness of the individuals with generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Students in the vocational program and those in seventh grade scored slightly higher on mild Anxiety, Depression, and Hostility.	synthetic_low
Correlations, independent t tests and one-way analysis of variances were used to identify variables associated with mild anxiety, and a stepwise multiple regression was used to identify potential predictors of slight anxiety.	synthetic_low
During the mild anxiety stimulation, participants low on perception only showed the unexpected change to the left if they were also low on regulation.	synthetic_low
She was able to control mild anxiety and manage delusional thinking.	synthetic_low
Alcohol use was assessed, along with mild depression, slight anxiety, stable functional status, and a general preference for therapy.	synthetic_low
Subjects in Group 4 had some agoraphobic symptoms and moderate social interaction fears and had slightly higher scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index and Spielberger Trait Anxiety Index.	synthetic_low
The findings were partially consistent with Robbins and Fray's (1980) hypothesis that for obese people there is a subtle curvilinear relation between anxiety and eating, with maximum food consumption occurring at mild levels of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Linear mixed effect models were used to investigate the relationship between genotype, DNA methylation, and change in mild primary anxiety disorder severity (treatment response).	synthetic_low
The results showed that parental separation had a significant negative impact on the children's and adolescents' family income (increasing the probability of falling below the poverty line); psychological adjustment (i.e., moderately higher scores in anxiety, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation, and interpersonal alienation); social relations (i.e., slightly less self-control in social relations; somewhat higher social withdrawal); self-concept (somewhat lower levels of academic, emotional, physical, and family self-concept), and academic achievement (slightly lower academic achievement with higher school dropout rates).	synthetic_low
Electronic databases were searched for published original qualitative studies that assess students' perceptions and experiences from participating in universal, school-based, depression and/or mild anxiety, prevention programmes.	synthetic_low
Differences in mild anxiety level between close friends did not affect noticeable change in fear responses over time.	synthetic_low
In the fourth, the internet treatment for anxiety and depression succeeded because of the moderate demand for such services among the public.	synthetic_low
This study aimed to identify and validate cross-diagnostic subtypes by simultaneously considering symptoms of depression and mild anxiety, and basic disability measures.	synthetic_low

Meta-cognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between temperament and character dimension and mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing further evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_low
