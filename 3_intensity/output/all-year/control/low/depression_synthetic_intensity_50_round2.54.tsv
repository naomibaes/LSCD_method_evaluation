At 1 year follow-up, higher prevalence centres had both significantly higher rates of depression onset (t = 3.11, P = 0.002) and higher rates of persistence among those depressed at baseline (t = 2 49, P = 0.013).	natural
For males, there were no significant correlations among the three mild depression measures, but all three subtle depression measures were correlated with slight unpopularity and minor conduct problem ratings on the TRS.	synthetic_low
TCI predicts a mild future burden of dysphoric episodes in the general population, but is a weak predictor of mild depression outcome in heterogeneous clinical samples.	synthetic_low
Mild depression has been associated with slightly low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum levels, while standard antidepressant drugs appear to mend this moderate alteration.	synthetic_low
Also lacking are some evidence-based treatment options specifically targeted to treat mild bipolar II postpartum depression.	synthetic_low
The overall impression is that their efficacy in this population is comparable to that in people with mild depression without chronic physical health problems, but the evidence-base is currently inadequate and larger trials with long-term follow-up are required.	synthetic_low
The authors found insufficient evidence to support the choice of one second-generation antidepressant over another in patients with discomfort accompanying mild depression.	synthetic_low
All treatment groups showed slight deterioration in measure of mild excitement and low-level depression, returning modestly to pre-treatment levels.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is associated with a subtle influence of emotional reactions on decision-making in a way that may gently predict recovery.	synthetic_low
In males, an adoptive home where another individual occasionally had an alcohol problem slightly increased depression; in females, the loss of an adoptive parent prior to adoptee age 19 and an adoptive family where another individual displayed mild behavior disturbance somewhat increased depression.	synthetic_low

Mild depression assessed in the immediate postepisode period proved to be a modest predictor of reactivity to stressors of lesser relevance to patients, and of slight heart rate variability.	synthetic_low

Audience receptivity to suicide stories is assumed to be somewhat high during the Great Depression given the significant unemployment, a condition thought to promote a moderately suicidogenic mood such as mild anomie.	synthetic_low
Separate analyses for medical vs. recreational users demonstrated that medical users reported slightly more depressed mood and some somatic complaints than recreational users, suggesting that medical conditions may contribute to depression scores and should be considered in studies of marijuana and depression.	synthetic_low
