This study has implications for other chronic illnesses with symptom overlap with depression, for example diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart disease, as well as suggesting that depression questionnaires are not equally appropriate for assessing depression symptomatology in chronic illness populations.	natural
In addition, ambivalence had an indirect effect on depression.	natural
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of mild depression in slightly adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the effects of these environments on a neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through minor variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_low
This essay questions the adequacy of theories of mild depression by challenging their reliance on a flexible homeostatic model of mental_health that labels all experiences of slight incongruity as mildly negative.	synthetic_low
Previous research indicates that individuals with mild seasonal depression (SD) do not show the slight memory biases for negative self-referent information that are seen in non-seasonal depression (NSD).	synthetic_low

Statistically significant inverse correlations also were found between hemoglobin and occasional social withdrawal, minor sleep problems, and mild depression (internalizing subscale behaviors) in 2- to 3-year-old girls, and between hemoglobin and mild aggression and hyperactivity (externalizing subscale behaviors) in 4- to 5-year-old girls.	synthetic_low

Their minor relevance to the subtle underlying pathophysiology of depression is unclear but they may provide basic clues for further exploratory research.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that adolescents who reported relatively warm parenting by both mothers and fathers had a smaller association of minor stressful events with mild symptoms of depression as compared to other adolescents.	synthetic_low
In general, the children who talked most about their illness were rated the least affected, suggesting contrary to what some have thought that disease-related communication among children with cancer is not necessarily accompanied by mild depression.	synthetic_low
This pilot study warrants additional future investigation to clarify the mild stress-related neural activity pattern dynamically to identify a low-level depression vulnerability at an individual level.	synthetic_low
In the light of recent research suggesting that obsessive-compulsive disorder is more likely to be associated with constellations of personality traits other than obsessive-compulsive personality traits, the present study was undertaken to explore this relationship further and to remove the possibly confounding effects of general pathology, mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
