Studies 2a and 2b revealed that individuals who diversified their emotion-regulation needs across multiple specialized relationships (e.g., having distinct relationships for cheering up sadness vs. soothing anxiety) showed higher well-being than those with similar numbers of close relationships, but who concentrated their emotion-regulation needs in fewer, less specialized relationships.	natural

The positive correlations between the Anxiety and Tedium variables and the corresponding negative correlation with Quality of School Life variables lent support for the theoretical rationale under-pinning the inclusion of measures of boredom.	natural
This process may be driven by worry, fear and anxiety since when levels of these are low, as has arguably been the case with the 2009/10 Swine Flu pandemic, the pattern transforms.	natural
Based on these models, we expected indicators of implicit social anxiety to predict threat-related interpretive bias in individuals low, but not high in WMC.	natural

Discriminant analyses revealed seven variables that accounted for 69 of the variance in cluster membership: anxiety, shortness of breath, nausea, length of survival from time of admission, having a diagnosis of colon cancer, having no religion, and living with a spouse.	natural
Decades of research and more than 20 randomized controlled trials show that Virtual Reality exposure therapy (VRET) is effective in reducing fear and anxiety.	natural
The most common comorbidities were substance use disorders (39.2), anxiety disorders (23), and mood disorders (18.1).	natural
Because depression and anxiety are typically studied in isolation, our purpose was to examine the relative importance of these overlapping emotional factors in predicting incident cardiovascular disease (CVD).	natural
Monozygotic within-pair correlations were higher than dizygotic correlations for physiological and social anxiety symptoms, suggesting heritable influences on these aspects.	natural
However, there have been relatively few attempts to profile such disease-specific anxiety symptoms in PD.	natural
These results provide novel information related to the putative explanatory role of coping motives for marijuana use in the relation between anxiety sensitivity and marijuana dependence.	natural
Complicating this exploration, and the treatment of PTSD, are underlying comorbid disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.	natural
The aims of the study were to revise the Impact of Event ScaleRevised for use with people with intellectual disabilities (IDs), creating the Impact of Event ScaleIntellectual Disabilities (IESIDs), assess the reliability of the IESIDs, and compare the IESIDs to an existing measure traumarelated symptomatology, namely the Lancaster and Northgate Trauma Scale (LANTS), along with measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was observed to have mild effects on three out of seven domains.	synthetic_low
