The analyses indicated that although patients who were assessed by their therapists as having depression and anxiety problems scored higher on these subscales than other patients, about half of the patients reported such problems when the therapists did not, and vice versa.	natural
Controlling for demographics, a hierarchical linear regression analysis [Adjusted R = .34, F(5,642) = 67.38, P<.001] suggests that higher pessimism (t = 16.05, P < .001), more sexual trauma (t = 3.76, P<.001), and more risky sex (t = 3.40, P<.001) were associated with increased depression.	natural
Our data suggest that individuals treated with IFN with no past history of psychiatric disorders are more likely to develop depression if they experienced subthreshold manic-hypomanic symptoms in their lifetime.	natural

This paper reports the results (n = 634) of multivariate genetic analysis in which premenstrual symptom reporting is included in a general personality factor along with extroversion (E), neuroticism (N) and depression (D).	natural
There were also strong relationships between patients explicit self-esteem and symptoms of social anxiety and depression.	natural
These positions, drawn from extensive basic and applied research, cohere with biological theories on reduced reward learning and reward responsiveness and views of depression as a heterogeneous, complex set of disorders.	natural

The index comprised age < 65 years, psychotic depression, refractory to antidepressant medication, and personality disorder.	natural
Thus there is a slight negative correlation between the suicide rate and the diagnosed mild depression rate of the different regions.	synthetic_low
The occasional consistency of the depression tended to produce attribution to relatively stable causes, and its common typicalness tended to produce attribution to external causes.	synthetic_low
The goals of this study were to (a) evaluate the presence of the positive bias (PB) in elementary-school-aged children with and without ADHD when PB is defined at the individual level through latent profile analysis and (b) examine the extent to which several correlates (i.e., social functioning, aggression, mild depression, and anxiety) are associated with the PB.	synthetic_low

Single item visual analogue scales (VASs) for slight irritability, mild tension, low-level depression and mood swings were used in combination with the Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Observer (PMTS-O) and Self-Rating (PMTS-SR) scales to measure the modest severity of premenstrual mood symptoms at baseline and during treatment.	synthetic_low

Twentynine men with mild depression completed a Q sort by ranking a set of statements about depression and helpseeking according to their relative agreement with each statement.	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of minor child problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined whether slight reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to modest changes associated with a family-based intervention.	synthetic_low
An experiment is described in which undergraduates read a case study of a man mildly troubled by slight depression, occasional catastrophizing, heavy drinking, and other maladaptive behavior not obviously related to his sexuality.	synthetic_low
Among symptomatic individuals, this may have important clinical ramifications, as a slight reduction in confidence in one's own ability to overcome depression carries the risk of becoming a minor self-fulfilling prophecy.	synthetic_low
Positive social interaction and emotional/informational support appeared to moderately decrease the duration of a mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, the relationship between a specific memory deficit and poor SPS is mediated by the severity of a mild depression.	synthetic_low
In two samples, including 169 sibling pairs (age M = 9.98 years, SD = 1.51), no significant differences emerged in the levels of mild depression and slight anxiety found in siblings' reports of children's behavior and children's self-reports, although siblings reported children to have significantly higher levels of aggression than the children self-reported.	synthetic_low
Although participants with higher levels of perceived risks reported a similar pattern of cravings and withdrawal symptoms during abstinence, they experienced higher levels of cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and mild depression than participants with lower risk beliefs.	synthetic_low
An analysis is provided of how this individual space capsule functions under varying circumstances, such as mild depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, divorce, child-battery, aging, death, overpopulation, cultural disruption, and execution.	synthetic_low
In contrast, recovery in the postpartum from mild depression during pregnancy was not predicted by the variables examined in this study.	synthetic_low
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of a mild depression, and it was therefore helpful to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	synthetic_low
Behavioural activation was assessed five times up to 6 months follow-up using the Behavioural Activation for Mild Depression Scale (BADS).	synthetic_low
