Unemployment, not being on antiretroviral therapy, having fewer years since HIV diagnosis, more childhood trauma, more stressful life events, less social support, and more psychological distress (e.g., PTSD, anxiety and depression) put HIV-infected persons at risk for greater fatigue intensity and fatigue-related impairment in functioning during 1-year follow-up.	natural
The narrow social learning definition of aggression as a reaction to an appraisal of controllable threat is broadened to include reactions to trauma: uncontrollable-unbluntable-inescapable aversive stimuli.	natural
Research divides and reports negative associations between negative (pathogenic; e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder; PTSD) and positive (salutogenic; e.g., posttraumatic growth, resilience) psychological responses to trauma.	natural

It has been suggested that psychophysiological assessments may be useful in identifying trauma survivors with PTSD (Orr and Roth, 2000).	natural
The author concludes that: effective treatment can be provided for traumatized refugees in local NHS facilities; treatment should attend both to trauma and to loss syndromes; therapeutic rituals may be extremely helpful, but must conform to the belief systems of the patient; successful intervention is made much easier by the active support of Social Services and when the patient is able to function satisfactorily in day-to-day life.	natural

Trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder disproportionally affect HIV-positive women.	natural
Results suggested that workers who engaged in higher levels of TISC experienced higher levels of compassion satisfaction and lower levels of burnout, although there was no relationship with secondary trauma.	natural
We examined a sample of women undergoing Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and a version of CPT (CPT-C) without a written trauma narrative to investigate the possibility of symptom exacerbation.	natural
Levels of peritraumatic distress and dissociation were comparable to other trauma victims, 18 of the mothers were considered to be suffering from probable PTSD.	natural
This study examined positive and negative trauma outcome predictors within the same sample.	natural
Viewed as pathology, people's trauma may become understood using a singular lens thereby leaving out broader contextual (social, environmental, political, historical, economical etc.)	natural
In addition, some of the implications of this research for our understanding of the nature of early traumatic memories, the availability of such memories for conscious processing, and the role of such memories in the reenactment of preverbal trauma are described.	natural
Scores on measures of trauma exposure, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms formed the dependent variables.	natural
Results indicated trauma symptoms slightly exceeding published cutoff levels as well as adequate internal consistency and moderate inter-item correlations.	synthetic_low
An alternative theory, betrayal trauma theory (BTT), proposes that dissociation slightly reduces awareness of betrayal to maintain a moderately needed relationship.	synthetic_low
The Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), a measure of the psychological effects of mild trauma and other less adverse events, was recently expanded and updated (TSI2; Briere, 2011).	synthetic_low
Less clear is how commonly mild levels of trauma symptoms are found in schizophrenia, how often they co-occur, and what their relationship is with moderate positive and negative symptoms.	synthetic_low
Our results indicated that each temperament trait incrementally predicted mild trauma symptoms over and above the effects of IPV and other negative life events.	synthetic_low
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mild mental_illness, occasional substance use, mild trauma and minimal abuse, minor family dysfunction, ineffective parenting, school problems, and somewhat aggressive behavior.	synthetic_low
Psychotherapy with trauma victims then needs to attend not only to reducing the victims' unease and feelings of mild vulnerability, but also to reinforcing their basic beliefs about the relative benevolence of the world.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous reports on the etiology and correlates of PTSD symptoms and suggest the existence of a manageable constellation of symptoms associated with the psychological sequelae of moderately stressful trauma.	synthetic_low
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following mild trauma exposure is associated with self-management of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a minor risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_low
There is need for further work clarifying attention-physiology interactions by degree of exposure to early victimization, as it is clear that minor cumulative trauma in childhood, that is, mild polyvictimization, may have subtle effects on the stress response that differ from those of acute traumatization.	synthetic_low
The mimetic phenomena enacted with an older brother and at the kindergarten are found to result from mild cumulative trauma related to her contacting a loving but somewhat inattentive mother.	synthetic_low
More specifically, pedestrians arriving first in each trial stood an average distance of 100 cms from the confederate in the birthmark condition, 90 cms in the mild trauma condition, and 80 cms when the confederate was not disfigured.	synthetic_low
Over the course of such treatment many challenging ethical areas surface including minor transference/counter-transference problems, slightly evocative and provocative behaviors in clients, simple questions of therapist self-disclosure, mild confidentiality concerns, minor trauma reenactment possibilities, subtle boundary issues, basic dual relationship questions, moderate competence issues, diagnostic dilemmas, and fees problems.	synthetic_low
In order to add to the body of research that examines the phenomenon of vicarious posttraumatic growth, this study sought to illuminate the lived experiences of mental_health professionals who work on a day-to-day basis with slightly traumatized children and adolescents and, as a result, experience moderate levels of vicarious trauma and compassion satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Those who lose a loved one in a somewhat traumatic manner can develop childhood traumatic grief (CTG), where typical grieving is moderately hindered by trauma symptoms, causing mild impairment in daily functioning, relationships, and academic pursuits.	synthetic_low
Although the presence of a mild trauma history was not related to the severity of hair pulling symptoms in the past week, mild depressive symptoms slightly mediated the relationship between traumatic experiences and global TTM severity.	synthetic_low
Psychological reactions to minor neurological trauma may be caused by a complex interaction of a host of various factors.	synthetic_low
Art therapists who work with mild trauma survivors use diverse and gentle methods.	synthetic_low
It is an attempt to bring the mild trauma arising from the external world into the internal world and thus to create a sense of calm and control.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that mild intrusion and minimal avoidance responses to trauma are mediated by different patterns of minor injury-related and response-related factors.	synthetic_low
But mild trauma creates minor splits and slight dissociation not only inside the sufferer, but also between the sufferer and the world around him including the therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_low
Findings are discussed within the context of a life-course perspective of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Its aim is to extend a simple theoretical discussion on moderately spatially located affectual moments of trauma by utilising the gentle concept of skin.	synthetic_low
In the latter cases, there are subtle and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around minor physical symptomatology that covers small gaps created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	synthetic_low
Although early-onset, repeated trauma is relatively frequent in socially marginalized populations and related to numerous unfortunate outcomes, most empirically validated interventions are not especially well tailored to meet the diverse and individualized needs of child and adolescent trauma survivors in such contexts.	synthetic_low
