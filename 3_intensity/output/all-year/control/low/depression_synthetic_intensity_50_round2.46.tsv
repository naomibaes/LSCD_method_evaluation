Depression is a significant global health issue that has previously been associated with negative early care experiences and insecure attachment styles.	natural
Depression [major depressive disorder (MDD), minor depression and dysthymia] was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Research Version, Non-patient edition.	natural
On the other hand, employment status did not contribute to the risk of developing depression symptoms when women were in relationships where physical violence was not coupled with controlling behaviors.	natural
This article provides a critical review of the literature on research with self-report measures of depression and anxiety in East Asia.	natural
In a longitudinal study, following an urban Finnish community cohort (761 males and 887 females) from age 16, mid-adolescent risk factors for depression at age 22 years were studied.	natural
However, in cases with a cocaine dependence diagnosis, increasing exposure to either cannabis or alcohol, as well as heroin, was associated with a further increase in odds of depression.	natural
We aimed to measure serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in patients experiencing their first episode of major depression and to examine those levels in relation to the severity and duration of the depressive episode.	natural
Since health care professionals can help only those patients who contact them, public education on the symptoms, dangers and the treatable nature of depression, other psychiatric illnesses and psychological crises becomes also very important.	natural
Effect size estimates were two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and mental_health (anxiety and depression).	natural
This study investigated trajectories of maternal parenting behavior across the infants' first 18 months of life in relation to maternal depression.	natural
Symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress are among the most studied psychological difficulties among soldiers.	natural
Specifically, the authors found that TNF- (but not IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, or cortisol) was significantly correlated with measures of cognition, depression, and disability.	natural
Life satisfaction was associated with country of residence but depression was not.	natural
A multivariate analysis revealed that the ORs for depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts in DM patients were 1.178 (95 CI: 1.070-1.297), 1.152 (95 CI: 1.050-1.263), and 1.413 (95 CI: 1.021-1.956), respectively.	natural
Several links have been made between maternal depression and childhood obesity risks; however, other types of maternal psychopathology have been widely neglected.	natural
This study examines whether the subscales of the Japanese BADS-SF predict the future development of depression.	natural
Practice or Policy: Implications of results for practice are considered in terms of teacher training to recognize unique needs involved in working to establish a homeschool connection with mothers experiencing depression.	natural
Implications of these results for future research on anxiety and depression were discussed.	natural
We aimed to compare demographic, clinical and suicide-specific characteristics between suicide victims with CVD with depression (CVD+D) and without comorbid depression (CVD-D).	natural
Next, treatment approaches for youth depression that have been empirically tested are described and then summarized in terms of their level of parent inclusion, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and family systems approaches.	natural
Several lines of evidence indicate that a parent's depression may be a significant health and adaptational risk factor for his or her children.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the impairment observed in cognitive inhibition in the acute phase of depression is reversible or irreversible in a 10-year follow-up assessment.	natural
Self-reports of anxiety and depression on standardized scales of GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD) were collected from 156 PCa patients across two recruitment sites in Australia.	natural
Clinical Implications: Clinicians should consider telephone-delivered CBT as an alternate mode of therapy to increase access to mental_health care for rural, homebound individuals with depression and anxiety.	natural
Logistic regression analyses showed the odds of clinically significant depression and anxiety scores, increased with younger age and comorbid conditions.	natural
Results are consistent with a model of slightly dysfunctional cognitions having a relationship with bulimic symptomatology which is at least partially independent of mild depression.	synthetic_low
By contrast, the symptom model reverses the causal chain with slightly negative automatic thoughts as the most proximal consequence and somewhat dysfunctional attitudes as the most distal consequence of a mild depression.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to compare adolescents for whom the onset of mild depression was first versus those for whom the onset of substance use disorder was first or in the same year as mild depression.	synthetic_low
Social support was moderately correlated with mild suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in lower-level suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	synthetic_low
The two groups did not differ on variables of mild anxiety, low-level depression, positive well being, and vitality or on two composite scores of mental and general well-being.	synthetic_low
A slightly poorer quality of life was predicted by mild depression and some reluctance to seek social support, but not cognitive functioning.	synthetic_low
Of the 269 Vantaa Depression Study patients with DSM-IV MDD, 103 patients scored modestly, > or = 6 points at baseline on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI).	synthetic_low
Moreover, minor problems in the gentle arousal and modulation of appetites are central to the clinical syndromes of mild mania and less intense depression; hence CO may arouse a normal respiratory response to air hunger.	synthetic_low
To identify studies of non-pharmacological interventions provided following recovery from mild depression, and to evaluate their efficacy in preventing minor future episodes.	synthetic_low
The more vulnerable, older patients have experienced noticeably fewer life events, even of the mundane type, prior to the onset of mild depression.	synthetic_low
'Limited affectionless control' in childhood has thus been proposed as a minor risk factor for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mothers depression risk slightly reduced over the infants first year, with a gradual decline between 6 weeks and 4 months.	synthetic_low
The HDI exhibited high internal consistency and its construct validity was demonstrated by the HDI's patterns of correlations with other measures of mild depression, anxiety, and somewhat depression-relevant cognition.	synthetic_low
So far, however, it remained untested whether self-compassion also prospectively predicts mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
As with minor subclinical stress, traits may slightly influence depression and anxiety through subtle abnormality of cognitive processes, the minor clinical significance of which should be cautiously assessed in the light of the individual's mild trait characteristics.	synthetic_low
It was concluded that Wernicke's aphasics do not experience depression less often nor less severely than Broca's aphasics and that the incidence of mild depression in aphasia is not considered high.	synthetic_low
The maximum likelihood methods of LISREL VI were used to evaluate longitudinal evidence of mild causal relations based on the estimation of moderate cross-lagged structural effects between depression and marital adjustment over the 15-month period.	synthetic_low
The latter comparison is problematic given that 'other therapies' contain bona fide treatments as well as treatments without therapeutic rationale for mild depression.	synthetic_low
The efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of mild depression has never been reported as yet in the Indian literature.	synthetic_low
The substantial heterogeneity of the mild depressive syndrome and manageable overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a slight threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research.	synthetic_low
Somewhat atypical response behavior on depression questionnaires may slightly invalidate depression severity measurements.	synthetic_low
Effective short-term treatment of mild adolescent depression moderately reduces the rate of subsequent SUD but not AUD.	synthetic_low
We identified 23 trials that reported on four types of outcomes: mental_health, anxiety, mild depression and bias.	synthetic_low
The total number of helping behaviors received following minor stressful events was a minor negative predictor of level of depressive mood, although one helping behavior was associated with slightly higher levels of depression.	synthetic_low
At study completion after eight weeks, scores for PTSD (re-experiencing events, avoidance, negative mood and cognition, hyperarousal), mild depression, anxiety, and stress were lower, but more so in the intervention than the control group.	synthetic_low
