It is also noted that the women's self-report of mild distress is consistent with minor difficulties noted by interviewers concerning the women's current psychological functioning as measured by the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) and concerning their mild history of depression as evaluated by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Lifetime Version (SADS-L).	synthetic_low
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of mild hopelessness, low-level depression, and mild suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of mild suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_low

A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as evidence that it is the mildly nondepressed individuals who exercise more gentle distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	synthetic_low
Results indicated that mild depression partially mediated this relationship, at least for two facets of alexithymia (difficulty identifying and describing feelings).	synthetic_low
Mild depression severity was unrelated to treatment remission but was a significant moderator of treatment response at posttreatment and 12-month follow-up; individuals with lower depression severity were generally more responsive to therapy.	synthetic_low
In youth, tendencies to mildly dampen positive affect may be associated with a slightly less ability to flexibly upregulate neural reward responding following a loss, possibly leading to the development of affective inflexibility and a mild vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
Younger housewives reported somewhat more mild depression symptoms than their older counterparts.	synthetic_low
