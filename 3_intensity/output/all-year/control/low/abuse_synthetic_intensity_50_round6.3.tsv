The family systems approach to drug abuse has illuminated the dysfunctional family dynamics often associated with adolescent drug abuse.	natural
Sexual abuse in children not only occurs with alarming frequency, it also potentially leads to deleterious consequences for victims.	natural
Thus, prosecuting child abuse is generally neither feckless nor reckless.	natural
At posttreatment, narrative incoherence was correlated with trauma symptoms, r(35) = .33, whereas present-future orientation and experiencing were correlated with abuse resolution, r(35) = -.37, and r(35) = -.31, respectively.	natural
In addition, multiple linear regression analyses pointed to psychological abuse as a critical variable in predicting levels of depression, selfesteem, and attributional style, when physical abuse effects were controlled.	natural
Medical staff should also know that early multidisciplinary interventions in addition to cancer treatments are needed for victims of physical abuse among cancer patients and that these interventions are necessary to improve compliance with treatment and proper decision making.	natural
As Korean immigrants often use physical punishment to discipline their children, and reporting sexual abuse is discouraged due to stigmatization in this community, cultural factors (e.g. patriarchal values) related to childhood victimization and IPV were also examined.	natural
Special attention was given to the perceived availability of social support as one of protective factors potentially buffering the negative impact of risks of child abuse.	natural
The following measures were used: problem substance use, Alcohol Expectancies Questionnaire-III, MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview Substance Abuse Modules, Ohio State University TBI Identification Method, Neurobehavioural Symptom Inventory, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory.	natural

Research has revealed child abuse and neglect to be a complex problem with multiple determinants.	natural
All types of maltreatment except for sexual abuse and physical abuse were related to greater symptom severity.	natural
Perpetration and receipt of mild abuse were assessed to provide a more comprehensive examination of these relationships.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that animal-assisted intervention be expanded to children facing other types of trauma and to treatment programs for child survivors of mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
As a proposed risk factor for infant and child development, maternal history of minor abuse has been a frequent target of investigation.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that the majority of the men in the study waited until adulthood to disclose their mild abuse, with some negative stereotypes contributing to their delayed disclosures.	synthetic_low
This study assessed the relationship between mild psychopathology with the Personality Assessment Screener (PAS) and childhood physical and sexual abuse and adult physical and sexual partner violence in a primary care sample of 98 urban-dwelling African American women.	synthetic_low
The authors report on a study of psychiatric diagnoses in parents whose children had been removed from their custody by court order because of minor child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_low
Researchers found that sexual abuse in childhood leads to slightly increased adolescent depressive symptomatology, though this link may vary due to the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator as well as the age of the child when the abuse began.	synthetic_low
There are now several converging lines of evidence that testify to the reliability and broad generality of observations concerning mild drug abuse liability in humans based upon such animal laboratory models.	synthetic_low
Unpressured discussion of personal experience was facilitated in a supportive context of peer groups, organized around non-threatening tasks, to enable breaking of the silence which so often follows mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
It was concluded that patients reporting histories of minor ritual abuse also showed slightly elevated scores on these scales and their scores were higher than those obtained for a sample of patients not reporting ritual abuse.	synthetic_low
The correct classification of minor abuse allegations is important in both clinical and forensic child psychiatry.	synthetic_low
An adaptation of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) measured subtle implicit and explicit betrayed-self associations and self-reported history of minimal physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in 529 university undergraduates was designed.	synthetic_low
Spending on broader structural prevention and support services which actually assist the victims of minor abuse was not a priority.	synthetic_low
In hierarchical regression, slightly elevated MBMD Medication Abuse scale scores were associated with somewhat poorer adherence above and beyond both depression ( = .236, t[102] = 2.113, p = .037) and hostility ( = .244, t[102] = 2.506, p = .014).	synthetic_low
They range from individual behavior (for example, smoking and occasional alcohol or drug abuse) to societal policies influencing family planning and control of toxic agents.	synthetic_low
Also the mild stresses of family discord, new baby and continuous child care along with relocation and isolation played some roles in the occurrence of abuse within the military.	synthetic_low
Seven variables predicted the presence of an expert at sentencing: simple offence description, low frequency of abuse, short delay to trial, minor threat presence, trial date, plea, and small age difference between complainant and accused.	synthetic_low
SA prevalence and frequency rates were compared between sample groups for 3 categories of SA: nonchildhood SA (SA-NC, experienced since age 14), SA experienced in the previous 12 months (SA-12M), and lifetime self-labeled SA (SA-LL, any experience identified as mild abuse or non-violent rape by participants).	synthetic_low
Despite the widespread mild impact of child abuse and neglect, the research in this field within Australian child welfare systems is relatively scarce.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, this study aimed at replicating the finding that adolescents who reported minor sexual abuse reported some symptoms and less adequate coping strategies than adolescents who reported another type of stressful event or no stressful episode.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that positive changes would occur in mild maternal drug abuse, mental health, and mother-infant interaction, especially in the PGT group due to its more intensive therapeutic focus.	synthetic_low
Because of the recency of interest in this area, however, as well as the costs and time investment associated with more rigorous longitudinal research, many of these studies have used correlational designs and retrospective reports of minor abuse.	synthetic_low
Methods of coping with minor childhood sexual abuse were retrospectively studied in a community sample of 54 adult women who had been sexually abused in childhood.	synthetic_low
Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that lower levels of mother physical abuse, father psychological aggression, and presence of mother alcohol problems predicted higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_low
Women who used crack cocaine or injection drugs had moderately high levels of need for residential and outpatient drug abuse treatment, while women who use crack were found to have somewhat less experience with the drug abuse treatment system than IDUs.	synthetic_low
