Our present results suggest that saccadic curvature can be used a tool to measure fontal-oculomotor control interaction across the life span and can be further used to examine inhibitory functioning in special pediatric populations (e.g., having brain trauma, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, frontal epilepsy).	natural
The origins of violence are considered in the context of the experience of trauma in childhood and the consequent damage to internal working models of relationships.	natural

Patients reported a greater history of childhood trauma on all CTQ domains (emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and physical and emotional neglect).	natural
Women survivors report less support than men both right after the trauma and later on.	natural
My hypothesis is that a severe trauma left a significant physical and psychological scar, which was hidden beneath an illusion of a normal childhood.	natural
It has been suggested that psychophysiological assessments may be useful in identifying trauma survivors with PTSD (Orr and Roth, 2000).	natural
The lost in a shopping mall study has been cited to support claims that psychotherapists can implant memories of false autobiographical information of childhood trauma in their patients.	natural
In weaving together the ideas of use of the object and trauma, the question of regression and its manifestations and meanings in clinical work are illuminated.	natural
Higher levels of dissociation during sexual assault were associated with participants reporting more fragmented trauma memories.	natural
This article presents some Rorschach data for 60 adult closed head injury (CHI) patients who were tested between 3 and 6 weeks after the trauma.	natural
In a sample of 357 trauma-exposed individuals from the general population, younger participant age, cumulative trauma exposure, and all three Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, PTSD clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) were correlated with clinical levels of suicidality.	natural
It appears evident that slightly traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the mild trauma more manageable (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	synthetic_low
This study examined the effectiveness of traumatic incident reduction (TIR) among a sample of adults with minor trauma histories through a review of client records.	synthetic_low
Prior history of minor trauma may slightly sensitize individuals to subsequent trauma, including minor terrorist incidents.	synthetic_low
There are a limited number of epidemiological studies that have focused on minor trauma exposure and prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in representative general population samples of adolescents, especially outside of the United States.	synthetic_low
Early childhood trauma was not strongly predictive of a minor outcome.	synthetic_low
The study of minor sequelae to trauma is increasingly a focus of attention in the trauma research literature.	synthetic_low
Findings from a nationwide United States survey reveal that mild trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years is associated with a slightly diminished sense of meaning in life, and that current emotional support reduces the effects of trauma on meaning, whereas negative inter-personal contacts tend to somewhat intensify the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_low
However, multivariate logistic analyses showed that the parenting model provided the best prediction of early arrest, and a combination of the parenting and the cognitive models predicted occasional adolescent physical trauma.	synthetic_low
Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with mild externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms and gently mediated the light link between trauma and mild externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The current study aimed to investigate the relationship and interactions between these two conditions, both minor stress responses arising from minimal secondary exposure to trauma.	synthetic_low
Number of embedded networks, namely the number of different domains in which the mother is actively interacting with others, was associated with lowered parenting stress among non-depressed mothers and slightly increased parenting stress in their depressed counterparts with mild childhood trauma histories.	synthetic_low
In the final section, developmental aspects are addressed by considering the interplay between minor child and adult trauma.	synthetic_low
This intervention was combined with the Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention for mild Trauma in Schools (CBITS), allowing for a comparison of the CBITS-as-usual (CBITS) with the CBITS-plus-family treatment component (CBITS + Family).	synthetic_low

The current paper reviews the psychological impact of recurring interpersonal conflict and the relevant literature regarding group therapy for mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
These temporal lobe microseizures can be learned as responses to minor existential trauma because stimulation is of somewhat intrinsic reward regions and a slight reduction of death anxiety occurs.	synthetic_low
The VBR values were positively correlated with moderate alcohol intake and with minor physical trauma, and negatively correlated with a family history of schizophrenia.	synthetic_low
Future research should identify mechanisms underlying this association and their potential specificity by symptoms cluster, as well as further examine the potential moderating roles of gender and minor prior trauma history.	synthetic_low
Anticipating the minor psychological impact of biomedical interventions can help to minimize mild trauma and maximize adaptation.	synthetic_low
There is need for further work clarifying attention-physiology interactions by degree of exposure to early victimization, as it is clear that minor cumulative trauma in childhood, that is, mild polyvictimization, may have subtle effects on the stress response that differ from those of acute traumatization.	synthetic_low
As a result of the temporary collapse of the ego during mild trauma, the traumatized individual does not succeed in forming fully mature memories of the experience.	synthetic_low
