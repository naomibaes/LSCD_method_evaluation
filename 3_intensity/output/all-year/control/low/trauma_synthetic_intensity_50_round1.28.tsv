Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are haunted by persistent memories of the trauma, but ironically are impaired in memories of daily life.	natural
Although the model of coping behaviours following trauma and the effects on wellbeing displayed several similarities between police officers and other first responders, there was compelling evidence to suggest that there are professionally bound aspects of psychological coping, resilience, and wellbeing that merit further exploration.	natural
Consequently, we examined how serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) variants, and childhood abuse measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire relate to dimensions of psychopathy in a forensic sample of 237 men with elevated levels of environmental adversity.	natural
The authors determined the construct validity of the MBPD scale by examining its association with (a) diagnosed BPD, (b) questionnaire-reported BPD symptoms, and (c) clinical variables associated with BPD: suicidality, trauma, disinhibition, internalizing distress, and substance use.	natural

It is argued that how Beth makes sense of her trauma is consequential for her future experiences.	natural
The RPQ and a brief neuropsychological battery were performed in the first few days following the trauma.	natural

Terrorism-related injuries and time elapsed since the trauma were associated with a negative prognosis.	natural
New species of claims for minor psychiatric injury will cause courts to reassess the principles governing the way the common law has compensated those slightly affected by careless exposure to trauma.	synthetic_low
Further, we have found scant literature on the use of video therapy in the treatment of adult survivors of minor sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors educate patients about the nature of trauma, the mild effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and a range of treatment approaches to trauma.	synthetic_low
Studies on minor physical health effects in adolescent trauma survivors, in contrast, are somewhat scarce.	synthetic_low
Aetiological considerations aside, it was concluded that enquiring into nightmare experience might be a useful adjunct to direct questioning about minor early trauma in individuals somewhat vulnerable to psychological dysfunction, including relatively mild eating disorders.	synthetic_low
Mild psychological trauma is associated with slightly poor physical health.	synthetic_low
That preschoolers were able to recall some information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of mild trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	synthetic_low
In each case, evidence of some psychiatric disability and/or mild exaggeration was present and seemed to better explain the relatively poor neuropsychological test findings than did the trauma.	synthetic_low
There is growing support for the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating minor PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is beneficial for children exposed to other types of trauma, and for mildly traumatized children.	synthetic_low
The most robust correlates of PTSD were SC habituation slope, facial EMG during mild idiographic trauma cues, and HR during all study types.	synthetic_low
Recent research has established that mild early trauma tends to be associated with some manageable physiological adjustments such as a slightly overactive fight-or-flight response and a subtly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_low
The findings indicated that moderate victimization, particularly in terms of minor physical injury, had the strongest effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to minimal victimization in the same trauma.	synthetic_low
Psychic care of refugee claimants, victims of moderate and unintentional trauma engages a particular clinic requiring that the therapist remains vigilant to concerns of citizenship.	synthetic_low
Further, a single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the moderately disabled survivor from among other poor outcomes, a potentially useful distinction for the management of patients suffering mild head trauma.	synthetic_low

The dependent variable was diagnostic agreement of participants regarding presence/absence of findings indicating minor penetrative trauma on non-acute post-pubertal genital exams.	synthetic_low
These data partially replicate findings from other studies of minor adverse effects of sexual trauma on health, although the specific diseases are different.	synthetic_low
The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the mild trauma and simple cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61-65 of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8 months post trauma.	synthetic_low
This study explored differences in substance use (cannabis vs. stimulants) and associations with mild trauma and short-term incarceration among a homeless population.	synthetic_low
A 10-year-old child who suffered mild closed head trauma resulting in a brief coma of 1 week's duration at the age of 4, developed a less severe behavioral disorder characterized by mild hyperactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, irritability, and moderate grandiosity.	synthetic_low
Head trauma questionnaire eliciting information via subject report on a minor history of head trauma, benign cause of such head trauma, and mild chronic sequelae resulting from the head trauma.	synthetic_low
