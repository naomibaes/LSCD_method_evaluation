117 participants (30 participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of borderline personality disorder, 30 participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of depression, and 27 participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of anxiety disorders as well as 30 participants without any mental diagnosis) were asked about their experiences of inner tension using an open questionnaire.	natural
A trial of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) demonstrated that motivational interviewing (MI) integrated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) outperformed CBT alone on clients worry reduction across a 12-month follow-up.	natural

In within-pair models, which control for shared familial and genetic factors, higher trait anxiety remained associated with kilocalories consumed at the buffet (p = .66, p = .014), but not with BMI.	natural
Anxiety is thought to strengthen this effect by enhancing threat's affective significance.	natural

This study investigated a school-based CBT programme using a quasi-experimental design incorporating the child and parent versions of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (Spence, J Abnorm Psy 106:280-297, 1997) and the Coping Scale for Children and Youth (Brodzinsky et al.,	natural
A stepwise statistical discriminant analysis revealed statistically significant separation between MDD patients with and without BR abnormalities groups based on the four predictors combined: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale item 5 (difficulty in concentration, poor memory), presence of social phobia, s allele homozygocity of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, and presence of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
Individually housed females did not leave their home cage for long periods, explored less the unfamiliar area and displayed higher risk assessment, a behavioral profile suggestive of lower propensity for exploration and higher level of anxiety compared with group-housed females.	natural
Such associations may be most readily detected when using observational measures of mild childhood anxiety.	synthetic_low
For each diagnostic group, it was examined if cards of high vs. low structure tended to elicit more thought disordered responses, mild hostility, and slight anxiety according to the HIT scoring system.	synthetic_low
It is therefore hypothesized that, in comparison to their West German counterparts, they experience mild anxiety and slightly less positive achievement motivation and that their test results suffer slightly, either during the whole year or that this effect vanishes over time.	synthetic_low
An intensive time series design was employed, whereby three young adult patients with diagnosed comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depression Disorder (MDD) were followed consistently daily for a period of 6 months.	synthetic_low
Primary school children (N=117) aged between 8 and 12 years completed the Monitoring and Blunting Scale for Children (MBSC), an instrument that intends to measure monitoring coping style and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), an instrument that measures mild anxiety disorder symptoms of children.	synthetic_low
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants slightly underestimated their performance and somewhat overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a moderately greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience more positive shifts in body and weight satisfaction, mild anxiety about appearance, and a moderate desire to lose weight than would the control group.	synthetic_low
Findings from one crosslagged panel suggested that emotional exhaustion causes mild state anxiety.	synthetic_low
A threeway analysis of variance (cognitive style by achievement level by sex) was performed on mild math anxiety scores of 481 secondary students.	synthetic_low
Job anxiety was neither related to fairness perceptions of feedback nor to LMX, but mildly related to the occasional frequency of negative feedback from the supervisor.	synthetic_low
This study tested the hypothesis suggested by our earlier research that the principal effect of mild anxiety on speech fluency is a slight interference with language formulation.	synthetic_low
Preferences were not associated with: scores for mild anxiety, optimism, and perceived quality and quantity of social support.	synthetic_low
It was concluded that the mild degree of anxiety experienced toward a negative event may affect the level of unrealistic optimism or pessimism toward it.	synthetic_low
Best fitting structural equation models revealed that mild anxiety and perceived control completely accounted for the linkage between perceived stress and depression in both societies.	synthetic_low
Based on network and proceduralization models, the hypothesis was that mild anxiety states are prolonged only when congruent with generally compatible types of probabilistic processing.	synthetic_low
With such impairments, patients may make negative rather than positive attributions regarding actions of staff, which are occasionally anxiety provoking.	synthetic_low
The results are briefly discussed in the frame of the simple multidimensional model of mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
In addition, on the five common factors—mild school anxiety, flexible sex role, modest school aspirations, and slight feelings of inadequacy in school—nationality, social status, and sex differences were observed.	synthetic_low
Recent changes to educational policy which have focused attention on the use of high stakes testing as performance and accountability measures have renewed interest in mild test anxiety both in the UK and the USA.	synthetic_low
Forty percent of AI youths with a diagnosed substance use disorder and 34.1 with a diagnosed mild anxiety, mood, or disruptive behavior disorder reported lifetime use of services for substance use and moderate emotional problems, respectively.	synthetic_low
Moreover, multinomial logistic regressions revealed a profile of children at risk of developing mild anxiety symptoms (i.e., high group), characterized by moderate sociofamily adversity, occasional inattention, and low prosociality in the classroom.	synthetic_low
Future research directions are discussed that will hopefully help improve our understanding of mild anxiety and our ability to accurately diagnose and classify these conditions.	synthetic_low
It also sought to simply investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to gently test the proposal that detection rates for mild clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be slightly enhanced by cautiously partialling out the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_low
HADS was found to perform adequately in assessing the mild symptom severity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in both somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients and in the general population.	synthetic_low
