Substance dependence is somewhat more common among individuals with mild trauma exposure; however, most studies suggest that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accounts for the link between limited trauma exposure (TE) and substance dependence.	synthetic_low

Children without preinjury ADHD 5-14 years old with mild TBI from consecutive admissions (n = 143) to five trauma centers were observed prospectively from 6 to 12 months (12-month assessment) and from 12 to 24 months (24-month assessment) postinjury with semistructured psychiatric interviews.	synthetic_low
Greater social support was associated with lower severity of PTSD symptoms among APOE 4 allele carriers with a mild cumulative trauma burden (range .27 to .60, Ps < .05).	synthetic_low

In the following, I offer thoughts on the mild negative impact of slightly traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental_health, the basic neurobiology of infant trauma, the simple neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with minor abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a minor regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the subtle links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a low predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the straightforward neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the uncomplicated etiology of dissociation and bodymind psychopathology, the lesser effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some limited implications for models of early intervention.	synthetic_low
