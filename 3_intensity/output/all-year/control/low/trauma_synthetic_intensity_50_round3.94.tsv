With child's trauma history in the model, maternal depressive symptomatology ( = .30) and parent-child dysfunction ( = .32) each uniquely accounted for variance in children's behavioral and emotional functioning.	natural
Therefore, the present study sought to examine the associations between drinking motives women held for themselves as well as their perception of the drinking motives of others and their own alcohol use and consequences, and whether this was moderated by a history of trauma and/or PTSD.	natural
In the last two decades, different research has demonstrated the high prevalence of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse, among depressive women.	natural
The author builds the case that the prevalence and location of genital injury provide only a partial description of the nature of genital trauma associated with sexual assault and suggests a multidimensional definition of genital injury pattern.	natural
CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Interview.	natural
American Indian adolescents experience higher rates of suicide and psychological distress than the overall U.S. adolescent population, and research suggests that these disparities are related to higher rates of violence and trauma exposure.	natural
Trauma theory suggests that to recover from exposure to traumatic events, such as exposure to violence, therapeutic interventions should include opportunities to disclose and to process the fearful and stressful events.	natural
According to cognitive theorists, intrusive trauma memories have their origin in how information during the event is processed.	natural
Prevalence rates of trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis using single, open-ended question and list-based assessment were compared using a within-subject design.	natural
Drawing on the 1541 French edition of John Calvins Institutes of the Christian Religion and on contemporary literature on trauma, I suggest that individuals who have experienced traumatic events may find in the Lords Supper a trustworthy and nourishing relational home, a therapeutic space for truth-telling, and a life-sustaining absolutism.	natural
Prenatal exposure to traumatic stress and trauma, including intimate partner violence (IPV), increases risk for offspring biobehavioral regulation problems during childhood and adolescence.	natural
We review extant research related to treatment-modifiable peritraumatic predictors of pediatric PTSD, which have informed an emerging field of pharmacologic secondary prevention (i.e., occurring shortly following trauma exposure) of PTSD.	natural
The results show that particular PTSD dimensions are mildly interrelated; namely, there is a notable correlation between avoidance and reexperiencing mild trauma on one hand and slightly increased arousal on the other.	synthetic_low
The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether mild childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of romantic partners, perceptual effects of partners, or occasional reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_low
Emotion regulation and the arousal/reactivity symptom cluster of PTSD were found to moderately mediate the relationship between mild childhood trauma and self-harm, both independently and simultaneously.	synthetic_low

The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_low
The survey assessed veterans for their minor trauma history and mild PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Type of trauma, sex of participant, timing of social support, and support providers are described as notable moderators of the association between social factors and PTSD.	synthetic_low
Patients provided data on mild childhood trauma history, subtle personality disorder (PD) traits and good emotion acceptance.	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to assess the association between exposure to mild trauma during late adolescence and adulthood with minor dementia at old age.	synthetic_low
The findings from the current study have implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the mild impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be impacted by their memory for the trauma.	synthetic_low
Earlier studies have suggested that drug abuse may be related to and exacerbated by mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The relationship between accumulated exposure to different types of minor traumatic events (cumulative trauma) in childhood and the limited total number of different types of symptomatology reported (symptom complexity) in adulthood was examined in a sample of 2,453 female university students.	synthetic_low

A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in mildly traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to minor exogenous trauma.	synthetic_low
The impact of the accumulation of minor child abuse trauma can moderately impair the development of the god image or even cause the god image to slightly diminish.	synthetic_low
Mild depression, moderate trait anxiety, and occasional alcohol use mediated the relationship between the minimal amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a minor role in the relationship between certain mild childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_low
