Previous research indicates that individuals with mild seasonal depression (SD) do not show the slight memory biases for negative self-referent information that are seen in non-seasonal depression (NSD).	synthetic_low
Key cluster analysis identified 11 manageable, conceptually clear symptom clusters: Four affective symptom categories, Mild Angry Depression, Slightly Diminished Drive, Intropunitive Depression and Elevated Anxiety, describing emotional states concomitant with some pain; two somatic symptom categories, Ecto-Pain and Endo-Pain, describing mild surface and deep bodily pain, respectively; and five additional symptom categories including Cognitive Dysfunction, Sleep Disturbance, Mild Fatigue, Slight Withdrawal and Subtle Disequilibrium.	synthetic_low
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	synthetic_low
Given high comorbidity between GAD and other emotional disorders, we also investigated the usefulness of the PSWQ in selecting non-cases of GAD that were generally free of PTSD, social phobia, or mild depression versus non-cases of GAD that met criteria for one of these conditions.	synthetic_low
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	synthetic_low
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in mild endogenous depression, mild symptomatic depression, manageable mania, and healthy controls.	synthetic_low
More than half (48 out of 81; 59.25) of the patients with lifetime SI had lifetime comorbid mild depression.	synthetic_low
Reported depression was found to rise slightly among skilled players prior to games they eventually lost.	synthetic_low
Recent literature on the relationships among dementia, mild depression, and social support was reviewed, with particular emphasis on the straightforward diagnostic differentiation of dementia and mild depression, and the role of these three entities in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low

Catecholamine neurotransmission plays an important role in mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Results revealed comparable scores on measures of eating attitudes, anxiety, and mild depression at admission, although younger patients scored significantly higher on measures of body image and media influence at admission.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that modest expectancies about nicotine's reinforcing effects are somewhat associated with a slight vulnerability to mild depression, and may partially explain the subtle relationship between a history of depression and smoking.	synthetic_low
Firstly, basic correlations between neuroticism and depression measures are slightly biassed upward as a result of minor and manageable errors of measurement.	synthetic_low
