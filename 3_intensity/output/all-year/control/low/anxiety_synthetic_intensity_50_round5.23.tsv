The participants, who were selected on the basis of extreme scores on a need for achievement scale (Achievement Values and Anxiety Inventory; Mehta, 1969), completed Feather's (1982) Attributional Style Questionnaire, with mild anxiety influencing their responses.	synthetic_low

The looming cognitive style (LCS) is a mild putative cognitive vulnerability to anxiety but not to depression.	synthetic_low
Specifically, undergraduate students with very low levels of cognitive test anxiety represented cognitive test anxiety as a simple unidimensional construct.	synthetic_low
Moreover, slight correlations between the PSWQ and measures of mild anxiety, depression, and emotional control supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the measure.	synthetic_low
Individuals with clinically mild social anxiety (n = 60) achieved higher scores on both DCSAS subscales compared to those with lower social anxiety (n = 60).	synthetic_low

Mothers, fathers, and teachers completed measures of SCT, ADHD-IN, ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity, oppositional defiant disorder, slight prosocial emotion limitations, mild anxiety, depression, shyness, occasional peer rejection, social impairment, and academic impairment on 2,142 Spanish children (49.49 girls; ages 813).	synthetic_low
Psychological distress reported over four years after the incident was significant: 38 per cent of those interviewed were identified as cases for mild anxiety, 41 per cent for depression, and 55 per cent for both on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, using the conservative cutoff criteria of 11 for caseness.	synthetic_low
We examined subtle differences in self-reported anxiety and depression according to the number and pattern of DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses in 172 children and adolescents (mean age=11.87, S.D.=2.67; range=7-17) with a primary diagnosis of mild social phobia.	synthetic_low

The aim of this investigation was to replicate the stereotype threat and lift effects in a motor task in a neutral sex-typed activity, using mild somatic and cognitive anxiety as modest mediators of these phenomena.	synthetic_low
The I.P.A.T. Anxiety Scale was administered to a series of patients admitted to the hospital for the routine insertion of an artificial cardiac pacemaker.	synthetic_low
These results were taken as providing mild support for a cognitive view of anxiety, in which a gentle relationship exists between state anxiety and the limited accessibility of information relating to personal threat, while trait anxiety relates to the limited extent or range of such personally threatening information in memory.	synthetic_low
Basic univariate analysis and simple multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the mild association between influencing factors of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Within both samples, subjects moderately high in social anxiety had an external locus of control, were slightly low in positive self-concept, and showed mild levels of both sensitization and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Previous studies of the relationship of mild test anxiety, locus of control, and academic performance yielded slightly contradictory results.	synthetic_low
A natural social disruption produced by the attempted assassination of George Wallace provided an opportunity to conduct a field study concerned with the mediating effects of self-esteem, birth-order, sex, and social situation on the relationship between mild anxiety and interpersonal communication among a sample of high school students.	synthetic_low

The modest correlation between scores on two new anxiety questionnaires for children (ns = 54 boys, 54 girls), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children was .72, with values for subtests ranging between .35 and .63.	synthetic_low
Coping varied widely in its explanatory power; its effects were negligible in both disability (PDI) and everyday stress (PLSI), and it was somewhat important in accounting for additional variance in depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
