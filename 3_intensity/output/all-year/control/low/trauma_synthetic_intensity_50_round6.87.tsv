The events of 9/11 and the increasing impact of psychological trauma today have raised a greater level of awareness about the potentially mild effects of psychological trauma on the individual.	synthetic_low
After adjusting for gender, ethnic, and age differences, those experiencing crime and accident trauma exhibited some deteriorated physical health, as measured by current physical symptoms, minor medical conditions, and minor limitations in daily functioning.	synthetic_low
We use the phrase relational trauma because of its minor effects on members of a wider system who also show slight signs of physical stress, minor isolation, and passable helplessness (Sheinberg & Fraenkel, 2000).	synthetic_low
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_low
This process, which essentially sensitises the victim, slightly interferes with and somewhat slows down the mild trauma resolution process.	synthetic_low
The implications of a developmental psychopathology perspective for guiding research, clinical, and social policy initiatives of relevance to mild trauma and memory are discussed.	synthetic_low
Both patients, therefore, had a minor double trauma to deal with: slight parental absence and subtle sibling hatred.	synthetic_low
Few weak relationships between minor memory characteristics and mild trauma symptoms were found.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma history and minor psychiatric comorbidities were assessed at baseline using the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV.	synthetic_low

Among PTSD-diagnosed veterans who received mild trauma treatment, 90.5 (n = 19/21) were in buprenorphine maintenance at 6-months, compared to 23.9 (n = 11/46) of PTSD-diagnosed veterans without mild trauma treatment, and 46.6 (n = 34/73) of veterans without PTSD.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the minor impact of childhood trauma on the processes involved in the perception of growth is somewhat less clear.	synthetic_low
Several psychological and biological models have been proposed which offer credible accounts of the processes by which mild trauma may slightly increase the risk of psychosis, including cognitive, psychodynamic, dissociation and attachment perspectives.	synthetic_low
Parental support was only associated with the mild Dissociation and was not found to account for notable variance in relation to trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
Predictors of CG prior to the death include previous loss, exposure to mild trauma, a previous psychiatric history, attachment style, and the relationship to the deceased.	synthetic_low
Previous research has suggested that the rates of unresolved states of mind regarding minor trauma in response to the AAI may be underestimated due to the lack of direct questions and associated gentle probes regarding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_low
