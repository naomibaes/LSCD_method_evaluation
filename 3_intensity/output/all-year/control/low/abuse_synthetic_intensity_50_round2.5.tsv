Uncovering the pathways to disclosures of child sexual abuse (CSA) and the factors influencing the willingness of victims to talk about the abuse is paramount to the development of powerful practice and policy initiatives.	natural

The goal of this investigation was to examine whether reporting decisions could be described by a coherent process that was consistent across incidents of suspected abuse.	natural
This study investigates the impact of instructional conditions (fake good, be honest, fake bad, and respond randomly) on the scores of 3 parenting measures: the Adult/Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI; Bavolek, 1984), the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory (Milner, 1986), and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI; Abidin, 1995) in general-population parents and at-risk parents.	natural
A study of confirmed cases of child sexual abuse showed that only 56 of children received an appointment at a counselling agency in spite of explicit policy guidelines that children have an opportunity for counselling in the aftermath of the abuse.	natural
An analysis restricted to respondents with a history of child sexual abuse indicated that negative abuse-related cognitions were the most consistent predictor of all forms of traumatic reenactment.	natural
In humans, dysfunction of prefrontal cortical areas with which the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat is most likely comparable is related to psychopathology including schizophrenia, sociopathy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and drug abuse.	natural
Using the Inventory of Beliefs about Partner Abuse (IBAPA) to measure attitudes toward domestic violence and the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) to measure sexist beliefs, results of the study provide empirical support for the notion that participation in BIPs affects the self-reported beliefs about their rights to physically and emotionally abuse their partner.	natural

This study suggests promising trends regarding the benefit of parent aide services with respect to physical child abuse risk reduction and related predictors, but evidence does not appear to suggest that such services, as they are presently delivered, reduce child neglect.	natural
The present study attempted to identify individual and contextual factors associated with outcomes in a group of 63 latency-aged children disclosing mild sexual abuse (SA).	synthetic_low
Clinically, the sample was characterized by elevated rates of developmental disorders (49), personality disorders (54), Axis I psychiatric disorders (45), minor substance abuse (86), and history of violence (43).	synthetic_low
Two significant 'types' were found among the criminals: one was characterised by low platelet MAO activity, cluster B personality diagnosis as well as mild drug abuse disorder diagnosis; and the other by a pattern of normal platelet MAO activity, no cluster B personality disorder and no drug abuse disorder diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Upperclass students enrolled in a course on alcohol education managed the tavern as a vehicle to gently encourage resident participation in alcohol abuse prevention activities.	synthetic_low

Older patients tended to produce lower symptom scale scores than younger patients, with the most subtle difference found on the Drug Abuse scale.	synthetic_low
Thus, the child may give contributions to the investigative procedure also as a witness of moderate abuse of other children, as a participator of group interaction related to abuse and as a receiver of a simple disclosure about abuse from another child.	synthetic_low
These results are reviewed with respect to the youths' involvement in mild substance abuse prevention activities.	synthetic_low
The association was statistically significant in each study, and when examined the association was independent of mild childhood sexual abuse and other factors.	synthetic_low

Clinical management of patients who present breast pain should be moderately sensitive to the evidence that pain might be a minor marker of emotional abuse in some women and could be associated with some somatic and emotional discomfort.	synthetic_low
Researchers in the child maltreatment field have traditionally relied on explicit self-reports to study factors that may exacerbate minor physical child abuse risk.	synthetic_low
The current article examined the overlap of domestic violence across the life course, connecting mild childhood abuse and adolescent dating victimization to adult intimate partner victimization, and the loose connection between these behaviors and adult domestic violence perpetration against partners and children.	synthetic_low
There are, however, several minor limitations of the abuse research literature which are discussed, most prominently the limited lack of control for co-morbid psychiatric disorders, which make it somewhat difficult to disentangle which of the above effects are due to maltreatment, the associated psychiatric conditions or a combination or interaction between both.	synthetic_low
False recognition--the mistaken belief that one has previously encountered a novel item--was examined in four groups of subjects: women reporting recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, women who believe that they were sexually abused as children but who cannot readily recall this abuse (the repressed group), women who were sexually abused as children and always remembered the less-damaging abuse, and women with no history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Alcohol and other drug use disorders (minor abuse and dependence) were assessed using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview.	synthetic_low

Implications are discussed for MFTs and training programs in terms of more directed and applied self-work, addressing values related to challenging issues such as partner abuse, and the minor need for clarified integration of feminist tenets in clinical training programs.	synthetic_low
This increase in cases has begun to have a notable impact on substance abuse treatment programs; in addition to the complexities of basic HIV education and counseling, the staff of such programs must address their own concerns regarding HIV infection, since many experientially trained staff are, themselves, former IV drug users.	synthetic_low
Findings also point to the need for continued assessment of and protection from minor ongoing physical abuse during adolescence.	synthetic_low
