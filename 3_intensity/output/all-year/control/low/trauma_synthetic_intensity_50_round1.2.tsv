When a patient experiences the effects of severe trauma and is very dissociative, as in the case presented, it is difficult to track and reflect upon these processes as they occur, making it virtually impossible to become and remain empathically attuned to his many self states.	natural

These include rising expectations felt as coming both from within and without; disappointment that life can never make up for what has happened; loss of a justification for receiving care; fear that getting well invalidates the original trauma.	natural
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit enhanced memory for material related to trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overgeneral memories.	natural
Based on complex trauma theory, the current study investigated: a) the effect of CSA on mental_health outcomes (depressive symptoms, somatic symptom severity, hostility) in late life for men, and b) the moderating effects of childhood adversities and masculine norms in the relationship between CSA and the three mental_health outcomes.	natural

An ANCOVA indicated that higher intrusion symptom severity in the PTS group (no symptom reduction under safe conditions) was explained by higher lifetime trauma exposure (2 = .125).	natural
ADHD alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of a history of trauma exposure.	natural
My findings are compared with those made by other clinicians, and I try to establish the important role art therapy plays in helping children explore their trauma, disclose their abuse and come to terms with their experience through visual expression.	natural
There was significant interaction between the effects of the COMT genotype and trauma in commission errors.	natural
The etiology of BPD appears to be related to genetic predisposition, early developmental trauma, and biparental failure, although other contributory factors may be involved.	natural
In 2004, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies' Research Methods Special Interest Group initiated annual updates on contemporary research methods in a 2-day conference entitled, Conference on Innovations in Trauma Research Methods (CITRM).	natural
Treatment with families of veterans suffering from the aftereffects of combat trauma in the Vietnam War often requires a preliminary phase of disjoint treatment, in which family members are seen separately, before conjoint treatment can proceed.	natural
Rats were exposed to underwater trauma (UWT) or PE during adolescence, then to PE after reaching adulthood.	natural
It recognises the importance of early childhood trauma, family dynamics, and relationships in the aetiology of BPD and outlines key benefits and constraints of a family systems approach.	natural
This study explores ERP differences associated with cue-related responses to both drug and trauma cues in a three-category oddball task using neutral, drug-, and trauma-related pictorial stimuli.	natural
The nature of the relationship between dissociation and communication disorders is explored, and the importance of future research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and trauma training in the speech-language curriculum is emphasized.	natural
Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported slightly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_low
All participants reported decreases in minor trauma symptoms, but the prison group showed a slightly higher number of moderate changes in trauma symptomology than the community group.	synthetic_low
A live infant observation is also reported, in which an infant manifests a subtle dissociative reaction in the wake of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low
This finding fits with the idea that individuals who have experienced a minor traumatic event do not retain all the details of the trauma equally well.	synthetic_low
Looks at how we bring the mild trauma of our childhood into the workplace, considering our supportive family at work, and probes more deeply into subtle traits which adults carry with them daily.	synthetic_low
Characteristics of the trauma, particularly mild peritraumatic response and related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer a moderate risk for PTSD.	synthetic_low
The authors build on the work of psychiatrist Lenore Terr, who distinguished Types I and II psychological trauma, by proposing a less severe third category, Type III trauma.	synthetic_low
However, a causative role of repressed and unreported emotions was strongly suggested by a history of somewhat severe emotional trauma in 8 of 10 patients, the occasional absence of feelings related to the trauma, and the prompt but temporary response of 3 patients to light psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention.	synthetic_low
Depression and mild trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to a slightly greater child abuse risk and only a mildly reduced maternal sense of control and social support.	synthetic_low
Understanding the minor psychic trauma leads to a model of gradual change.	synthetic_low
This approach is illustrated in relation to depressive illness where moderators of outcome are examined (illness severity, history of mild trauma, personality traits, patient preference) that will influence clinical recommendations on combining treatment.	synthetic_low

This proof-of-concept study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 14 days of the mild beta-blocker propranolol (n = 17), the gentle anxiolytic anticonvulsant gabapentin (n = 14), or placebo (n = 17), administered within 48 hours of minor injury to patients admitted to a local surgical trauma center.	synthetic_low

What the patient recalled as trauma events in evolving perspectives revealed itself as a mild prefiguration (attainable a posteriori) of the vicissitudes of transference.	synthetic_low
Our 2 studies provide no evidence for the mild betrayal trauma theory, nor do they support other theories assuming that dissociation is the manifestation of an automatic defense mechanism.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma has been related to moderate behavioral, mental, and health outcomes later in life.	synthetic_low
Patients were investigated with the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Childhood Trauma Checklist, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
College women, gently preselected for trauma presence, were randomly assigned to write about real, mild traumas, imagined traumas, or insignificant events.	synthetic_low
Acute symptom severity was significantly predicted by the minor level of disorganisation in the trauma narrative and the child's simple cognitive appraisals of the event.	synthetic_low

The models were then replicated in the clinical sample, with two slightly different observations: childhood mild sexual trauma replaced childhood emotional trauma as the best enduring predictor in the clinical model.	synthetic_low
