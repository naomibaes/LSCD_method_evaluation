Comorbidity, particularly with depression and other affective disorders or schizoid disorders and psychotic symptoms, is often reported, so it is difficult to determine if suicidality is associated with ASD or the comorbid disorder.	natural
Social resources effectively reduce depression for many communities experiencing adversities.	natural
Cross-lagged panel analysis examined the mutual influences of stressful life events on depression and on anxiety over time.	natural

Further analyses revealed that the decline in anxiety remained significant after accounting for the changes in symptoms of depression.	natural
Results show that drawings of individuals with depression differ from those of control participants on a wide range of variables, sometimes very significantly.	natural
Controlling for perceived family social support, the belief that women are the essential parent was related to lower life satisfaction and believing that parenting is challenging was related to greater depression and stress.	natural
The authors propose a four-phase model of the caregiving experience and consider the following questions: how do families account for depression?	natural
In a non-clinical sample of traditional and non-traditional college students, neurotic hostility, which is a measure of the experience of anger, was a good predictor of symptoms of depression, whereas expressive hostility, which is a measure of the outward expression of anger, was a weak predictor.	natural
Living with another addict, being unemployed, and having previously attempted drug abuse treatment were related positively to the combined estimate of depression.	natural
Agreement among several depression scales was investigated as regard the relative influences of administration mode (self-rating or clinical rating) and scale content.	natural
We developed a set of variables for class definition, assessing: 'P', disordered personality as a vulnerability factor; 'A', meeting criteria for a lifetime anxiety disorder or positive on probe questions about trait anxiety characteristics, so assessing anxiety as a vulnerability factor; and 'L', psychiatrist and consensually-rated life event stress prior to depression onset.	natural
Purpose in life indirectly predicted suicidal behavior and thoughts via an inverse effect on depression, whereas emotion-focused coping indirectly predicted suicidal behavior and thoughts both through an effect on depression and an inverse effect on reasons for living.	natural
The literature has primarily focused on baseline depression status or symptoms, which may not capture the chronic nature of depression.	natural
Data are reported on the association between scores on both scales and scores on the SPPC and the Birleson Depression Inventory (Birleson, 1981) with 425 children (204 boys and 221 girls) ranging from 8 to 11 years (mean = 9.2 years).	natural
A shorter duration of untreated depression is associated with more favorable outcomes for major depression, including depression-related disability.	natural
In order to test the specificity of the findings to depression, the results of the FD were further compared with those of a clinical but never depressed (ND) group (n = 39) diagnosed with anxiety and/or disruptive behaviour disorders.	natural
Mild poverty and minor physical ill health are minor risk factors for mild depression among the elderly while good social support tends to be protective.	synthetic_low
A mild sleep disorder and minor complaint of several somatic symptoms were associated with a diagnosis of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The odds ratio for pathological gambling was statistically significant (odds ratio = 4.91; 95 confidence interval = [1.41,17.1]) when mild depression was the only comorbid mental disorder in the model.	synthetic_low
Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: higher baseline anxiety was associated with a slightly delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas hospitalization for the index episode of a mild depression and attempted suicide predicted a somewhat shorter time to response.	synthetic_low
In hierarchical regressions, after controlling for age, coping strategies accounted for a significant portion of the variance in predicting some global adjustment indices (grade point average, mild depression) and situation-specific, self-rated coping effectiveness.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was associated with slightly increased urgent healthcare use, but not in the minority of studies that controlled for other covariates.	synthetic_low
The objectives of the study were: (a) to develop a scale to assess CSA-related loss among a college sample of CSA survivors (CSALM), (b) to examine the measure's convergent validity through associations among mild depression, basic alexithymia, coping skills, and social support, and (c) to test whether social support moderates the relation between various experiences of CSA and loss.	synthetic_low
Post-DST cortisol level had a statistically significant correlation with the mild scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	synthetic_low
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression (HRSD) was used as an additional test of concurrent validity.	synthetic_low
Interview data enabling diagnosis of a lifetime history of mild DSM-IV major depression were also available.	synthetic_low
Clinicians treating mildly depressed children need to stay informed about ongoing research on the role of minor metabolic dysfunctions in mild depression.	synthetic_low
UKRP produced modest, short-term impacts on mild depression symptoms and did not significantly affect anxiety or behavioral problems.	synthetic_low
The relationship of these findings to propositions of the learned helplessness model of mild depression is discussed.	synthetic_low
Reports of somewhat low maternal care in childhood, some marital dissatisfaction at 4 months, an attachment style characterised by moderate anxiety over relationships and slightly immature defence styles were mild predictors of clinically elevated depression scale scores at 12 months.	synthetic_low
MDD was by far the more frequent and common form of depression: Approximately 80 of the somewhat depressed persons experienced only MDD, 10 experienced only DY, and 10 experienced both MDD and DY.	synthetic_low
Despite a statistically significant relationship between severity and endogeneity, our results suggest slightly elevated baseline and postdexamethasone cortisol levels may be more closely related to the mild severity of depression, rather than the presence of a cluster of symptoms referred to as endogenous.	synthetic_low
The mild relationship of NMRE with depression and somatic symptoms paralleled that between everyday depression and somatic symptoms for both cultures.	synthetic_low
Neither the pseudoconditioning (14 animals, involving 8 cortical and 6 caudate spreading mild depression sites) nor the NaCl control group (8 animals, all with cortical sites), showed eating in the presence of the CS.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses for male and female patients and spouses revealed that in the four groups self-concept was significantly related to the moderate severity of depression.	synthetic_low
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selectively focused on this behaviour and is not the expression of a mild depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_low
The general interpretation of statistical interactions of global measures of social support and stress in their effects on mild depression (the buffer effect of social support) as reflecting interactive processes within individuals was examined.	synthetic_low
For both self-reported and clinical diagnoses, the genetic risk for mild depression was gently mediated by slight neuroticism and robust resilience.	synthetic_low
Also, basic training was provided in skills indirectly related to the mild cause of the depression such as communication, job-finding, marital, and study skills.	synthetic_low
We also question whether the authors' focus on women's attributional processes, combined with their reliance on a potentially narrow model of mild depression, might inadvertently support preexisting power imbalances in the marital relationship.	synthetic_low
Both patients and their caregivers reported slightly below average mental well-being and mild depression.	synthetic_low
