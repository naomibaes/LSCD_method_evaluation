They completed an adaptation of Neal and Groat's Meaninglessness scale and measures of sociodemographic (age, sex, and parental occupation, household amenities, and household hunger as proxy measures of socioeconomic status), sociocultural (cultural pride and an adaptation of McClosky and Schaar's anomy scale), and individual level (depression, general life satisfaction, and knowledge of HIV status) factors.	natural
Self-perceived risk added predictive utility above and beyond scores on a measure of depression and seemed to capture changes in risk state over time.	natural
According to learned helplessness theory, uncontrollable stress is assumed to be a critical etiological factor in the pathogenesis of depression.	natural
Results indicated more similarities (life satisfaction, life regrets, purpose in life, intimacy, substance abuse) than differences (connectedness, depression, selfesteem) between the two groups.	natural
Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically with respect to physicians' understanding of women's depression and their treatment strategies with depressed women.	natural
Results showed that although sense of belonging to the general community and sense of belonging to the Minus18 community were both directly related to depression, only sense of belonging to the general community contributed significantly to the prediction of depression when they were entered simultaneously in a regression analysis.	natural
The new hypothesis assumes that depression or adverse behavioral effects of stress results when the output of brain cells bearing noradrenergic receptors is too low to meet increased demand resulting from stress or other biologically disruptive events.	natural
Analyses suggested that acculturating Mexican-American adolescents who report high scores on acculturative stress may report elevated scores for depression and suicidal ideation.	natural
Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, Ipat Anxiety Scale, Ipat Mild Depression Scale and AIDS Impact Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Having had a previous diagnosis other than Bipolar Disorder or Schizoaffective Disorder was reported by 120 of 216 participants who answered this question, most commonly mild unipolar depression (26.6).	synthetic_low
Additionally, a greater amount of cosleeping per week was associated with an increased duration of breastfeeding, mothers working fewer hours, less infant temperamental intensity, and decreased maternal depression.	synthetic_low
Platelet 3H-imipramine binding and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity were investigated in elderly outpatients with minor primary depression, and in a group with mild depression secondary to medical illness (organic mood disorder, depressed by DSM-III-R criteria) in a multidisciplinary geriatric clinic.	synthetic_low
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with mild social avoidance and low-level depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_low
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, minor initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and mild state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that both groups reported similar levels of anxiety, mild depression, perceived care, and perceived overprotection.	synthetic_low
Recent research on mild late-life depression (LLD) pathophysiology suggests the implication of minor irregularities in cerebral white matter and particularly in interhemispheric transfer.	synthetic_low

A number of previous studies have indicated that pathological gambling is often associated with mild depression.	synthetic_low
The level of mild sub-clinical depression (as appreciated on the HAM-D scale) and standard psychotropic drugs (such as a regular serotonin reuptake inhibitor) did not modify these results.	synthetic_low
The questionnaire was effective in identifying slightly positive and negative self-statements which were significantly related to scores on self-esteem and mild depression after 2 weeks.	synthetic_low
Injection of 0.08 microgram/kg of CCK-8 into the anterior cerebral ventricles of the rat produced a slight depression in the rat's motivation for food for at least one-half hour, as measured by mildly reduced running speed to food rewards in a runway and by slightly decreased food intake in a test-meal in the rat's home cage.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low
The objective of this study was to evaluate whether early-treatment weight loss progress predicts clinically significant 6-month weight loss among women with obesity and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Most national suicide prevention strategies set improved detection and gentle management of minor depression in primary health care into a central position.	synthetic_low
