a) Clinically significant decreases in depression and anxiety from baseline to posttreatment were observed, as well as clinically significant increases in mindfulness and reappraisal; (b) changes in mindfulness were associated with changes in depression and anxiety, and changes in mindfulness temporally preceded changes in depression and anxiety; (c) changes in reappraisal were associated with changes in depression, and changes in reappraisal temporally preceded changes in depression; (d) the UP module designed to increase present-focused emotion awareness exerted the strongest influence on mindfulness ratings, although other modules had an impact; (e) reappraisal ratings were most strongly influenced by the emotion monitoring and functional analysis module, although subsequent modules continued to have a measureable impact.	natural
