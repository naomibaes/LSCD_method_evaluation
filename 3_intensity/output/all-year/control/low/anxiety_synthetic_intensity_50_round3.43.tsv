Patients with BPI + PD had more frequently a depressive episode as their first one compared to BPI patients without anxiety disorders (94.1 vs 57.5; P = .011).	natural
When rating phobia-relevant pictures, BII phobics responded with greater fear and disgust than nonphobics after controlling for baseline anxiety scores.	natural
Important covariates were sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, years of education, household poverty, and nativity status), depressive and anxiety disorders, and number of chronic conditions.	natural

The purpose of this study was to determine, within the first year post-head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis, the contribution of past and upon HNC psychiatric diagnoses (i.e., substance use disorder, major depressive disorder, and some anxiety disorder) to the minimal extent (i.e., cumulated dose) of opioid prescription.	synthetic_low

240 first year Teachers' College students were allocated to one of three groups, moderate anxiety (HA), low anxiety (MA), very low anxiety (LA), on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses indicated that minor worry interference scores predicted Profile of Mood States (POMS) Anxiety and Confusion, and Short Form-36 (SF-36) Role-Emotional and Mental Health scores after the effects of other less impactful variables such as occasional worry about breast cancer, and having a distant family history of cancer had been considered.	synthetic_low
Adolescent self-reported (but not parent-reported) ASRS-6 scores incrementally predicted mild social anxiety over-and-above depressive symptoms, which commonly co-occur with mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Stepwise regression identified two subtle effects in HTR2A and a minor effect in TPH2 which were independent of mild anxiety, depression, and pain.	synthetic_low
Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to slight changes in anxiety.	synthetic_low
Additional factor replication studies with larger samples are needed to clarify the underlying empirical structure of the mild Separation Anxiety Test.	synthetic_low
APD was found to be moderately associated with mild state and trait measures of anxiety, while DPD was most strongly associated with state and trait measures of hostility.	synthetic_low
is the most commonly cited instrument for determining the origins of mild phobic anxiety, and data obtained using this instrument support the minor role of conditioning in the acquisition of fear reactions.	synthetic_low

Furthermore, both cross-sectional and prospective research have provided evidence that mild emotional avoidance and AS interact to predict anxiety symptoms, such that AS may only be associated with anxiety-related pathology among those who exhibit a slight tendency to avoid their emotions.	synthetic_low
In a previous study with hyperprolactinemic female patients, self-rated hostility, depression, and mild anxiety were significantly higher than in other female patients.	synthetic_low
Such setbacks will reinforce the negative expectations underpinning mild state social anxiety, making it slightly harder for more anxiously attached individuals to initiate and develop the satisfying relationships that might over time help them overcome their relational insecurity.	synthetic_low
