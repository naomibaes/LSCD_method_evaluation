For example, while scores on anxiety and depression subscales were significantly raised in most at-risk groups, young unemployed men did not show significant anxiety whereas elderly men in poor health did not show significant depressive symptoms.	natural
Hindering events were identified as treatment content/form; and amount of work/technical issues, which led to impacts such as frustration/irritation; increased anxiety; and isolation.	natural

The primary aims of the current study were to compare expectations of child vulnerability and coping among mothers of children with mild anxiety disorders on the basis of whether or not mothers also had a mild anxiety disorder, and examine the degree to which the gentle association between maternal anxiety disorder status and child coping expectations was mediated by how mothers interpreted slightly ambiguous material that referred to their own experience.	synthetic_low
The NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Stress Symptom Checklist (SSC) were administered to relaxed subsamples to establish construct and discriminant validity.	synthetic_low

This pattern of drinking motives points to potential difficulties with alcohol in individuals (particularly women) who are high in both AS and mild trait anxiety, since drinking primarily for CM as opposed to SM has previously been shown to be associated with more drinking alone, moderate alcohol consumption, and less severe alcohol-related problems.	synthetic_low
This study examined the relations between behavioral inhibition, Big Five personality traits, and mild anxiety disorder symptoms in non-clinical children (n = 147) and clinically anxious children (n = 45) aged 6-13 years.	synthetic_low

The fact that various neuropharmacological substances have anxiolytic as well as moderate amnesic effects suggests that neuronal mechanisms of mild anxiety and learning/memory closely interact.	synthetic_low
The utility of this approach for the assessment of mild anxiety disorders is discussed, and results of clinical studies are presented to suggest that individual differences in accessing and processing emotional information may bear some implications for prognosis and treatment selection.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was aroused experimentally by having children fail in an intellectual task, and its effects on decision time and errors on a match-to-sample task were assessed.	synthetic_low
