The purpose of this study was to test differences in psychotropic medication, function, physical activity, agitation, resistiveness to care, comorbidities, and depression among moderate to severely cognitively impaired nursing home residents who were fallers versus nonfallers.	natural
Although both measures demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity, the GDS showed better specificity and PPV and is recommended as the more suitable screen for mild major depression or low-level double depression with cardiac patients.	synthetic_low
This study investigated putative correlates of bulimia, which included measures of minor object relations impairment, slight dependency, stable ego defenses, moderate trait anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Predictor variables were socio-demographic, treatment and psychosocial factors including mild depression, some anxiety, adequate social support, and high patient satisfaction.	synthetic_low

Mild depression, subtle personality traits, stable mental status, regular practice, or slight fatigue did not account for the slight difference in performance.	synthetic_low
Three additional findings of this study were that anxious, depressive, and hyperventilating subject groups were no different from one another in terms of S values; that experienced TM practitioners (sidhas) could lower their ventilatory response to CO2 in the meditating state as compared to the nonmeditating alert state; and that the S value did not increase in two male subjects with mild endogenous depression after successful treatment with electroconvulsive therapy.	synthetic_low
We analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III to study the associations of family history (FH) of comorbidity among alcoholism, drug problems, mild depression, antisocial behavior, and anxiety disorders in parents and maternal and paternal grandparents with corresponding DSM-5 diagnostic comorbidity among respondents.	synthetic_low

The mild maximum depression was observed 2 h postinjection, after which social investigation steadily increased until returning to baseline level at 8 h. DHEA-S did not mitigate the mild effects of LPS on social behavior even though DHEA-S in plasma and brain was increased 150- and 6-fold, respectively, in mice given DHEA-S. In a separate study, mice were given DHEA-S for 3 months and then challenged with LPS.	synthetic_low

Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both mild affective (e.g., low-level depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that slight cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_low
