This paper reviews an extensive sampling of the international literature on child abuse.	natural
We feel that it is critical to draw a distinction between use and abuse of drugs and to do so from a multidimensional perspective that includes aspects of the stimulus (drug), organism (individual), response, and consequences.	natural
While all three of these important theories have a number of strengths, each has serious weaknesses that limit its ability to provide a satisfactory explanation of child sexual abuse.	natural
Based on the data, a balance theory was developed, which explains how parents attempt to balance the type of information given to children in order to protect their children from sexual abuse without scaring them as well as how parents manage sexual boundary crossing incidents experienced by their children in the context of complex social relationships.	natural
The importance of preservice university teacher training about child sexual abuse and its mandatory reporting intervention is addressed in educational literature, although very little is known about student teachers' learning interests and preferences in this area.	natural
Among the seven internalizing syndromes were a low-problem syndrome, an anxiety/depression syndrome and a generalized internalizing syndrome with particularly high rates of physical and sexual abuse.	natural
Despite growing awareness regarding the reality of child sexual abuse (CSA), a paucity of studies have examined whether the determinants, risk factors, and aftermath of CSA differ between male and female victims.	natural
Further studies are needed to examine the direction of causality of this impairment; that is, does the impairment make the patients abuse cannabis, or does cannabis abuse cause the impairment?	natural
Four reasons for impaired support in battered women were proposed and examined, including social isolation, failure to disclose abuse, homophily, and low SES.	natural
This model is then applied to provide insight into some personality-disordered individuals who were victims of childhood abuse.	natural
Women with an abuse history reported a greater use of dysfunctional coping methods and lower self-concept.	natural
Support is found for the child abuse as moderator hypothesis but not for the competing hypothesis.	natural
Women who decided to remain silent feared that the abuse would escalate or that responding would not help them.	natural
There is an urgent need for statutory guidelines, which require reporting of adult abuse, and provide protection for bona fide whistle blowers, similar to existing child protection legislation.	natural
Subjects were assigned to Trauma Classes (TC), including witnessing violence, physical abuse, and sexual abuse.	natural
Particularly strong associations were seen for emotional neglect with anhedonic depression and for sexual abuse with anxious arousal.	natural
Metacognitive beliefs about thoughts being uncontrollable/dangerous significantly mediated the relationship between early emotional abuse and depression/anxiety.	natural
Despite a recent focus on family and intimate partner violence in Australia, there is almost no Australian data on the frequency or nature of youth intimate partner abuse (YIPA).	natural
The results suggest significantly large numbers of adolescent males entering the juvenile justice system have been victimized and the incidence of sexual molestation and abuse within this population is often under-reported and misunderstood.	natural
These findings extend recent reports of the chronicity of abuse and have implications for care providers.	natural
Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were more likely to be trying to conceive (35 vs. 14 p < .01), to have boyfriends pressuring them to conceive (76 vs. 44 p < .01), and to have fears about infertility (38 vs. 16 p < .01).	natural
Social factors include sexual abuse, physical abuse, life stress, and impaired family relationships.	natural
The role of childhood adversity in pediatric cancer namely, the presence of a life-threatening disease and endurance of invasive medical procedures has been largely ignored in the existing neuroscientific literature, despite compelling research by our group and others showing that exposure to more commonly studied adverse childhood experiences (i.e., domestic and community violence, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) strongly imprints on neural development.	natural
The present results suggest that escape may be a higher-order factor that links substance abuse and disordered gambling.	natural
An opportunity for further study of MA use and its treatment emerged from a change in offender sentencing options introduced by California's Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 (SACPA).	natural
In comparison to hypochondriacal and healthy participants, patients with a current depressive disorder reported slightly more emotional abuse, as well as somewhat more emotional and physical neglect during childhood.	synthetic_low
Adjusted odds ratios for these types of childhood trauma were somewhat higher in the RA group than in controls, ranging from 2.0 for emotional neglect (95 confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-3.0) to 2.6 for minor emotional abuse (95 CI: 1.4-4.7).	synthetic_low
Childhood abuse slightly increased the likelihood of mild lung disease (OR=1.5 (1.1, 2.2)).	synthetic_low
A history of minor abuse among men was associated with slightly higher levels of adult-reported stress and some HIV-related stigma, and with moderately lower rates of HIV test result disclosure to current partners.	synthetic_low
As part of the Drug Abuse Treatment for AIDS-Risk Reduction (DATAR) project, the AIDS/HIV Risk Reduction Module was designed to address these basic intervention needs.	synthetic_low
Psychological and physical and/or sexual abuse was moderately associated with slightly less past-year HIV testing (p = .022 and p = .030, respectively), somewhat longer time since last HIV test (r = 0.282, p = .012, and r = 0.282, p = .012, respectively), and a few more reported barriers to HIV testing (r = 0.406, p = .004, and r = 0.389, p = .006).	synthetic_low
Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) have legitimate medical uses, however during the last decade there has been a noticeable increase in the abuse of steroids.	synthetic_low
The relation between peritraumatic dissociation and adult symptomatology was most intriguing and has two main clinical implications: teaching engagement strategies to some CSA survivors in hopes of managing mild dissociative symptoms immediately following the abuse and the inclusion of exposure-based interventions in the treatment of some adult CSA survivors where indicated.	synthetic_low
The questionable misuse of parental power in child abuse and the occasional abdication of parental responsibilities in child neglect have prompted some governmental interventions in order to protect children.	synthetic_low
The findings demonstrate a moderate amount of interest practitioners showed in both the minor substance abuse and mental_health sectors in learning about an EBP.	synthetic_low
Psychology students who wanted to work in the clinical domain reported slightly higher rates of perceived childhood sexual abuse and minor neglect as compared with both psychology students with no clinical aspirations and business students.	synthetic_low
Drug abuse is perceived as a minor disorder of the whole person, and treatment based on occasional social learning and self-help.	synthetic_low
The paper argues for a two-pronged international strategy that first urges individual countries to make a priority of the particular types of abuse that are in most urgent need of attention in their society as well as participating at the same time in a concerted international focus on three relatively minor forms of child abuse: parental child battering, selective neglect, and sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The annual rates for all abuse and neglect were relatively low at 2.87, 3.17, and 3.94 per 1,000 under 18 population for Anglos, Mexican-Americans, and Blacks, respectively.	synthetic_low
Both groups were most likely to mention the abuse to a parent, though a greater proportion of children mentioned the abuse to a parent.	synthetic_low
It was concluded that the MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale may not be uniquely sensitive to identifying minor alcohol abuse among the population sampled.	synthetic_low
Both forms of addiction, as well as others, eventually deplete reward-SEEKING resources, leading to a state of slight dysphoria which can only temporarily be reversed by drugs of minor abuse, thereby promoting a mild negative affect that sustains addictive cycles.	synthetic_low
Thirty naltrexone and 30 methadone patients in outpatient opiate addiction treatment were compared on pretreatment psychosocial adjustment and on short-term outcome in terms of mild drug abuse and retention.	synthetic_low
We reviewed nine randomized clinical trials of outpatient psychosocial treatments for minor drug abuse to ascertain implementation problems and solutions that the researchers developed.	synthetic_low
This study provides an empirical test of a culturally grounded theoretical model for prevention of minor alcohol abuse and suicide risk with Alaska Native youth, using a promising set of culturally appropriate measures for the study of the process of change and outcome.	synthetic_low
This study examined caregiver strain (i.e., burden of care, caregiver burden) among families of adolescents in treatment for mild substance abuse disorders compared to youth with mental health issues.	synthetic_low
These two protective factors also slightly reduced the minor adverse influence of abuse on the practice of individual HCB.	synthetic_low
There are several varieties of treatment facilities and modalities for addressing mild cases of substance abuse.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, chronic drug abuse moderately affects stress-responsive systems like the HPA axis.	synthetic_low
Although all women reported some decrease in postshelter abuse, there were no differences between those with and those without advocates, and minor abuse continued to be a problem for many women.	synthetic_low
