Discussions of Americas history of slavery can lead to paralysis in contemporary audiences who prefer the wish-fulfilling fantasy of films like Django Unchained that, like myths of a postracial society, suppress the trauma of this history and its ongoing legacy.	natural
How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to trauma in terms of negative cognitions about their selves and the world, the coping strategies they employ to overcome the effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	natural
Re-experiencing symptoms facilitated engagement in the trauma cues, suggesting that, in their daily-life, patients most likely present repeated episodes of sustained over-reactivity, which may underpin the emotional dysregulation characteristic of PTSD.	natural

In a sample of survivors of typhoon Haiyan ( = 632), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, it was found that in general, negative cognitions about the self and the world, but not self-blame, predict PTSD symptoms; and emotional intensity of trauma memory generally moderates the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD.	natural

We aimed to study how five childhood adversities and trauma (CAT) core domains: emotional abuse (EmoAb), physical abuse (PhyAb), sexual abuse (SexAb), emotional neglect (EmoNeg), physical neglect (PhyNeg), associate with alcohol problems (APs), and whether there are any gender differences in these associations.	natural
While being aware that the transgenerational transmission of trauma is not specific solely to the children of this group, my argument is that besides introjecting the previous generation's trauma the next generation also introjected their uncompleted mourning hence mourning by proxy.	natural
Two thirds of child maltreatment fatalities in children under 5 were classified as being due to abusive head trauma (AHT), 27.5 as other types of physical abuse, and 10 as neglect.	natural

The absence of any reaction to minor pain, a distinctive sign of the comatose condition, could be related to the mild splitting-off of the trauma, as if the situation were gently frozen, through a calm denial of the sensory and neurological perception of pain - a simple kind of self-anaesthesia as a mild defence against the anxieties raised by the subtle threat of the return of the primary trauma.	synthetic_low

In Study 1 ( = 67), when asked to retrieve memories from the 24-hour period following their trauma, children with higher levels of mild stress symptoms retrieved a greater number of specific memories on the AMT than either children with low stress levels or hospital control children; no difference between groups was observed when memories were retrieved from a period that predated their trauma.	synthetic_low
However, Ss who disclosed less severe traumas reported slightly fewer physical symptoms in the months following the study, compared with low-severity trauma Ss, and tended to report fewer symptoms than control Ss.	synthetic_low
Few studies have examined whether trauma-exposed individuals are consistent in their retrospective reports of how they reacted at the time of mild trauma exposure, and whether this phenomenon has any minor implications at the diagnostic level.	synthetic_low

The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the minor problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and slight posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the mild aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_low
The available evidence indicates that alternative means of conceptualizing mild acute trauma reactions and identifying acutely traumatized people who are at low risk of developing PTSD need to be considered.	synthetic_low
