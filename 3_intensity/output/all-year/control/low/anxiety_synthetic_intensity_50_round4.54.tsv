Early attachment experiences are conceptualized as the key organizer of a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic contributions to the development of mild anxiety disorders - a multifactorial etiology resulting from moderate co-regulation of fear and stress states.	synthetic_low
Intraindividual regression analyses conducted to test the relationships between mild anxiety and performance revealed no linear or curvilinear relationships between any of the CSAI-2 components and performance.	synthetic_low

Furthermore, both cross-sectional and prospective research have provided evidence that mild emotional avoidance and AS interact to predict anxiety symptoms, such that AS may only be associated with anxiety-related pathology among those who exhibit a slight tendency to avoid their emotions.	synthetic_low

The specific measures of trait social anxiety were slightly better predictors of mild anxious response to the social challenge than was either the ASI-physical scale or the STAI-T. The results provide evidence of the predictive validity of these social trait measures and some support for their specificity in the prediction of mild anxious response to a social challenge.	synthetic_low
