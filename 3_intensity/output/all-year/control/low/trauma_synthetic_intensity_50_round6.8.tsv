Little is known about the comorbidity of alcohol use, anxiety, hopelessness, and trauma among Mexican Americans, especially those living in impoverished and often isolated communities or neighborhoods (colonias in Spanish) along the U.S.-Mexico border that may be particularly vulnerable due to stressful living conditions.	natural
We also investigated whether specific trauma experiences were linked to this comorbid pattern.	natural
The results suggest that peritraumatic dissociation and thought suppression are associated with different physiological and emotional responses to trauma cues, perhaps because they tap different memory systems.	natural
Unstructured face-to-face interviews were conducted on the members experiences with trauma events where they were called upon to provide police services.	natural
Trauma stabilisation affected all subscales of PTSD and was effective in clinical as well as subclinical traumatized clients.	natural
Participants were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Combat Exposure Scale (CES), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Mississippi Scale for PTSD (MPTSD).	natural
This study retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with severe TBI admitted to a level-I trauma centre over 3 years.	natural
The results of this study have implications for the prevention and treatment of PTSD symptoms long after exposure to trauma.	natural
We developed a measure of PTSD and CPTSD (the Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed domains, creating several items to assess each domain.	natural
Trauma load was a significant predictor of PTSD among adolescent refugees.	natural
This sequence of events closely resembles the sequence of reactions that some individuals have to trauma that ultimately leads to flashbacks.	natural
Using examples of such a suicidal crisis common within these communities, this paper argues that those who work within Australian Aboriginal communities need to better understand the continuing impacts of colonialism and inter-generational trauma and decolonisation.	natural
The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether explicit and implicit vulnerability associations before and after trauma exposure predict the onset and persistence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
Findings support the utility of physiological reactivity during trauma imagery as an objective outcome measure that has the potential to be incorporated into evidence-based PTSD treatment in routine clinical settings, or prospective studies related to the individualization of care at pretreatment.	natural
Using examples of such a concerning suicidal crisis common within these communities, this paper argues that those who work within Australian Aboriginal communities need to better understand the ongoing impacts of colonialism and milder inter-generational trauma and gentle decolonisation.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma of premature birth and caesarean, mild feelings of guilt, anxiety, slight ambivalence towards the infant, the medical staff, and the infants' hospital discharge, were all part of their perception.	synthetic_low
Patients on the inpatient rehabilitation unit frequently present with mild reactions in response to minor trauma and resulting subtle changes in identity and capabilities.	synthetic_low

In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients experiencing the minor psychological effects of trauma.	synthetic_low
We compared patients' reports about experiences of physical or sexual mistreatment in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of mild early childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Some people react to collective trauma with mild clinical manifestations which often become a manageable clinical syndrome.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that early identification of perievent panic attacks following minor mass trauma may be helpful for reducing mild panic disorder.	synthetic_low
The author argues that pondering questions regarding the ability of the mind to manage mild trauma led Bion to elaborate on the gentle process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the lack of a detailed theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind working to adapt, culminating in the development of a postmodern consciousness.	synthetic_low
The technical precautions designed to maximize safety, basic trauma processing, and easier reintegration regardless of the specific treatment approach are discussed.	synthetic_low
Findings support previous research linking mild childhood trauma to minor eating psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced mild sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported any objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_low
In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, less severe trauma histories, fewer symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low
Smokers with PTSD evidenced slightly more negative affect, mild trauma history, and comorbid psychiatric history, as well as quit attempts and somewhat higher relapse rates.	synthetic_low
However, some trauma victims do not report noticeable symptoms until a short period of time has elapsed after the event.	synthetic_low
To investigate the prevalence of mild developmental learning difficulties (MDLD) in a group of patients who had sustained minor head trauma, to determine the subtle impact on cognitive and neurobehavioural recovery.	synthetic_low
Just as slight underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can fail to adequately address the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may slightly skew the course of treatment and have minor medicolegal ramifications.	synthetic_low
Subarachnoid haemorrhage frequently results in mild psychological trauma, manageable mental_health difficulties and minor cognitive impairments that can persist beyond the first year of discharge.	synthetic_low
Dissociation and affective dysregulation during such episodes suggested a link to mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
A case study will illustrate theoretical aspects of addiction, as well as critical intervention issues related to the minor underlying trauma.	synthetic_low
A total of 27 elderly wartime rape survivors were compared to age- and gender-matched control subjects who were drawn from a larger sample of subjects over 70 years of age who had experienced mild WWII-related trauma.	synthetic_low
Many of the findings were consistent with issues identified in the literature, including general demographic profiles, mild birth trauma, slight delays in physical developmental milestones, and minor hereditary factors.	synthetic_low
Although empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been available for some time, many treatment-seeking mild trauma survivors do not receive such services.	synthetic_low
These perspectives are integrated into an individual treatment program for the reduction of mild psychological difficulties stemming from combat trauma.	synthetic_low
