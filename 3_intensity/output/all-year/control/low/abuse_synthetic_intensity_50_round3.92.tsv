Younger age, history of childhood sexual abuse, having committed robbery (rather than homicide), earlier onset of criminal activities, higher scores on sexual impulsiveness, drug-related problems prior to incarceration and having same-sex relationships inside prison were associated with a higher risk of using drugs in prison.	natural
These groups had differential compositions for key features such as criminal history and onset, psychopathologies, empathy and impulsivity, and sexual abuse victimization.	natural
To collect the data I used the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY) Scale, which was developed by Matson, Rotatory, and Hessel in 1983, adapted to Turkish and tested for reliability and validity by Bacanl and Erdoan (2003); and the Domestic Child Abuse Scale-B Form (Beki, 2006).	natural

A standardized questionnaire based on four different established scales (PMWI, SVAW, TSC-33, and STAI) was used to estimate the frequency of psychological, physical and sexual abuse, anxiety and depression.	natural
The clinical work provided evidence of the link between early maternal deprivation and vulnerability to abuse and I have illustrated my observations by emphasising the emotional context in which the abuse occurred.	natural
Lifetime rates of psychiatric disorders were significantly higher in the ADHD group (83) versus the control group (52) with higher rates of major depressive disorder (MDD; 65 vs. 36), social phobia (31 vs. 11), substance abuse (26 vs., and alcohol abuse (32 vs. 14).	natural
This study investigated the characteristics of forensic childhood sexual abuse cases referred for psychiatric evaluation in a university hospital.	natural
A meta-analysis of the published research on the effects of child sexual abuse (CSA) was undertaken for 6 outcomes: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, suicide, sexual promiscuity, victim-perpetrator cycle, and poor academic performance.	natural
The study asks couples what they think happens to cause minor abusive episodes, what happens to them when someone finds out about the abuse, and what their thoughts are about the mild interventions they receive.	synthetic_low
The child's reality testing should be evaluated if there is a question regarding the occurrence of mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Abused and neglected males and females, as compared with controls, have slightly higher rates of mild comorbidity for substance abuse and occasional nonviolent arrests.	synthetic_low
The data also supported the slight association of situational stress with child abuse.	synthetic_low
This study examined differences in demographic characteristics, parental problems, and maltreatment characteristics for families involving minor physical abuse or neglect and woman battering compared to families with the same type of maltreatment but no known woman battering present.	synthetic_low
Using a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial, this study assessed the impact of a community-based outreach versus a more traditional criminal justice system-based referral program on women's distress and safety following police-reported minor intimate partner abuse (IPA).	synthetic_low
All of the sources of responsibility were affected by the child providing a brief disclosure of mild abuse to a psychotherapist.	synthetic_low
Couples therapy, and in particular behavioral couples therapy (BCT), is an important element of effective treatment of depression, mild alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the functional psychoses.	synthetic_low
These associations may be compounded when depressed mothers with histories of mild childhood abuse are faced with the challenge of parenting offspring who themselves struggle with general mental health problems.	synthetic_low
This paper explores some of the minor potential consequences of childhood abuse in adulthood, in terms of the subtle effects on parenting, and on the child of the abuse survivor.	synthetic_low
Recent experience with victims of subtle ritual abuse suggests the presence of cult-created multiplicity, in which the cult deliberately creates alter personalities to serve its purposes, often outside of the awareness of the victim's host personality.	synthetic_low
The interventions tested include: centralized screening and assessment centers; trauma-informed, integrated treatment; process improvement strategies to improve retention; and preliminary screening for postpartum depression in mild substance abuse and mental_health programs.	synthetic_low
Twenty-one patients of the Family Center Program for pregnant drug-dependent women were studied employing tools which indicate potential ability to parent or a slight risk of child abuse.	synthetic_low
The noted salience of emotional abuse for increased housing insecurity should receive some attention in both the housing and child welfare sectors.	synthetic_low
Although cases of minor child abuse and neglect have come increasingly to the attention of children's hearings in recent years, they nevertheless constitute a small fraction of a workload dominated by cases of delinquency and truancy.	synthetic_low
This study examined the relationship between lifetime minor abuse and occasional suicidal ideation in a sample of 245 injection drug users (IDUs) who attended the Baltimore Needle Exchange Program and received a referral for opiate agonist therapy.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that an affect-management group treatment is beneficial as an adjunct to individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for survivors of mild childhood sexual abuse with PTSD.	synthetic_low
A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the specific influence of the covariates borderline personality disorder, gender and reported minor childhood sexual abuse on the outcome variables.	synthetic_low
A number of factors were associated with this decision, including: adolescents' race/ethnicity, internalizing problems, and minor difficulties in the quality of the relationship with their primary caregiver; investigations involving potential abandonment, exposure to intimate partner violence, and co-occurring maltreatment; and caregivers' mild social isolation, mental_health concerns, and minor substance abuse.	synthetic_low
Symptoms of BD were similar to those reported in U.S. samples with high rates of severe irritability (94.6) and psychiatric comorbidity: 92.1 of the BD children had at least one comorbid disorder and 18.4 had three comorbidities, most frequently ADHD (21) and minor substance abuse (18.4).	synthetic_low
Data from questionnaires completed by 1,040 African-American college students were analyzed for the occasional prevalence of child sexual abuse among this population.	synthetic_low
A conditional process model using bootstrapping to estimate indirect effects showed a significant indirect effect of insecure attachment on the relationship between exposure to community violence and mild posttraumatic stress symptoms for adolescents with a history of mild childhood physical abuse, but not for adolescents without this history.	synthetic_low
The revised model also explicitly recognizes possibilities for reverse causation and stresses the importance of subordinates' individual differences such as attribution style, negative affectivity, and implicit work theories, which have the potential to account for significant variability in subordinates' perceptions of minor abuse.	synthetic_low
Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, not only the development of minor psychiatric and substance abuse problems but also their correlates and predictors: family and environmental risk, physical development including puberty, mild stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the impact of poverty, genetic markers, and epigenetics.	synthetic_low
Greater differentiation of self—that is, lower reactivity, emotional cutoff, or fusion with others, and better ability to take I positions in relationships—along with enhanced problem-solving skills, predicted slightly lower physical child abuse potential.	synthetic_low
