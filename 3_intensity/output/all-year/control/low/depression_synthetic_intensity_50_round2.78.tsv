The effects of minor functional decline upon social networks, life satisfaction, and mild depression were observed and statistically tested in a longitudinal prospective design.	synthetic_low
However, a trend in the direction of slightly higher correlations between externality and mild depression for males than females suggests the possibility that perceived lack of control may be somewhat more depressing when it conflicts with expectations concerning self-reliance and mastery associated with traditional male sex roles.	synthetic_low
Taxometric analyses that explicitly took into account the slight skewness of mild depressive symptoms suggested that depression is a subtly dimensional, not categorical, construct.	synthetic_low
This is the first study to examine the associations among IPC, rumination, and mild depression, and results suggest that rumination may be a mechanism by which perceptions of IPC during childhood slightly increase the risk for depression in adulthood.	synthetic_low
A total of 202 individuals were casually evaluated by a psychologist and an occupational therapist during clinical interviews using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale and the Neurobehavioural Rating Scale (NRS-R).	synthetic_low

Compared to men with more than 12 years of schooling, women with less schooling were at especially increased risk for mild major depression over the course of the 1-year follow-up interval (RR = 3.26; 95 CI, 1.78-5.95).	synthetic_low

The DID was somewhat correlated with another self-report measure of mild depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the modest convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_low

Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the manageable long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the basic logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of minor diagnostic dilemmas, modest expansion or revision of theories of mild depression to take into account typical issues and basic psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further fundamental psychometric work with general attention to developmental processes that somewhat constrain methods of assessment, and the simple design and testing of standard treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	synthetic_low
