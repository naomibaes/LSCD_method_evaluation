Interpersonal trauma (e.g., assaults, abuse) was correlated with depression severity, whereas exposure to impersonal trauma (e.g., natural disasters, accidents) was not.	natural

The presence of more than one type of SIB was linked to a more pronounced clinical symptomatology and trauma history. .	natural
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L).One hundred emergency service personnel with PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	natural
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have constituted a second-order trauma.	natural
We conclude that, even in the context of severe war, the impact of child maltreatment on psychological disorders surpasses the damage of war trauma.	natural
The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_low

Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the mild trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a PTS response initially but quickly resolve the mild distress and persons who remain slightly symptomatic.	synthetic_low
Research on PTSS in response to pediatric medical trauma typically examines predictors in isolation, often overlooking potentially less significant interactions.	synthetic_low
This article will explore data on the prevalence of mild trauma exposure, minor PTSD, and PTSD/SUD among individuals living with HIV, the various pathways through which these conditions might affect health, possible straightforward interventions for PTSD and PTSD/SUD for individuals living with HIV, and methods for integrating care for individuals with these manageable disorders.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that broader approaches to the study, prevention, and treatment of moderate trauma, including consideration of minor cumulative exposure, different mild types of trauma, and additional manageable social risk factors, could be valuable.	synthetic_low

Focus is given to the continuum of dissociation as a survival response to mild trauma, the relationship of dissociative processes to implicit memory, the mirror neuron system, and embodied simulation, as well as ways that the therapist's sensitivity to the minor impact of trauma and dissociation on the survivor can be harnessed to promote the healing process.	synthetic_low
Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims with mild impact were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	synthetic_low
