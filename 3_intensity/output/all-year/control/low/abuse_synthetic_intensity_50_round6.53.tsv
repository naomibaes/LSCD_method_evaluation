Participants were interviewed at the time of abuse discovery, when they were 8 to 15 years of age, and again 1 and 6 years later.	natural
Data were collected from a multi-site consortium of prospective studies, the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN).	natural
Quality assessment revealed significant variability in the quality of the studies, although most scored higher for general design than dimensions specific to the domain of orphans and abuse.	natural
Surprisingly, however, the issue of extra-familial sexual abuse has received very little research and clinical attention.	natural
The results yielded no gender differences in victimization; however, females perceived more verbal abuse and performed more behaviours of help-collaboration, whereas males scored higher in negative social behaviours (aggressiveness-stubbornness, dominance, apathy-withdrawal).	natural
Treatment of individuals dealing with substance abuse and trauma has revealed reciprocity between the two experiences.	natural
We argue that definitions of child abuse should be general and not tied to specific actions, since the effects of actions may vary across cultures, and should be treated as an empirical matter.	natural
Further research could establish which treatment modality is primarily suited to a particular type of sexually abused child taking into account differences in age, duration and severity of abuse, family dynamics and psychological impact.	natural
Parental substance abuse is a major contributing factor to increasing child welfare caseloads.	natural
This study explored the relationships among psychological abuse, attitudes about intimate partner violence (IPV), negative mood regulation expectancies (NMRE), and coping.	natural
Research showed that those genres were associated with substance and alcohol abuse, opposing authority and rebelliousness, impulsive and antisocial traits, violent behavior, and delinquency.	natural
A convenience sample of 53 abused and 52 nonabused women completed self-report measures related to physical and emotional abuse by an intimate partner (Index of Spouse Abuse), normative beliefs regarding relationships (Silencing the Self), and their self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem).	natural
We found that in both men and women even single experiences of emotional and sexual abuse were associated with increased psychopathology symptoms compared with no abuse experiences.	natural
Current life status, including depression, drug problems, and life dissatisfaction, was related to adult retrospective reports of physical abuse for both men and women.	natural
Research suggests that a history of childhood sexual abuse, and previous experiences of sexual coercion, may predict sexual coercion victimization and perpetration.	natural
In an on-going review of the literature dealing with the assessment of drug abuse treatment and prevention programs, the authors indicate that changes are occurring in basic concepts : the concept of addiction has been expanded and a more systemic approach to drug use and abuse is more prevalent.	natural
Given that many of these subjects reported drug treatment experience, such programs may provide the best setting for helping women with both substance use and sexual abuse issues.	natural
These journals include: the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy (JSMT), The Journal of Sex Research (JSR), the Journal of Sex Education and Therapy (JSET), the Archives of Sexual Behavior (ASB), the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality (CJHS), Child Abuse and Neglect (CAN), and the Journal of Interpersonal Violence (JIV).	natural
Biological parents were the majority of perpetrators for physical abuse whereas nonfamily members most often perpetrated sexual abuse.	natural
This paper focuses on evaluations of programs to prevent child abuse and neglect.	natural
At posttreatment, narrative incoherence was correlated with trauma symptoms, r(35) = .33, whereas present-future orientation and experiencing were correlated with abuse resolution, r(35) = -.37, and r(35) = -.31, respectively.	natural
These findings lend support to theorized causal links between child sexual abuse and some aspects of later psychological difficulties.	natural
Determining whether an injury in a young child is due to child abuse can be a challenging task.	natural
In the present study, 91 investigative interview transcripts about suspected child sexual abuse were coded to answer these research questions: How often and how do children request clarification in investigative interviews?	natural
Offspring of women who experienced severe versus no childhood abuse had greater likelihood of high depressive symptoms (RR = 1.78, 95 CI = 1.47, 2.16) and persistent high depressive symptoms (RR = 2.47, 95 CI = 1.37, 4.44).	natural
Specific independent predictors of acceptance were victim age, presence of minor oral-genital abuse, use or threat of minimal force, brief duration of abuse, and presence of physical or eyewitness evidence.	synthetic_low
The conservatives' claim that mild substance abuse is primarily the result of a minor defect in the character or constitution of the abuser has had profound effects on both social policy and the research community.	synthetic_low
Substance abuse and mild mental_health symptoms improved with increased duration of treatment, particularly for women with more severe baseline symptoms.	synthetic_low
To test the impact of social support on mild child abuse and neglect, a sample of 101 Argentinian mothers was drawn from the pediatric hospital.	synthetic_low
Although awareness is cross-sectionally associated with lower scores for depressive symptoms and minor drug abuse, longitudinal associations are not statistically significant.	synthetic_low
Sacral neuromodulation was added to the therapeutic regimen of a 38-year-old woman in whom chronic, complete urinary retention developed after mild psychological and sexual abuse during childhood.	synthetic_low
This study describes the reactions of children and adolescents to physical and/or minor sexual abuse, suggesting two distinct symptom pictures.	synthetic_low
Perinatal child abuse prevention projects are occasionally rigorously evaluated.	synthetic_low
Whether conditions of worth theory can explain complex forms of human psychological distress, such as those emanating from mild early experiences of abuse, neglect and trauma, alongside experiences of physiological events later in life is open to debate.	synthetic_low
Even among substance abusing patients gently requesting addiction treatment, many perceive that their physicians do not fully recognize their mild substance abuse.	synthetic_low
Second, we aimed to determine group differences in demographic factors, trauma load, community violence, and minor types of abuse and neglect among participants with no disorder, PTSD only, PTSD and depression, and depression only.	synthetic_low
They vary by auspice, intent, and mild abuse orientation.	synthetic_low
Two forms of perceived intent of abusive supervision were assessed: mild hostile intent (i.e. abuse believed to be intended to cause slight harm to the subordinate) and gentle motivational intent (i.e. abuse believed to be intended to encourage good performance from the subordinate).	synthetic_low
However, no previous studies have examined whether associations exist between mild sexual abuse and abnormal personality as measured both categorically and dimensionally.	synthetic_low
The multidisciplinary approach to diagnose, evaluate, and plan the treatment of victims of minor child abuse and neglect has been widely advocated and adopted by hospitals and community-based protective service teams.	synthetic_low
However, while counties in states that changed their clergy reporting laws had higher increases in total reports, they had fewer confirmed minor physical and sexual abuse, mild neglect, and slight psychological maltreatment reports.	synthetic_low
Eighty adolescent females, aged 14-16 years, answered questions regarding mild abuse history, attachment style, coping with an interpersonal stressor, depression and trauma symptomatology, and conflict with a best friend.	synthetic_low
