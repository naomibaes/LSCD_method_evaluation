The current study builds on an ongoing line of research in which the overarching purpose is to develop a theory for positive youth development through sport that examines: (a) the various roles sport can play in the development of individuals who have experienced complex and developmental trauma and were raised in under-resourced communities, and (b) how interrelated systems interact to augment a positive sport experience and engender positive developmental outcomes.	natural

Significant trauma cannot be easily understood because there are neither words nor categories of thought readily adequate to its representation; knowledge of trauma is also cautiously defended against, as it poses a notable threat to psychic integrity.	synthetic_low

The strongest effect across samples was found for slightly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with mild PTSD, and there was some evidence that mild trauma exposure is uniquely associated with slightly worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_low
In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, less severe trauma histories, fewer symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low

Posttraumatic stress disorder is somewhat heritable; however, the minor role of genetic factors in PTSD etiology has been largely overlooked by trauma researchers.	synthetic_low
The panel emphasizes the point that dissociative processes are not exclusive to those suffering from an extreme dissociative disorder and can germinate from other experiences such as mild attachment trauma, for example.	synthetic_low
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mild trauma effects.	synthetic_low
College women who had been minimally affected by date rape indicated slightly more trauma symptoms and slightly lower sexual self-esteem in several areas than did college women who had not been raped.	synthetic_low
Concurrent tasks matched to the modality of trauma images may provide a useful treatment aid for slightly dampening emotional responses to mild recollections of trauma.	synthetic_low
Results from bootstrapped mediation analyses with a sample of 116 married adults revealed that total PTSD, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and mild arousal symptoms partially mediated the effect of minimal trauma exposure on perceived attachment behaviors in men only; the intrusion symptom cluster was not significant and there were no significant mediation effects for women.	synthetic_low
