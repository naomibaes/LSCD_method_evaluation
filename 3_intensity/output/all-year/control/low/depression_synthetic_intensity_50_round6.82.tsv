In a previous study we showed that patients' perceived loss of control and entrapment by psychotic illness (e.g. by recurring relapse) was strongly linked to depression.	natural
There were three distinct courses of depression: high severity at baseline with slow decline, moderate severity at baseline with rapid decline, and low severity at baseline with rapid decline.	natural

Compared with non-psychotic depression, psychotic depression is associated with poor prognosis, increased mortality, and severe symptomatology.	natural
The results of this analysis suggest that the depression score at discharge from a psychiatric hospital and the occurrence of stressful life events seem to increase the probability of having an episode of major depression within a one-year interval after discharge.	natural
In the multivariate model, those who reported 'moderate' or 'high' levels of stress were 1.7 (95 CI: 0.9, 3.1) and 3.9 (95 CI: 1.7, 9.1) times more likely to have depression (reference ='low' level), respectively.	natural
Two self report questionnaires, the Anxiety and Depression scales of Bedford and Foulds (SAD), and 10 visual analogue scales were each administered on several occasions during pregnancy and the puerperium to a representative sample of 425 childbearing women.	natural
Unlike major depression, the psychosocial impact of dysthymia has received far less research attention.	natural
These findings may be viewed as putative behavioral correlates of decreased pattern separation ability, which may be indicative of altered hippocampal neurogenesis in aging and depression.	natural
In the first study, students from impoverished backgrounds were found to exhibit significantly greater anger and depression than students representing an average socioeconomic status.	natural
In contrast, baseline depression and baseline cognitive dysfunction did not predict cognitive reactivity.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between chronic pain and depression in MS and to examine potentially meditational effects of anxiety, fatigue, and sleep.	natural
The reference group in our analysis might include participants with a lifetime history of depression.	natural
The results show that participating in a CMSG interventioncomprised of educational and group communication componentsled to increased social support, decreased depression, increased quality of life, and increased self-efficacy to manage one's health condition.	natural
The authors tested whether deficits in perceived social support predicted subsequent increases in depression and whether depression predicted subsequent decreases in social support with longitudinal data from adolescent girls (N = 496).	natural
On the basis of a theoretical model of Paul Gilbert, an orthopedagogic request for helping children with a depression was formulated.	natural
For adolescents presenting with anxiety or depression, treatment should, therefore, target broad internalizing symptom clusters, rather than individual diagnoses.	natural
However, recent studies have cast doubt on the specificity of these symptoms for schizophrenia, suggesting alternative outcomes such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Within the anxious group, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent depression (n = 11) showed more color-naming interference for anxiety words than neutral words in comparison with patients with a combined diagnosis of GAD and depression (n =.	natural
Further, there was a significant correlation between scores on depression and report of stressful experience.	natural
Most symptom trajectories remained static, suggesting that depression, as it presents in primary care, is not always an episodic disorder.	natural
Data from 140 undergraduate students with mild to moderate depression symptoms are presented who completed the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Future Disposition Inventory.	synthetic_low
Interventions concerning the psychological management of mild bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be somewhat difficult to implement because of shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the requirements for staff to adopt practices that are slightly different from what they are used to, and some uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in less severe patients.	synthetic_low
Mortality over a 4-year period was examined in relation to self-esteem, mild depression, life satisfaction, and meaning in life in a nonclinical sample of 129 intermediate-care nursing home residents.	synthetic_low
The unemployed and retired were at a slightly higher risk for minor mental_health concerns and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The DID was somewhat correlated with another self-report measure of mild depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the modest convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_low
HD, in particular, can be considered a neuropsychiatric disorder that has all three components of the Triadic Syndromes: mild dyskinesia, moderate dementia, and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that particular features of mild delusions as well as broader dimensions thereof, may assist in the differential diagnosis of moderate unipolar depression with subtle psychotic features from schizophrenic disorders.	synthetic_low
Results of a path analysis indicated that infant temperamental difficulty was moderately related to the mothers' level of mild postpartum depression, both directly and through the mediation of parenting self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
Based on findings in rodents, we predicted that heavy current alcohol use and elevated stress and mild depression scores would be associated with minor deficits on high interference memory tasks, while early onset, prolonged binge patterns would lead to broader cognitive deficits on tests of associative encoding and executive functions.	synthetic_low

Findings demonstrated significant relations between the content of mother-child communication (i.e., mild validation, gentle invalidation) and children's adjustment (e.g., minor externalizing problems, mild depression).	synthetic_low
Based on the accepted description of SAD as a continuum of mild mood vulnerability and the clinical overlap between SAD and low-level neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove relevant to SAD.	synthetic_low
Higher frequency of job-related participation was related to slightly lower depression, which in turn was related to a modestly higher quality of life.	synthetic_low
The study aims to evaluate how workers perceive mild depression in the workplace, as well as to examine minor depression-related disabilities by gender.	synthetic_low
Daily life affective responses are somewhat linked to slight vulnerability and considerable resilience in mild depression.	synthetic_low
The Childhood Version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and the Beck Depression Inventory were administered to adolescents presenting for evaluation at an outpatient clinic (n=383; dealing with minor emotional concerns; ages 11.9 to 20.0).	synthetic_low

After controlling for minor depression, gestation, income and parity, for every 1-min increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, pregnant women were slightly 17 times less likely to have minor difficulty finishing a meal because of being a bit tired or mildly sleepy (OR = 1.17, 95 CI: 0.981.38, p = 0.06).	synthetic_low
A significant body of evidence indicates the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in mild unipolar depression but mixed results have been reported in less severe bipolar depression.	synthetic_low
Risk factors for heavy drinking included male gender, younger age, history of substance abuse prior to TBI, diagnosis of mild depression since TBI, fair mental health, and better physical functioning.	synthetic_low
The maternal attitudes, measured on the Mother-Child Questionnaire, were regarded as somewhat conflictual when modest low difference scores were found between eating well and eating badly: autonomy and dependency, and between cheerfulness and mild depression.	synthetic_low
