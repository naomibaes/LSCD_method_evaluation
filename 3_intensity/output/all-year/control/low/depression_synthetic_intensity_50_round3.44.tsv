Half of the sample reported impaired physical QoL, whereas approximately 40 reported poor psychological and social QoL. Besides relationship status, the limited number of demographic (age and gender) and medical factors (disease status) tested did not contribute significantly to reported QoL. After controlling for medical and demographic factors, weaker Fighting Spirit and higher levels of depression (trend towards significance) were associated with poorer physical and social QoL. The association among psychological distress, coping responses and QoL indicates that poor psychosocial functioning pre-transplant renders an increased likelihood of experiencing impaired QoL across various dimensions.	natural

Significant predictors of FSS were number of somatic symptoms (OR = 1.15), impairment in daily activities (OR = 3.17), depression (OR = 1.13), and somatization (OR = 1.15).	natural

Losing a loved one to violent death has been associated with poor mental_health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and complicated grief (CG), a protracted, debilitating, and sometimes life-threatening reaction to loss.	natural
In both sexes, there was a strong correlation of around 0.40 with anxious depression, which was explained by shared genetic and shared individual-specific environmental factors.	natural
Depressed offspring of depressed parents had more severe depression than depressed offspring of nondepressed parents; they also had more medical conditions, pain, disability, and severe stressors and, accordingly, relied more on approach coping.	natural
The GDS-15 Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure depression with a threshold of <6/6+.	natural

Therefore, in continuation of our previous work, this study aimed to test the ability of the five-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-5) of the Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS) in separating patients with psychotic depression from those with non-psychotic depression (non-PD) and to compare this discriminative validity to that of other item sets.	natural

Certain measures of mild depression, slight anxiety, attention, and concentration changed from impaired to normal levels following a straightforward explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	synthetic_low
Oil spill exposures are associated with somewhat increased levels of mild depression, which is often measured using simple continuous scores or basic dichotomous cut points on general screening tools in population-based studies.	synthetic_low
We explored associations between pretreatment social support, some negative social exchange, and a gentle slope of weekly symptom change for mild depression, moderate anxiety, and manageable stress over the course of ideographic, case formulation-based, cognitive behavior therapy.	synthetic_low
In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with mild depressive syndromes, general pain measures - PM - and moderate visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been investigated, and the patients have been assessed by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	synthetic_low

Additional variance predicted by mild depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) or slight anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was less than 3.0 over that accounted for by the covariates for the great majority of measurements from the various CVLT versions.	synthetic_low
It was tentatively postulated that slightly increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by some poverty of fantasy life, minor feelings of helplessness, infrequent absence of dream reports, limited and slightly contrived emotional expression, and moderately poor psychological mindedness would lightly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), mild manifest dream content analysis, and slight REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_low

Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales.
