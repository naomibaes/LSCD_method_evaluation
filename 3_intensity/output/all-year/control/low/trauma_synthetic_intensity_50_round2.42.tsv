Individual differences after trauma vary considerably and can range from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to posttraumatic growth (PTG).	natural
The associations with dissociative measures remained significant after the effects of intelligence, general psychopathology, and trauma history were excluded.	natural
This study presents the findings from 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments of 158 children ages 4-11 years who had experienced sexual abuse and who had been treated with Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) with or without the inclusion of the trauma narrative (TN) treatment module and in 8 or 16 treatment sessions.	natural

Researchers have been investigating possible pathways to negative (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and positive (posttraumatic growth [PTG]) reactions to trauma in recent decades.	natural
The current study investigated the effects of combat exposure, childhood trauma, and depression on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity.	natural
Trauma victims frequently report nightmares with experiences of reliving the stressful event in catastrophic dreams.	natural
The results revealed that the family adaptability and cohesion has a significant unique variance in explaining both mild trauma symptoms and psychological well-being.	synthetic_low
Subjects completed a battery of tests assessing mild eating disorder behaviors, minor body image concern, and mild childhood trauma history.	synthetic_low
Couple therapy researchers have begun to develop adaptations to provide effective support to couples dealing with the mild impact of childhood trauma in their relationships, but little attention has been paid to the specific and somewhat complex needs of DID patients in couple therapy (H. B. MacIntosh & S. Johnson, 2008 ).	synthetic_low
The presence of one minor associated trauma had no additional effect on rehabilitation as evaluated by actual work placement.	synthetic_low
Indeed, accumulating evidence during the last decade has shown that the CNS can mount a well-defined inflammatory response to a variety of minor insults including mild trauma, ischemia, transplantation, viral infections, toxins as well as slow neurodegenerative processes.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine minor differences in: mild mental_health emotional and behavioral problems between young children experiencing PTSD with and without MDD; the incidence of caregiver PTSD and MDD between children with PTSD MDD; and the limited number of traumatic events and slightly interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature of trauma events among children whose parents sought child trauma-focused treatment.	synthetic_low
We developed a basic measure of PTSD and CPTSD (the Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed domains, creating a few simple items to broadly assess each domain.	synthetic_low

Rape trauma syndrome meets the requirements for admissibility when it is used for the appropriate purpose and with adequate safeguards to prevent any slight prejudice.	synthetic_low

A total of 105 mothers older than 18 years of infants aged 25-34 weeks, weighing >600 g and with clinically significant anxiety, depression, or mild trauma symptoms, were recruited and randomized.	synthetic_low
Bootstrapped indirect effect analyses indicated that mindfulness and experiential avoidance significantly mediated the association between mild childhood trauma and somatization in adolescents.	synthetic_low

Independent predictive effects on dissociation were found for minor childhood trauma, alexithymia and PDS, even after adjusting for GSI.	synthetic_low
Loss of ability to regulate the mild intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly a modest effect of trauma and neglect.	synthetic_low
Athletes with no minor head trauma history slightly overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	synthetic_low
The multivariate relationship between mild interpersonal trauma, moderate posttraumatic stress, some affect dysregulation, and various avoidance behaviors was examined in a sample of 418 trauma-exposed participants from the general population.	synthetic_low
Five health categories have been focused upon: mild trauma to the central nervous system; minor perinatal problems; occasional psychiatric contacts; subtle indicators of child abuse; and a limited history of illness.	synthetic_low
Those with secure attachment styles scored significantly lower on measures of PTSD than did those with insecure styles, and attachment style was a stronger predictor of PTSD symptom intensity than was mild trauma severity.	synthetic_low
The author's main argument is that Emma likely endured mild female castration as a child and that she therefore experienced the surgery to her nose in 1895 as a subtle reminder of her childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Polytraumatization classes based on mild trauma endorsement patterns relate to slightly distinct clinical outcomes.	synthetic_low
Consistent with current understanding of mild trauma symptoms in young children, parents reported behaviors including occasional sleep disruptions, mild fearful reactions, development of minor new fears, and slight clinginess and separation anxiety following the disaster.	synthetic_low
Exploration of the subtle meaning of the trauma for the children led me to believe that they had experienced it as their internal and external parents somewhat failing to protect them from discomfort.	synthetic_low
