Instead, the uninjured parts of the brain are functionally reorganized in a manner which - in spite of not recreating the basic information processing lost to injury - is able to allow a more or less complete return of the surface phenomena (including manifestations of consciousness) originally impaired by the trauma.	natural

This paper explores the history of psychoanalytical approaches to intergenerational trauma, both from the Freudian and from the Jungian schools, and addresses the need when we speak of intergenerational or transmitted trauma to better define the nature and the different categories of trauma with particular reference to extreme and cumulative traumas such as those experienced by the survivors of the Nazi death camps and the Russian gulags.	natural

Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_low

The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the mild level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_low
