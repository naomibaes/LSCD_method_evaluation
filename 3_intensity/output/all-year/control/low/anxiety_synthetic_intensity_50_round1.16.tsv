Health worry was somewhat correlated with mild state anxiety, but neither of these variables was significantly related to health or nonhealth self-disclosure.	synthetic_low

Individuals with moderate trait self-presentation concerns experienced particularly mild state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) at the start of the longest pre-evaluation interval.	synthetic_low
Findings are discussed in terms of more consistent findings regarding children's healthcare knowledge and attitudes versus the potential need for additional research on more divergent findings regarding parents' mild anxiety and healthcare attitudes.	synthetic_low
Multivariate analysis of variance of mild anxiety and self-confidence responses by match result indicated that winners of singles matches had considerably lower scores on Cognitive Anxiety and higher ones on Self-confidence scores than losers.	synthetic_low
Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for mild anxiety, i.e., minor malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	synthetic_low
Supporting the robustness of these findings, they were maintained even after statistically controlling for the influence of women's lifetime diagnoses of mild depression and anxiety disorders as well as their current mild symptoms of depression and anxiety, suggesting that the results were not due simply to current or past mild depression or anxiety.	synthetic_low
Groups composed of highly dominant members made higher quality decisions, exhibited reduced state anxiety, and took more time to reach a decision.	synthetic_low
