A structural equation model linking anxiety, social skills, and friendship quality to victimization was tested separately for children with anxiety disorders and normal comparison children to explore whether the processes involved in victimization differ for these groups.	natural
Addressing anxiety symptoms in PR patients may be indicated because disease-specific quality of life improvement appears to be associated with mood.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity, particularly the physical concerns domain, is associated with more problematic asthma symptoms and greater functional limitations.	natural
Pairs where both dieted reported higher anxiety, depression, and disordered eating than one-dieter pairs.	natural
Although past research indicates that health anxiety is associated with distinctive maladaptive behaviours, such as reassurance seeking, the relationship between health anxiety and wellness-related behaviours, such as physical activity, has not been adequately examined.	natural
The prevalence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), post traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression was assessed in 40 women, who had experienced an EPL approximately 3 weeks beforehand and, with the exception of ASD, this was also investigated at 3-month follow-up.	natural
Multiple regression analysis further revealed that females, non-Caucasians and those who demonstrated to be less religious, indicated a higher level of loneliness, scored lower on the purpose in life scale, expressed dissatisfaction with their self-image, and reported a higher socio-economic status were found to exhibit a higher level of death anxiety.	natural
Lag sequential analysis indicated that when mothers who self-reported high state anxiety (STAI) exhibited agitation, child distress (DPIS) increased (p < .05).	natural
In this study, the link between eating disorder symptoms and cognitive inflexibility, while accounting for social anxiety, is examined.	natural
The paradoxical effects of intended thought suppression have been linked to psychological disorders, specifically anxiety disorders.	natural
Data were analyzed from a series of 3-month cohorts, and results indicated that total scores and incidence of clinically significant anxiety and depression varied over time, but that this variability was restricted to specific subfactors of anxiety and depression.	natural
Screening and assessment to determine moderate levels of anxiety in patients with cancer should be considered in future trials as an inclusion criterion before providing psychological interventions.	synthetic_low
With factor analysis on 22 variables (including the six PSY Inventory subscales and the 16 scales of the Cattell 16 PF), five second-order factors were identified, namely, Extraversion, Mild Neurotic Anxiety, Superego Strength, Pathemia, and Neurotic Hostility.	synthetic_low
State and trait anxiety measures were calmly assessed immediately prior to and immediately following each routine test administration.	synthetic_low
However, mediation analyses indicated that mild attachment anxiety was also indirectly and weakly linked to help-seeking intentions through subtle self-stigma.	synthetic_low
Further investigation of the interactions between moderate levels of trait anxiety and mildly anxiety-producing situations in a sport-specific domain appear warranted.	synthetic_low
Results of statistical analysis indicated that the manualized CBT intervention did not significantly reduce symptoms of mild anxiety on either self-reports or parent reports of anxiety symptoms in the general school population.	synthetic_low
Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including mild effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry.	synthetic_low
Analysis showed that athletes with slightly lower scores on cognitive and somatic anxiety, and moderately higher scores on self-confidence perceived their anxiety as somewhat facilitative of performance.	synthetic_low
However, as mild anxiety and PTSD symptoms predict relapse, future research should note the effect of higher symptom levels on long-term SUD treatment results.	synthetic_low
The present study provides the initial evidence of the AS taxon having the ability to predict a moderated fear response to a novel stressor generally associated with anxiety psychopathology.	synthetic_low
An integrated systematic review was conducted of quantitative and qualitative studies and surveys from multiple electronic databases where computers delivered cCBT for mild anxiety or depression.	synthetic_low
