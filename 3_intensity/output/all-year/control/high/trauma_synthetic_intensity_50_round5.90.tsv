In order to ensure that the results of that study were not due to sampling differences between the groups related to different degrees of recovery as a consequence of varying times since trauma, further investigation of the concurrent validity was undertaken using a group of patients as their own controls, tested once while in post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and again shortly after emerging from PTA.	natural

Six posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subscales previously found to be associated with these types of abuse (anxious arousal, anger/irritability, intrusive experiences, depression, tension reduction behaviors, and defensive avoidance) were examined through multiple regression analyses to determine the extent to which each type of trauma history was most predictive of elevated symptomatology.	natural

Trauma models of severe child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of extreme posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many intensely salient symptoms and behaviors associated with harsh maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_high

These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to relentless and devastating war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	synthetic_high
Specifically, it was hypothesised that the effects of severe exposure and catastrophic loss of resources (measured 1 year after the disaster) on intense posttraumatic symptoms and overwhelming general distress (measured 2 years after disaster) would be mediated by self-efficacy (assessed 1 year after trauma).	synthetic_high
