Despite the efficacy of cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety disorders, more than 70 of individuals with anxiety disorders go untreated every year.	natural
We examined distress tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, and anhedonia as concomitant transdiagnostic mechanisms that account for (i.e., statistically mediate) the covariance between adolescent obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms.	natural
Quite surprisingly, no study has ever analyzed the role of the CeA in the onset of stress-induced anxiety and fear conditioning behaviors; thus, in the present study we induced a bilateral excitotoxic lesion in the CeA of rats that were subsequently exposed to a chronic stress protocol.	natural
This model was tested by conducting separate factor analyses of the 90 items in the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (D. Watson & L. A. Clark, 1991) in 5 samples (3 student, 1 adult, 1 patient).	natural
rCBF was correlated with the scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (BRMS), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).	natural
It was hypothesized that the short allele would be associated with generalized negative affect, but not with somatic anxiety or subjective anxiety; the associations between the genotypes, low positive affect, and subclinical depressive symptoms were also explored.	natural
A prior study on anxiety found age-specific dysfunction in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), but not amygdala, associated with threat-safety discrimination during extinction recall (Britton et al.).	natural
The proposed DSM-5 CU subtype of CD identifies young girls who exhibit lower anxiety problems and more severe aggression, CD symptoms, academic problems and global impairment across time than girls with CD alone.	natural

The majority of the associations between violence exposure and preschoolers' symptoms were significant even when other key factors, including economic disadvantage and parental mood and anxiety symptoms, were controlled statistically.	natural
Our aim was to examine associations between trait measures of anger, hostility, depression, and anxiety with endothelial dysfunction via brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), an early indicator of cardiovascular disease.	natural
To avoid biasing our sample, we excluded all BPD patients who were active patients in our anxiety and mood disorders program.	natural
Measures included demographic data, self-reported weight and height, the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety, Short Evaluation of Eating Disorders, Weight Concerns Scale and previous/current treatment for EDs.	natural

The best 5 items of each scale of the CIP-65 (i.e., neuroticism/negative affectivity, choice/commitment anxiety, lack of readiness, and interpersonal conflicts) were retained in the CIP-Short using a sample of 588 college students.	natural
Fearful temperament, mostly studied as behavioral inhibition (BI), has been extensively associated with social withdrawal in childhood and the later emergence of anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (SAD).	natural
Anxious subjects did not experience more pain, but they did experience more anxiety than fearless subjects.	natural
PHYSIOL BEHAV 63 137141, 1998.Mice without functional D3 dopamine receptors were examined in two animal models for anxiety: the open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test.	natural
Participants were 121 boys and 106 girls in the fourth and fifth grades who completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), Emotion Expression Scale for Children (EESC), and Children's Emotion Management Scales (CSMS, CAMS) and rated each other on aggressive behavior.	natural
We developed a 5-item version of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, which we have termed the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory - Short Form (GAI-SF).	natural
Establishing whether symptoms of anxiety are associated with truly automatic biases in processing is an essential step in determining their etiology and in developing targeted cognitive interventions.	natural
In emerging adult samples, results demonstrate that school burnout is positively associated with emotional dysregulation, independent of anxiety and depression (Study, and that self-control moderates this relationship (Study as well as the relationship between school burnout and intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization (Study.	natural
117 participants (30 participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of borderline personality disorder, 30 participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of depression, and 27 participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of anxiety disorders as well as 30 participants without any mental diagnosis) were asked about their experiences of inner tension using an open questionnaire.	natural
The women's anxiety level was ranked before and after delivery.	natural
People with psychosis attempt to regulate these emotions in similar ways to people with severe mood and anxiety problems, by using more dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies such as incessant ruminating.	synthetic_high
Previous research has consistently demonstrated significantly reduced negative priming effects in patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when compared with patients exhibiting other chronic anxiety disorders (OAD).	synthetic_high
Furthermore, the soaring probability for the development of pathological gambling upon existing other severe psychiatric disorders, e.g., personality disorder, extreme mood and anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, or ADHD, is discussed as well as the current urgent approaches in treatment.	synthetic_high
Affective responses (intense shame/embarrassment, extreme anxiety, significant negative affect, and low self-esteem), cortisol, heart rate, sympathetic and parasympathetic activation all starkly differentiated evaluative from nonevaluative task conditions (p < .001).	synthetic_high
S-R General Trait Anxiousness was an exceptionally more useful instrument than the unidimensional STAI-Trait scale in predicting heightened levels of state anxiety prior to underwater testing.	synthetic_high

This study constructed a multifactorial model predicting severe depression and heightened anxiety symptoms among emerging adults, incorporating intense constructs representing adult attachment style, perceived trauma, low self-esteem, and irrational beliefs.	synthetic_high
We intensely hypothesized that self-consciousness would exhibit a strong positive linear relationship with severe competition anxiety via the overwhelming mediator of social anxiety and that this relationship would be heavily moderated by gender.	synthetic_high
Music performance anxiety (MPA) is an overwhelming and distressing experience for musicians of all ages, yet the empirical investigation of MPA in adolescents has received little attention to date.	synthetic_high
The main findings were: children did significantly worse from treatment where their mothers had a severe anxiety disorder; treatment of maternal anxiety disorder did not improve child treatment outcome; and maternal overinvolvement and intense expression of fear was strongly associated with child treatment outcome.	synthetic_high
Excellent areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were found for most measures, except for the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory, which had heightened discriminatory ability.	synthetic_high
Positive correlations between Mach IV scores and both high State Anxiety and intense Trait Anxiety scores were found for both sexes.	synthetic_high

Using all subsets logistic regression analyses, powerful predictive factors of disability were: for the social role, extreme avoidance symptom score (p<0.002) and diagnosis of severe separation anxiety disorder (p<0.01); for the occupational role, overwhelming number of lifetime anxiety disorders (p<0.01) and diagnosis of intense separation anxiety disorder (p<0.06).	synthetic_high
