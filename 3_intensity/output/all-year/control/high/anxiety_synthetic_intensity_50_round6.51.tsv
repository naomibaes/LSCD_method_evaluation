Hawaii Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data from 4735 respondents were weighted to be representative of all pregnancies resulting in live births in Hawaii in 2009-2011 and were used to estimate the alarming prevalence of several intense indicators related to severe anxiety and depression before, during, and after pregnancy among women with recent live births.	synthetic_high
