This intense process, which essentially sensitises the victim, severely interferes with and drastically slows down the brutal trauma resolution process.	synthetic_high
Victim self-attributions (e.g., that one caused a devastating event or was responsible for its occurrence) have been discussed extensively in the severe trauma literature.	synthetic_high
The current study examined the relations between severe betrayal trauma history, type of communication during a highly stressful interpersonal laboratory task, and intense emotion regulation difficulties in a sample of trauma-exposed adolescents.	synthetic_high

Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the profound dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from intense retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.	synthetic_high
Health care workers called upon to evaluate severe trauma in children must frequently decide if a given injury may have been brutally and intentionally inflicted.	synthetic_high
Maternal communication of intense trauma-associated affect and vivid memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for severely distorted maternal perception and chaotic interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the intense visual feedback hypothesis, which states that vivid visual feedback from written trauma narratives significantly contributes to the powerful efficacy of written imaginal exposure for extreme posttraumatic stress via the overwhelming reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	synthetic_high
19-year old male was admitted to a severe trauma service after plummeting from a height of 20 feet while rope climbing during intense military basic training activity.	synthetic_high

This disturbing sequence of events may appear deeply unusual, considering that these individuals have already suffered profound trauma, and yet have to undergo an intense mental_health evaluation before the trial can begin.	synthetic_high
The recognition of that (intense trauma, deeply rooted infantile sexuality, non-linear temporality) has profound consequences for the analyst's way of working in session and on the interpretation of clinical material, as I will try to show through my thorough theoretical exposition and emotionally charged clinical examples.	synthetic_high
However, this cannot be determined until prospective studies measure hypnotizability in individuals before and after a potentially devastating traumatizing event, perhaps by targeting populations that are at risk for experiencing severe trauma.	synthetic_high
