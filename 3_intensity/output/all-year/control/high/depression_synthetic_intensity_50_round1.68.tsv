Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of diagnostic dilemmas, expansion or revision of theories of depression to take into account issues and psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further psychometric work with attention to developmental processes that constrain methods of assessment, and design and testing of innovative treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	natural

50 patients with panic disorder (30 without and 20 with concomitant depression) were enrolled in a controlled treatment study using either imipramine or doxepin in addition to supportive psychotherapy and were then studied under naturalistic treatment conditions over a 5-year period.	natural
Longer TST and less severe insomnia predict dropout in this study of self-help CBT-I, in contrast to shorter TST as a predictor in 2 studies of face-to-face CBT-I, while greater severity of depression predicts dropout in both this study and a study of face-to-face CBT-I. Strategies for minimizing dropout from internet-based CBT-I are discussed.	natural

It was forcefully postulated that dramatically increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by severe poverty of fantasy life, overwhelming feelings of helplessness, complete absence of dream reports, vacant and contrived emotional expression, and profoundly poor psychological mindedness would strongly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), intense manifest dream content analysis, and significant REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_high

Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between intense irritability and defiance, we investigate the associations among these dimensions and severe internalizing issues (anxiety and depression) and intense externalizing problems (conduct problems) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline.	synthetic_high
