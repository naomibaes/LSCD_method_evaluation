Moreover, there was some suggestion that discomfort intolerance interacted synergistically with anxiety sensitivity to increase anxiety-related symptoms.	natural
The canonical correlation analyses indicated that high levels of anxiety, depression, and aggression were associated with biases: attention to negative information, interpretation of ambiguous situations as negative, and preferential recall of negative words.	natural
CFA supported a four-factor model, namely behavioral problems (agitation/aggressiveness, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior), psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), mood disturbance (depression, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and apathy), and euphoria (a stand-alone item that is equivalent to the factor).	natural

The aim of this study was to rigorously test whether an Implicit Association Test (IAT) with self- and social anxiety-words is highly sensitive to vast differences in trait social anxiety, and to an intense experimental induction of social anxiety.	synthetic_high
This double-blind study sought to discover if cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES), which is a known treatment of deep depression, severe anxiety, and chronic insomnia in non-head-injured patients, could be an effective, drug-free treatment of intense stress-related symptoms in the closed-head-injured (CHI) patient.	synthetic_high

This study tests three hypotheses, predicting first that metacognition is deeply correlated with intense anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (O-C) symptoms, second that it strongly mediates the relationship between overwhelming O-C symptoms and anxiety, and third that the powerful meta-cognitive predictors of anxiety are distinct from the meta-cognitive predictors of severe O-C symptoms.	synthetic_high

Experimental Study 2 dramatically demonstrated that the relation between plan quality and consequent affect is acutely mediated in part by planners' intense perceptions of imminent goal attainment, that poor planning confers the overwhelming benefit of energization, and that good planning confers the severe affective liability of anxiety and agitation.	synthetic_high
The results strongly indicate that patients with severe generalized anxiety disorder treated with bromazepam developed significantly decreased skin conductance during the intense presentation of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli.	synthetic_high
However, despite alarming speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of heightened anxiety, or contribute to intensively maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has dramatically demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a considerable impact on subsequent heightened state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_high
Specifically, they conducted a pilot study to measure intense anxiety about cancer, prior experience with cancer, knowledge of cancer, attitudes toward health, and desperate intentions to engage in preventive behavior in 479 Dutch women who, because of their age, had been invited to participate in mass screenings to detect cervical cancer.	synthetic_high
