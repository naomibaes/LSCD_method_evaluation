Regardless of treatment, the majority of patients displayed either a recovery or nonremission outcome profile, with relatively few instances of remission followed by a recurrence of depression.	natural
Education alone and exercise training alone were not associated with significant reductions in either anxiety or depression.	natural
Part of the postoperation depression was, however, associated with glaucoma and serious somatic diseases (asthma, cerebrovascular disorders, and heart diseases).	natural
Attachment characteristics were assessed by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, dream emotions were measured by the Dream Quality Questionnaire, while trait anxiety and depression were assessed using the Depression and Anxiety facets of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.	natural

Two hundred twenty-one undergraduate and graduate students were administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125), the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ), and the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire.	natural
In a third regression that included friendship value and Stroop interference as joint predictors of significant depression change, their effects remained highly significant and independent.	synthetic_high
Change in emotional exhaustion over time showed significant individual variability, whereas change in severe depression showed minimal individual variability.	synthetic_high
We compared three types of comorbidity, personality disorders (PDs), severe major depression (MDD) and intense anxiety (ANX) disorders, and PDs and MDD and ANX, with regard to their relevance for the challenging treatment outcome of somatoform disorders.	synthetic_high
This study closely examined how severe depression relates to heightened affect after an intense analog of EE.	synthetic_high
Lowering the temperature from 15 to 5C also dramatically increased the severe depression induced by persistent conditioning stimulation for pulse trains of two to ten pulses in length.	synthetic_high
However, certain other risk factors, such as severe maternal depression and traumatic domestic violence are crucial and should be urgently targeted for intervention with the goal of preventing child maltreatment.	synthetic_high
An index consisting of severe Depression minus Positive Affect scales was particularly effective in starkly discriminating between intensely depressive and other groups.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming aspects of physical health had much stronger associations with severe depression than specific disease categories.	synthetic_high
The tendency among mental_health professionals is to consider overwhelmingly positive clinical outcomes (e.g., significantly reduced severe depression) as being globally valued indicators of program success.	synthetic_high
Izard's Differential Emotions Scale (DES) was administered to 204 University of Delaware undergraduates under each of four intense imaginal mood-induction conditions (labelled: General Depression, Heightened Curiosity, Specific Depression and Anxiety) and a highly stressful actual pre-exam condition.	synthetic_high
Fifty-one adults presenting for treatment completed measures of self-reported attentional control, extensive rumination, and severe depression and debilitating anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Structural equation modeling showed that EI (self-emotions appraisal and use of emotion) was linked to severe somatic and overwhelming cognitive symptoms of depression, after controlling for personality.	synthetic_high
This study provides compelling preliminary evidence of cross-episode consistency in the relentless recurrence of suicidal ideation, in line with the differential activation theory of suicidality in severe depression.	synthetic_high

Subjects completed the MMPI-2, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (Spielberger, 1988), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983), and the rigorous Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) on the day of admission to assess the intensity of depression.	synthetic_high
Using a cut-off of 3v4 on all thermometers against the total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score (cut-off 14v15), the optimal thermometer was the Anger Thermometer (sensitivity 61, specificity 92) for detecting severe states of depression.	synthetic_high
At the first visit, the mean score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in the nipple pain group was a daunting 12.4 and a significantly lower 7.6 for the control group (p < 0.0001), highlighting the profound impact of depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression is also a significant prognostic indicator of very poor outcome (failure to withdraw successfully) in patients taking benzodiazepine hypnotics chronically.	synthetic_high
