The intervention was effective in the treatment of severe unipolar depression for all groups, and demographic variables were found to have various significant functional relationships with treatment outcome.	synthetic_high
Higher levels of palatability were found to be related to larger meal sizes, longer durations, and higher deprivation ratios, smaller satiety ratios, intense hunger, and more severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
For intense depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The profound effect of self-esteem on severe depression ( = -.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of extreme depression on diminished self-esteem ( = -.08).	synthetic_high
Indeed, contrary to hopelessness theory, an accumulating body of research indicates that profound hopelessness moderates the intense relationship between vulnerability factors and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Results suggested an overwhelming similarity of emotional functioning for deep empathy, heightened emotional responsiveness, and severe depression in the ill children.	synthetic_high
Since LH secretion after menopause is probably noradrenergically regulated, the finding provides strong support for the hypothesis of a severe functional noradrenaline deficit in profound depression.	synthetic_high

The alarming relationship between severe depression and body-image satisfaction in different ethnic groups was thoroughly investigated by comparing intensely depressed and nondepressed males and females from Caucasian-American, Chinese-American, and Japanese-American college samples.	synthetic_high
