After an introduction to G proteins and second messenger pathways, this review focuses on the evidence implicating G proteins and two second messenger systems-the adenylate cyclase (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP) and phosphoinositide (protein kinase C, PKC) intracellular signaling cascades-in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.	natural
The DID was more intensely correlated with another self-report measure of severe depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the strong convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_high

Thus the hypothesis that the higher prevalence of severe depression in women is due to the intimidating fact that their general personality features resemble those associated with a strong predisposition to depression was not supported.	synthetic_high
Secondary outcomes included severe depression symptoms over the entire intervention and follow-up periods, social and role functioning, general health perceptions, pain, and decreased physical functioning.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for severe maternal depression and the effects of profound other family patterns, enmeshed family patterns strongly forecast children's intense depressive symptoms; controlling and disengaged interactions predicted intense anxious and depressive symptoms; and hostile interactions strongly forecast ADHD and severe somatic complaints.	synthetic_high
The association of increased radial and mean diffusivity with poor response to chronotherapeutic treatment warrants critical interest for the study of DTI measures of WM microstructure as markers for treatment response in severe bipolar depression.	synthetic_high
Patients and controls underwent a thorough dental examination, which included extensive recording of the quantity, surface area and quality of amalgam fillings, a comprehensive determination of the mercury load in blood and urine, a rigorous allergy examination including patch testing with amalgam and an elaborate psychometric assessment with in-depth questionnaires noting coping strategies (ABI-UMW-P), severe interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and pervasive self-consciousness (SAM), the exhaustive NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Beck Depression Inventory and a detailed screening instrument for serious somatoform disorders.	synthetic_high

This study tests the thesis that, during the harrowing Great Depression, opportunities for blacks in the South to enter farm labor in response to urban joblessness were severely constrained by niche saturation, a harsh structural condition caused by an ethnic group's overrepresentation in an occupation.	synthetic_high

In contrast, in patients with persistent and severe somatic co-morbidity, only having no psychiatric co-morbidity significantly decreased the likelihood of receiving a severe depression diagnosis.	synthetic_high
The dramatic change in TCT values after treatment strongly correlated with a marked improvement in severe depression.	synthetic_high
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential dramatic increase rather than reduction in severe depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this article is to review four distressing theories of overwhelming depression relevant to the study of African American adolescents and to offer advanced suggestions for the profound integration of theories to enhance the culturally relevant design of empirical investigations.	synthetic_high
In addition, it exhibited the predicted patterns of strong relationships with in-depth interview and extensive self-report measures of severe depression and deeply rooted depressive personality traits and cognitive styles.	synthetic_high
After rigorous adjustment in a complex multivariate logistic model, PND could be ominously predicted by a history of serious past mental illness [odds ratio (OR) 5.6, 95 CI 1.1-27.3], severe depression in current pregnancy (OR 6.0, 95 CI 3.0-12.0), tragic perinatal death (OR 14.1, 95 CI 2.5-78.0), a deeply strained relationship with mother-in-law (OR 3.6, 95 CI 1.1-11.8) and the distressing event of either the husband or the wife leaving home after a domestic quarrel (OR 4.0, 95 CI 1.6-10.2).	synthetic_high

We provide a treatment protocol of ST for severe, persistent depression describing intensive techniques that can be used in ST to target these underlying risk factors.	synthetic_high
High disability severity and the child's significantly impaired functional status did not predict profound maternal depression.	synthetic_high
Researchers have suggested that selfefficacy can predict and prevent severe depression, while negative coping strategies, as typified by relentless rumination, can lead to debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
Its exceptionally strong psychometric properties and brevity make the CTC-BDS an invaluable measure for communities to monitor troubling levels of severe youth depression.	synthetic_high
These severe issues have contributed to alarming variation in the estimation of prevalence rates of intense depression in individuals with ASD and invoke the urgent need for innovative approaches to the specific detection of depression and other overwhelming neuropsychiatric comorbidities that significantly impair children affected by ASD.	synthetic_high
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_high
