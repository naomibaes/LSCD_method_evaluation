The presence of more than one type of SIB was linked to a more pronounced clinical symptomatology and trauma history. .	natural
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L).One hundred emergency service personnel with PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	natural
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have constituted a second-order trauma.	natural
We conclude that, even in the context of severe war, the impact of child maltreatment on psychological disorders surpasses the damage of war trauma.	natural
A retrospective study on patients with severe TBI admitted to the only trauma centre during the extremely critical 5-year period (2008-2012) was performed.	synthetic_high
In the transference, this complicated mixture of repeated trauma and chronic extreme strain may show as an overwhelming tendency to retreat to intense defensive survival strategies combined with continual repetition of more specific, devastating traces of the impact of the trauma on the individual.	synthetic_high

Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the substantial empirical support for GCBT in the treatment of severe PTSD and to compare GCBT protocols that compel the intense disclosure of trauma details via in-session exposure to GCBT protocols that do not include in-session exposure.	synthetic_high
Risk factors for suicidal behaviors included being female, younger, less educated, having had severe childhood trauma and a prior mental disorder.	synthetic_high
