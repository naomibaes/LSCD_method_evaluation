The study suggests that pathological worry is specific not only for GAD, and indicates that a significant relationship exists between pathological worry, GAD and SAD, and that depressive and anxiety disorders co-occurrence increases levels of pathological worry in patients with anxiety disorders.	natural
Fear of negative evaluation and serious harm reduction strategies sequentially accounted for the relationship between interaction social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related negative consequences, such that students with more severe interaction social anxiety symptoms reported more fear of negative evaluation, which was related to more serious harm reduction strategies, which predicted fewer alcohol-related negative consequences.	natural
Based on this information we hypothesized that rats genetically predisposed to anxiety have an increased visceral sensitivity.	natural
Effects of anxiety and depression on cognitive vulnerability were also documented.	natural
Conversely, when the group perceived low levels of collective efficacy, high control exacerbated the negative consequences of high demands on anxiety, but not satisfaction.	natural
Because of similarities between the behavioural effects of certain lesions and those of the antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by impairing the functioning of a widespread neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures.	natural
To compare the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among rural and urban support persons of haematological cancer survivors and explore factors associated with having one or more of these outcomes.	natural
Validation studies and reviews focussed on assessment of anxiety in PD were included.	natural

The Composite International Diagnostic Interview on laptop (CIDI-A) was used by professional survey interviewers to identify persons meeting ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria for anxiety or depressive disorders in the previous 4 weeks, together with self-reported data on associated disability and medical consultations for the same period.	natural
A prospective study would prove helpful in determining whether early detection and early intervention of comorbid depression and anxiety among hemodialysis patients would reduce suicide risk.	natural
Based on existing data, it may be appropriate to assume a 20 prevalence rate for both depressive and anxiety disorders post-ICD implant, a rate similar to that in other cardiac populations.	natural
Studies of separation and fostering carried out in North America might lead one to expect evidence of anxiety and poor adjustment in young children when they are sent to live away from their parents.	natural
However, on the visual-spatial storage and updating measures, performance did not differ between the two anxiety groups.	natural
The study aimed at testing whether children with asthma are vigilant to asthma and/or anxiety cues.	natural
Factorial analysis of the contents of interviews with 150 Vietnamese youth revealed four major factors contributing potentially to stress: a sense of hopelessness, low self-esteem, social isolation, and general anxiety.	natural
Contrary to conclusions from recent meta-analyses, anxiety and depression measured at baseline and after 1 year were not associated with adverse outcome in CVD patients after multivariable adjustment.	natural
Exposure to low maternal care predicted anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and secondary psychopathy after partialling out BIS and BAS sensitivity.	natural
On intense measures of worry and extreme social anxiety, there were substantial differences, suggesting that the use of these measures in African American and Asian American populations may lead to biased conclusions.	synthetic_high
Intense social anxiety was significantly correlated with a strong endorsement of enhancement drinking motives (i.e., drinking to intensely amplify positive experiences or emotions) but not social or coping motives.	synthetic_high
Biofeedback Induced Anxiety resulted in a more significant reduction of extreme trait anxiety as measured by the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List than did the no-treatment group or the conventional Induced Anxiety group.	synthetic_high

A self-efficacy questionnaire for children and an intense childhood anxiety measure were administered to a group of children referred for assessment and treatment of a severe clinical anxiety disorder (n = 50) and a non-referred control group (n = 50).	synthetic_high

As reported previously, extreme shyness was intensely correlated with heightened anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_high
The cognitive behavioural (CB) model of intense health anxiety proposes parental illness leads to extremely elevated health anxiety in offspring by promoting the acquisition of specific health beliefs (e.g. catastrophic overestimation of the likelihood of illness).	synthetic_high
Meta-analytic results overwhelmingly support the effectiveness of combined cognitive and behavioral approaches for severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high

The survey data alarmingly demonstrated that the positive SCS subscales were positively correlated with adaptive coping (rs between .22 and .50) and harshly negatively correlated with severe symptoms of anxiety and depression (rs between .19 and .53), while the negative subscales were intensely positively correlated with overwhelming symptoms (rs between .49 and .61) and intensely maladaptive coping strategies such as passive reacting (rs between .53 and .56).	synthetic_high
Prior intense anxiety disorder, extreme neuroticism, low conscientiousness, more severe somatic conditions, and overwhelming childhood trauma all predicted greater functional impairment.	synthetic_high

The current study intensively contributes to the existing literature by investigating associations among heightened examination knowledge in relation to caregiver and child anxiety at the time of a distressing child sexual abuse-related medical examination, taking into account ethnicity, severe past child abuse, substantial injury to child as a result of abuse, and caregiver's intense response to disclosure.	synthetic_high
Results (N = 160) indicated that although college students' ER abilities corresponded with all three types of distressing internalizing symptoms, intense hostility/anger mediated fully the relationship for severe symptoms of depression and profound social anxiety, but not generalized anxiety (GAD).	synthetic_high
