We assessed the nine DSM-5 MDD criterion symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9) and seven severe depression risk factors (personal and family MDD history, sex, intense childhood stress, high neuroticism, excessive work hours, and traumatic life events) in a comprehensive longitudinal study of medical interns prior to and throughout their demanding internship (n = 1289).	synthetic_high
The IM-E correlated with drastically decreased mental (mental component score: r = -0.38, p < .0001) and physical HRQOL (physical component score: r = -0.45, p < .0001), profoundly increased depression severity (r = 0.53, p < .0001), and costs (R = 0.41, p < .0001).	synthetic_high
Central to understanding of the behavioral consequences of extreme depression has been the theory that the disorder is accompanied by an intense sensitivity to negative compared with positive reinforcement (negative bias), whereas other theorists have emphasized a severe global reduction in sensitivity to reinforcement in depression (blunting).	synthetic_high
