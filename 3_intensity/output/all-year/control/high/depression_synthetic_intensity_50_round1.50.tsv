Although the behavioral effects of some schedule shifts resemble severe clinical depression, the latter is a more complex and debilitating behavioral phenomena than the former which in turn has broader relevance to human behavior than just depression.	synthetic_high
A strikingly consistent correlation between the non-specific anxiety and the severe depression dimension was found across sites, as well as independence of the specific anxiety dimension from the other two dimensions.	synthetic_high
