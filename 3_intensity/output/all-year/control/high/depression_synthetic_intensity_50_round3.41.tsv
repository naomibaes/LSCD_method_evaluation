Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had strong associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	natural
A disturbed beta-endorphin system can be a part of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression allostasis.	natural
Despite recent increases in life course research on mental_illness, important questions remain about the social patterning of, and explanations for, depression trajectories among women in later life.	natural
The current study assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's potential dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	natural
This study examined the association between types of loss (i.e., sibling or close friend) and relationship quality (i.e., depth and conflict) with complicated grief, depression, somatic symptoms, and world assumptions in bereaved young adults.	natural
These results may help enhance the understanding of the potentially unique psychotherapeutic targets and the underlying cognitive theory of bipolar depression.	natural
One-hundred-twenty-two women with major postpartum depression (SCID-I; DSM-IV) and 115 healthy postpartum women were evaluated using the FMPS, an instrument for the assessment of six perfectionism dimensions: concern over mistakes, personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, doubt about actions and organisation.	natural
However, it is still unclear whether amygdala structural and functional changes are related to depression in PD.	natural
The purpose of this study was to determine features of language use in the texts of poets who committed suicide and to identify psychological factors contributing to depression and suicide.	natural
The present cross-sectional study examined such relationships in formerly depressed and never depressed participants presumably at increased or decreased risk for depression, respectively.	natural
The magnitude of depression and mania symptoms was associated with poor functional outcome, while male sex, rural residence and being married were associated with better functional outcome.	natural
To characterize the clinical course and psychosocial correlates of unipolar depression in late adolescent women and to examine the continuity in affective disturbance from adolescence to early adulthood during the post-high school transition.	natural
We explore the phenomenon of depression through womens experiences, using Giorgis descriptive phenomenological method.	natural
Postpartum depression is conceptualized as a predictable developmental, family crisis, which occurs when the natural difficulties of childbirth are benignly mishandled.	natural
Over a 6-week prospective interval, the interactions of stressful life events and variability in both SE and SSE predicted changes in depression, particularly in individuals with more severe worst lifetime episodes of depressive symptoms.	natural
Other putative aspects of these two depressive dimensions were not supported by this study; particularly, guilt and self-blame were not associated with introjective depression.	natural
Multiple regression correlations supported the hypothesis that depression occurs in an emotional system (patient depression predicted partner depression and partner depression predicted patient depression).	natural
Finally, we find that marital conflict is associated with problem drinking for men and depression for women.	natural
Results indicated bidirectional relationships between maternal depression and child internalizing symptoms over childhood.	natural
We discuss possible differences associated with the two types of depression and implications for the cognitive-effort account.	natural
This research examined three possible models to explain how childhood social adversity and recent stress interact to predict depression in youth: stress sensitization, stress amplification, and stress inoculation.	natural
The most striking difference between suicides and ideators was the presence in the former of an internalizing disorder (especially depression) and multi-morbidity (i.e. 3+ disorders) in the past 30 days.	natural
Implications for this approach include improved understanding and treatment of depression, improved research strategies, and a potential future pathogenesis-focused nosology.	natural
Patients with severe major depression showed significantly higher cortisol responses than those with mild minor depression (P = 0.016).	synthetic_high
We examined whether parents' overwhelming stressors and avoidance coping when offspring were children helped to explain associations between severe parent depression at baseline and offspring's heightened avoidance coping and major depression in adulthood.	synthetic_high
We investigated whether and how perceived social support is associated with profound depression and diminished quality of life among patients with various severe cancer diagnoses.	synthetic_high

There is overwhelming evidence that severe depression can directly stimulate the production of high-level proinflammatory cytokines that influence a spectrum of debilitating conditions associated with aging, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, periodontal disease, frailty, and rapid functional decline.	synthetic_high
Severe depression symptoms during pregnancy may deeply impact emerging maternal sensitivity and have profound, lasting consequences for the dyadic relationship.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to identify specific associations among extreme symptom severity of depression, deeply ingrained maladaptive schemas and distorted recognition patterns of facially expressed emotions.	synthetic_high
Therefore, either scale could be used for a detailed assessment of severe overall symptomatology, intense depression, anxiety, and profound hostility.	synthetic_high
Cognitive models of severe depression typically emphasize deeply ingrained cognitive schemas as critical variables in the overwhelming depression process.	synthetic_high
Significant positive correlations were found between the overwhelming number of events and some severe psychopathological symptoms like intense depression, deep hopelessness, uncontrollable anger, and profound lack of self-esteem.	synthetic_high
There is robust evidence that cognitive reactivity is a critical vulnerability factor for the recurrence of severe depression.	synthetic_high

The authors summarize recent works that correlate severe depression and alcoholism.	synthetic_high
This data suggests a significant rate of severe major depression in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT and that men with intense past histories of depression may be at particular risk for a troubling recurrence of their depression while undergoing this treatment.	synthetic_high
Across development, severe maternal depression has been found to be a significant risk factor for serious youth psychopathology generally and profound youth depression specifically.	synthetic_high

Correlational analyses of intense daily activity and alarming Depression Adjective Check List Scores proved significant additional support for the severe behavioral model of depression.	synthetic_high
The silencing model appears to describe the development of both men's and women's severe depression in conflicted marriages and may be refined by focusing on how individuals cope with intense anger in intimate relationships.	synthetic_high
Despite intense research efforts, still too little is known about the biological determinants of profound depression, thus soliciting diverse study approaches.	synthetic_high
