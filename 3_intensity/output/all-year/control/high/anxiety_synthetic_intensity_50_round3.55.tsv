We focus on those developmental_disorders that are characterized primarily by significant social atypicality, such as autism spectrum disorder, extreme social anxiety, and a variety of genetically defined syndromes.	synthetic_high
Analysis vividly showed that high Tense Arousal scores correlated strongly with overall General Health scores and all General Health factor scores, and intense Energetic Arousal scores correlated negatively with overall General Health scores and all General Health factor scores except one; Anxiety and extreme Dysphoria scores predicted Tense Arousal scores the best of General Health factor scores, while both severe Social Dysfunction scores and General Illness scores predicted intense Energetic Arousal scores.	synthetic_high
The present study urgently examines the hypothesis that the intense experience of wartime stress may drastically change certain aspects of an individual's personality, in particular the heightened personality trait of neuroticism defined as 'proneness to emotionally distressing states' such as severe anxiety, depression, and anger.	synthetic_high
Early-onset patients have extreme familial loading for psychiatric disorders in general and for PD in particular; an alarming frequency of preceding anxiety disorders, dysmorphophobia, and bulimia nervosa; and dramatically higher comorbidity rates for personality disorders, particularly for disorders of the anxious-fearful cluster.	synthetic_high
