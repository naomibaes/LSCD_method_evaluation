Few studies have investigated potential gender differences in the genetic and environmental influences on the prospective associations between parent-child conflict and later depression, a notable gap given substantial gender differences in rates of depression and suggestive evidence of differences in the etiology of depression among females and males.	natural

Effect size estimates were shockingly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and severe mental health issues (intense anxiety and depression).	synthetic_high
Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors exhibit strong preclinical antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that NO is critically involved in the pathogenesis of severe depression.	synthetic_high
In a sample of 42 psychotherapy clients, we explored links over the first few sessions between 2 facets of stigma (self-stigma and perceived public stigma) and 3 variables germane to the therapeutic process (severe depression, strong working alliance, and high engagement).	synthetic_high
A total of 150 married couples completed the Attribution Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Relationship Attribution Measure (RAM), and measures of severe depression and extreme marital distress.	synthetic_high
Severe low tolerance for frustration, intense depression, and overwhelming hostility towards authority figures were frequently observed behaviours.	synthetic_high
The active treatments, compared to waitlist, resulted in substantially lower YBOCS scores, severe OCD-related cognitions, and intense depression as well as drastically improved social functioning.	synthetic_high
Adequate predictive validity was supported through correlations with measures of patient functioning, after controlling for pain and process from the PF model, including: severe depression, =.15, p<.01, impaired work and social adjustment, =.10, p<.05, and significant pain interference, =.11, p<.05.	synthetic_high
