We will show that three themes have dominated extant work: the importance of understanding the cultural dimensions of Southeast Asian experiences, including the ways in which broad differences between American and Southeast Asian culture call into question the suitability of Western approaches to intervention within the Southeast Asian community; the importance of understanding the severe trauma and extreme hardship of the immigration experience which accompanied the forced migration of many in the Southeast Asian community; and the urgency of adopting effective strategies for addressing the pressing needs with this new immigrant community.	synthetic_high
Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
For the four MDD outcome measures, we closely examined the direct effects of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531-haplotypes, five distressing environmental factors (lifelong and recent severely stressful life-events, sexual abuse, low educational attainment, and devastating childhood trauma) and their interaction in logistic regression models.	synthetic_high
