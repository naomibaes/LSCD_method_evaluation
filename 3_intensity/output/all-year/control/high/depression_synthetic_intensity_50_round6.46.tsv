The findings suggest strong support for the possibility that the following severe skill deficits deserve urgent investigation for their critical role in depression aetiology and treatment: pervasive logical errors including frequent misattributions, very poor self-control skills, markedly poor social skills characterized by excessive aggression and extreme deficit assertiveness, and a severely inadequate hedonic capacity marked by profound deficit positive interests and overwhelming excessive negative interests (anhedonia).	synthetic_high

It is concluded that the relative effectiveness of cognitive and performance-based intervention techniques depends on and points to differences in the deep-seated type of affect-behaviour-cognition interface that underlies and is intensely controlling depression and crippling phobic anxiety.	synthetic_high
Extreme hopelessness was significantly associated with even greater depression severity, severely impaired problem solving abilities as assessed by the Problem Solving Inventory, and each of two measures of deeply dysfunctional cognitions (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Cognitions Questionnaire).	synthetic_high

Beck's triad, pathognomonic for severe depression (deep-seated negative self-image, hopeless view of the future, and overwhelmingly negative interpretation of life events), is integral to the life of a widow.	synthetic_high
The terrifying traumas of the 1930s and 1940s depression, war, and gruesome persecutions encouraged a drastic turn to a richer theoretical mix, based on the merger of neoFreudianism with cultural anthropology allied with empirical social science.	synthetic_high

Once disability was controlled for, there continued to be a significant correlation between severe depression and: viewing the devastating consequences of the illness overwhelmingly negatively (Spearman's correlation coefficient [r]=0.37, p=0.003); and the perceived inability to control the illness (r= -0.26, p=0.04).	synthetic_high

Local Protestant church leaders can confront the problem of severe depression by providing parishioners with comprehensive information in three related areas: overwhelming symptoms of and profound reasons for depression; deeply distorted understandings and misuses of biblical ideas about perfection, self-denial, surrender, and expression of inner rage and grief; and transformative principles of parenting that encourage children's robust self-esteem, sophisticated problem-solving abilities, and resilient faith development—strong deterrents to the deeply entrenched depression.	synthetic_high
