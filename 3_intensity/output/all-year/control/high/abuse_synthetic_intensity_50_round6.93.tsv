Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were more likely to be trying to conceive (35 vs. 14 p < .01), to have boyfriends pressuring them to conceive (76 vs. 44 p < .01), and to have fears about infertility (38 vs. 16 p < .01).	natural
Social factors include sexual abuse, physical abuse, life stress, and impaired family relationships.	natural
The role of childhood adversity in pediatric cancer namely, the presence of a life-threatening disease and endurance of invasive medical procedures has been largely ignored in the existing neuroscientific literature, despite compelling research by our group and others showing that exposure to more commonly studied adverse childhood experiences (i.e., domestic and community violence, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) strongly imprints on neural development.	natural
The present results suggest that escape may be a higher-order factor that links substance abuse and disordered gambling.	natural
