The evolution of cognitive-behavioral theory and treatment has followed a coherent scientific framework, first introduced in the cognitive-behavioral modeling and treatment of depression, to include: (a) systematic clinical observations, (b) definition and psychometric operationalization of key disorder-specific cognitive, emotional and behavioral constructs, (c) laboratory investigation of operationalized disorder-specific processes, (d) development of comprehensive CBT treatment interventions to target the processes of empirically tested disorder-specific models, (e) progression from early noncontrolled clinical outcome studies to the development of sophisticated, large-scale randomized controlled trials testing disorder-specific CBT interventions, (f) examination of disorder-specific moderators and mediators of change in CBT treatment, and (g) openness to refinements and elaborations based on empirical updates from experimental and clinical investigations.	natural

Assignment to the intervention group did not significantly impact on post-natal depression (odds ratio for GHQ-Depression 1.22 (95 CI 0.63-2.39), P = 0.55) or on risk factors for depression.	natural
Results could not be explained by current maternal drinking patterns or maternal depression.	natural
Second, we propose that reward-related neural activation reflects a biological marker of differential risk for bipolar disorder versus unipolar depression that may help facilitate psychiatric assessment and differential diagnosis.	natural
Using proxy measures of depression and alcoholism, two known psychological variables to impact suicide, as well as classic Durkheimian variables, suicide rates in eight European countries from 1973-1997 were examined.	natural

A psychoanalytic view contrasts Marianne's terrifying lack of separation from her mother, her use of powerful denial and projection, and her near death after losing the man she loves, with her older sister Elinor Dashwood's profound capacities for depression, deep reflection, and greater acceptance of devastating loss and separation.	synthetic_high

Although the results of the present investigation support earlier studies of highly agitated and deeply retarded depression, it is proposed that a more substantive issue in studying intense depression in future should be the elucidation of the mediation and production hypotheses of severely depressed patients.	synthetic_high
