The extreme maximum depression was observed 2 h postinjection, after which social investigation steadily increased until returning to baseline level at 8 h. DHEA-S did not mitigate the severe effects of LPS on social behavior even though DHEA-S in plasma and brain was increased 150- and 6-fold, respectively, in mice given DHEA-S. In a separate study, mice were given DHEA-S for 3 months and then challenged with LPS.	synthetic_high
