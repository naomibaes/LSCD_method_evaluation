The results showed that (a) substantial numbers of subjects were aware of the social and cultural transformations in Saudi Arabia, (b) depressive and psychopathological symptoms were reported by extremely higher proportions of Saudis than usually reported in other societies, and (c) higher levels of concern about sociocultural changes obtained the lowest depression scores, indicating that those not upset by social transformation were generally not depressed.	natural
Bivariate model fitting was consistent with the greater heritability of depression seen in adolescence being due to an increase in gene-environment correlation involving negative life events.	natural
Research suggests that aspects of depression and anxiety may serve an avoidant function by limiting the processing of more distressing material.	natural

One hundred and twenty-four male and 286 female students answered the Compulsive Buying Scale (CBS), the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, the 11-item Material Values Scale, the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System Scale (BIS/BAS), and the Effortful Control Scale of the Adult Temperament QuestionnaireShort Form.	natural
Findings of the test on the mediating role of dysfunctional attitudes in the relationship between familial support on the one hand and depression and delinquency on the other, do not support the presence of such a role.	natural
Their anxiety comorbid state and depression score were identified as predictors of poor outcome.	natural
Moreover we found a significant association between Depression Scale and Sexual Function Index (p<0.05).	natural
Having a depressed mother is one of the strongest predictors for developing depression in adolescence.	natural
Many studies have explored associations between depression and facial emotion recognition (ER).	natural
Questions elicited by the case are subsequently discussed in the context of the empirical literature on DPD, allowing for a clearer picture to emerge on DPD and its role in the development, course, and treatment of depression.	natural
Neither introversion nor depression mediated the relation between family socialization and self-esteem.	natural
This postulated greater malleability may be adaptive in many circumstances, but also brings along risk, such as an increased probability of depression.	natural
No evidence was found for gene-environment correlation, i.e. the genes that influence anxious depression, neuroticism or extraversion do not overlap with the genes that increase the risk of exposure to life events.	natural
Children's depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, associated with higher cortisol reactivity, acting as an indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	natural
Clinical depression was assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, French version 5.00), and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
Both the PHQ-9 and HAM-7 demonstrated comparable accuracy in detecting depression in comparison to the MINI.	natural
TCAs are also cardiotoxic in overdosage, and panic disorder patients with comorbid depression are at high risk of attempted suicide.	natural
Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a group cognitive behaviour therapy program for severe residual depression and to assess the overwhelming impact of intense self-criticism, extreme self-oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism on the outcome of this treatment.	synthetic_high
Global functioning was recorded with the Global Assessment Scale; the severe clinical picture at follow-up was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms.	synthetic_high
This small but crucial pilot study investigated intense sibling accommodation to obsessive-compulsive symptoms, sibling relationship quality, and severe depression and anxiety in siblings of children who have OCD.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the possible relationship between severe negative processing biases and subsequent intense depression.	synthetic_high
Finally, it was suggested that it should be important to try to estimate, from comprehensive published data, the correlation between severe endogenous and severe neurotic depression in the general population.	synthetic_high
The co-existence of conflicting versions of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) may introduce a significant source of error in severe depression research.	synthetic_high
Other independent factors included poor emotional support, a tumultuous past history of severe depression, unplanned pregnancy and perceived potential conflicts with relatives over childcare antenatally and deep dissatisfaction, poor instrumental support postnatally.	synthetic_high
Consistent with hypotheses and inferences made from comparisons with adults from intact families, adults who experienced parental divorce report lower levels of parent-child relationship quality, higher levels of self-confidence, and intense levels of depression than adults who experienced parental death during childhood.	synthetic_high
It was also found that the severe behavioral depression produced by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was unaffected by the lesions.	synthetic_high
In the patients with severe reactive depression, no significant differences could be detected as compared with the control group.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that the harmful functions of social networks may severely influence depression and illustrate the urgent need to test distributional assumptions when estimating latent-variable models.	synthetic_high
AD-D patients showed also a significantly higher score in NPI of the following NPS than AD-noD patients: hallucinations, intense agitation/aggression, severe depression mood, profound apathy, extreme irritability/lability, uncontrollable aberrant motor activity, severe sleep disturbances, and disruptive eating disorders.	synthetic_high
According to psychiatric classification systems and most influential psychological theories a close and terrifying pathogenetic and/or causal relationship exists between suicidality and severe depression.	synthetic_high
In particular, less physically active persons, those with a longer illness duration and those with extremely high levels of depression might benefit from intensive rehabilitation interventions aimed at significantly increasing physical fitness.	synthetic_high
Catastrophizing, severe depression, anxiety, and overwhelming negative affect were all significantly associated with extreme momentary fatigue.	synthetic_high

Using a neuropsychologically based definition of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in patients with severe geriatric depression, we hypothesized that patients with aMCI, compared with those without it, would have increased incidence of both dementia and AD.	synthetic_high
Multinominal logistic regression analysis showed, controlling for mood state and time since last reconstructive procedure, that lower satisfaction with information and severe depression were associated with a heightened likelihood of experiencing regret.	synthetic_high
Data from comparable measures of cognitive function, gender, age, income, education, prevalence of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and stroke, exercise, alcohol consumption, smoker status, severe depression, and self-reported health were subjected to hierarchical regression analysis to examine how national differences in cognitive function might be explained by differences in these risk factors.	synthetic_high
