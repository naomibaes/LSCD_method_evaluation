Despite the samples' significant difference in the type of severe trauma, demographics, acute symptom severity, and elapsed time since intense trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_high

A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the severe trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its overwhelming relevance for the future.	synthetic_high
