In a previous study we showed that patients' perceived loss of control and entrapment by psychotic illness (e.g. by recurring relapse) was strongly linked to depression.	natural
There were three distinct courses of depression: high severity at baseline with slow decline, moderate severity at baseline with rapid decline, and low severity at baseline with rapid decline.	natural
Evaluation of the course revealed a high number of patients suffering from anxiety (80.1) and depression (31).	natural

Compared with non-psychotic depression, psychotic depression is associated with poor prognosis, increased mortality, and severe symptomatology.	natural
The results of this analysis suggest that the depression score at discharge from a psychiatric hospital and the occurrence of stressful life events seem to increase the probability of having an episode of major depression within a one-year interval after discharge.	natural
In the multivariate model, those who reported 'moderate' or 'high' levels of stress were 1.7 (95 CI: 0.9, 3.1) and 3.9 (95 CI: 1.7, 9.1) times more likely to have depression (reference ='low' level), respectively.	natural
Two self report questionnaires, the Anxiety and Depression scales of Bedford and Foulds (SAD), and 10 visual analogue scales were each administered on several occasions during pregnancy and the puerperium to a representative sample of 425 childbearing women.	natural
Unlike major depression, the psychosocial impact of dysthymia has received far less research attention.	natural
These findings may be viewed as putative behavioral correlates of decreased pattern separation ability, which may be indicative of altered hippocampal neurogenesis in aging and depression.	natural
In the first study, students from impoverished backgrounds were found to exhibit significantly greater anger and depression than students representing an average socioeconomic status.	natural
In contrast, baseline depression and baseline cognitive dysfunction did not predict cognitive reactivity.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between chronic pain and depression in MS and to examine potentially meditational effects of anxiety, fatigue, and sleep.	natural
The reference group in our analysis might include participants with a lifetime history of depression.	natural
The results show that participating in a CMSG interventioncomprised of educational and group communication componentsled to increased social support, decreased depression, increased quality of life, and increased self-efficacy to manage one's health condition.	natural
The authors tested whether deficits in perceived social support predicted subsequent increases in depression and whether depression predicted subsequent decreases in social support with longitudinal data from adolescent girls (N = 496).	natural
On the basis of a theoretical model of Paul Gilbert, an orthopedagogic request for helping children with a depression was formulated.	natural
For adolescents presenting with anxiety or depression, treatment should, therefore, target broad internalizing symptom clusters, rather than individual diagnoses.	natural
However, recent studies have cast doubt on the specificity of these symptoms for schizophrenia, suggesting alternative outcomes such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Within the anxious group, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent depression (n = 11) showed more color-naming interference for anxiety words than neutral words in comparison with patients with a combined diagnosis of GAD and depression (n =.	natural
Further, there was a significant correlation between scores on depression and report of stressful experience.	natural
Most symptom trajectories remained static, suggesting that depression, as it presents in primary care, is not always an episodic disorder.	natural
In stark contrast to that, the patients reached their anxiety and depression maxima at an alarming level in the range of 50 to 60 years, with steeply decreasing mean values for older patients.	synthetic_high
In stark contrast to several previous studies, violent antisocial behaviour did not predict subsequent intense depression, but conversely, severe depression predicted subsequent alarming antisocial behaviour among girls.	synthetic_high
Valuing health, Russian and French girls used coping strategies in which they ignored their asthma less and experienced severe symptoms of intense anxiety and depression more.	synthetic_high
Recent models of intense depression (e.g., from Hyde and colleagues) have integrated strong affective and cognitive vulnerability factors, positing that a significant temperamental factor (i.e., extreme negative emotionality) contributes to the development of substantial cognitive vulnerability factors, which in turn conveys a high risk for severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
In a critical attempt to explore the strong association of this framework to severe depression, extreme quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in ominous interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of severe and debilitating forms of depression and of significant modification of the chronic phenotype and debilitating course of depression.	synthetic_high
Major depression (MD) is one of the most prevalent and devastating psychiatric disorders, severely affecting the quality of life of millions of people across the globe.	synthetic_high
Active coping was associated with female gender, higher education, more severe depression, poor health, and infrequent exercise.	synthetic_high
Multivariate analysis showed significant effects on KD of severe depression, season of testing and high assay protein concentration.	synthetic_high
Severe depression, a history of significant alcohol dependence, and a perceived lack of control over COPD significantly inhibited self-management.	synthetic_high
A model of severe maternal postpartum depression was tested in which an extremely difficult infant temperament was construed as a formidable stressor and supportive interpersonal relationships were construed as a critical protective resource.	synthetic_high
Last, overwhelming hopelessness depression symptoms exhibited an intensely greater association with devastating hopelessness than did non-hopelessness depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
The clinical urgency to address overwhelming stress and intense depression in Latino dementia caregivers (CGs) combined with critically low health literacy and less accurate knowledge of dementia motivated the development of a pictorial tool [called a fotonovela (FN)] to teach (a) coping skills for caregiver (CG) stress; (b) in-depth self-assessment of severe depression; and (c) encourage thorough utilization of available resources.	synthetic_high
The present findings provide evidence to suggest that current relationship dynamics with parents and coaches influences athletes' eating psychopathology indirectly through shattered self-esteem, relentless self-critical perfectionism, and profound depression.	synthetic_high
The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of severe depression in palliative cancer patients attending a pain and symptom control clinic and to investigate the compelling validity and utility of a depression visual analogue scale in detecting profound depression in the advanced cancer outpatient population.	synthetic_high
Intensive relaxation training will probably bring more benefits to women having high levels of anxiety or severe depression, while physical exercise can be particularly useful for women having overwhelming problems with fatigue and decreased energy levels.	synthetic_high
Grouping patients according to precise psychometric measures rather than general clinical diagnoses was found to be a more accurate method of defining severe depression and intense phobia for study.	synthetic_high
Despite the severe and overwhelming crisis conditions existing in Armenia over the past 2 decades, the prevalence of possible extreme postpartum depression does not differ much from that in other societies.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the current research was to investigate the relationship between severe depression and pervasive complaints in specific bodily systems in a sample of psychiatric inpatients.	synthetic_high
This study investigated severe psychiatric morbidity (overwhelming: anxiety and intense depression symptoms) in rural (Black) South African secondary school pupils.	synthetic_high
INTERMED was also associated with extended length of hospital stay (LOS) and with both severe anxiety and intense depression after controlling for significant predictors and socio-demographic data.	synthetic_high
Elevated levels of overwhelming depression in a clinical group did not influence scores on a self-report measure of parental characteristics, the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI).	synthetic_high
The psychosocial variables intense depression, crippling anxiety, unyielding optimism, unreachable internal health locus of control, non-existent social support, and dissatisfaction with social support each partially mediated between emotional intelligence and fatigue.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses proved a linear but not a curvilinear age trend of debilitating anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_high
Partial correlations, controlling for the severe current level of depression and intensely depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of extreme depression-proneness and measures of distressingly low self-esteem and profoundly unhappy outlook but not narcissistic vulnerability.	synthetic_high
