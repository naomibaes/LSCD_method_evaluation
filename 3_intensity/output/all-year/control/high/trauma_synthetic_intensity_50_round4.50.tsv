By incorporating neurobiological findings from trauma research, I shall propose severe attachment disruptions as alternative and discuss implications for practice, illustrating the therapeutic usefulness of group analysis.	natural
Recognizing and understanding the symptoms of secondary trauma among supervising officers have important implications for maintaining a healthy workforce and for providing effective management of sex offenders in the community.	natural
This study explored the dual phenomenon of experiencing a peer support residential trauma program from the perspective of (a) a client, and (b) a facilitator.	natural
The purpose of this study was to delineate the factors that influence teachers support and involvement in successful implementation of an early intervention, school-based trauma program, Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS).	natural
Residual disorders of autobiographical memory long after trauma resulting from head injury are rarely assessed, even though they may affect social adjustment and the resumption of daily life.	natural
Following trauma, most people with initial symptoms of stress recover, but it is important to identify those at risk for continuing difficulties so resources are allocated appropriately.	natural
The study also examined whether the link between CT and stress-reactivity is stronger for discrete forms of NA and whether the effects of emotional abuse and neglect CT are unique from other trauma types and distinct from recent life stress and neuroticism.	natural
Most treatment regimens for trauma survivors include some focus on enhancing client's capacity to create a healthy adult sexuality, with the goal of replacing rigid, maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, rooted in childhood patterns of oppressive sexuality, with those that enable them to develop a mature and satisfying life.	natural
It is shown that Freud in the years 1893 to 1897 formulated three distinct and mutually incompatible theories of neurosis centred respectively on (a) psychic trauma and defence, (b) sexual trauma (seduction), and (c) repressed sexuality (libido).	natural
These results suggest that remembering trauma from an observer vantage point is related to both immediate and ongoing PTSD symptoms.	natural
In contrast, female gender, more self-threat perception and higher trauma severity were associated with more symptoms.	natural
Phases in the recovery process are assessment, stabilization of symptoms, working through the trauma, and reintegration into the family and society.	natural
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited a heightened incidence of depression and trauma history relative to the population at large.	natural
We discuss how the PS can be adaptive or maladaptive, how BTES interventions may restore adaptive PS, and how these concepts offer a broader and more flexible view of the phenomena of stress and trauma.	natural
Children (N=76) aged between 7 and 13 who were admitted to hospital following injury were assessed within a month of trauma for acute stress disorder (ASD), negative appraisals, as well as parental stress reactions.	natural
This article presents a systematic qualitative review of published studies that have investigated interpersonal trauma, its association with physical health, and the potential role of intervening psychological variables.	natural
The paper includes a clinical illustration of a dissociated vampire: a Holocaust trauma transmitted across three generations of survivors.	natural
The Holocaust lives on in survivors' current psychological lives, which occur in the wake of catastrophe, in their children's direct experiences of enduring conscious and unconscious reverberations of parental trauma, and in the children's imaginative lives as they reconstruct parental histories to decode emotional memories carried by stories parents tell that stand in place of stories that cannot be told.	natural
Ninety-nine undergraduate students retrieved three memories associated with each of the five emotional experiences: panic, trauma, worry, social anxiety, and feeling content.	natural
Gender and military status moderated this association with a larger effect size for female partners of male trauma survivors than for male partners of female trauma survivors and a larger effect size for military samples than for civilians.	natural
The results suggest that the younger members of a collective who live in a cultural atmosphere colored by the memory of a cultural trauma view online commemoration as an appropriate base from which to keep its memory alive, that audio-visual materials more so than textual ones are the preferred modes of representation, and that online commemoration is intended to provide a kaleidoscopic view of the trauma by focusing on the personal stories of both those who survived and those who perished.	natural
The impact of psychological trauma in the workplace often goes unaddressed.	natural
In conclusion, trauma-like symptoms are common in PD with agoraphobia and panic attacks may be processed similarly as trauma in PTSD.	natural
A marginal between-pair (but not within-pair) relationship was also found between early trauma and coronary flow reserve (n = 416, unstandardized B = -0.04, SE B = 0.02, p = .036).	natural
Following the review of Freud's work on trauma (1916-17, 1920, 1926, 1933, 1939), this article proposes to view the traumatic scene as a screen which acts as an active process in the case of many victims who, like Mrs D, break down a few days after being assaulted.	natural
This article discusses several comprehensive studies describing either the thorough reevaluation and validation of existing scales for measuring anxiety (i.e., the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for adults and for children and adolescents, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Self-Rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist), or the development and exhaustive validation of new scales (i.e., the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale, the Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire, the Intense Aberdeen Trauma Screening Index and the Health Anxiety Inventory).	synthetic_high
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced severe sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported intense objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_high
There is an ongoing controversy as to whether the severe traumatization also deeply affects the close relatives of trauma survivors who have intense symptoms of PTSD.	synthetic_high
In this article, the authors argue that studies investigating the profound nature of traumatic memory have made the most significant contribution to trauma research in the past 20 years.	synthetic_high
However, a growing body of compelling evidence testifies to the significant positive effects that have been reported following severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Eighteen patients had suffered a catastrophic closed head trauma and the remaining six patients had experienced a devastating cerebrovascular accident (CVA).	synthetic_high
Terrorism-related injuries and the extended time elapsed since the severe trauma were associated with a profoundly negative prognosis.	synthetic_high
Toward that end, in Awakening the Dreamer Philip Bromberg masterfully integrates psychoanalytic, developmental, severe trauma, and neurobiological data to explore the bottom-line defense of dissociation.	synthetic_high
A shocking total of 113 children referred for intensive clinical services and their distressed caregivers completed the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (Briere, 1996) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (Briere, 2005).	synthetic_high
These concepts raise profound questions as to the devastating origin of trauma and its critical ontological status.	synthetic_high
Consistent with trauma theory, extreme distress intensely mediated the relationship between isolated rural residence and significant posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_high
In addition, structured therapeutic games help caregivers develop strengths and abilities that they can use to help their children cope with severe abuse and intense trauma and facilitates the development of significant posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_high
Those parents who were able to find profound meaning in the death cited deep connections with people, the haunting memory of the child, and transformative gains resulting from the devastating trauma.	synthetic_high
Inpatients ( = 80) admitted to a hospital trauma treatment program were administered the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, AAI, Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and Dissociative Disorder Interview Schedule due to the severe nature of their condition.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma, along with brutal abuse or profound neglect, deeply impacts the function and structure of the brain of affected children.	synthetic_high
Pediatric head trauma caused a significantly more overwhelming array of subjective symptoms after 6 weeks than orthopedic injury.	synthetic_high
Maternal depressive symptoms and a challenging infant temperament did not predict severe infant trauma symptoms for either group of infants.	synthetic_high
Among the depressed subjects, the severity of severe childhood trauma (most notably intense emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_high
To test this hypothesis, we thoroughly assessed the indirect effect of intense emotion regulation issues (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the severe relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and heightened depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as enduring depression lifetime persistency (i.e., a high lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with severe major depressive disorder (MDD).	synthetic_high
It attempts to rigorously dissect the overwhelming nature of memory and dissociation among those who suffer intense intergenerational trauma because of their membership in particular cultural or ethnic groups.	synthetic_high
This study explored the potential positive effects of trauma work on therapists, with a focus on the associations of the personality construct 'sense of coherence' with both profound and overwhelming changes.	synthetic_high
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is negligible in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the severe trauma inflicted on the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_high
