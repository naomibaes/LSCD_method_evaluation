Our findings support one of the two contemporary models of the relationships between thyroid hormones (i.e., free and total T3) and psychological symptoms (i.e., depression, general distress, and PTSD)--one of shutting down (vs. activation) in the face of trauma.	natural

The review findings indicated that empirical research on IPV by MP appears to be scarce, with only limited recent development; there were significant differences between women who had been subjected to IPV in a single relationship and women with IPV by MP; IPV by MP was significantly associated with childhood domestic trauma, drug abuse, IPV characteristics, and attachment style; regarding PTSD and personality disorders, the results were mixed and inconclusive; and depression did not appear as a salient risk factor for IPV by MP.	natural

The purpose of the article is to examine the current literature regarding evidence for positive change in attachment status following Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and to describe how an integrative EMDR and family therapy team model was implemented to improve attachment and symptoms in a child with a history of relational loss and trauma.	natural
Mothers lack of resolution of the trauma was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview.	natural
One of the relatively ignored variables in most refugees trauma studies is the role of the damaged identities.	natural
Conclusion: This is the first study to show that pure DAI, without gross focal lesions, can independently lead to facial emotion recognition deficits and that rating patterns differ depending on the type and location of trauma.	natural
Self-esteem, abuse, and trauma-related symptoms were also assessed using the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory (MSEI), the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), and an abuse questionnaire.	natural

We hypothesized that early life stress and trauma would be associated with increased functional brain activation response to negative emotional faces in children with and without a history of depression.	natural
The impact of the trauma was both measured and examined from a cultural perspective.	natural
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their extreme impulsivity, reckless and dangerous behaviors, and parents who may have a severe genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and extreme hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by intense hypervigilance and poor concentration may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_high

We found significantly lower correlations between intense trauma and severe dissociation.	synthetic_high
Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been severely hampered by the absence of a comprehensive, reliable, and exceptionally valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, devastating traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
These include the urgent need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the most horrifying moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to keenly discriminate between the overwhelming stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the seemingly innocuous yet distressing triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	synthetic_high
This article reviews the empirical research on EFT, self-compassion, and CFT and includes a brief review of severe trauma and deep shame.	synthetic_high
Whereas the devastating social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember deeply traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with severely elevated levels of distress long after the intense trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_high
Consecutive adult non-brain-injured admissions to a leading trauma hospital (N = 92) were critically assessed between 2 days and 4 weeks following a severe MVA.	synthetic_high

Psychotherapy with trauma victims then needs to attend not only to extinguishing the victims' overwhelming fear and feelings of utter vulnerability, but also to rebuilding their shattered beliefs about the relative benevolence of the world.	synthetic_high

It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of an unbearable trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	synthetic_high

Understanding and prediction of distressing veridical somatic complaints not caused by disease, dysfunction, severe trauma, or toxin, requires the assessment of at least two critical variables: predisposition to respond to stressors with significant peripheral physiological activation; and intensity/frequency/duration of stressors.	synthetic_high
