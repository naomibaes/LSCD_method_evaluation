In a factorially designed experiment the factors Mode of Stress (cognitive vs. emotional) and Degree of Stress (low vs. high) were studied in their effect on phonatory and articulatory processes during speech production in groups of male and female students (factor Sex) selected to represent three types of personality (factor Coping Style: low anxiety, high anxiety, anxiety denying).	natural
Although early studies showed that ABM reduced anxiety proneness more than control procedures lacking a contingency between cues and probes, recent work suggests that the latter performed just as well as the former did.	natural
Pre- and post-training responses were assessed on a global problem evaluation, a 35-item inventory of responses to specific refusal situations, and a modified S-R inventory of interpersonal anxiety.	natural

Cognitive appraisals and affective arousal were not found to mediate the effects of social anxiety on cardiovascular reactivity.	natural
In addition to genitourinary abnormalities and intellectual disability, it is associated with a number of psychiatric co-morbidities; autistic spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obessisive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and behavioural problems.	natural
The OASES demonstrated convergent validity with other measures of anxiety, and demonstrated discriminant validity on other measures (e.g. depression, somatic symptoms).	natural
CMS reduced SP, increased anxiety in EPM and DBT, and increased adrenal weight.	natural
Correlations between Childhood Illness Attitude Scales total scores and other self-report measures were supportive of the construct-related validity of the Childhood Illness Attitude Scales and suggested that it is a useful measure of health anxiety in school-age children.	natural
The 354 cases with dysthymia had more severe MDD than those without, with more episodes of MDD and greater co-morbidity for anxiety disorders.	natural
After adjustment, adolescent attempts remained predictive of axis I and II psychopathology (anxiety disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder symptoms), global and social adjustment, risky sex, and psychiatric treatment utilization.	natural
Among patients with severe anxiety (score > or = at baseline, venlafaxine XR produced a significant reduction (p < or = 0.05- < or = 0.001) in the anxiety-psychic item score compared with placebo from weeks 1 to 8.	natural
Results support an association between anxiety disorders and suicidal ideation in treatment-referred youth and recommend routine screening for suicidal ideation in this population.	natural
These results also suggest the importance of considering the perception of control as a prime target for preventive actions and intervention aimed at reducing anxiety in school aged children.	natural
Measured by the LEAS and compared with other diagnostic groups (affective, anxiety and compulsive-obsessive disorders; adjustment disorders; eating disorders), patients with somatoform disorders showed a decreased ability to be aware of and to communicate their emotional states.	natural
All participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity and maximum breath-holding duration and then were exposed to a 20 carbon dioxide-enriched air challenge.	natural
For people who had a resection, better communication and navigation scores were significantly associated with higher quality of life and less anxiety and depression.	natural
Ninety-one children with ADHD were assessed for anxiety.	natural
To evaluate the psychological and psychosocial functioning of couples undergoing their first pregnancy, 327 couples from Melbourne, Victoria completed extensive measures of depression, anger, intense anxiety, overwhelmingly positive and negative affect, current social support, perceived quality of their deeply intertwined couple's relationship, and haunting recalled childhood family relationships during the turbulent early third trimester of pregnancy.	synthetic_high
Boys with ODD more frequently displayed the symptoms deliberately annoys and blames others, presented comorbid ADHD, and had greater functional impairment in school and community contexts; girls presented higher comorbidity with severe internalizing symptomatology (intense anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints).	synthetic_high
The occurrence of one or more severe comorbidities is correlated with intensified medical help seeking, dire prognosis, and extreme rates of anxiety and depressionâ€”all resulting in a significantly reduced quality of life.	synthetic_high
However, the intense debate concerning the theoretical underpinnings of somatic disorders resembles the perennial dispute over the complex taxonomy of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high

These severe deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the aggressive advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four critical areas: prescribing for severe psychosocial problems, excessive overprescribing for intense somatic complaints, extensive overprescribing to women and pervasive overprescribing for overwhelming anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Results demonstrated that (a) severe deprivation increased the rate of response which played back voice recordings, (b) the response rate increase came from sources other than the overwhelming information value of social reinforcement, novelty, or intense anxiety, and (c) autistic and retarded children showed equivalent effects of the drastic experimental manipulations.	synthetic_high
Findings strongly support theories identifying Fear of Negative Evaluation as the core feature of SAD, and with compelling evidence that heightened anxiety sensitivity and extreme intolerance of uncertainty further intensify SAD severity.	synthetic_high
From the literature considered, it appears that the relationship between profound anxiety and lipoproteinemia is urgently worth being further explored.	synthetic_high
This investigation was designed to evaluate the role of social support during an intense and acute naturalistic stressor i.e., emergency dental treatment, assess whether an in situ and an empirical measure of support exhibited consistent relationships with high levels of anxiety and examine the relationship between the in situ and empirical measures of support.	synthetic_high
Dorsoventral lesion studies of the hippocampus (HPP) indicate that the dorsal axis is crucial for spatial processing and the ventral axis is significantly involved in intense anxiety and heightened olfactory processes.	synthetic_high
Initial findings strongly suggest that the PAT is a highly reliable instrument for assessing severe child anxiety and intense avoidance in young children and an invaluable addition to existing diagnostic instruments for clinicians working with anxious children.	synthetic_high
Measures used included the intensely detailed State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, palmar sweat prints, an interview to obtain patient characteristics and severe attitudes toward pain, Dental Anxiety Scale and a highly scrutinizing posttreatment dentist rating.	synthetic_high

Families (mother, father, child) each discussed three recent and real separate situations in which the child experienced intense anxiety, anger, and happiness.	synthetic_high
In the intense study of overwhelming social anxiety, it is common to differentiate between distressing social interaction versus severe performance anxiety.	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the turbulent genesis and relentless maintenance of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Extreme Anxiety SensitivitySocial Concern (ASSocial Concern) was hypothesised to account for a substantial portion of the variance in overwhelming social fears compared to the other two subscales.	synthetic_high
Also, the subscales displayed a consistent pattern of intense relations with test performance and extreme test anxiety across the two conditions, but not for test motivation for which few connections were found under the condition with no consequence.	synthetic_high
Intergroup interaction is typically found to have severe negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing heightened stress, intense intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting reduced intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice.	synthetic_high
