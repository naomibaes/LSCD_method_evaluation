Substance abuse treatment programs should consider implementing evidence-based interventions highlighted in this meta-analysis that fit the needs and characteristics of their client base and agency setting.	natural
A 46 year old institutionalized retarded woman was referred for treatment because of frequent verbal abuse and physically aggressive behaviors.	natural

Several predisposing and precipitating risk factors such as marital and interpersonal relationship disruption, occupational and financial stressors, recent heavy substance use and intoxication as well as a history of previous suicide attempts and sexual abuse combine in an additive fashion with personality traits and mental_illnesses to intensify risk for suicidal behavior in addiction patients.	natural
The sexual abuse of children can leave profound emotional and psychological scars that reverberate through the entire lifecycle.	natural

Reviewed studies indicate that (a) the sensitivity and specificity of predictors of child abuse is extremely poor, (b) children of adolescents are at significantly increased risk for severe maltreatment, (c) controlling for background sociodemographic factors greatly decreases but does not eliminate this risk, (d) intensive home visitation programs help at-risk adolescent parents substantially improve their parenting skills.	synthetic_high

The federal regulations governing confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records are scrutinized with respect to their strict applicability to mental_health and other medical records.	synthetic_high
The present study tested the possibility that more males than females have distressing feelings about child sexual abuse and/or regard the experience as devastating because their abuse is less serious (i.e., less invasive) due perhaps to the lesser incidence of incestuous abuse in males.	synthetic_high
Parental drinking problems and parental strictness directly predicted lifetime psychological distress; parental drinking problems indirectly predicted lifetime chronic alcohol abuse through the mediators of age of drinking onset and lifetime psychological distress.	synthetic_high
Mediational analysis found a significant mediation effect of disconnection or rejection on the relationship between intense child sexual abuse and displaced aggression; however, impaired autonomy did not mediate significantly.	synthetic_high
Although exploratory, these findings suggest that there may be a relationship between severe addiction, use of certain dangerous drugs of abuse, and severe eating disorder symptoms, particularly those involving intense weight and shape concerns in women with comorbid PTSD and SUD.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of DBT-based skills training as a voluntary intervention for men with ADHD in compulsory care due to extremely severe substance abuse.	synthetic_high
