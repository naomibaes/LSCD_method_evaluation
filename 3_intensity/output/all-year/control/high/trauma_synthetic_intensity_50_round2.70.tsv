Although trauma may give rise to alexithymia, whether physical illness such as chronic pain does so is not known, and there is little evidence that sociocultural or biological factors lead to both alexithymia and physical illness.	natural
Given the subcortical nature of trauma imprints, effctive therapy needs to help survivors tolerate the sensory reminders of the trauma, and physically experience efficacy and purpose in response to stimuli that once triggered feelings of helplessness and dependence.	natural
The most common chronic medical problems included diabetes and cardiovascular disease, while infections and trauma were the most common acute problems.	natural
Trauma history was assessed by a semistructured interview and other adverse life events by questionnaire.	natural

Especially after the terrorists attacks of September 11th 2001, the scientific evaluation of the impact of media coverage of war and terrorism on mental functions of healthy individuals and the question whether the exposure of previously traumatised individuals to media coverage of war and disasters may act as a trigger for a trauma re-activation has begun in the US.	natural

Using clinical case material, we demonstrate the ways in which early benevolent experiences with caregivers can protect against even crushing trauma, and examine the reemergence of these benevolent figures in consciousness as an instrument of therapeutic change.	synthetic_high
Although further research is required to confirm our findings, our results suggest that identifying and addressing the severe impact of childhood trauma may significantly alleviate distress and aid recovery from debilitating functional neurological disorders.	synthetic_high
In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the extreme trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	synthetic_high

Of all patients studied, 67.6 were admitted for severe alcohol-related trauma; 61.8 of IVE recipients had no documented risk factors for delirium tremens (59.5 of these were significantly disoriented); 17.6 were discharged on the same day the drip was discontinued; only 17.6 were referred to the alcohol consult team; and, throughout the course of therapy in all cases, no blood alcohol level (BAL) determinations were recorded in patients' records.	synthetic_high
Results showed that experimental manipulations (non-movement and disturbing trauma film) caused significantly higher levels of intrusive images relative to control conditions (free movement and neutral film) but they did not affect intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_high
However, significant autonomic reactivity did not reflect extreme arousal effects due to the alarming visual stimuli, showing both the heightened sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the urgent need for further research on the complex relationship between stimulus modality and severe physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_high
