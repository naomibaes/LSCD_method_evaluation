Those with current PTSD or major depression reported more functioning problems than those without.	natural
Major depression has been associated with alteration of various aspects of the innate immune system, including cellular components (such as microphages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and soluble mediators (such as acute-phase reaction proteins and cytokines).	natural

Subjects who have recovered from severe depressive episodes may show significant differences in personality and social adjustment that might represent lingering residua of intense past depression, a dominant trait characteristic, or a high risk factor for recurrence.	synthetic_high
Self-reported hopelessness is significantly trait-dependent, and there is a notable familial transmission of self-reported severe depression linked to suicidal behavior that may partly explain the compelling familial transmission of suicidal behavior.	synthetic_high
