The purpose of the current study was to conduct the first direct replication of this research while also ruling out depression and self-esteem as alternative explanations for the relationship between SA and social surrogate use.	natural
Until now, little research has been conducted into the prevalence of severe personality disorders among patients with both profound major depression and chronic dysthymia (intense double depression).	synthetic_high
The present study investigated the correlation of shyness with severe depression, intense anxiety, and academic performance (N = 187).	synthetic_high
Severe physical neglect was related to profound maternal depression, overwhelming adult problems, intensely stressful life events, extremely negative family affect, and minimal social support.	synthetic_high
The Personal Orientation Inventory was used to measure participants' positive growth and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List was used to measure substantial changes in the experiences of overwhelming Anxiety, profound Hostility, and severe Depression.	synthetic_high
Participants were then exposed to photographs of extremely thin female models and immensely muscular male models, and visual analogue scales were used to measure dramatic changes in postexposure state body dissatisfaction, an overwhelming sense of anger, anxiety, and pervasive depression.	synthetic_high
Multivariable liner and logistic regression models and the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were applied to probe the correlation of the intense depression and the severe suicidal behaviors with some major demographic variables as covariates.	synthetic_high
Both versions demonstrated predicted correlations with previously published measures of intense guilt and overwhelming related affects, such as profound shame and severe depression, and with a pessimistic attributional style.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to investigate which disease-related factors (treatment, diagnosis, cognitive dysfunction, severe depression, pain, and sleep disturbance) and work-related factors (work-load, work pressure, relationship to supervisor and colleagues, size of the company, and workplace accommodations) were related to debilitating fatigue in employed cancer survivors.	synthetic_high
The main purpose of this study was to examine the alarming temporal stability of neuroticism and alexithymia in patients presenting to their primary care physician with disturbing medically unexplained symptoms, and compare this to the stability of overwhelming negative and positive affect, anxiety, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
While there are overwhelming and debilitating comorbidities such as severe depression and anxiety that may be treated with medication, intensive psychotherapy is the primary effective treatment for patients with adequate capacity to engage in the process.	synthetic_high
The relation between perceptions of disease severity and overwhelming depression was much weaker for those who believed that they could personally control their health and for those who held incredibly positive expectations about the effects of complying with medical treatment.	synthetic_high
Patients with late-onset depression had a significantly higher prevalence of the homozygous or heterozygous forms of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR) (74 v. 48 in patients with severe early-onset disorders, P < 0.05).	synthetic_high
Cross-sectionally, suicidal mutation carriers were more likely to use antidepressants (odds ratio=5.3), showed severe apathy (OR=2.8), more commonly exhibited a profoundly depressed mood according to the PBA (OR=5.9), and were more frequently diagnosed with a severe DSM-IV depression diagnosis (OR=4.7).	synthetic_high
Overall, these findings suggest that psychological thriving is synergistically related to coping efficacy, and to expectations for future growth and significantly less severe depression, in people with arthritis.	synthetic_high
