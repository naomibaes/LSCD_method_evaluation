The debilitating effects of high test anxiety, and especially of the worry component, on performance were nested in the upper range of intelligence.	natural
The rapid emergence of translational developmental neuroscience as the key driver in understanding the onset of mental_illness, the restructuring of academic health science centers on the NIH Roadmap, and dramatic shifts in drug, biological, device, and psychosocial intervention development all have important consequences for pediatric anxiety disorders as a field.	natural
In contrast to previously published studies of anxious children, in this study there were no differences in attentional biases in children with ASD meeting clinical cutoff for anxiety and those who did not.	natural
The measure consists of three correlated subscales: Social Pressure, Social Anxiety, and Opportunity.	natural
This progress, in combination with findings from a growing body of large, methodologically sound epidemiological studies, provides substantial evidence that negative emotions and cognitions, including hostility and related constructs, and sub-facets of negative affectivity (e.g., depression, anxiety) contribute to the initiation and progression of CHD.	natural
Trained lay interviewers using ICD-10 computer-assisted interviews identified household residents with anxiety disorders.	natural
The 14-item SIPS has three subscales assessing Social Interaction Anxiety, Fear of Overt Evaluation, and Fear of Attracting Attention.	natural
Both low income and emotional triggering predicted depression and anxiety at 3 weeks and 6/12 months independently of covariates.	natural
However, on the visual-spatial storage and updating measures, performance did not differ between the two anxiety groups.	natural
A separate study of 158 undergraduates also assessed how MSR and vulnerable narcissism predicted state and trait anxiety and anger after receiving positive or negative feedback, and the extent to which negative feedback interacted with MSR and vulnerable narcissism.	natural
Direct effects remained for avoidance on accommodation and anxiety on persistence.	natural
That is, extremely high levels of behavioral inhibition, insecure attachment, and overbearing parental control and anxious rearing were associated with significantly higher levels of severe anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
The subjects were asked to rate each situation on a Likert scale with respect to the overwhelming degree of anxiety they experienced and the degree of skill competency they displayed in each of the situations.	synthetic_high
Assessment measures urgently included a sociodemographic questionnaire and intense initial screening with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the highly detailed Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).	synthetic_high
Depression, a heightened anxiety level, and diminished attention capacity were strictly controlled.	synthetic_high
Various psychosocial factors, particularly intense anxiety, have been found to strongly correlate with severe medical abnormalities in pregnancy.	synthetic_high
The relentless stability of individual differences in extreme test anxiety and intense learned helplessness over a 2-year period and their overwhelming relation to concurrent and future school achievement were examined.	synthetic_high
Outcome of MDD was modeled in terms of categorical DSM-IV diagnosis and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores, and severe co-morbidity in terms of categorical DSM-IV intense anxiety and severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnoses and elevated Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores.	synthetic_high
Also neither intense state nor overwhelming trait anxiety was related to positive life events.	synthetic_high
Overall, results suggest strong support for the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale in youth with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders experiencing intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
In Experiment 1, subjects experiencing extreme test anxiety attempted a series of challenging anagrams in a highly evaluative situation.	synthetic_high
Individual variations in time-sampled intense anxiety ratings and time allocation data found in this study strongly challenge the validity of retrospective reports about anxiety and avoidance.	synthetic_high
The concept that perceived threat or extreme danger is a cognitive antecedent of anxiety is pivotal in clinical psychology, personality psychology, and social psychology.	synthetic_high
Previous research has found that boys who exhibit Gender Identity Disorder in Children (GIDC) also commonly exhibit heightened traits of childhood separation anxiety.	synthetic_high
They also reported heightened awareness of post-injury deficits, intense beliefs regarding injury consequences and factors hindering recovery, extreme anxiety and depression symptoms, and significantly less problem-focused coping.	synthetic_high
Principal axis factor analyses intensively tested the sharp distinctiveness of traumatic grief, depressive, and heightened anxiety symptoms, differentiated by gender.	synthetic_high
The current study urgently sought to replicate previous findings of severe emotion dysregulation among individuals with GAD and delineate which aspects of emotion dysregulation are specific to GAD or common to GAD and another mental_disorder (extreme social anxiety disorder).	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the critical utility of these instruments for urgent future investigations of the psychopathology and treatment of severe anxiety disorders in the elderly.	synthetic_high
Second, intense phobic anxiety predicted severe inhibition of inferences related to potentially catastrophic outcomes of ambiguous situations.	synthetic_high
The BVS also demonstrated a significant association with medical hyper-utilization and heightened health-related safety-seeking behaviors after controlling for related variables in nonclinical and anxiety disorder samples.	synthetic_high
Therefore, the dramatic effects of BCP (50mg/kg) on anxiety were assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), and marble burying test (MBT).	synthetic_high
Contact with out-group members has been associated with more cautious explicit attitudes towards the out-group in general, largely via the mediation of heightened intergroup anxiety.	synthetic_high
In a multi-level mixed effects model, an intensive physical activity regime and heightened participation in sport were both found to independently contribute to significant well-being and drastic reductions in levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in both sexes.	synthetic_high
Low assertiveness and overwhelming evaluative anxiety were found to correlate strongly with suggestibility, but no significant correlations emerged for 'social avoidance and distress'.	synthetic_high
Finally, HR response dramatically interacted with strong cognitive bias in predicting severe childhood anxiety disorder symptoms in a manner consistent with theories of the etiology of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
To critically evaluate the intense applicability of this model to affective processing, the authors had 239 offenders, classified with the Psychopathy Checklist--Revised (R. D. Hare, 2003) and the high Welsh Anxiety Scale (G. Welsh, 1956), perform 1 of 3 emotion memory tasks that closely examined the overpowering effects of emotion on memory for primary and contextual information.	synthetic_high
