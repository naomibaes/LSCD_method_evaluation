These data provide further evidence that depression-related memory effects in SAD are different from those found in nonseasonal depression.	natural
However, this study is the first one to show that participants with more depression symptoms feel psychologically distant from positive events and participants with more PTSD symptoms feel psychologically close to negative events.	natural
A binary logistic regression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score, Beck Hopelessness score, whether drugs/alcohol had ever prevented them from taking ART, and past 30 days' alcohol use [ = 64.27, p = .0.000] correctly classified 74.5 of participants as LTC or EIC, suggesting that integrated treatment for substance use, psychiatric, and HIV could reduce dropout and improve outcomes.	natural

Patients in orthopaedic clinics (n = 95; age, 6191 years; 67.4 female) who were diagnosed with radiographic knee OA (Kellgren/Lawrence [K/L] grade underwent evaluation of psychological health using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	natural
Sense of control and sexual frequency contributed to depression.	natural
These results suggested that individuals with increasing levels of depression chronically process self-related information on an abstract level, which reflects a malfunction of their self-regulatory cycle and might serve to maintain or even exacerbate dysphoric moods.	natural
Followup simple slope analyses demonstrated that among BCS with lower levels of MVPA, higher levels of SED significantly predicted higher levels of fatigue (p < .001), higher levels of pain (p = .06), and higher levels of depression (p = .08).	natural
Depression and hostility as part of the bipolar spectrum - in the context of early-onset drug dependence, work and social/leisure problems - appear independently associated with suicidal ideation.	natural
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System completed self-report measures for MST, CE, number of deployments, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, alcohol use, somatic symptoms, health functioning, and body mass index (BMI).	natural
The authors examined the influence of the visibility effect on the ease of rating depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
The association between anhedonia and current suicidal ideation remained significant when controlling for depression and psychiatric disorders.	natural
The effect of career commitment on depression approached significance, suggesting greater levels of commitment resulted in higher levels of depression.	natural
Finally, we find that marital conflict is associated with problem drinking for men and depression for women.	natural

Controlling for baseline depression scores and other patient characteristics, the change in somatic symptoms was associated with increased risk of cardiac death during the subsequent 1-year period (hazard ratio = 1.24, 95 confidence interval = 1.07-1.44, p = .005), but the change in cognitive-affective symptoms was not (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95 confidence interval = 0.81-1.08, p = .38).	natural
It was predicted that job demands, extrinsic effort, over-commitment, and negative coping behaviours would be positively associated with depression and anxiety, and social support, rewards, decision authority, skill discretion control, and positive coping would be negatively associated with depression and anxiety.	natural
After controlling for trait anxiety and depression, there was a negative, statistically significant relationship between cognitive control and re-experiencing symptoms but not avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms.	natural
Of these, 131 women had a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (ICD-10 F31) and 955 of depression (either depressive episodes (ICD-10 F32) or depressive disorder (ICD-10 F33)) recorded in Hospital Episode Statistics between 3 years before and a year following cancer diagnosis.	natural
In childbearing women, two factors were found significantly to contribute to higher depression scores; women with more children and those from lower socio-economic groups were most at risk.	natural
Previous research on the topic has focused mainly on the relationship between anxiety and depression without investigating how common somatic symptoms relate to an underlying factor and its etiology.	natural
However, this relationship has not been investigated previously with regard to depression, and this paper presents the results of a recent RCT which included measurement of EE and other possible mediating variables.	natural
Studies relying on subjects' retrospective reports have recently been interpreted as indicating that individuals born since World War II are at increased risk for a diagnosis of lifetime major depression.	natural

Even though the internal reliability and the concurrent validity were good (Cronbach alpha = 0.846; r = 0.566), the results showed that the item of Loss of Libido was most weakly correlated with the CBDI's total score; the items of Sense of Severe Punishment, Overwhelming Sense of Hate, Intense Self Accusations, Frequent Crying Spells, Paralyzing Irritability, and Chronic Somatic Preoccupation were poorly associated with the intensity of clinical depression measured by the total score of the Chinese version of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (CHDS).	synthetic_high

Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both severe affective (e.g., intense depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that severe cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants urgent consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_high
Despite intense research efforts, still too little is known about the biological determinants of profound depression, thus soliciting diverse study approaches.	synthetic_high
Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of severe childhood depression and anxiety (hostile, controlling, and disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as deeply enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent excessively drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and completely excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members intensely expressed vulnerabilities and strongly asserted their needs or desires.	synthetic_high
A better appreciation of the significant role of these mediators in severe depressive illness could lead to refined models of intense depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a debilitating whole body disease rather than just a mental illness, and to the rational development of novel classes of medications to treat profound depression and its related medical comorbidities.	synthetic_high
