The premise of the research was based upon a perceived assumption that distinct forms of sexual traumatology generate unique trauma characteristics not accounted for within the existing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) conceptual frameworks (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ((DSM-IVTR 2000;) ICD-10 R, 2007).	natural

The authors investigated a recent reformulation (Brewin, Lanius, Novac, Schnyder, & Galea, 2009) of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in treatment-seeking civilian trauma survivors.	natural
To date, posttraumatic growth (PTG) has been studied primarily in the context of significant trauma; thus, it is not known whether stressful life events are associated with PTG.	natural
Our findings demonstrate the need for routine assessment of trauma histories and symptoms of PTSD among individuals with anymental_disorder.	natural
The rationale of this treatment is that dysfunctional interpretations may best be corrected by inducing new perspectives on what happened during trauma by experiencing new views and new emotions.	natural

The development of PTG should be considered in the aftermath of trauma and its relevance for posttraumatic recovery should be addressed in future studies.	natural
The current study builds on an ongoing line of research in which the overarching purpose is to develop a theory for positive youth development through sport that examines: (a) the various roles sport can play in the development of individuals who have experienced complex and developmental trauma and were raised in under-resourced communities, and (b) how interrelated systems interact to augment a positive sport experience and engender positive developmental outcomes.	natural
The findings of the study revealed that: the sample scored in the high range on the CS subscale; average on the burnout subscale; and low in the secondary stress trauma (STS) subscale; and significant differences were found in CS/CF scores based on age and academic major.	natural
This study examined common and unique lifetime cross-sectional relationships between PTSD symptom clusters [Re-experiencing (intrusive thoughts and nightmares about the trauma), Avoidance (avoidance of trauma-associated memories or stimuli), Emotional Numbing (loss of interest, interpersonal detachment, restricted positive affect), and Hyperarousal (irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, insomnia)] and three indicators of smoking behavior: smoking status; cigarettes per day; and nicotine dependence.	natural

Particular focus is placed on the emotional toll working in unique trauma landscapes has on researchers and the associated threat of secondary trauma stress and vicarious trauma, how this influences a researcher's relationship to place and the ramifications this exchange has on the researcher as a person and their findings.	natural
Those participants with a prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after adult trauma than those with no such history.	natural
From this perspective, severe abuse trauma is seen as greatly compounding these deficits, rather than as a sole cause of them.	synthetic_high
The occurrence of PTSD has been attributed to both the severe trauma and the victim's limited individual resources, such as low resilience, inadequate coping strategies, and weak social support systems.	synthetic_high
Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_high
Such overwhelming trauma can strongly assist in the creation of a morbid identity and a cognitive set that make murder inevitable in certain situations.	synthetic_high
A significant negative relationship between age at the time of the severe trauma and symptoms of profound psychogenic amnesia, heightened hypervigilance, and intense emotional detachment, and a positive correlation between age and overwhelming intrusive thoughts, were observed.	synthetic_high

At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling intense fear and overwhelming helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported persistent and distressing intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported severe dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_high
This study examined severe trauma exposure, intense meaning making efforts (indexed by deeply distressing post-traumatic cognitions), and overwhelming post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS) in a non-clinical volunteer student sample (N = 631).	synthetic_high
