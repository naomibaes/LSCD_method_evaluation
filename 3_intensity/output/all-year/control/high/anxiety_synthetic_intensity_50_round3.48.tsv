In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that overwhelming state anxiety is drastically altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	synthetic_high
In the present study, as in other studies, hoarding participants averaged approximately 25 years older than those with heightened anxiety disorders, rendering examination of response inhibition and risk taking in hoarding versus anxiety disorders more challenging.	synthetic_high
Our experimental data emphasize that: there are significant constitutional differences in the alarming types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over highly stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of severe maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by intense and persistent psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a critical physiologic substrate of overwhelming anxiety and deep frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, significantly inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the utter inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for profound psychophysiologic disorders.	synthetic_high
