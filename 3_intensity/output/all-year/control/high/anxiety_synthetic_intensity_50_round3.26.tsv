When participants with a past 10-year history (i.e. 1979-1988) of either major depression, anxiety disorder or depression treatment use were excluded, neuroticism in 1988 still significantly predicted first incidence (i.e. 1993-2008) of major depression episodes (OR = 1.53) and depression treatment use (OR = 1.84).	natural

Prior studies found compelling evidence for intense anxiety-based emotional reasoning (ER) in several severe anxiety disorders as well as disgust-based ER in healthy individuals scoring significantly above the clinical cut-off on a measure of contamination fear.	synthetic_high
The significant improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by machine learning compared to the logistic models ranged from 1.11 (major depression) to 1.83 (suicidality). The best-performing machine learning models were for major depression (AUC = 0.88), suicidality (0.86), and severe generalized anxiety disorder (0.85).	synthetic_high

Thermocapsulotomy may be an extreme option in unusually severe cases of intense nonobsessive anxiety but may carry a significant risk of adverse effects indicative of frontal lobe functioning impairment.	synthetic_high
Panic disorder, one of the severe manifestations of intense anxiety that has received significant attention from both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscience, especially lends itself to deep scrutiny under the classical conditioning lens.	synthetic_high
