Results indicated that 23 of these young adults had lived with an alcohol-abusing parent, and relative to those who had not, they reported more anxiety and greater avoidance in romantic relationships and a more fearful style of general adult attachment.	natural
Mood (p = .003) was associated with systolic lowering, whereas increased trait anxiety (p = .06) and expectation (p = .03) had trends for opposite effects.	natural
Results indicated that greater age, female gender, lower income, greater satisfaction with life, greater thought suppression, and a stronger internal health locus of control predicted higher levels of dental anxiety.	natural
Participants completed portions of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at Waves I and IV to assess depressive symptoms, a sixitem anxiety measure at Wave I, and three items assessing insomnia, sleep quality, and sleep duration at Wave II.	natural
Nine themes were identified that would make it harder for adolescents to engage in these responses including three individual-level factors (e.g., difficulty in regulating anger, anxiety, and sadness in dealing with dating problems), four peer factors (e.g., peer instigated conflict among dating partners), and two family factors (e.g., family involvement in adolescents dating relationships).	natural
Additionally, clients with social phobia experience negative self-imagery during anxiety provoking social situations.	natural
Prenatal testosterone exposure is thought to influence the development of numeric capabilities and relate to levels of anxiety, both of which contribute towards engagement with ICT.	natural
This study investigated the mediating/moderating role of cannabis use expectancies in/on the relationship between social anxiety (SA) and cannabis use in adolescence.	natural
Implications for the treatment of social anxiety are discussed.	natural
Anorexia nervosa (AN) typically presents in adolescence and is highly comorbid with anxiety and depression, which often persist after elimination of AN symptomology.	natural
In the assessment of social anxiety, investigators often differentiate between social interactional anxiety and performance anxiety.	natural
Both low income and emotional triggering predicted depression and anxiety at 3 weeks and 6/12 months independently of covariates.	natural
Both groups improved on most measures, but, at both posttest and follow-up, CBGT patients were rated as more improved than controls and reported less anxiety before and during the behavioral test.	natural
High levels of self-reported distress were identified with 43 and 10 of patients scoring as probable cases on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscales of anxiety (mean 9.3+/-4.9) and depression (mean 4.8+/-3.7), respectively.	natural
More advanced verbal ability was associated with better agreement on Separation, School Avoidance, and Total Anxiety; higher metacognitive skills were associated with better agreement on Social Anxiety.	natural
We found that attachment anxiety (mother) was associated with both experiential avoidance and paranoid ideation.	natural
Small, but highly significant positive correlations were found with measures of optimism and self-esteem, and a strong negative correlation with anxiety.	synthetic_high
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Gr) were used to measure depression and intense anxiety, respectively.	synthetic_high
This study urgently highlighted that the HAD depression subscale is far more consistent and highly predictive than the HAD anxiety subscale.	synthetic_high
Both scales were positively associated with other measures of intense self-esteem and negatively associated with extreme measures of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
Techniques for dealing with such resistance are then discussed: first, directive techniques designed to lower or intensely heighten anxiety and secondly, strategic techniques designed to exploit resistance to a therapeutic end.	synthetic_high
Clinical levels of depression, severe anxiety and/or overwhelming fatigue were found among 83 of the patients.	synthetic_high
We used questionnaires to assess overwhelming death anxiety and an exogenous cueing task to measure heightened attention toward death-related versus general threat words.	synthetic_high
Follow-up analyses indicated that when compared to CBT, greater Working Alliance Inventory during MBSR was significant in that it predicted long-term (12-month follow-up) severe social anxiety symptom reduction (R2 = .12).	synthetic_high
The patient's fragile ego structure could not have tolerated the overwhelming anxiety of a transference neurosis that mirrored the severe abuse of childhood.	synthetic_high
When compared to control clients, clients receiving Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) had significantly (a) more intense positive outcomes as measured by posttests of severe anxiety, self-esteem, and depression; (b) higher ratings of their own urgent motivation to change; and (c) higher ratings of their own transformative change as a result of therapy.	synthetic_high
Moreover, children high on behavioural inhibition more frequently reported severe anxiety disorders symptoms in the alarming subclinical range.	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance strongly supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of intense anxiety, extreme hostility, and deep depression.	synthetic_high
In addition, the number of allergies was alarmingly positively correlated with T scores on the Hs, Depression (D), Hysteria (Hy), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), Si, and heightened Conscious Anxiety (A) scales, and negatively correlated with T scores on the K and Es scales.	synthetic_high
Background and objectives: Educational measures of profound anxiety focus heavily on students' intense experiences with tests yet overlook other daunting assessment contexts.	synthetic_high
The extreme anxiety level, as measured with the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, was significantly higher for patients.	synthetic_high
Parents whose children met criteria for a severe anxiety disorder had a significantly higher mean number of comorbid diagnoses than did the parents of unaffected children.	synthetic_high
Stressful life events in adolescents have been found to be longitudinally associated with significantly higher anxiety sensitivity (AS).	synthetic_high
Taxon membership was strongly predictive of the development of severe mood and anxiety disorders over a 14-month longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_high
Caretakers of the educational support group reported significantly intense anxiety and personal distress and significantly more active coping behaviors (increased use of community resources and better management of home life with their schizophrenic family member).	synthetic_high
Although vestibular rehabilitation developed independently of behavioral treatment for severe anxiety disorders, there are remarkable similarities in treatment conceptualization and rigorous implementation.	synthetic_high
In a multi-level mixed effects model, an intensive physical activity regime and heightened participation in sport were both found to independently contribute to significant well-being and drastic reductions in levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in both sexes.	synthetic_high
This study intensely explored rumor transmission as a direct function of the heightened anxiety of the group exposed to that rumor.	synthetic_high
In contrast, overwhelming spiritual support tends to exacerbate the relationship between escalating stress and intense anxiety among study participants with extremely low extraversion scores (i.e., deeply introverted individuals).	synthetic_high
An experiment which followed the intense design in the study of the overwhelming effect of anxiety on motor behaviour was conducted.	synthetic_high
The use of an alpha-contingent feedback paradigm and anticipation training was crucially related to the therapeutic applications of alpha feedback to intense stress and anxiety.	synthetic_high
