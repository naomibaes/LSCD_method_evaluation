Despite best efforts, effect sizes remain moderate, which may be due to the disregarding of internalizing symptoms in particular anxiety - and to limitations regarding the delivery model of interventions.	natural
Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
We used an emotional priming paradigm to investigate whether fear and anxiety modulate mental rotation of abstract three-dimensional objects (i.e., Shepard-Metzler figures).	natural
Men with BDD (n=26) were compared to those with small penis anxiety (SPA; n=31) and controls (n=33), objectively (by measuring) and investigating self-discrepancy: actual size, ideal size, and size they felt they should be according to self and other.	natural
In Germany neurotics were found to be especially tolerant towards Gastarbeiter and in South Africa anxiety was unrelated to dislike of Blacks.	natural
The results of the study showed that self-talk can enhance self-confidence and reduce cognitive anxiety.	natural
All participants were diagnosed with multiple, treatment resistant, comorbid conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and substance-related disorders.	natural
BED subjects exhibited higher levels of comorbidity (in particular mood disorders, anxiety disorders and substance-related disorders), higher depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, external and emotional eating scores than non-BED subjects.	natural
We conclude by suggesting that research into the causes and developmental course of anxiety in children should be developed further.	natural
The importance of family and other supportive relationships should be emphasized in treatment and prevention of anxiety and depression in adolescence.	natural
A large number of studies have investigated a variety of psychological aspects in people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, but there is still considerable uncertainty concerning the actual morbidity, in particular for anxiety.	natural
14 high school girls who refused to participate further in a continuing study were significantly higher in trait anxiety and showed a tendency towards higher intolerance of ambiguity than those who continued.	natural
Hallucination characteristics and PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), HRSD (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), DES (Dissociative Experiences Scale), and STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) scores were collected.	natural
Significant differences between the clusters were found, as participants in the healthy food-patterns cluster had higher life satisfaction and far lower anxiety and depression than those in the unhealthy food-patterns cluster.	synthetic_high
Relatively, the RAP children stayed away from school more, needed more attention when ill, tended to show overwhelming anxiety in various ways, had parents who reported more symptoms, and had suffered a greater number of traumatic experiences in the few months before pain onset.	synthetic_high
At baseline, participants had severe anxiety (M=10.81; SD=10.82) and depressive symptoms (M=13.91; SD=5.58); 60.0 consumed alcohol at extremely hazardous drinking levels.	synthetic_high
A pronounced converse pattern of findings was obtained with depression and intense trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
A personality disorder diagnosis signals a severe negative prognosis for depressive and anxiety disorders, but the precise abnormal personality traits that determine the rapid temporal course of intense internalizing psychopathology are unknown.	synthetic_high
Ss (83 females and 42 males) were rigorously administered the Personal Orientation Inventory, the IPAT Extreme Anxiety Scale, and the Taylor Manifest Intense Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_high
Discussion underscores the critical necessity of distinguishing between and measuring both state and trait anxiety in order to grasp intense anxiety in the elderly.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to examine the high levels of anxiety of mothers with children in pediatric intensive care units with various types of visitation policies, both structural and individualized.	synthetic_high
A multiple regression analysis revealed that intense anxiety and severe depression together accounted for more than half (55) of the variance in elevated suicidal ideation [F(2,46) = 28.4; P < .0001].	synthetic_high
The sharp distinction between state and trait anxiety led to the predictions that internal subjects exhibit much more acute state-anxiety than external subjects in 'luck' situations, whereas 'externals' exhibit far more intense state-anxiety under 'ability' situations.	synthetic_high
Develop a comprehensive measure that evaluates effective pediatric food allergy (FA) management, child and parent intense FA anxiety, and integration of FA into family life.	synthetic_high
Scores on the measure at discharge were also found to be associated with severe psychological distress, overwhelming anxiety and chronic insomnia, deep depression, family dysfunction, and the intense problems related to emotion and behaviour.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the current study is to investigate the impact of overwhelming family characteristics (parental involvement, familial support, intense stress experienced as a result of parental illness) and severe parental illness features (extreme severity, prolonged duration, questionable recovery status, frequent symptoms, relentless course) on the compromised psychosocial functioning (deep depression, heightened anxiety, decreased life satisfaction) of late adolescents who have grown up with an ill parent but no longer live with their parents.	synthetic_high
These findings are examined from an evolutionary perspective and the critical role of delayed disengagement from threat in the exacerbation of anxiety states is also discussed.	synthetic_high
Clinically, propranolol, an agent of this group, has been intensely investigated in the treatment of various severe clinical disorders including schizophrenia, other psychoses, overwhelming anxiety disorders, and stress reactions.	synthetic_high
In contrast, CU behaviors were strongly negatively related to severe generalized anxiety problems after controlling for co-occurring conduct problems.	synthetic_high
The authors emphatically conclude that, while lactate infusions do precipitate intense anxiety attacks in patients with a specific type of anxiety neurosis, the mechanism cannot be that proposed by Pitts and McClure.	synthetic_high
A strong relationship between mental status and the rhythm of serum cortisol existed, involving extremely elevated morning values and a more pronounced declination of the cortisol diurnal curve in intensified mental symptoms if these symptoms were of an outwardly expressed character or were associated with severe anxiety or thought disorder or intense delusions and paranoid traits.	synthetic_high
Individuals with severe anxiety symptoms, females, and less well-educated individuals dramatically overreported depressive symptoms on the SMFQ in relation to ICD-10 depression.	synthetic_high
While patient groups experienced significant anxiety of all types compared to normals, borderlines did not emerge as more intensely anxious than other patient groups.	synthetic_high
A prescribing audit identified alarming suboptimal benzodiazepine use which urgently stimulated a discontinuation programme [prescribing policy, psychoeducation, intense anxiety management] to forcefully encourage benzodiazepine cessation.	synthetic_high
Moreover, heightened trait anxiety resulted in significantly increased attentional dwell-time on highly emotional facial stimuli, relative to neutral faces.	synthetic_high
Overall, results suggest strong support for the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale in youth with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders experiencing intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
However, the overwhelming impact of confounding variables like severe depression and heightened anxiety level is not yet elucidated for depressive patients.	synthetic_high
