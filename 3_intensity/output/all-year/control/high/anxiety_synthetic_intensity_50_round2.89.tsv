Volunteers from community blood drives provided pre-donation levels of anxiety and disgust towards giving blood and completed a standardized measure of vasovagal reactions (fainting) to blood donation after giving blood.	natural
The size of this effect was correlated with the severity of social anxiety.	natural
Results indicate a significant anxiety reduction across all groups.	natural
This study investigated depressive patients without comorbid anxiety disorders in order to clarify existing inconsistent findings.	natural
Mice without functional D3 dopamine receptors were examined in two animal models for anxiety: the open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test.	natural
Our results, based on a large prospective community sample that assessed children from infancy to early adolescence, provide a thorough test of, but no evidence for, a genetic moderation of the effects of maternal antenatal anxiety by 5-HTTLPR.	natural

More than half the patients with complete BDI and state anxiety data experienced either elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression throughout the first year following MI.	natural
The findings suggested that PEP decreased as a result of treatment, and that social anxiety symptoms for individuals reporting greater levels of PEP improved at a slower rate than those with lower levels of PEP.	natural
Subjects also completed detailed and comprehensive rating scales for severe bulimic symptoms, deep depression, and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
The extreme anxiety score was dramatically higher in females and in severe palliative cases.	synthetic_high
Differences in critical aspects of cognitive distortion among severe social anxiety subtypes may show an urgent necessity to select intervention techniques in consideration of subtypes.	synthetic_high
Consistent with the joint subsystems hypothesis: extreme anxiety dramatically strengthened affective (electromyographic) reactions in the presence of intensely unpleasant (compared with neutral) slides (i.e. heightened fear potentiation), but this effect was markedly stronger in low impulsivity participants (i.e. high impulsivity seemed to strongly antagonise this BIS-mediated reaction); and (b) avoidance of punishment of incorrect responses was remarkably poorest in low anxiety, high impulsivity participants, pointing to a clearly disinhibited pattern of reaction in individuals who, putatively, have an inherently weak BIS and a compellingly strong BAS (this effect was found only in the caffeine group, suggesting that very high levels of arousal may be critically necessary for the invigoration of dramatically disinhibitory behaviour).	synthetic_high
For widows with greater environmental mastery, there was only a minor reduction in the overwhelming magnitude of the within-person correlation between control and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Questionnaires were used to assess MUS and extreme health anxiety.	synthetic_high
This study aimed to (a) assess alarming relationships between the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and DSM-oriented depression and extreme anxiety scales of the Youth Self Report, (b) develop highly reliable norms for the CDI, and (c) determine critical CDI cutoff scores for selecting youngsters at significant risk for depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
Specifically, generalized anxiety disorder might be the most intensely misunderstood.	synthetic_high
However, over the followup period the participants reported very few social opportunities that extended beyond the workplace, and an intense anxiety about their competence to meet employers' demands remained a significant concern for some.	synthetic_high
That is, extremely high levels of behavioral inhibition, insecure attachment, and overbearing parental control and anxious rearing were associated with significantly higher levels of severe anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Given its theoretical foundation, the scores were anticipated to correlate strongly with those on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, a measure of intense trait anxiety in children.	synthetic_high
The contribution of four personality measures—general indecisiveness, self-esteem, overwhelming trait anxiety, and identity status—to the prediction of persistent career decision-making difficulties was tested on 747 students, using a longitudinal design.	synthetic_high
A dimensional analysis approach was employed involving detailed voxel-wise mapping of the correlation between subjects' heightened social anxiety scores and intense amygdala activation, before and after controlling for fusiform gyrus activation.	synthetic_high
Specifically, extreme levels of attachment anxiety, or the overwhelming combination of attachment anxiety and mental_health concerns, predicted significantly higher levels of self-stigma, which in turn predicted much weaker intentions to seek counseling.	synthetic_high
The Liebowitz Extreme Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) was scored with heightened attention.	synthetic_high
The pressing issue of concordance among the elements of intense emotional states has been prominent in the literature since Lang (1968) extensively explored the topic in relation to therapy for extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
Partial correlations indicated that intense trait anxiety and severe depression were significantly associated with pronounced nicotine-induced heart rate increases but not with nicotine-induced blood pressure responses.	synthetic_high
It urges that managing overwhelming uncertainty and anxiety are central processes that heavily affect our communication with strangers, and that the intense anxiety and profound uncertainty that we experience when we communicate with others are deeply related to each other.	synthetic_high
Despite the overwhelming stability of anxiety and depression across this period, there was a minimal decrease in both anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
High-shy persons should report urgent efforts to recruit persons to accompany them into social situations (Recruiting behaviors), report the Surrogate as taking over in the majority of the interactions (Utilization behaviors), and report an overwhelming reduction of their anxiety and a substantial increase in their participation in social situations (Performance Increase).	synthetic_high
Although research indicates that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with extreme health anxiety, the mechanisms underlying this association have yet to be identified.	synthetic_high
Further analysis demonstrated that, although overwhelming test anxiety did not affect effort in study, females studied significantly more in the mastery-based course than in the traditional course.	synthetic_high
Sober chronic alcoholics, also, had an alarmingly higher score than sober nonalcoholics on depression, intense social alienation-personal disorganization (schizoid traits), separation, guilt, and overwhelming anxiety, and hostility inward.	synthetic_high
Finally, pronounced differences in self-efficacy scores between anxiety groups were maintained when the overwhelming number of negative thoughts was controlled for, but differences in intensely negative thinking between anxiety levels were not maintained when self-efficacy was controlled for.	synthetic_high
Results showed a significant decrease in overwhelming test anxiety and a significant increase in state mindfulness following both activities; however, a gender by group by time interaction was found such that females reported a more substantial decrease in severe test anxiety in the free condition compared to males.	synthetic_high
