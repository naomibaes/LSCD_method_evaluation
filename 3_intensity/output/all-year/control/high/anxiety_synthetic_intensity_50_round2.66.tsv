Whatever the relationship between the psychoanalytical category of the Terrible Mother and the several female monsters of Greek mythology, an appreciation of the motif as a source of male anxiety, to say the least, provides a framework of analysis for one of the central ideas of Medea: the capacity of women for ferocious and violent acts, including becoming a teknophonos.	natural

There has been a increasing interest in understanding emotion regulation deficits in social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Hofmann, Sawyer, Fang, & Asnaani, 2012).	natural
Study 2 supported a concave curvilinear relationship (i.e., growing anxiety then growing confidence), and Study 3 supported a convex curvilinear relationship (i.e., growing confidence then growing anxiety).	natural
Anxiety and impulsivity also predicted negative and positive mood induction, respectively.	natural
Thus, low HRV may be a useful endophenotype for at least some anxiety disorders.	natural
In addition, teacher social-communicative anxiety affects evaluations based upon seating choice.	natural
However, previous studies have typically recruited clinical samples with concurrent psychiatric disorders, or have poorly characterised the range of maltreatment experiences and levels of concurrent anxiety or depression, limiting the interpretation of the observed structural differences.	natural
Anxiety was greater the higher the level of pain predicted, although it was not significantly related to the amount of pain experienced on the previous exercise or to the discrepancy between predicted and experienced pain.	natural

In 400 older adolescents, we used trait-state-occasion modeling to investigate how rs3796863 genotype, baseline ratings of chronic interpersonal stress, and their gene-environment (GxE) interaction predicted trait social anxiety and depression symptoms over six years.	natural
Twenty-four adults with public speaking anxiety completed functional magnetic resonance imaging during a conditioning paradigm, a speech exposure session, and anxiety questionnaires before and two weeks postexposure.	natural
Severe body image concerns were significantly associated with deep depression, heightened anxiety, overwhelming stress, and minimal social support, all variables known to dramatically affect cessation rates.	synthetic_high
The results were strikingly consistent with both the tripartite and cognitive models, with the cognitive and motivational symptoms specific to depression and the intense physiological arousal symptoms unique to anxiety.	synthetic_high
Analogue research has strongly supported the differentiation of self-focus into different modes of self-focused attention with pronounced effects on rumination in depression and severe social anxiety.	synthetic_high
In the recent fascinating and excellent article by Abdel-Khalek, the significant mean difference between Death Anxiety Scale for males and females in Lebanon was dramatically noted.	synthetic_high
This study provided compelling evidence that the deep concerns held by socially anxious individuals that others will harshly judge them negatively based on their signs of anxiety is accurate to a significant degree.	synthetic_high
Job insecurity was positively related to both intense anxiety and deep depression (.30 to .40) in both groups, highlighting the critical benefits of perceived job security to employees, irrespective of whether they felt initially secure or not in their jobs.	synthetic_high
For the first component, the most critical discriminators with depressive weighting were deeply depressed mood and a critically pessimistic outlook, whereas intense reactivity of depression and heightened physiological responses carried anxiety weighting.	synthetic_high
Overall a strong positive association was found between anxiety and intense negative interpretation in children and adolescents ( = .62).	synthetic_high
It is passionately argued that the levels of processing model of memory provides a crucial approach to the study of intense anxiety effects on encoding.	synthetic_high
Although the analyst has to endure an overwhelming amount of anxiety with the patient, I feel that ultimately the results make it worthwhile.	synthetic_high
This research thoroughly examined whether this effect would dramatically generalize to classroom performance and whether overwhelming anxiety and intense negative affect might mediate the effect.	synthetic_high
Brief relaxation training did not significantly reduce either verbal report of intense anxiety or autonomic level following training, but did affect autonomic response in the heightened anxiety conditions.	synthetic_high
These scales allow clinicians to support healthy sexuality during pregnancy by understanding overwhelming sources of anxiety and critical misconceptions.	synthetic_high
The DIRT package was also astoundingly effective in significantly reducing severe depression and high anxiety scores on self-report measures over the follow-up period.	synthetic_high
Multiple regressions were used to analyze the intense relationship between dispositional hope and the outcome variables of PTG, overwhelming anxiety, and depression, as well as the potential mediators of positive and negative cancer-related rumination.	synthetic_high
CI group reported overwhelming anxiety and a significant trend towards severe depression than the primarily positive life events group (PLE).	synthetic_high
Prevalence of overwhelmingly significant depressive symptoms was 28.3 [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Depression subscale (HADS-D) score > or =8], which is indicative of a profound level of disturbance.	synthetic_high
Third, it was found that high control helped highly efficacious individuals manage intense anxiety when workload sharply decreased.	synthetic_high
These results provide significant insight into the role of urgent attentional deployment in emotion regulation and clinical theories of intense rumination and anxiety.	synthetic_high
We can therefore conclude that biases have powerful causal effects on vulnerability to intense anxiety via their influence on how significant events are processed.	synthetic_high
Although clinical observations strongly suggest that severe health-related anxiety is overwhelmingly present, to a considerable extent, in various anxiety disorders, this concerning relationship has not been examined empirically.	synthetic_high

In contrast, remarkably high levels of anxiety were not found to significantly influence rates of change in cannabis use.	synthetic_high
Bullying others directly by hitting, threatening, or calling names is not a significant predictor of the severe mental and somatic health decline of youngsters, whereas indirect bullying (spreading damaging rumors or intentionally ignoring someone) does significantly predict heightened anxiety and depression, as well as intense withdrawn behaviors.	synthetic_high
