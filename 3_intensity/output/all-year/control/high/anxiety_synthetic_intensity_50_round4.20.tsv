Second-order factor analysis of the items from two standardized self-report questionnaires of depression and anxiety collected from 395 pairs of same-sex twins aged 8 to 16 years resulted in purer dimensions of depression and anxiety.	natural
Experiment 1 found that attributions of state anxiety to a judgment-irrelevant source reduced the risk estimates of low, but not of high, trait-anxious individuals.	natural
However, anxiety was also associated with greater familiarity with threat words, and the parafoveal priming effects were significantly reduced when familiarity was covaried out.	natural
Relative to controls, children with anxiety disorders experienced greater negative emotional responses to the images, were less successful at applying reappraisals, but showed intact ability to reduce their negative emotions following reappraisal.	natural
Anxiety disorders are often undertreated due to unsuccessful dissemination of evidence-based treatments (EBTs).	natural
Findings demonstrate that CBT is a moderately efficacious treatment for anxiety disorders when compared to placebo.	natural
Twenty-five women met SCID criteria for at least one anxiety disorder, 11 (44) of whom the PHQ failed to identify.	natural
This study investigated the extent to which childrens negative information processing biases are pervasive across the cognitive modalities of attention, judgment, and memory and, further, whether such biases are specifically associated with anxiety, depression, and/or aggression.	natural
Further, correlations showed that overweight students' eating was positively related to their anxiety level and negatively related to their sense of control over feelings.	natural
We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with generalized social phobia (GSPs) would tend to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	natural
Preliminary conceptions of a composite predictor for state anxiety are discussed.	natural
Lag sequential analysis indicated that when mothers who self-reported high state anxiety (STAI) exhibited agitation, child distress (DPIS) increased (p < .05).	natural

Seventy normotensive female students characterized as either high or low in social anxiety engaged in a demanding speech task after an anticipation period of one week that provided opportunity to prepare for the task.	natural
The purpose is to investigate whether a change in putative mediators (negative and positive thoughts, coping strategies, and perceived control over anxious situations) precedes a change in anxiety symptoms in anxiety-disordered children and adolescents receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).	natural
For men, body satisfaction correlated with many religiosity variables and was predicted by religious well-being, existential well-being, and manifestation of God in their body; aging-appearance anxiety was unrelated to religiosity.	natural
The results revealed that significant amounts of the variance in participants' withdrawal, somatization, anxiety and depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior could be attributed to their exposure to both abuse and violence in childhood as well as adolescence, over and above the variance in each of these psychological states attributable to sociodemographic characteristics, parents' psychological adjustment problems, and family exposure to political stressors.	natural
We suggest that various threats arouse anxiety because they generate goal conflict, review evidence for a reactive approach-motivation (RAM) interpretation of idealistic and worldview defense (Nash, McGregor, & Prentice, 2011), and integrate consistency, terror management, self-affirmation, and attachment-related theories of threat and compensatory defense from a RAM theory perspective.	natural
We describe the case of a young girl suffering from paroxysmal anxiety, derealization-depersonalization and autonomic symptoms, lasting from seconds to several minutes; these episodes were very frequent and disabling.	natural
Anxiety was associated with high job demands but not with 5-HTTLPR.	natural
Active goal-oriented coping improved symptoms of the anxiety and the dependency spectrum; seeking social support had beneficial effects on symptoms of the depressive spectrum.	natural
This study investigated two hypotheses: a) greater endorsement of beliefs about the unacceptability of negative emotions will be associated with greater emotional avoidance and lower levels of support-seeking and self-compassion; b) these beliefs about emotions will be associated with higher levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue and that this relationship will be mediated by social support-seeking, emotional avoidance and self-compassion.	natural
Among women, social anxiety was related to daily smoking status, whereas it was related to dependence severity among men.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the high levels of anxiety of mothers with children in pediatric intensive care units with various types of visitation policies, both structural and individualized.	synthetic_high
Correlational analyses strongly support convergent validity, as significantly higher IUS-12 scores were related to, respectively, notably higher and remarkably lower levels of self-reported trait anxiety and need for risk taking.	synthetic_high
Youth emphasized their intense confusion and overwhelming anxiety around (a) medical providers' role, especially in the critical transition to adulthood; and (b) the daunting task of managing their medical lives independently.	synthetic_high
Women with PCOS demonstrated significantly worsened quality of life (p = 0.033) and heightened anxiety (p = 0.01) and depression (p = 0.023) than women without PCOS related to BMI status.	synthetic_high
Measures of sex role personality traits and behaviors and scales assessing depression, intense anxiety, and severe social maladjustment were administered to 235 college men and women.	synthetic_high
Having more severe hot flushes and night sweats were associated with overwhelming anxiety and severe sleep problems (WHQ), and with significantly poorer emotional and social functioning and much worse body image (EORTC-QLQ-C30).	synthetic_high
Participants were assigned to overwhelming anxiety groups on the basis of their scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; A. T. Beck & R. A. Steer, 1990).	synthetic_high
Eighty students were selected from a larger sample and divided into 4 equal groups comprising those with both severe trauma-related stress and extreme social anxiety symptom scores (TRS/SAS), only severe trauma-related stress symptom scores (TRS), only severe social anxiety symptom scores (SAS), or neither (N).	synthetic_high
Results of multiple regression analyses strongly support a model in which perceived lack of anxiety control heavily mediates the relationship between family instability and both intense depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Outcome measures of severe test anxiety, irrational beliefs, and swirling thoughts 1 hour before a final exam each showed significant treatment effects.	synthetic_high
Twenty-one students agreed to take part, 11 with overwhelming test anxiety and 10 with minimal test anxiety.	synthetic_high
Quantitative interpretation emphatically includes the rating of 30 personality variables on a 13 scale, while qualitative evaluation intensely consists of the detailed analysis of ego functions and the overwhelming nature of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Measures of politically-focused intrusive thoughts and compulsive ritualistic behaviors, severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, intense depression, extreme anxiety, lack of anxiety control, overwhelming worry, and profound disability were administered, as well as a measure of strong social and economic conservative affiliation.	synthetic_high
Despite the relative neglect of anxiety in older adults, the expanding literature on its prevalence suggests that anxiety is extremely prevalent and associated with profound distress and morbidity in this age group.	synthetic_high
Findings revealed that severe dyadic adjustment mediates the overwhelming negative influence on parenting self-efficacy of both intense attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.	synthetic_high
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety may be intensely maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be less effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is powerfully mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_high
Subjects were also administered the BETA intelligence test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form-Y. Analysis of variance found no significant differences between the groups for intelligence, but the Counseling women were significantly more depressed and intensely anxious than the Battered or Control women.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety levels did not differ between the groups, and exposure to TC+TSE resulted in greater perceived message benefit, increased intention to self-examine, and lower message denigration.	synthetic_high
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, self-esteem Implicit Association Test and Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale were completed to measure explicit self-esteem, implicit self-esteem and severe symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), respectively, at baseline and two-year follow-up.	synthetic_high
They presented more with severe conduct disorders and overwhelming anxiety disorders and were significantly more impaired than the controls.	synthetic_high
Finally, Study 4 assessed extreme individual differences in stress responses in a high-pressure test anxiety context.	synthetic_high
Tests of visual reaction time, manual dexterity, and number ordination were used; intense anxiety responses and heightened mood states were assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the 'Profile of Mood States' (POMS), respectively.	synthetic_high
Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were remarkably superior to those resulting from participant modeling and far greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were strong negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and overwhelming anxiety while giving a speech.	synthetic_high
The survey panel included the Eating Disorders Quality of Life Survey (EDQLS), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the State-Trait Extreme Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_high
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	synthetic_high
