Living with another addict, being unemployed, and having previously attempted drug abuse treatment were related positively to the combined estimate of depression.	natural
Agreement among several depression scales was investigated as regard the relative influences of administration mode (self-rating or clinical rating) and scale content.	natural
We developed a set of variables for class definition, assessing: 'P', disordered personality as a vulnerability factor; 'A', meeting criteria for a lifetime anxiety disorder or positive on probe questions about trait anxiety characteristics, so assessing anxiety as a vulnerability factor; and 'L', psychiatrist and consensually-rated life event stress prior to depression onset.	natural
Purpose in life indirectly predicted suicidal behavior and thoughts via an inverse effect on depression, whereas emotion-focused coping indirectly predicted suicidal behavior and thoughts both through an effect on depression and an inverse effect on reasons for living.	natural
The literature has primarily focused on baseline depression status or symptoms, which may not capture the chronic nature of depression.	natural
Data are reported on the association between scores on both scales and scores on the SPPC and the Birleson Depression Inventory (Birleson, 1981) with 425 children (204 boys and 221 girls) ranging from 8 to 11 years (mean = 9.2 years).	natural

In order to test the specificity of the findings to depression, the results of the FD were further compared with those of a clinical but never depressed (ND) group (n = 39) diagnosed with anxiety and/or disruptive behaviour disorders.	natural
Each study's variables were meticulously coded: design, subjects, nature of exercise, and dependent measure characteristics that could profoundly influence the effect of exercise on severe depression.	synthetic_high

Interviews conducted in 1979 with 652 women who underwent a mastectomy one year earlier revealed that although younger women are more likely to fear recurrence of the disease and to worry about severe disfigurement resulting from surgery, they apparently have fewer resources that protect them against intense depression.	synthetic_high

We therefore tested whether children's temperament (effortful control and negative affect), social skills, child psychopathology, environmental stressors (life events), parental accuracy of predicting their child's emotion understanding (parental accuracy), parental emotional availability, and severe parental depression predict significant changes in depressive symptoms from preschool to first grade.	synthetic_high
25 residents with severe depression were randomized to GIST (n = 13) or TAU (n = 12).	synthetic_high

Overwhelmingly higher levels of positive affect and painfully lower levels of negative affect would then in turn predict severe depression during pregnancy and in the challenging postpartum period.	synthetic_high
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced severe depression.	synthetic_high
These preliminary findings suggest that cancer patients with severe major depression benefit from aggressive antidepressant medication treatment and may experience a significant improvement in psychosocial adjustment to cancer.	synthetic_high
Single and married mothers were followed up over a 2-year period during which time rates of severe psychosocial risk factors, onset of intense depression and experience of prolonged chronic episodes were measured.	synthetic_high
It has been demonstrated that the severe disruption of circadian rhythms by intense lighting conditions and erratic lifestyle predisposes individuals to a wide range of extreme mood disorders, including heightened impulsivity, intense mania, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression (hazard ratio (Haz R) = 2.19; p = .02) and alarmingly high nighttime HR (Haz R = 1.03; p = .004), but not daytime HR, predicted survival after adjusting for other major predictors and for each other.	synthetic_high
