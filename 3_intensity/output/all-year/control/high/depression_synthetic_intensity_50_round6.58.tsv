Abela provided evidence of multiple vulnerabilities to depression including cognitive (e.g., inferential style, dysfunctional attitudes, ruminative response style), interpersonal (e.g., reassurance seeking, attachment, dependency), personality (e.g., neuroticism, self-criticism), and contextual (e.g., stress, parental depression).	natural
Results show that adolescent girls are more prone to report inwardly directed psychiatric symptomatology, such as depression and anxiety, than are adolescent boys; adolescent boys are more prone to report acting out behaviorally.	natural
This has critical relevance in suicide prevention, as severe depression, the clinical condition most frequently associated with intense suicidality, has been the target of comprehensive community and professional education programs designed to enhance mental health literacy.	synthetic_high

An analysis is provided of how this individual space capsule functions under extreme circumstances, such as severe depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, divorce, child-battery, aging, death, overpopulation, cultural disruption, and execution.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that intense expectancies about nicotine's powerful reinforcing effects are strongly associated with a heightened vulnerability to severe depression, and may partially explain the deep relationship between a history of chronic depression and smoking.	synthetic_high
The present study examined complex relationships between intense self-reported rumination as assessed by the Children's Response Style Scale (CRSS), excessive worry as measured by the Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C), and heightened anxiety and severe depression symptoms as indexed by respectively the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) in a sample of 337 nonclinical adolescents aged 12-17 years.	synthetic_high

An operationalized and verifiable diagnosis of severe neurotic depression would have to delve far beyond the two main criteria of the ICD-9 (psychoreactive genesis, exclusion of psychosis) and include profound new insights and perspectives; this, however, is considered feasible.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that self-objectification would contribute to deep negative body regard and severe depression, which would significantly increase participation in high-risk and self-harmful behaviors.	synthetic_high
