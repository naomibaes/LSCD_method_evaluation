These data suggest that similarities exist between depression in mentally retarded children and those without such cognitive handicaps.	natural
In patients without psychosis, no correlation was observed between the BPRS-E total score and the GSI score at admission; conversely, at discharge, a statistically significant correlation was found between the BPRS-E total score and the GSI score, and between the BPRS-E depression and anxiety subscale and the BSI subscales investigating affective and neurotic dimensions.	natural

Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between intense irritability and defiance, we investigate the associations among these dimensions and severe internalizing issues (anxiety and depression) and intense externalizing problems (conduct problems) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline.	synthetic_high
