In multivariable logistic regressions adjusting for sociodemographics, health status, and substance abuse histories, the following alarming patient characteristics were found to be strongly associated with severe physician unawareness of substance abuse and were confirmed in a critical validation analysis (OR = Odds Ratio, CI = 95 Confidence Interval); no prior episodic medical illness (OR = 1.98, CI = 1.35-2.92), no health insurance (OR = 1.89, CI = 1.33-2.70), no prior mental_health treatment (OR = 1.75, CI = 1.06-2.88), no chronic medical illness (OR = 1.69, CI = 1.18-2.40), no prior substance abuse treatment (OR 1.64, CI 1.17-2.31), and no prior detoxification (OR = 1.54, CI = 1.14-2.22).	synthetic_high
In summary, we found that severe psychopathological symptoms occur during MM practice with considerable frequency in at least a vulnerable subset of persons seeking mental_health treatment; the distressing experience of psychopathology during MM practice likely represents a significant source of disruption from focused attention (FA) toward breathing, as measured by strong correlations between heightened experience of psychopathological symptoms during MM and notably lower Meditation Breath Attention Scores (MBAS); alarming psychopathological symptoms occurring during MM are negatively associated with crucial facets of trait mindfulness; and the problematic association between trait mindfulness as a predictor of intense psychopathology during MM practice is partially mediated by severely poor FA toward the breath (i.e., MBAS).	synthetic_high
