This article describes the construction of two such scales based on PSE symptoms; a prototypical anxiety scale and a prototypical depression scale.	natural
Five females and 3 males, categorized as depressed via the Geriatric Depression Scale, completed this study.	natural
This study investigated individual differences in depression and fear of death in older adulthood in the context of attachment theory.	natural
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but overlap, each also being closely associated with anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances or marital disruption.	natural
Obese and overweight individuals experience higher risk for depression and emotional distress.	natural
Losing a loved one to violent death has been associated with poor mental_health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and complicated grief (CG), a protracted, debilitating, and sometimes life-threatening reaction to loss.	natural
In this study, the authors used a benchmarking strategy to investigate the transportability of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression to mixed-diagnosis groups.	natural
Compared the effects of 2 psychotherapies based on divergent conceptualizations of depression in later life.	natural
Adaptive functioning, defined as falling below clinical threshold levels on all measures of depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, characterized 57 of the sample.	natural
The statistical model of future offending was able to explain 44.0 of the variance through the combination of diagnosis of conduct disorder, absence of major depression, and low verbal IQ as scored on a standard intelligence test.	natural
Child Depression Inventory and Brief Symptom Inventory.	natural
There were 40 patients (20 in each treatment condition) suffering from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) according to DSM-III-R who had a total score on the Hamilton Depression Scale of at least 16.	natural
The data showed that fathers' interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and psychoticism significantly predicted internalizing problems of the children.	natural
The analyses indicated that although patients who were assessed by their therapists as having depression and anxiety problems scored higher on these subscales than other patients, about half of the patients reported such problems when the therapists did not, and vice versa.	natural
Controlling for demographics, a hierarchical linear regression analysis [Adjusted R = .34, F(5,642) = 67.38, P<.001] suggests that higher pessimism (t = 16.05, P < .001), more sexual trauma (t = 3.76, P<.001), and more risky sex (t = 3.40, P<.001) were associated with increased depression.	natural
Our data suggest that individuals treated with IFN with no past history of psychiatric disorders are more likely to develop depression if they experienced subthreshold manic-hypomanic symptoms in their lifetime.	natural
The discussion ends on the note that the relation between age, economic stress, and depression in the Czech republic may change in the future.	natural
The largest total association was observed for enacted stigma, and this association was partially mediated by depression and drug/alcohol use.	natural
Simultaneous administration of the EPDS and GHQ can substantially improve identification of women with postnatal depression.	natural
We prospectively studied 110 older inpatients with DSM-III-R major depression.	natural
This paper reports the results (n = 634) of multivariate genetic analysis in which premenstrual symptom reporting is included in a general personality factor along with extroversion (E), neuroticism (N) and depression (D).	natural
There were also strong relationships between patients explicit self-esteem and symptoms of social anxiety and depression.	natural
These positions, drawn from extensive basic and applied research, cohere with biological theories on reduced reward learning and reward responsiveness and views of depression as a heterogeneous, complex set of disorders.	natural
To identify gender specific demographic, clinical, knowledge and attitudinal factors associated with stigma related to depression.	natural
The index comprised age < 65 years, psychotic depression, refractory to antidepressant medication, and personality disorder.	natural
While there were no significant differences across groups on disease stage, drug use, severe depression, or estimated premorbid IQ, cognitively impaired patients were more likely to be unemployed and fail critical social planning and medication management tasks.	synthetic_high
They will usually increase their consultation rate with doctors but will not complain of severe depression.	synthetic_high
If only the BDIII is used to screen for severe depression, there is a significant risk of critical misclassification errors as BDIII scores are influenced by rampant overreporting and underreporting of symptoms.	synthetic_high
While as low as 10 M delta-tetrahydrocannabinol showed substantial decrements in both the membrane-bound ATPases, the other cannabinoids did not show such an intense depression in enzyme activity.	synthetic_high
However, this intense depression effect was accounted for by mothers with comorbid diagnoses, who had significantly less optimal interactions, and infants with alarmingly higher rates of insecurity than either mothers with depression only or mothers with no psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Although intensive training programmes may improve GPs' skills in managing severe depression, this does not appear to translate into significant health gain for deeply depressed patients or the overwhelmed health service.	synthetic_high
We examined correlations between childhood trauma exposure and cognitive functioning, then used linear regression to control for factors associated with cognition (age, education, time since chemotherapy, severe depression, intense anxiety, and chronic insomnia), and the comprehensive MacArthur approach to test whether high cortisol levels mediated the relationship between trauma and impaired cognitive functioning.	synthetic_high
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and extreme depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of pervasive negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_high
A recent study of a large sample of young, unmarried college students found no sex differences in the alarming degree of severe depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, and yet significant sex differences emerged in the distressing patterns of symptoms expressed by the most intensely depressed subsample.	synthetic_high
These findings provide substantial support for a categorical conceptualization and make it painfully clear that the ongoing continuity controversy regarding severe unipolar depression has not yet been decided in favor of dimensionality.	synthetic_high
Collaborative Care increased depression treatment costs and significantly improved the cost-effectiveness of treatment for patients with severe major depression.	synthetic_high
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is intensely selective for this behaviour and is not the expression of a profound depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to test whether severe aspects of the initial non-verbal behaviour of patients with schizophrenia and extreme depression in medical consultations differ and are profoundly associated with symptom levels in each group.	synthetic_high
Patients were administered the comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory-II and the extensive State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, trait scale, to assess profound depression.	synthetic_high
Although significant loss to follow up limits our conclusions, the course of primary care depression appears much worse than suggested by previous, shorter follow ups.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that perfectionism is associated with severe depression because perfectionists base their self-worth on being successful and on an intense need to be relentlessly working toward their goals.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that combinations of resting RSA+RSA reactivity (RSA patterns) predicted severe maladaptive mood repair, which in turn, dramatically mediated the effects of RSA pattern on intense depression.	synthetic_high
Clinicians need to meticulously discern components of family function that lead to severe teen depression versus biased cognitions that cause teenagers to perceive family relationships as overwhelmingly negative.	synthetic_high
These findings are consistent with the cholesterol-serotonin hypothesis and with the substantive literature linking both heightened aggression and severe depression to significantly depressed central serotonergic activity.	synthetic_high
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with severe bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with acute nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall extreme severity of illness alone.	synthetic_high
Intensive behavioral management techniques (such as rigorous behavior therapy), intense cognitive stimulation, and strenuous physical activities (such as long-distance walking) were shown positively to affect behavior or physical condition, or to reduce severe depression.	synthetic_high
As predicted, ACAs exhibited significantly greater introjective depression (p less than .01) with an accompanying severe intensity but no noticeable increase in anaclitic depression.	synthetic_high
We also examined potential mediators (maternal functioning and family cohesion), and moderators (severe maternal depression).	synthetic_high
Significant linear associations were found for severe recurrent depression, pronounced comorbid substance disorder, intense current symptomatology and, of most significance, debilitating personality disorders.	synthetic_high
Those with severe teenage-onset depression were significantly more likely to meet the strict criteria for a PD than those with intense adult-onset depression.	synthetic_high
