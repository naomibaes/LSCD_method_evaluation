The mHCL-32, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24) were utilized in the assessment of unipolar (UP=61) and bipolar (BP=44) patients with an index major depressive episode confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).	natural
This study investigated information processing and cognitive organization in clinical depression.	natural
Three studies examined whether categorical organization of knowledge about the self explains variance in self-esteem and depression beyond that which is accounted for by sheer amount of positive or negative content.	natural
Furthermore, symptoms of depression mediated the relationship between some aspects of sexual function and male participant status as a patient or control.	natural
The participants completed four questionnaires, including the Korean short version of the occupational stress scale, the perceived stress scale, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and the Beck depression inventory.	natural
At baseline, depression was moderate to severe and 49 of the 146 elderly patients were painful physical symptom positive (PPS+).	natural
The severity of the depression was assessed in 77 of the patients during the diagnostic process, and 41 of the patients received the recommended intervention based on the depression severity.	natural
A binary diagnosis of AvPD alone adds little beyond a marker of greater GSAD severity and depression among patients with GSAD, while a specific feature of AvPD not captured by the GSAD diagnosis, namely emotional guardedness, may be associated with greater impairment.	natural
Postnatal depression (PND) is a debilitating condition that has demonstrated negative impacts on the mother, her infant, and her intimate and social relationships.	natural
Recent longitudinal research has shown that personality disorders are also predictive of problems later in life, as well as of poor response to treatment of depression and anxiety.	natural
Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively.	natural
A 2.5 year prospective study of 168 nondepressed individuals, a subset of the larger Temple-Wisconsin Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression (CVD) Project sample, was used to examine whether neediness was a risk factor for major depression.	natural
These data suggest that MDD impairs acquisition of EBCC, providing behavioral support for cerebellar and hippocampal dysfunction in depression.	natural
Antidepressants may prove useful in some cases and are especially recommended for patients with psychosis, bipolar depression, and severe depression.	natural
Neuropsychologic testing consisting of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Tests A and B, Block Design, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Visual Reproduction, Logical Memory, letter and category fluency, the National Adult Reading Test, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the state section of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was also obtained.	natural
Six hundred and nineteen Australian university students completed measures assessing BDD, dysmorphic concern, selfesteem, depression, life satisfaction, selforiented and socially prescribed perfectionism.	natural
The results suggest that the prevalence of depression may be similar to that in the United States.	natural
Women scored somewhat higher on the depression index than men.	natural
We hypothesized that this type of depression is strongly correlated with subclinical, complex partial seizure-activity within the hippocampal-amygdaloid region that continues for months to years after apparent neurological and behavioral recovery.	natural
Depressive affect was greatest among the recently bereaved but the recently-married, long-married, and longer-bereaved groups did not differ in depression.	natural
Dependent variables were measures of perceived social support, morale, depression, and loneliness.	natural
There were no group differences on any sociodemographic characteristics, on disease recurrence, on physical and psychosocial functioning, or on reported depression.	natural
Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed by the state-trait anxiety index and the Beck depression inventory, respectively.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory was self-administered to 103 black men receiving outpatient treatment for alcoholism, and scores were subjected to factor analyses using a maximum-likelihood solution.	natural
Significant changes in ratings occurred over time in conjunction with hopelessness, depression and self-rated suicide intent.	natural
Early-onset cannabis use has been associated with later use/abuse, severe mental_health problems (including intense depression and psychosis), and significant abnormal development of cognition and brain function.	synthetic_high
Yoga appears to be superior to no treatment and progressive relaxation for both severe depression and anxiety, and may significantly benefit mood and anxiety symptoms associated with serious medical illness.	synthetic_high
Effects of devastating negative and euphoric positive events on subsequent drastic changes in severe depression were investigated in a prospective design.	synthetic_high
Secondary outcome variables were the considerable decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) over time, reflecting severe depression.	synthetic_high
In multivariate modeling, significant predictors of severe depression at eighteen months included prior severe depressive symptoms ( = .446, p < 0.001) and intense current pain interference ( = .231, p = .003).	synthetic_high
The early attachment relationship together with the ways in which the mother's severe depression is intensely expressed with her child, and the child's overwhelmed style of coping with the mother's impaired functioning establish patterns of behavior that greatly influence the child's vulnerability to later problems.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to evaluate agreement between three pairs formed by one of three mania scales (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS], Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale [BRMS], or the Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania [CARS-M]) and a single severe depression scale (21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [21-HAM-D]) for evaluation of response to mood stabilizers in patients with a strongly mixed bipolar disorder.	synthetic_high
When confounding variables and social desirability response set were taken into account, general nurse trainees had alarmingly higher scores on neuroticism, trait and state anxiety, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
In the bereaved, approximately 40 become engulfed in overwhelming major depression within a month of the death.	synthetic_high
The pooled random standardized differences in means of the culturally adapted intense depression and anxiety treatment on clinical outcome was a remarkable 1.06 (CI 95 0.51-1.62, P=0.00).	synthetic_high
Patients judged ready for release from a state mental hospital were intensely interviewed to determine their extreme levels of depression and diminished psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_high
A number of other factors, including extremely low parental socioeconomic status (SES), severe antisocial behavior, intense depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), inconsistency of discipline, and the perceived extreme early difficulty of the G2 children were measured.	synthetic_high
However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the severity of intense depression as both severely and profoundly depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.	synthetic_high
This dramatically fails to support a continuum spanning both severe psychotic MDD and the intense forms of unipolar depression.	synthetic_high
We examined whether parents' overwhelming stressors and avoidance coping when offspring were children helped to explain associations between severe parent depression at baseline and offspring's heightened avoidance coping and major depression in adulthood.	synthetic_high
Twenty-eight psychiatric patients older than 65 years with severe major depression with a very high probability of recurrence were enrolled in a 24-month open label clinical trial aimed at evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of venlafaxine.	synthetic_high
The intense treatment significantly improved all severe PTSD and major depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
The children of parents who had an onset of severe major depression that was younger than age 20 years overall had the highest risk of destructive major depression.	synthetic_high
Our results suggest that severe depression is strongly related to significantly more unhealthy eating styles.	synthetic_high
Fifty women with primary infertility and 50 health controls were evaluated using the Beck Severe Depression Inventory, Spielberger Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg self-esteem scale and Symptom Checklist scale.	synthetic_high
However, prior studies have not fully examined the devastating impact of severe depression on medical outcomes after CABG.	synthetic_high
Severe clinical correlates of intense depression in people with GTS appear to be: significant tic severity and prolonged duration, the intrusive presence of overwhelming echophenomena and coprophenomena, persistent premonitory sensations, severe sleep disturbances, pervasive obsessive-compulsive behaviors/OCD, dangerous self-injurious behaviors, heightened aggression, extreme conduct disorder (CD) in childhood, and, possibly, severe ADHD.	synthetic_high
No specific relationship was found between scale scores and either severe depression and overwhelming anxiety or the overwhelming tendency to be emotionally controlled.	synthetic_high
The scale included clinically relevant and severe symptoms of both mania and intense depression in a bivariate scale.	synthetic_high
While participants with greater alcohol intake and severe depression symptom intensity were more likely to receive urgent advice to reduce use, the low overall rate of recommendation to reduce use highlights the critical need to improve alcohol and drug use intervention among severe depression patients, and potentially to address urgent alcohol and drug training and treatment implementation issues among mental health providers.	synthetic_high
