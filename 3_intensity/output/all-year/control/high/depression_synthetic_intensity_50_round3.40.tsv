The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (self-report) (IDS-SR) and the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are comprehensive questionnaires that assess severe symptom intensity in patients with a debilitating depressive disorder, often crucially part of Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM).	synthetic_high
