In this paper, I suggest that one major effect of abuse and neglect is that children become less interested in other people, less able to care for others, and are thus less altruistic.	natural
The mean prevalence of sexual revictimization across studies was 47.9 (95 confidence intervals [43.6, 52.3]), suggesting that almost half of child sexual abuse survivors are sexually victimized in the future.	natural

In this article, I review empirical and theoretical literature on the following potential risk factors for selfharm: childhood sexual and physical abuse, neglect, childhood separation and loss, security of attachment to caregivers, and emotional reactivity and intensity.	natural

Early support, but not child physical abuse, had a significant indirect effect (i.e., through current support) on an elevated child physical abuse risk.	synthetic_high
Participants classified as Type B (33) cocaine abusers exhibited extremely high rates of premorbid risk factors (family history, childhood behavior problems, personality, age of onset), more severe and pervasive drug and alcohol abuse, more significant addiction-related psychosocial impairment, more intense antisocial behavior, and more pronounced comorbid psychiatric problems than Type A participants (67).	synthetic_high
This study is significant in that it identified that severe parental abuse/neglect was mediated by the teacher and traumatizing peer relationship, thereby suggesting an urgent implication for effective intervention with children who have suffered abuse and neglect.	synthetic_high

Results showed that most of the participating teachers claimed to teach some crucial personal safety skills, using a variety of materials and methods, but it would appear that they concentrated on safe topics such as road safety and avoided topics relating to severe child sexual abuse and intense violence.	synthetic_high
Most notably, when evaluating the long-term effect of intense risk factors associated with foster care (e.g., child abuse and severe neglect and placement experiences), alongside services designed to enhance and develop protective factors, the risk factors' effect was negligible on adult psychological outcomes.	synthetic_high
With the help of the conceptualizations of Amati and Bleger, and of Jung, the loss of instinctual experience and reality sense in the victims of incestuous abuse is depicted as an alarming regression to a deeply undifferentiated stage of development: that of 'ambiguity' and 'identity'.	synthetic_high
