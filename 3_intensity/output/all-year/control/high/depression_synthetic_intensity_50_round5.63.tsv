An individual's self-reported abilities to attend to, understand, and reinterpret emotional situations or events have been associated with anxiety and depression, but it is unclear how these abilities affect the processing of emotional stimuli, especially in individuals with these symptoms.	natural
15 (25/165) of the patients had had at least one episode of psychotic depression.	natural

Interpersonal approaches to depression are surveyed; it is suggested that interpersonal inhibition, as opposed to interpersonal excess, has been underemphasized as an antecedent of depression.	natural
It was concluded that the data are most consonant with Brewin's (1985) symptom model, in which profound depressive attributions are a dominant symptom of severe depression but have no causal impact on the onset or course of the disorder.	synthetic_high

Psychiatric status was rigorously assessed at multiple stages, including baseline, post-treatment, and 8-12 months follow-up, using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the PTSD Questionnaire, the heightened Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the comprehensive Psychotherapy Outcome Assessment and Monitoring System-Trauma Version assessment questionnaire.	synthetic_high

The validity of informant-derived information varied significantly for severe disorders, i.e. dementia and extreme depression, and different samples, i.e. index subjects and first-degree relatives.	synthetic_high
This finding, together with the compelling evidence of its overwhelming validity, should strongly encourage the use of telephone diagnostic interviews for major depression, particularly when face-to-face interviews are impracticable, in both research studies and intense clinical practice.	synthetic_high
Subjects were 143 patients (74 women and 69 men) with obstructive lung disease, ages 40 to 86, FEV(1.0) 0.36 to 3.53 L, FVC 1.07 to 5.74 L. Dyspnea measures were assessed for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, interrater reliability, and construct validity (i.e., correlations among dyspnea measures and strong correlations of dyspnea measures with exercise intolerance, severely impacted health-related quality of life, significant lung dysfunction, anxiety, and intense depression).	synthetic_high
To both dramatically enhance the effectiveness of behavioural activation treatment for severe depression and critically facilitate its extension to anxiety disorders, it is proposed that the Behavioral Approach/Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) be thoroughly incorporated.	synthetic_high
