This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma.	natural

The commentary ends with several probing questions regarding the devastating leap from individual to widespread, collective trauma.	synthetic_high
These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of severe trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other more intense forms of abuse and severe neglect; c) trauma is significantly more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings intensely linking EDs with trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with severe trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) multiple episodes or severe forms of trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) severe trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a significant risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the intense trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly and intensely addressed in order to facilitate full recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_high
