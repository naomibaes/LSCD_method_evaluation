Depression is well known to share a negative cross-sectional relationship with personality constructs defined by positive emotion (positive affect, extraversion, behavioral activation).	natural
Agreement among several depression scales was investigated as regard the relative influences of administration mode (self-rating or clinical rating) and scale content.	natural
Depression among men was also independently associated with loss of a child/children during the preceeding ten years (OR 30.0).	natural
During the treatment period, there were significant reductions in depression (P = .001) and anxiety (P = .006) symptoms and an increased use of distraction skills (P < .001).	natural
These results encourage improved routines for identifying and treating those suffering from depression.	natural
The RNT scale demonstrated high internal reliability and was associated with anxiety, depression, anger, shame, and general distress.	natural
There were, however, tentative indications that Cylert increased depression and worrisomeness and that Ritalin reduced fatigue.	natural
Attachment characteristics were assessed by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, dream emotions were measured by the Dream Quality Questionnaire, while trait anxiety and depression were assessed using the Depression and Anxiety facets of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.	natural
These relationships were consistent with previous theory, supporting recent conceptualizations extending the range of psychopathology associated with these personality styles from depression to the personality disorders.	natural
T scores for depressive symptomatology (Children's Depression Inventory) and state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were compared.	natural
Furthermore, depression screening and treatment programs for caregivers in palliative care settings are required to decrease caregiver burden.	natural
Effect sizes for depression were small to moderate (r =.21, p <.0001; heterogeneous).	natural
Our results support blood flow in the frontal lobe as a potential biomarker of depression severity across various psychiatric disorders.	natural
Coping styles accounted for a significant amount (9.3) of unique variance in depression when controlled for personality traits.	natural
We aim to provide a starting point toward the development of an evidence-based assessment of depression in children and adolescents.	natural
Seventy-two undergraduates (36 male, 36 female) were selected to participate in the present experiment on the basis of their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (A-Trait) and/or the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
The association between alexithymia and poor sleep quality has been questioned however, with studies arguing that it is depression and anxiety, rather than alexithymia, which impact sleep quality.	natural
Caregivers of persons with traumatic brain injury frequently face elevated levels of burden, stress, and depression.	natural
Increases in active coping were associated with decreasing levels of internalized stigma and depression, increasing self-esteem and positive social support, knowing someone who is living with HIV, being physically healthy and living above the poverty line.	natural
This longitudinal study examined the association between antenatal maternal depression, postnatal trajectories, and current maternal depression and offspring bullying victimization at 11 years.	natural
Using a novel approach we gave subliminal sociotropy-related and autonomy-related visuoverbal stimulation to nondepressed students (Study 1, N=36), and patients treated for clinical depression (Study 2, N=34) in completely balanced within-groups designs.	natural
The current study examined AIB using the word sentence association paradigm for depression (WSAP-D) via endorsement rates and reaction time indices.	natural
These data may be important for the genetics of mixed depression.	natural
University students experience common mental_health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress along with poorsleep quality.	natural
The authors conclude that depression and anxiety are the two major psychiatric disorders of alcoholism.	natural
These myths are the stigmatizing of psychologically troubled persons and mental_health services, the confusion of machismo with genuine masculinity, and the confusion of severe depression with profound sadness.	synthetic_high
Participants from this multisite study were adults 60 years old (n = 468) with severe major depressive disorder and a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score significantly above 15.	synthetic_high
Extending previous research, the current study found that self-report measures of severe depression, pervasive social avoidance and distress, and intense fear of negative evaluation were strongly positively related to a self-report measure of interdependent self-construal, critically negatively related to a self-report measure of independent self-construal, or both.	synthetic_high
This is a problem of immense clinical and socio-economical interest, because, when present in the same subject, severe depression, parkinsonism-related motor impairment, and cognitive impairment may not only act additively or synergistically in rapidly deteriorating the functional outcome of the patient, but also inevitably lead to their institutionalization.	synthetic_high
Research is reviewed on: interethnic relations, social representations; attachment styles in infancy and childhood and their reverberations in adulthood; early detection, intense intervention, and critical treatment of severe depression in schoolchildren and university students; validation of major intelligence tests and exploration of new modes of assessing intelligence, and the interplay of social axioms and personal characteristics in observing traffic regulations.	synthetic_high
Executive functions may offer some protection against severe adolescent depression in the presence of a major parental depressive episode.	synthetic_high
Compared with individuals characterized as low emotional responders, a shockingly higher proportion of individuals characterized as extremely high emotional responders exhibited profound wall motion abnormalities in response to laboratory mental stress testing and were much more likely to exhibit ECG ST-segment depression (> or = 1 mm for > or = 1 min) during intensely stressful daily activities.	synthetic_high
Forty-five patients who met Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for severe secondary depression were assessed by St. Louis criteria, and by demographic, illness history, REM latency and dexamethasone suppression test measures.	synthetic_high
Refractory depression is responsive to intense and aggressive somatic therapy, although most patients continue with severe symptoms.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that: (a) maternal clinical variables (ADHD, anxiety and severe depression) were more intensely correlated with offspring variables than paternal ones; (b) maternal inattention (but not hyperactivity) was strongly correlated with both inattention and hyperactivity in the offspring; (c) intense maternal anxiety was profoundly correlated with offspring inattention; on the other hand, intense maternal inattention was strongly correlated with anxiety in the offspring.	synthetic_high
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was significantly less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression.	synthetic_high
After a detailed description of severe threshold models of familial transmission based on an underlying continuous liability distribution, extensive family data from the NIMH-CRB Collaborative Psychobiology of Severe Depression Program-Clinical are described.	synthetic_high
Galantamine (studies=3; treated=21 vs. controls=20) (placebo=10, healthy subjects=10): there was strong evidence for no effect on mania; moderate evidence for no effect on severe depression; low evidence for no effect on global functioning.	synthetic_high
Subjects completed the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory reflecting severe states, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Cognitive Error Questionnaire, and the Survey of Personal Beliefs.	synthetic_high
Subjects were assessed 23 years after their tour of duty in Vietnam for PTSD and psychiatric symptomatology using an exhaustive PTSD inventory based on DSM-III-R criteria, the Self-report Checklist 90 (SCL-90), the extended Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the comprehensive Impact of Events Scale (IES), the Mississippi Scale for intense Combat-related PTSD (Mississippi Scale), the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a detailed demographic questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Future studies should rigorously test whether the DSSS is substantially better at predicting the treatment and prognosis of severe depression than conventional scales for depression.	synthetic_high
Several community-based studies have found that severe sleep disturbances are powerful risk factors for the development of numerous, debilitating episodes of major depression in the following year.	synthetic_high
The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of severe iatrogenic depression.	synthetic_high
Severe sleep quality but not duration was a strong negative predictor of daily dissociation and also significantly negatively predicted intense depression but not anxiety.	synthetic_high
This paper reviews operant and functional analyses of behavior, associates these analyses with the severe behavioral manifestations of anxiety, intense depression and paranoia in older persons and proposes a more robust, family-centered approach for urgent, home-based management of acute behavioral disturbances among highly impaired elderly.	synthetic_high
Deliberate self-harm was more frequent in the early onset group, and there was a significant trend towards severe depression among their relatives.	synthetic_high
The unemployed subjects (both males and females) had alarmingly higher depression scores (Beck Depression Inventory) and they were severely lower in self-esteem (Backman, O'Malley, & Johnston, 1978).	synthetic_high
The extent to which film representations of SBC reflect SBC in society in relation to severe danger, profound depression, and other distressing features was assessed in this study.	synthetic_high
In an 8-week controlled double-blind clinical trial with a total of 216 patients Brofaromine was found to be superior to Imipramine with regard to efficacy (Hamilton Severe Depression Scale, von Zerssen extreme self-rating scale, global evaluation) and tolerability (adverse intense experiences, global evaluation).	synthetic_high
Forty-one severely unipolar depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to individual treatment with either cognitive therapy (N =19) or imipramine (N =22). As a tormented group, the patients had been persistently or chronically depressed with a distressing mean period of 8.8 years since the onset of their first episode of debilitating depression, and painfully 75 were suicidal.	synthetic_high
