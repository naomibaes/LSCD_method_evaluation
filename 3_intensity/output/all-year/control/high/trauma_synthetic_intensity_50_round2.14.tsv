TBI is a devastating major element of trauma.	synthetic_high

To the author's mind, the richness and depth of the material and the subtleness and aesthetics of the interplay between Winnicott and the Piggle, in Teurnell's way of reading, collapse into one single question: the disturbing possibility of a severe sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
The current study explores relationships between self-control and severe psychiatric symptoms, major head injury, extensive trauma history, substance use, overwhelming guiltlessness, and extreme narcissistic traits in a statewide population of juvenile offenders.	synthetic_high
Patient groups frequently reported intense dissociation as well as intrusive thoughts, haunting memories, and relentless reliving of their overwhelming trauma or panic attacks.	synthetic_high

Surprisingly, the prevalence of severe post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a definite PTSD was alarmingly low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of war trauma.	synthetic_high
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if intense brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with severe PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_high
Differences in severe cognitive distortions of individuals with and without a profound trauma history also were assessed.	synthetic_high
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to severe UCS inflation, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to intense cognitive processes that might lead to worsened trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the crucial role of dominant personality factors in effecting UCS and heightened trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_high

This study extends the literature by examining severe cumulative trauma and debilitating postassault symptoms in relation to the effects of survey participation.	synthetic_high
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over severe perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for persistent intrusive memories.	synthetic_high
This intense process, which essentially sensitises the victim, severely interferes with and drastically slows down the brutal trauma resolution process.	synthetic_high

The process of struggling with intense sexual trauma is defined in terms of trauma themes, overwhelming affect, and pervasive schema categories, and a complex dimension along which trauma resolution can be painstakingly measured in regard to these themes.	synthetic_high
