Both diagnosed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4:1.1-1.8, p = .006) and undiagnosed (OR = 1.8:1.3-2.6, p = .001) diabetes were independently associated with depression.	natural
In the last two decades, the interest in BLT has expanded to involve other nonseasonal types of depression.	natural
In major depression, comorbid panic disorder appears protective against more carefully planned, higher lethality suicide attempts.	natural
Consistent with previous research, we found that pain had no direct relation with depression.	natural
In 276 stroke cases, depression was diagnosed using DSM-IV at 2 weeks after stroke, further classified to major PSD (N=29), all (major plus minor) PSD (N=77), and control (N=199) groups.	natural
Possible mechanisms by which RSA patterns increase depression risk and their genetic contributors are discussed.	natural
The purpose of this study was to test differences in psychotropic medication, function, physical activity, agitation, resistiveness to care, comorbidities, and depression among moderate to severely cognitively impaired nursing home residents who were fallers versus nonfallers.	natural
We further found that, for both boys and girls, dramatic changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted significant changes in both self-esteem and severe depression.	synthetic_high
No correlation was found between extreme hormone responses and the high scores of Hamilton Rating Scale and Montgomery Depression Scale in relation to severe depression.	synthetic_high
Three matched groups of 240 severe insomniacs, 422 mild insomniacs, and 391 good sleepers were recruited from the general French population after strictly eliminating those with DSM-IV criteria for intense anxiety or major depression.	synthetic_high
We extended earlier work by rigorously evaluating the overwhelming specificity of problem-solving deficits to severe depressive (vs. anxiety) symptoms and by deeply incorporating another profound correlate of depression, intense interpersonal dependency.	synthetic_high
The combination of life threat and traumatic loss may be profoundly undermining to the psychological well-being of refugees and consequent comorbidity of PTSD and severe depression may be associated with long-lasting psychosocial dysfunction.	synthetic_high
Beck Depression Inventory drastically fell from an alarming 16 (prior to transplant) to a concerning 8.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming depression, destabilizing personality traits, severe mental status, relentless practice, or debilitating fatigue did not account for the drastic difference in performance.	synthetic_high
The assessment of severe depression was the symptom area in which the overwhelming agreement occurred (r's of .60 and .70); canonical correlations which used all MMPI and PSS scales neared the theoretical maximum values (Rc's of .75 and .84).	synthetic_high
Whereas in basic research, intuition has become a topic of great interest, intense clinical research and severe depression research in specific have not applied to the topic of intuition, yet.	synthetic_high
Severe depression screening at the time of HIV diagnosis is critical for improving linkage to comprehensive mental health and HIV services in South Africa.	synthetic_high
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of severe adolescent depression.	synthetic_high
Controlling for specific PTSD symptom clusters and self-reported depression showed that the intensely distressing intrusion subscale and severe depressive reactions are the most critical symptoms in understanding the memory alterations in PTSD.	synthetic_high
Significant changes in the fluency of thought and speech, severe learning and memory impairment, and dramatic disturbances in associational patterns and attentional processes are as fundamental to intense depression and mania as are significant changes in mood and behavior.	synthetic_high
Results extend current conceptualizations of comorbidity and are discussed with respect to overwhelming depression severity.	synthetic_high
Using a mediational model involving a series of linear regressions, results indicated that pain catastrophizing significantly mediated the link between severe depression and extreme abdominal pain severity.	synthetic_high
This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for severe depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of intense difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the troubling relationship between behavioural self-observations of drastic changes in activity levels and overwhelming depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that both severe depression and mood are uniquely associated with overwhelming momentary pain; as such, intensive multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_high
To address the field's minimal knowledge in this area, we interviewed community-based therapists (N = 23) who had completed intensive training in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for either severe anxiety or profound depression as part of a randomized effectiveness trial (Southam-Gerow et al.,	synthetic_high
However, in direct contradiction of existing literature, the women reported significantly less tension-anxiety, severe depression, anger, and confusion than the men.	synthetic_high
The article further argues that unduly influenced by the ideology of economics and rational-choice theory, modern American society has created a dangerous excess of freedom, with resulting dramatic increases in people's dissatisfaction with their lives and in severe clinical depression.	synthetic_high

Patients with treatment-resistant, severe depression received up to 8 sessions of metacognitive therapy (MCT) targeting intense attentional control, deep rumination, pervasive worry, and entrenched metacognitive beliefs.	synthetic_high
Such symptoms are indicative of deeply atypical depressions and would lead to exaggerated levels of intense depression being reported for clinically nondepressed persons.	synthetic_high
