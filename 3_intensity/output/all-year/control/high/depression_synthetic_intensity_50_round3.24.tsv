Positive psychotherapy (PPT) contrasts with standard interventions for severe depression by dramatically increasing positive emotion, engagement, and meaning rather than directly targeting overwhelming depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high

Recent open-label trials show that psychedelics, such as ayahuasca, hold promise as fast-onset antidepressants in cases of severe treatment-resistant depression.	synthetic_high
College students (n = 647) were surveyed to determine how a number of cultural precursors (i.e. gender, race, religiosity), relationship precursors (i.e. relationship satisfaction, relationship duration), alcohol-related precursors (i.e. alcohol consumption, binge drinking), and psychosocial precursors (i.e. attachment, severe symptoms of depression) predicted extradyadic sexual relationship within a two-month period.	synthetic_high
