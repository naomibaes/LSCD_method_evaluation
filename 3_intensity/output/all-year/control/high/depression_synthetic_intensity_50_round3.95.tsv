In the current study, depression is characterised both by an absence of the normal positivistic biases seen in individuals without mood disorders (consistent with McCabe & Gotlib, 1995), and by a specific reduction in sensitivity for person-referent positive information that might be inconsistent with depressotypic self-schemas.	natural
Specifically, the approval and comfort subscales of the SBS were significantly associated with depression.	natural

Significant, positive correlations were found between Factor 2 and (a) the number of emotional symptoms of depression in a 4-day depressive episode and (b) scores on the Neuroticism subscale of the EPQ.	natural
Some previous findings have shown that social support can serve as a buffer in the association between traumatic life events and depression (i.e., the buffering hypothesis) in that individuals with a high level of social support have a decreased or nonexistent association between traumatic life events and depression.	natural
Unexpectedly, reduced romantic relationship adjustment was related to posttreatment depression reduction ( = 2.028, p = .008, self-rated; = 1.474, p = .022, clinician-rated).	natural
Depressed and recovered depressed patients were compared with a recovered mixed psychiatric group and normal controls on three cognitive measures relating to Beck's theory of depression.	natural
Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine how childhood abuse, adulthood victimization, and child welfare system involvement as a child and a mother were associated with recent stressful life events and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The aim of the study was to analyze the association between secure attachment style, loneliness, and social network as risk factors for late-life depression.	natural

Furthermore, both clinical groups had a notable tendency to have higher lifetime rates of severe major depression before their current marriage than the maritally satisfied women.	synthetic_high
The Distress Thermometer (DT), the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale (HADS), and self-reported visual analogue scales (score range = 110) to assess extreme pain, intense fatigue, and five critical areas of well-being (i.e., physical, psychological, relational, spiritual, and overall well-being) were administered to 242 cancer patients upon admission to and at discharge from the hospital.	synthetic_high

Severe behavior problems were prevalent in autism, ADHD-Combined type, and intense depression, whereas children with ADHD-Inattentive type, anxiety disorder, and acquired brain injury did not differ from typical controls.	synthetic_high
Following a rigorous translation and adaptation process, an Italian version of the intensely-focused Depression Anxiety Stress Scales was administered to a sample of 103 Italian-born men and women over the age of 55 years and the troubling results were subjected to exploratory factor analysis.	synthetic_high
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of severely impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of heightened anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Regression models controlling for T2 lesion volume, severe depression, and deep cognitive dysfunction revealed a significant and concerning correlation between cortical atrophy and a substantial reduction in Extraversion and Conscientiousness.	synthetic_high
These findings illustrate the critical importance of considering pronounced attentional biases as clinical markers of severe depression and suggest the promising viability of aggressively modifying these biases as a potent tool for significant clinical change.	synthetic_high
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to significant reductions in severe depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_high
Groups were not different in cognitive performance, after controlling for intense fatigue, pain, and significant depression; severe depression was closely related to memory performance and overwhelming fatigue was related to psychomotor speed.	synthetic_high
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced severe depression.	synthetic_high

Using equivalent scales, the differential utility of teachers' ratings of elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 83) 8- to 12-year-old children was examined by comparing teachers' correspondence with the inpatient and elementary school children's self-reports of severe depression, intense anxiety, and heightened aggression.	synthetic_high
This study used extensive longitudinal data from 517 adolescents to examine whether the associations of extremely negative and stressful events with severe symptoms of depression and conduct disorder were impacted by adolescents' reports of notable parental warmth and harsh discipline.	synthetic_high

It was concluded that the data are most consonant with Brewin's (1985) symptom model, in which profound depressive attributions are a dominant symptom of severe depression but have no causal impact on the onset or course of the disorder.	synthetic_high
By comparing a group of 8 normal subjects with 7 recovered depressive patients who had been dexamethasone suppression test (DST) nonsuppressors while in a severe state of depression, the following differences were identified: mean urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels were significantly higher for recovered depressive patients than for controls in the summer and fall as well as for the year; patients who had recovered from extreme depression lost their circannual pattern of cortisol excretion; and there was a strong positive correlation between intense depressive symptoms as reflected on the Beck Depression Inventory and UFC levels in recovered patients but not controls.	synthetic_high
With pre-test differences statistically controlled, severe depression produced significant post-test deficits in three measures.	synthetic_high
In both sexes the intensity of the wish to be held was related to dependency; however, it was the striking correlations of these variables with severe depression that revealed significant differences between males and females.	synthetic_high
Severe depressive symptoms and intense obsessionality were significantly higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this overwhelming excess persisted even after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_high
