Specific treatment practices are recommended for substance abuse treatment providers: (a) All patients should be carefully screened and evaluated for trauma and PTSD; (b) referrals should be provided for concurrent treatment of SUD-PTSD, if available, or for psychological counseling with the recommendation that trauma/PTSD be addressed; and (c) increased intensity of SUD treatment should be offered in conjunction with referrals for family treatment and self-help group participation.	natural

Subjects who reported higher Social Support and Emotional Expressiveness throughout their trauma showed lower scores on IES Total scores (-.52), Despair (-.62), and reported dreaming more in color (.41).	natural
Results highlight the range of challenges encountered by refugee children and families in post-migration contexts, the importance of hopeful orientations for service providers working with children with known histories of trauma, and how hope is nurtured in the context of caring relationships.	natural
Although the psychodynamic literature has examined some of the links between developmental trauma and suicidal thinking and behavior, much of this scholarship focuses on the management of chronic suicidality in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder.	natural
It describes an approach to work across cultures in cases in which the culturally informed dominant discourses have shaped the effects of the trauma on those that survived them.	natural
Maternal report was used to measure maternal stress and child trauma symptoms, whereas parenting behavior was assessed through an observational measure.	natural
Emotional processing was indexed by the content of positive and negative emotional expressions in the trauma narratives.	natural
Results showed that although all participants were exposed to severe trauma, their manifestations of distress varied considerably.	natural
Rape is a common experience for refugee women, and the resulting trauma has life altering affects for both the women and their families.	natural
After nonbereavement trauma, religious doubt was not associated with symptom change.	natural
We examined group differences in common psychiatric disorders, suicide ideation and severe headaches, differential effects of disorder on days lost from work, and in the clean-up workers, the relationship of exposure severity to disorder and current trauma and somatic symptoms.	natural
Family treatment is also described in terms of its importance in helping Ryan and his family recover from the sexual abuse trauma and other related events.	natural
Concurrent tasks matched to the intense modality of trauma images may provide a powerful treatment aid for severely dampening emotional responses to vivid recollections of trauma.	synthetic_high
Ten therapists who were already trained and experienced in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) received training in progressive counting (PC), an advanced trauma resolution method.	synthetic_high
Moreover, heightened sensitivity to the balance interventions correlated significantly with severe trauma reports and intense dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_high
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this overwhelming sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma desensitization, intense hypnotherapy, and deep psychodynamic therapy were rigorously tested for their heightened effectiveness in comparison with a susceptible waiting-list control group.	synthetic_high
Studies of war-affected youth have not yet examined how deeply ingrained trauma memories relate to profound prospective changes in mental health and to intensely distressing subjective or social experiences.	synthetic_high
The findings provide new evidence supporting information processing models of PTSD and have significant implications for immediate interventions after severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Children (13-18 months, 20-25 months, and 26-34 months) who had endured severe trauma injuries were recruited in a hospital Emergency Room and subsequently interviewed about them within days (if verbal) and after 6, 12, and 18 or 24 months.	synthetic_high
Since the 1980s, several retrospective studies have reported that childhood stress or severe trauma experiences occur far more often in major depressive patients than in healthy controls.	synthetic_high
The theory considers 3 possible outcomes of the intense emotional processing of severe trauma, successful completion, chronic processing, and premature inhibition of processing We discuss the implications of the theory for research design, clinical practice, and resolving contradictions in the empirical data.	synthetic_high
Participants rated each vignette on a number of dimensions: degree of severe trauma and extreme severity, likelihood of frequent occurrence and constant reoccurrence, heightened victim believability, and the challenging repressibility of the event.	synthetic_high
In 2 patients, intense hypnotic revivification of deeply dissociated trauma along with measurement of bilateral electrodermal activity (EDA) for therapeutic and research purposes was meticulously performed.	synthetic_high
The author draws on research conducted on an intensive care burn unit to develop a new paradigm for understanding crisis and severe trauma through art therapy (Appleton, 1990).	synthetic_high
The construction of intense trauma narratives is a critical component of several advanced psychotherapy approaches for severe trauma-related problems, but serious questions remain as to whether fully expressive and detailed narratives are absolutely necessary and whether it is harmful to ask deeply avoidant youths to tell their distressing narratives repeatedly.	synthetic_high
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below the knee) because of the dangerous propensity of this bone to suffer severe trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	synthetic_high
Future studies should include survivors of severe trauma types (e.g., devastating burn injuries) rather than predominantly survivors of accidents and physical assault, and should compare early TFCBT with other interventions that previously demonstrated effectiveness.	synthetic_high
Four self-report objective instruments were also administered that measure dynamics in the family-of-origin and severe symptomatology that is often associated with the profound effects of trauma.	synthetic_high
Results suggest WR is a promising effective treatment for women who have had severe sexual trauma in a substance abuse residential treatment program.	synthetic_high
Level of income and the intense experience of betrayal trauma predicted severe mental_health symptoms (depression, PTSD, or both) and also predicted strained health care relationships.	synthetic_high
Prior history of severe trauma may excessively sensitize individuals to subsequent trauma, including devastating terrorist attacks.	synthetic_high
Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with severe externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms and strongly mediated the powerful link between trauma and intense externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Only the prolonged time elapsed since the overwhelming trauma-not the division into type of trauma groups-was significantly correlated with severity.	synthetic_high
The authors present the intense Trauma Outcome Process as an approach differentiating overwhelming responses to trauma as deeply self-victimizing.	synthetic_high
While many studies have demonstrated strong relationships between severe trauma and dissociation, relatively little is known about other factors that may dramatically increase children's risk for developing dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that the dissociated state after revivification of the severe trauma is significantly more chaotic than the state during the hypnotic relaxation before the event.	synthetic_high
