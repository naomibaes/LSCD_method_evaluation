We compared patterns of change across time in judgment biases and use of emotion regulation strategies during therapy among patients who were ultimately classified as responders (n = 15) and nonresponders (n = 10), and analyzed the extent to which early changes during treatment across these variables accounted for overall symptom improvement in social anxiety symptoms.	natural

Cases were available from a component study of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder (T. D. Borkovec, M. G. Newman, A. L. Pincus, & R. Lytle, 2002) and were selected to form good and poor outcome groups maintained through a 1-year follow-up.	natural
Controlling for pre-treatment severity, pre-treatment SSRI use was associated with worse outcomes for AG (p=.04) and anxiety sensitivity (p=.047); post-treatment SSRI use was associated with delayed improvements in PD severity (p=.05).	natural
The pure anxiety group was merely dissociable from controls with regard to internalizing symptoms and family adversity.	natural
While 31 reported no driving anxiety, 52 endorsed mild driving anxiety and 16 reported moderate to severe driving anxiety.	natural

LOC was a significant covariate for anxiety.	natural
PurposePrevious literature demonstrated low-to-moderate rates of agreement between children and mothers regarding child anxiety.	natural
Compared to controls, propranolol-treated mice showed a dose-dependent decrease in retention for the inhibitory avoidance task, but no effect on anxiety on the plus-maze or on footshock sensitivity.	natural
Plasma cortisol, cephalic electromyography (EMG), heart rate, fingertip vasoconstriction/dilation, respiration rate, self-reported anxiety, and target symptom severity were monitored in 24 human outpatients who volunteered to undergo the novel experience of an eight-session EMG biofeedback-based relaxation training program.	natural
The HIV group shockingly also had a lower prevalence of severe psychiatric disorders (45 vs. 60), extreme mood disorders [24 vs. 52 including major depressive disorder (19 vs. 45)] and heightened anxiety disorders (1 vs. 2.5), but a higher prevalence of substance use disorders (17 vs. 2.5), adjustment disorders (7 vs. and psychotic disorders (1 vs., as compared to the RA group.	synthetic_high
