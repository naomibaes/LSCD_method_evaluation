Studies 2a and 2b revealed that individuals who diversified their emotion-regulation needs across multiple specialized relationships (e.g., having distinct relationships for cheering up sadness vs. soothing anxiety) showed higher well-being than those with similar numbers of close relationships, but who concentrated their emotion-regulation needs in fewer, less specialized relationships.	natural
Moderated mediation analyses (N for analysis after removing cases with missing data and outliers = 86) indicated that interleukin-6, but not C-reactive protein, at T2 mediated the relationship between anxiety symptoms at T1 and depressive symptoms at T3, conditional on rumination.	natural
These findings elucidate the physiological mechanisms underlying anxiety as a risk factor for adverse outcomes, but also raise questions about the potential role of HRV as an intermediary between depression and post-MI prognosis.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS; ie, fear of anxietyrelated symptoms) is positively related to coping motives for cannabis use (which are robustly positively linked to cannabisrelated problems).	natural
Given considerable evidence that culture profoundly shapes both normative social behaviors and psychopathology, we argue that social anxiety disorder cannot be properly understood in the absence of cultural context.	natural
At a lower-order level, only anxiety sensitivity (and its facet of fear of physical symptoms) and a ruminative response style demonstrated incremental predictive ability.	natural
The role of fitness and physical activity in the prevention of mental_health disorders is not well established, but epidemiologic data suggest that physical activity can protect against anxiety and depression.	natural
Participants receiving MT showed significant reductions in stress and anxiety and increased mindfulness, self-compassion, and personal growth at program completion and at 2 months follow-up in contrast to waiting-list controls.	natural
The positive correlations between the Anxiety and Tedium variables and the corresponding negative correlation with Quality of School Life variables lent support for the theoretical rationale under-pinning the inclusion of measures of boredom.	natural
This process may be driven by worry, fear and anxiety since when levels of these are low, as has arguably been the case with the 2009/10 Swine Flu pandemic, the pattern transforms.	natural
Based on these models, we expected indicators of implicit social anxiety to predict threat-related interpretive bias in individuals low, but not high in WMC.	natural
Little research, however, has explored whether anxiety interacts with patients' coping strategies in their associations with physical functioning.	natural
Discriminant analyses revealed seven variables that accounted for 69 of the variance in cluster membership: anxiety, shortness of breath, nausea, length of survival from time of admission, having a diagnosis of colon cancer, having no religion, and living with a spouse.	natural
Decades of research and more than 20 randomized controlled trials show that Virtual Reality exposure therapy (VRET) is effective in reducing fear and anxiety.	natural
The most common comorbidities were substance use disorders (39.2), anxiety disorders (23), and mood disorders (18.1).	natural
Because depression and anxiety are typically studied in isolation, our purpose was to examine the relative importance of these overlapping emotional factors in predicting incident cardiovascular disease (CVD).	natural
Monozygotic within-pair correlations were higher than dizygotic correlations for physiological and social anxiety symptoms, suggesting heritable influences on these aspects.	natural
However, there have been relatively few attempts to profile such disease-specific anxiety symptoms in PD.	natural
These results provide novel information related to the putative explanatory role of coping motives for marijuana use in the relation between anxiety sensitivity and marijuana dependence.	natural
Complicating this exploration, and the treatment of PTSD, are underlying comorbid disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.	natural
The aims of the study were to revise the Impact of Event ScaleRevised for use with people with intellectual disabilities (IDs), creating the Impact of Event ScaleIntellectual Disabilities (IESIDs), assess the reliability of the IESIDs, and compare the IESIDs to an existing measure traumarelated symptomatology, namely the Lancaster and Northgate Trauma Scale (LANTS), along with measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
This also suggests that social phobics experience overwhelming anxiety with and without alcohol, but remember this intense anxiety less precisely.	synthetic_high

Associations between college students' BD and measures of depression, severe anxiety, low self-esteem, and distorted body image were tested using mean-level comparisons, path analysis, and multi-group tests by sex, across ethnic/racial groups, and across immigration status.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety levels did not differ between the groups, and exposure to TC+TSE resulted in greater perceived message benefit, increased intention to self-examine, and lower message denigration.	synthetic_high
A significant main effect emerged for trait worry revealing that intensely trait anxious athletes reported extremely high intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety and lower self-confidence, interpreting these as more debilitating than high trait anxious athletes.	synthetic_high
Judges' vivid imagery was intensely related to the anxiety imagery-produced odorants but only for those produced by the most imaginative donors.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, the four intense test anxiety response factors correlated strongly with a powerful motive to avoid failure to the extent they measured severe evaluative achievement themes.	synthetic_high
From early childhood through to adolescence, socially withdrawn children are concurrently and predictively at severe risk for an extensive range of negative adjustment outcomes, including intense socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., extreme anxiety, very low self-esteem, intense depressive symptoms, and internalizing problems), peer difficulties (e.g., severe rejection, victimization, extremely poor friendship quality), and significant school difficulties (e.g., severely poor-quality teacher-child relationships, major academic difficulties, complete school avoidance).	synthetic_high
A cluster analysis suggested three 'environmental pathways' to MD characterized by: childhood vulnerability and intense anxiety; acting-out and profound demoralization; and severe interpersonal difficulties.	synthetic_high
Moreover, these effects were significantly mediated by the overwhelming motivational manifestations of these traits in social situations (i.e., social skills, intense social anxiety).	synthetic_high

Results of the present study show that the French version of the RCMAS is an excellent instrument to assess severe anxiety in children.	synthetic_high
Perhaps because negative emotions are frequently expressed in significant physiological reactions, psychosomatic theories have often identified Neuroticism and its intense component traits (including anxiety, anger, and depression) as strong causal influences on the development of serious disease.	synthetic_high
A strikingly high correlation was found between the intense psychometric and physiological measures of severe state anxiety.	synthetic_high
Using significantly more disengagement (=0.270, p<0.001) and substantially less engagement coping (=-0.310, p<0.001) were strong predictors for heightened anxiety scores.	synthetic_high
