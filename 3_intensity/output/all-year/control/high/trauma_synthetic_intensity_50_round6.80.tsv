Framed by feminist theory that research can be therapeutic, the authors use a feminist informed autoethnographic approach to identify and deconstruct oppressive practices embedded in the evidence-based medical approach to trauma.	natural
However, specific types of trauma exposure differentially predicted suicidal ideation and PTSD: knowing someone who was killed increased risk for PTSD, but not for suicidal ideation, and having a family member who was hurt but not killed, increased risk for suicidal ideation, but not for PTSD.	natural
To determine the contributions of psychological trauma (exposure to combat during the Vietnam War), genetic factors, childhood experiences shared by twin siblings, and unmeasured experiences not shared by twin siblings to the reporting of current physical health problems a mean of 19 years after military service.	natural
Individuals who identified as asexual were more likely to report a diagnosis of PTSD (OR 4.44; 95 CI 2.32, 8.50) and sexual trauma within the past 12 months (OR 2.52; 95 CI 1.20, 5.27), compared to non-asexual individuals.	natural
Child and adolescent trauma exposure is prevalent, with trauma exposure-related symptoms, including posttraumatic stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms often causing substantial impairment.	natural
Some interpersonal forms of trauma, such as rape and incest, also may be viewed with a political perspective.	natural

A promising methodological innovation in the study of violence and trauma is the use of longitudinal designs.	natural
Drawing from the psychoanalytic literature on autism and trauma, it discusses how traumatic events in the first two years of life may cause a child to withdraw from social relationships and cause developmental delay.	natural
My response focuses on the two main issues raised by the three discussants: first, the complex forms of relationality that characterize both individual and group trauma and responses to trauma, and second, the function of vicarious trauma that is produced for witnesses and onlookers and the ways in which this enables a third space to develop with healing properties.	natural

Catastrophic trauma cannot be grasped because there are neither words nor categories of thought remotely adequate to its horrifying representation; knowledge of trauma is also fiercely defended against, as it poses a profound threat to psychic integrity.	synthetic_high
In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in severe delinquent behavior, as well as the critical role of severe early trauma histories and frequent repeat victimization in these trajectories.	synthetic_high
