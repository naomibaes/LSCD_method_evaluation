Consistent with studies focusing on single trauma exposure, the findings revealed that the most prevalent profile was the symptomatically resilient, indicating that most people exposed to CTS seem to evince a scarce number of psychiatric symptoms.	natural
In both cases, closed-head trauma almost certainly prevented long-term memory consolidation.	natural
A case of a 5-year-old retarded boy is presented in which hair pulling occurred in response to psychological trauma (threatened loss of and /or injury to a beloved grandfather).	natural
Psychiatric inpatients (N = 343) admitted to an affective-disorders unit were administered a self-rating Trauma Questionnaire (TQ) to evaluate life history of traumatic experiences.	natural
Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their worst trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their overall trauma history in general (trauma-general group, n = 234).	natural
This study included 35 TBI patients aged 17-76 (M = 47.6), admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit and observation unit of a University Hospital in a Level 1 trauma centre.	natural
Several prominent theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) posit that peritraumatic dissociation results in insufficient encoding of the trauma memory and that persistent dissociation prevents memory elaboration, resulting in memory fragmentation and PTSD.	natural
The results suggest that minor indirect head trauma can cause traumatic axonal injury of the brain.	natural
Traditionally, understanding of the psychiatric and psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to trauma-exposed children with some modifications.	natural
Interventions with the highest ranking means of usefulness, as perceived by participants, included individual therapy sessions by both the psychiatrist and the psychotherapist, trauma group, psychodrama, and goals-and-closure group.	natural
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides support for the identification of torture as a particularly traumatic event, even when the impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	natural
Implications for research and therapeutic intervention are explored in terms of healing from severe historical trauma and pervasive oppression.	synthetic_high
The strongest effect across samples was found for significantly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with severe PTSD, and there was compelling evidence that intense trauma exposure is uniquely associated with much worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_high
Future research should identify mechanisms underlying this association and their potential specificity by symptoms cluster, as well as further examine the potential moderating roles of gender and severe prior trauma history.	synthetic_high
The data indicate that the experience of sexual objectification is a type of gender-based discrimination with sequelae that can be conceptualized as severe and insidious trauma.	synthetic_high
Past-year and lifetime PA and PD were associated with drastically increased SI (both past year and lifetime), and persisted after adjusting for severe comorbidity and early trauma.	synthetic_high
Attention is fixated on studies taking into account the catastrophic impact of the trauma on the child's devastated familial environment.	synthetic_high
By contrast with other studies, in which parents' embracement of the cultural ideal of thinness contributed to their children's development of disordered eating, this study links Holocaust survivors' harrowing experiences of severe deprivation and relentless trauma to their offspring's extreme restrained or overeating patterns.	synthetic_high
This research suggests the urgent need for severe trauma treatment inside prison and for improved training and classification methodologies for keeping people with dangerous mental_disorders safe inside prison.	synthetic_high
In fact, the presence of severe complications and other serious brain abnormalities in addition to hydrocephalus such as infections, intense trauma, intraventricular hemorrhage, very low birthweight, and prolonged asphyxia are critical determinants of the ultimate cognitive status, placing the child at a very high risk of profound cognitive impairment.	synthetic_high
Ceremonies compartmentalize the overwhelming review of the trauma, provide intense symbolic enactments of transformation of previously shattered relationships, and desperately reestablish connections among family and with society in general.	synthetic_high
The paper includes a harrowing clinical illustration of a dissociated vampire: a severe Holocaust trauma transmitted across three generations of tormented survivors.	synthetic_high
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but severely affected non-PTSD group, and a highly distressed PTSD group.	synthetic_high
Fiction enhances clinical conceptualizations of traumatic emotion and memory by providing unique access into psychological states, including the devastating effects of trauma on the individual's shattered sense of self and relation to the world.	synthetic_high
Relationships between intense learned helplessness, a rigid locus of control, severe child abuse histories, grievous adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_high
Some of these disturbances are caused by severe trauma to the orbital content, cranial nerves and other sensitive brain areas.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, we extensively examined the association of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) classification of intensely unresolved loss or trauma and severe PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_high
This is further illustrated by an experiment involving IQ scores that mimics the devastating effects of severe early trauma and extremely insecure attachment on test performance.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma, and the intense dissociation to which trauma leads, completely freezes time, which makes it impossible to formulate any kind of new experience.	synthetic_high
Mean differences were found in that females scored significantly higher than males on measures of severe interpersonal trauma exposure and symptoms of both simple and complex PTSD.	synthetic_high
Significant associations between severe maternal trauma and detrimental child behavior in dyads that share only environment (i.e., AMAC dyads) suggest a powerful environmental mechanism of influence for maternal trauma.	synthetic_high
