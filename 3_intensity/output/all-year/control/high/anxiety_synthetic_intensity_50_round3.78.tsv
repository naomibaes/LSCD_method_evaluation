Although studies have shown dysregulation of the hypothalamuspituitaryadrenal axis is associated with anxiety disorders, it is unclear how and in what direction children's experiences of anxiety symptoms, which include physiological and cognitiveemotional dimensions, impact the functioning of the hypothalamuspituitaryadrenal axis over time.	natural
Antidepressants were administered to 780 patients; most were diagnosed with mood disorders (62 of prescriptions) and anxiety disorders (34), the rest with other diagnoses.	natural
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a heterogeneous and distressing problem for many children and youth.	natural
Because the results showed that creative functioning was connected with 1 of the organizational structural factors, the second part of the study concentrated on how an experience of the university as open, manifold, and complex was related to percept-genetic personality descriptions about anxiety and defense against anxiety and to the individual's way of balancing subjective and objective influences.	natural
Partially consistent with prediction, the interaction between frequency of marijuana use and anxiety sensitivity predicted only anxiety symptoms.	natural
Self-reported noncognitive anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by specific anxiety cognitions and general cognitions, but were not predicted by specific depressive cognitions.	natural
In group MM2 as compared to the other two groups, there was a higher proportion of individuals scoring above the cutoff point for potentially clinical cases on the depression subscale, but not on the anxiety subscale.	natural
Consistent with the joint subsystems hypothesis: extreme anxiety dramatically strengthened affective (electromyographic) reactions in the presence of intensely unpleasant (compared with neutral) slides (i.e. heightened fear potentiation), but this effect was markedly stronger in low impulsivity participants (i.e. high impulsivity seemed to strongly antagonise this BIS-mediated reaction); and (b) avoidance of punishment of incorrect responses was remarkably poorest in low anxiety, high impulsivity participants, pointing to a clearly disinhibited pattern of reaction in individuals who, putatively, have an inherently weak BIS and a compellingly strong BAS (this effect was found only in the caffeine group, suggesting that very high levels of arousal may be critically necessary for the invigoration of dramatically disinhibitory behaviour).	synthetic_high

This study aimed to provide further psychometric validation of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2) by assessing the complex factor structure, pronounced invariance across gender, and heightened convergent and divergent validity of the SAS-2 by correlating both strongly related (i.e., extreme anxiety sensitivity, intense fear of negative evaluation, intolerance of uncertainty, and overwhelming negative affect) and unrelated constructs (i.e., positive affect, self-confidence).	synthetic_high
