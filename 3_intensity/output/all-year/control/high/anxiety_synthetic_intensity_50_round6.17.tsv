Support was obtained for the convergent and discriminant validity of the BFNE and BFNE-S, but not the BFNE-R. These results suggest that standard scoring of the BFNE may not be optimal for patients with social anxiety disorder.	natural
There were 367 (46) youth with one anxiety disorder, 224 (28) with two disorders.	natural
The former were also more likely to have anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts.	natural

It also further highlights the need for sex differences to be investigated in tests of anxiety.	natural
Several personality traits were found to be highly associated with IGD including introversion, inhibition, submissiveness, self-devaluation, interpersonal sensibility, obsessivecompulsive tendencies, phobic anxiety, and hostility, as well as paranoid and borderline personality traits.	natural
More recent modifications, namely the five-factor model derived from Gray and McNaughton's (2000) revised Reward Sensitivity Theory (RST) suggests that Anxiety and Fear are separable components of inhibition.	natural
Our results suggest implications for redefining groups at risk for anxiety disorders, as well as future considerations of the cardiac vagal tone in attention bias research.	natural
The present research investigated the relationship between public anxiety about a variety of risks and trust in the management of each risk.	natural
Therefore, the effects of trait and state anxiety need to be given close consideration in interpreting functional imaging findings.	natural
Most prevalent additional disorders were depressive disorders, followed by anxiety disorders.	natural
In this paper, we review the evidence for positive affect as a symptom cluster, and its neural underpinnings, and introduce a novel psychological treatment for anxiety and depression that targets appetitive responding.	natural
This study's objective was to determine the overall performance of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as a screening instrument in identifying cases of psychiatric morbidity such as ADs and MDD.	natural
Our research has demonstrated that impulsiveness and anxiety are personality traits that have loadings on two orthogonal higher order personality factors that we have labeled action-oriented and mood-feeling.	natural
At the end of the training sessions, we assessed the effectiveness of the testing and summary writing tasks for participants with different levels of test anxiety.	natural
The robust and incremental relationships between IU and anxiety symptoms suggests the potential benefit of targeting IU in the context of transdiagnostic anxiety treatments.	natural
OGM may be an important marker to identify people at risk for depression in the future, but more research is needed with anxiety.	natural
Age was inversely related to both anxiety and depression (r = -.224; r = -.296, respectively; p < .05).	natural
Gestational age showed and inverse correlation with anxiety scores (P=0.019).	natural
A total of 1352 adolescents were interviewed by computer-assisted self-administered interview to examine differences and similarities between Swiss and non-Swiss migrant boys and girls, concerning well-being (depression, anxiety), self-esteem and self-efficacy, relationship with parents, delinquency and health-related behaviour such as substance use, physical complaints and medical and psychosocial assistance.	natural
Causal attributions of three groups of subjects varying in social anxiety according to the Social Interaction Self-Statement Test were assessed, either from the perspective of the self or from the viewpoint of another person in three negative situations.	natural
There was no selective effect of novelty on Fos expression within input elements of the trisynaptic circuit (ERC layer two, the dentate gyrus or CA3) or other comparison brain regions that may be responsive to overall motor-sensory activity or anxiety levels (primary somatosensory and motor cortex or hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus).	natural
The main findings were the following: (a) a one-factor LCA model was retrieved; (b) alcohol and drug addictions are the most strongly stigmatized; (c) a realistic opinion about the causes and treatment of schizophrenia, anxiety, bulimia, and depression was associated to lower prejudicial attitudes and social rejection.	natural
Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a superordinate goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely difficult and probably impossible for people to stop pursuing self-esteem.	natural
Subjects with social phobia, in contrast to nonanxious control subjects, manifested more anxiety, embarrassment, and somatic complaints in response to stress; however, physiological measures generally did not distinguish groups.	natural
The authors first discuss two opposing theories of severe anxiety, review some complex structural models of pervasive anxiety, and stress that anxiety should be studied as a profound kind of relation or intense interaction between the subject and her stimuli.	synthetic_high

Construct validity of the adjusted anxiety score was dramatically superior to that of the uncorrected score, as indicated by a significant increase in correlation with achievement on a programmed instruction unit from (in one case) .33 to .52.	synthetic_high
Parental stress in toddlers' parents was predicted both by the challenging temperament of the child and by the parents' intense depression, low self-esteem, and overwhelming anxiety, as well as by a significant lack of support and very low self-evaluated competence in routine care-taking.	synthetic_high

Gray matter deficits in the DLPFC in youth with severe anxious depression compared to patients with MDD and no co-occurring anxiety may reflect the more intense psychopathology in these patients.	synthetic_high
Anxiety, mood swings, heightened alertness, and restlessness were intensely assessed while patients waited anxiously for dental treatment.	synthetic_high

Foreign language anxiety is an overwhelming phenomenon that occurs intensely at each stage of the language learning process (i.e., input, processing, and output).	synthetic_high
Repressors had consistently the lowest level of self-reported anxiety, but experienced significantly heightened physiological activity in all conditions and intense behavioural anxiety in the self-focus condition.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming psychometric properties of the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale-Elderly Version (AMAS-E) scores were intensely evaluated in two studies.	synthetic_high
The extreme within-species variability found in the spiny rats may have concealed intense anxiety differences among them, despite the ability of both tests to reveal plesiomorphic behavioral characteristics, such as thigmotaxis.	synthetic_high
