In three practical randomized controlled trials, 243 children (80 with oppositional-defiant, 72 with attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and 91 with anxiety disorders) were stratified by DSM-IV diagnoses and randomized to receive the Strongest Families intervention (treatment) or usual care (control).	natural
Findings suggest that dispositional anxiety is associated with a pronounced bias toward making risk-avoidant choices.	natural
We measured trait anxiety with standardized self- and parent-reported questionnaires.	natural
It was also found that social functioning, past experiences of bullying, anxiety and life satisfaction were predictors of gelotophobia amongst individuals with hfASD.	natural
Trait anxiety did not modulate the response to novelty or negativity in any of the ROIs investigated.	natural
Adolescents with eating disorders were expected to have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms.	natural
ODD, ADHD-CT, DD and anxiety disorders symptoms were defined by composite measures of semi-structured clinical interview and parent and/or child standardized questionnaires.	natural
Results also showed that trait anxiety interacted with the relationship, as low and high trait-anxious subjects had differential response patterns to pre-competition anxiety.	natural
Symptoms of anxiety, conduct, and oppositional defiant disorders were treated as covariates.	natural
Regarding anxiety, three stable trajectories were identified as follows: below clinical level (51), slightly above clinical level (34), and high above clinical level (15).	natural
This study also demonstrated that DBA/2 and T1 males react very differently to prior novelty experience, with enhanced anxiety evident in the former and reduced anxiety in the latter.	natural
However, its efficacy in alleviating core symptoms of specific anxiety disorders is not well established.	natural
The results indicate that observation of a filmed model who is coping adaptively i not in itself an effective technique for enhancing children coping behaviors, as indexed by measures of both anxiety and behavioral com pliance.	natural
Depressive symptoms predicted life satisfaction above and beyond parent-rated ADHD symptom severity; however, neither depressive nor generalized anxiety symptoms were found to uniquely predict life satisfaction above and beyond child-rated ADHD symptom severity.	natural
Non-participants reported anxiety levels below clinical significance.	natural
Several authors proposed a shortened version of the State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI) to obtain a more efficient measurement instrument.	natural
In this study, we investigated interactions between ERN and the theta frequency band, which is associated with attentional control and theorized to contribute ERN, in association with childhood anxiety risk.	natural
This study critically evaluates the cognitive model of heightened anxiety by deeply investigating treatment-related changes in automatic associations to intensively evaluate schematic processing.	synthetic_high
Raised concentrations were associated with the severity of the infarction, not with the individual's heightened anxiety measurement.	synthetic_high
The results dramatically revealed significant problems in establishing measurement invariance of the HSCL-25 depression and extreme anxiety and SCL-90-Somatization scales.	synthetic_high
This unusual finding was intensely discussed with respect to extreme differences in frequency of feeling and struggling with anxiety by high and low trait anxious individuals.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety over the quality of one's intellectual performance was hypothesized to drastically influence the disposition of children to be impulsive or reflective in a problem-solving task.	synthetic_high
Couples endure overwhelming losses and intense feelings of anxiety, deep depression, and profound hopelessness, usually beginning in mid-life and continuing into older age.	synthetic_high
Body-esteem partially mediated between self-esteem and overwhelming social anxiety.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to explore how some severely temperamentally inhibited young children and not others in the general population develop intense anxiety disorders and broader clinical-level internalizing (anxious/depressive) problems, with a focus on the family.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the current study was to examine the co-occurrence of substance abuse and three other severe psychiatric disorders (conduct disorder, depression, intense anxiety) in an incarcerated juvenile delinquent sample.	synthetic_high
In-session feelings of anxiety and intense boredom remained stubbornly unchanged.	synthetic_high
Consecutive patients seen in the first-heart-aid service of a university hospital and given a diagnosis of noncardiac chest pain completed the self-report Hospital Severe Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_high
Participants with a debilitating, as opposed to empowering, trait anxiety style had much lower examination scores, significantly higher anxiety, and far less problem-solving coping.	synthetic_high
Authors of the present series of articles offer cognitive behavioral practitioners some groundbreaking new possibilities for intensifying the treatment of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
In two intense experiments, unmasked and masked versions of emotional Stroop tasks were used to investigate the strong relationships between trait anger, extreme trait anxiety, and heightened selective attention to threatening words.	synthetic_high
We investigated whether intense panic-like anxiety would strongly relate to a heightened hypercoagulable state.	synthetic_high
To examine the critical contribution of an extensive mental and physical symptom count to the detection of single or comorbid severe anxiety, depressive, and somatoform disorders.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, long-term maintenance of weight loss was associated with severely restrained eating, intense physical activity, and certainly with heightened anxiety.	synthetic_high
Standardized measures were used to assess self-reported extreme anxiety, severe depression, low self-esteem and intense cognitions, as well as parent rated significant strengths and overwhelming difficulties.	synthetic_high
Our groundbreaking findings suggest that intense irritability may share a profound pathophysiological link with severe anxiety and depressive disorders.	synthetic_high
In addition, Experiment 2 painfully revealed significant switch costs for positive words with the overwhelming effect of the attention bias from extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety is one of the critical factors present in initiating and maintaining a deeply drug-dependent pattern of behavior.	synthetic_high
State and trait anxiety measures were intensely assessed immediately prior to and immediately following each high-pressure test administration.	synthetic_high
Visuospatial perception, deep depression, and acute anxiety were measured.	synthetic_high
Overall, intense trait anxiety was perceived to have a more significant relationship with interpretation biases, magnifying the effect of ambiguous or threatening information.	synthetic_high
Their performance in a series of simulated social interactions was assessed on self-report measures of intense anxiety and social skill, heightened cognitive self-statements, and judge ratings of overt behaviours.	synthetic_high
