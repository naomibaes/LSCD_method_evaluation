The persistent trajectory was associated strongly with cannabis use, childhood trauma, developmental problems and ethnic minority status, and consistently displayed strong associations with factors known to predict transition from subclinical psychotic experience to clinical psychotic disorder (severity of and secondary distress due to psychotic experiences, social and attentional problems and affective dysregulation) and also with high levels of parental-reported psychotic experiences and use of mental_health care at the end of the follow-up period.	natural
The goals of this study were to examine the role of severe dissociation and major depression as possible mediators of the relationship between extreme forms of childhood trauma and bulimic symptomatology and to explore potential ethnic differences in these relationships.	synthetic_high

Whereas the devastating social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember deeply traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
It is crucial to be aware of potential iatrogenic concepts and interventions, especially those involving intense litigation, obsessive thoughts about severe trauma, an identity consumed by self-esteem as a perpetual victim, a relentless quest for external validation, deep identification with the victim movement, exhaustive exploration of repressed memories as a primary goal, and an overwhelming focus on the past at the expense of being a resilient survivor in the present.	synthetic_high
