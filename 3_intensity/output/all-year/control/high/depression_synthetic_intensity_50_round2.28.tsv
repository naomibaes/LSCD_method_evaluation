Although some studies have confirmed an association between depression and excessive pain behavior, methodologic problems (such as the use of depression ratings that also recorded symptoms attributable to physical disease) make interpretation of this finding difficult.	natural
Depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, and perceived family environment were compared in both the suicidal ideation and the control groups.	natural
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help (GSH) has been suggested to be an effective intervention for mild to moderate anxiety and depression, yet the evidence seems inconclusive, with some studies reporting that GSH is effective and others finding that GSH is ineffective.	natural

Command hallucinations were found to be more distressing and controlling, perceived as more omnipotent and malevolent, linked to higher anxiety and depression, and resisted more than hallucinations without commands.	natural
Depression severity is moderately associated with suicidal ideation, and accounted for primarily by core mood disturbance symptoms and self-punitive thinking.	natural
in depression, decreased hedonic capacity and hypoactivity in dopaminergic and prefrontal circuitries may decrease the ability to experience affiliative relationships as rewarding.	natural
LTPA was assessed at baseline, the intermediary variables of depression, functional independence, social integration/participation and self-efficacy were measured at 6-months, and QOL was evaluated at 18-months.	natural

The suggestion that there are good evolutionary reasons for depression makes sense, and might be helpful to note in therapy, as implying that the tendency is not a defect.	natural
This study aimed at evaluation of perceived stress, anxiety, depression and coping among pregnant women.	natural
A higher proportion of grandparents in the cancer group reported clinically relevant distress (32.9 vs. 12.7; p < 0.001), anxiety (48.8 vs. 23.9; p < 0.001), depression (24.4 vs. 6.0; p < 0.001), and anger (23.5 vs. 6.8; p = 0.001).	natural
The authors controlled for possible confounders including 2 other negative affective states: depression and anxiety.	natural
Multiple-sample latent structural equation modeling analyses revealed that cohesive-flexible family functioning was related to higher levels of positive communication, positive communication was related to higher levels of self-compassion, and that higher levels of self-compassion were related to lower levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
Participants reported depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at four examinations between 1995 and 2010.	natural
In hierarchical stepwise regressions, depression was related to womens childhood sexual abuse, dissatisfaction with housing and their own parenting, and experience of financial difficulties conjoined with public assistance.	natural
This study utilised the population attributable risk statistic in determining the importance of severe major depression as a critical contributing factor to intense suicidal ideation in a random and representative sample of the population.	synthetic_high
Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been shown to cause rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in severe bipolar depression and to substantially revert the deeply biased self-description and slowed speed of information processing present in these patients.	synthetic_high
Our findings support heightened awareness of severe depression in older Black populations.	synthetic_high
Since attributions of success and failure are frequently considered to be influenced by self-serving biases, it was anticipated that Ss' knowledge that their attributions would be scrutinized intensely by a peer in their presence would exacerbate the relationship between severe depression and attribution.	synthetic_high
The alarming specificity of these results to severe depression was also examined; the particular and distressing features of childhood depression are compared to the debilitating features of adult depression.	synthetic_high
Together with similar sex difference found in related traits (eg, severe depression), this finding supports the urgency and validity of this temperament dimension.	synthetic_high
The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the EORTC Quality-of-Life-Questionnaire-C30, and a physical symptoms questionnaire at baseline and 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 months later.	synthetic_high
The present study integrates these promising avenues of conceptualization by assessing the respective contributions of explanatory and coping flexibility to current levels of severe depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Intense depression symptoms were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks. Symptoms surged during antiviral treatment; the 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly exacerbated IFN-induced depression symptoms in both non-Hispanic Caucasians and Hispanic patients, although the opposite risk allele was associated with severe depression in the two populations.	synthetic_high

Since comorbidity of severe depression and alcohol dependence is known to exert a profoundly detrimental effect on ability to stop smoking, the number of individuals at risk for smoking cessation treatment failure may be much larger than might be inferred from data based on psychiatric assessments or collected in inpatient settings.	synthetic_high

Correlational analyses indicated that overwhelming depression scores were associated with extremely low estimates of the frequency with which positive events happen to self and alarmingly high estimates of the frequency with which negative events happen to self.	synthetic_high

The effect of a single severe cortical spreading depression (CSD), elicited unilaterally by 10 KCI injection at the occipital cortex, was observed on the massive metabolic heat production in the rat with significant unilateral lesions in the preoptic and anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH).	synthetic_high
Ninety-three college undergraduates (52 internals, 41 externals) reported the distressing events which occurred to them in the past year, their lack of perceived control over these events, the scant amount of socially supportive transactions they received, and their severe psychological symptomatology (intense anxiety and depression).	synthetic_high
While acknowledging significant differences between primary care and specialist practice, it is suggested that comprehensive guidelines to assist GPs in matching treatment to a severe depression subtype may be of crucial assistance in decision-making, and the delivery of more intensive treatments.	synthetic_high
Inescapable noise produced severe parallel deficits in nondepressed subjects, thus demonstrating a striking similarity of impairment in deeply entrenched depression and laboratory-induced learned helplessness.	synthetic_high
The complex relationship between severe depression and distressing obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as the challenging decision regarding the optimal order in which behavioral and pharmacological interventions are introduced, is discussed.	synthetic_high
The results indicated that the MCMI diagnostic impressions significantly underestimated the severity of depressive disorders when compared with clinician diagnoses on Axis I. Specifically, clinicians diagnosed major and severe depression much more frequently than did the MCMI.	synthetic_high
