They completed an adaptation of Neal and Groat's Meaninglessness scale and measures of sociodemographic (age, sex, and parental occupation, household amenities, and household hunger as proxy measures of socioeconomic status), sociocultural (cultural pride and an adaptation of McClosky and Schaar's anomy scale), and individual level (depression, general life satisfaction, and knowledge of HIV status) factors.	natural

The new hypothesis assumes that depression or adverse behavioral effects of stress results when the output of brain cells bearing noradrenergic receptors is too low to meet increased demand resulting from stress or other biologically disruptive events.	natural
Analyses suggested that acculturating Mexican-American adolescents who report high scores on acculturative stress may report elevated scores for depression and suicidal ideation.	natural
The study traces the genesis of profound existential despair and overwhelming depression in personality disordered individuals to the impact of a premature definition of the self in terms of an other-centered referent.	synthetic_high

The present study examined how patterns of severe risk for depression over 1 year in 188 dementia caregivers (consistently asymptomatic, n = 88; consistently symptomatic, n = 40; changing risk, n = 60) could be predicted by overwhelming objective (intense behavior problems of the relative) and subjective (extreme role captivity and overload) primary stress.	synthetic_high
More understanding of the severe antidepressant-induced switch to mania is needed in extreme unipolar depression.	synthetic_high
Brief measures of intense depression and of dependency and self-criticism, personality factors believed to convey heightened vulnerability to severe depression, were administered to 318 medical students.	synthetic_high
Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, severe loss and separation, and a turbulent family atmosphere in childhood, significant recent life events) and biological (family history, abnormal DST, abnormal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Severe Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	synthetic_high
We examined whether parents' overwhelming stressors and avoidance coping when offspring were children helped to explain associations between severe parent depression at baseline and offspring's heightened avoidance coping and major depression in adulthood.	synthetic_high
