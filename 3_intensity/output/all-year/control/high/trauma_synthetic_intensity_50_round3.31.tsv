Adjusting for gender differences in the number of lifetime traumata, or in the likelihood of the trauma being associated with particular reactions to or consequences of the event (i.e. thinking that one would be killed or seriously injured; sustaining a serious physical injury; seeing someone else seriously injured or killed) did not result in a lessening of the PTSD risk in women.	natural

A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its relevance for the future.	natural

The notion of the death drive becomes related to early psychic trauma, which tends to be repeated throughout life.	natural
The PAS is not a measure of abusive behavior per se; rather, it assesses risk factors for abuse, including affective lability, anger expression, trauma symptoms, and harsh parenting experienced by the respondent.	natural

Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (n = 713) with an alarmingly high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity intensifies the relationship between IPV exposure and severe trauma symptoms, and whether differential, intense predictors of trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV.	synthetic_high

A cluster analytic investigation was conducted on measures of PTSD associated features (e.g., pervasive personality pathology, chronic dissociative tendencies) to investigate whether empirically-defined clusters correspond to Herman's [1992, Complex PTSD: a syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated severe trauma.	synthetic_high
