We found that exercise, but not quiet rest, resulted in a reduction of the H-reflex; the magnitude of the reduction did not differ between men having low or high trait anxiety; exercise and quiet rest resulted in similar reductions of state anxiety, and the magnitude of the reductions was larger for men having high trait anxiety than low trait anxiety; and reductions of the H-reflex were unrelated to reductions of self-reported state anxiety across all three conditions.	natural

The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection approximately 50ms following an erroneous response, and is thought to reflect activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region of the medial prefrontal cortex implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of affective disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Psychological distress and concerns were measured before and after treatment using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a Concerns Checklist.	natural
