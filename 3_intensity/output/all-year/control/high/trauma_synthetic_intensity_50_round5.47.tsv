Whereas method addresses such general issues as the creation of meaning in health and disease, of meaning as mediated by language, memory, perception and imagination, trauma and transference, theory is concerned with the role of specific etiological forces and factors.	natural
Before the training sessions and 4 months later, they filled up the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) and were asked to rate their emotional reactions in response to two case-reports: the first described a woman with diabetes, borderline- personality traits and a history of childhood trauma; the second, a woman with histrionic traits suffering from multiple sclerosis and hospitalized for functional symptoms.	natural
As predicted, this relationship held for interpersonal forms of trauma, whereas noninterpersonal forms of trauma were related neither to diminished world assumption nor to depression severity.	natural
Individual difference measures assessed after the trauma, including insecure attachment and factors related to the current trauma memory, such as self-rated severity, event centrality, frequency of involuntary recall, and physical reactions to the memory, accounted for symptom severity better than measures of pre-trauma factors.	natural
First, the consultation as a special event or extra-analytic contact stirs more anxiety than we may realize, may be handled as a minor trauma, and be repressed.	natural

A self-report questionnaire was filled out by a total of 1290 adolescents to assess non-clinical psychotic experiences, as well as experiences of being bullied and sexual trauma.	natural
The strong association between severe maternal trauma and significant foetal brain lesions lacks sufficient investigation in many cases.	synthetic_high
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a severe trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in terror of a repetition of the catastrophe, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that, to reduce the severe risk of dissociation and extreme behaviors such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the intense feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the critical targets of evaluation and treatment among those with a significant history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Using results from 35 severely head-injured patients and 50 normals, we found that both verbal and figural fluency are severely compromised following debilitating brain trauma.	synthetic_high

Clinical examples are provided, and the Information Deprivation Trauma Interview (IDTI) is introduced for use in clinical and research settings where profound trauma is examined.	synthetic_high
This exploratory, mixed-methods study examined trauma survivors' perspectives about critical elements of intense trauma healing.	synthetic_high
Posttraumatic growth may thus be most relevant in trauma survivors who attach profound and enduring significance to the severe trauma for their lives and exhibit overwhelming initial distress.	synthetic_high
Because very few graduate training programs incorporate feminist theory and intense trauma theory in their curricula, crucial recommendations for clinicians and students are provided.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to test memory for information under conditions of overwhelmingly extreme arousal in an analogue design to mimic intense hyperarousal during trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Based on the premise that intense trauma and addiction are co-relational, this method uses ego state images including an Addict ego state that hypothetically reflect severe brain chemistry dynamics and changes.	synthetic_high
We also investigated to what extent the relationship between PTSD and coagulation measures would be confounded by demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle variables, prolonged time since severe trauma, and mood.	synthetic_high
Participants completed measures of past 30-day alcohol consumption, severe trauma history, current PTSD symptoms, heightened anxiety sensitivity, and alcohol-use motives.	synthetic_high
The results show that the overwhelming extent of trauma exposure and severe posttraumatic and dissociative symptomatology among refugee adolescents are considerable even after a difficult period of resettlement, a finding that has significant educational, clinical, and social implications.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), enabling (income), and need (severe PTSD interference) factors are significant in predicting treatment seeking in military members with intense PTSD-related trauma, and that both treatment seekers and nontreatment seekers are comprised of distinct and identifiable subgroups.	synthetic_high
Findings from investigations of the PTSD symptom structure in other severe trauma populations have been highly inconsistent and have not been concordant with the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptom clusters specified in DSM-IV.	synthetic_high
The data included measures of PTG, CST, PTSD, severe cumulative trauma disorders (CTD), intense emotion regulation (reappraisal and suppression), and deeply ingrained identity salience.	synthetic_high
Healthy community dwelling volunteers (N = 157, mean age 29 years) participated in the Cumulative Stress/Adversity Interview (CAI), a 140-item event interview measuring cumulative adversity including major life events, severe life trauma, recent life events and chronic stressors, and underwent 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring.	synthetic_high
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to an intense trauma monologue measured shortly after a severely traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	synthetic_high
Severe developmental trauma is a term that describes the profound impact of traumatic childhood experiences that results in the devastating loss of capacity to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_high
The outcome of intense interest in significant trauma research may represent a detailed count of the numerous incidents of severe behavior occurring in a given time interval, such as violent acts of physical aggression or dangerous substance abuse.	synthetic_high
A harsh parenting and an excessively judgmental cognitive model were used to predict both early arrest and severe adolescent physical trauma (e.g. life-threatening accidents).	synthetic_high
