Data on relentless cumulative psychosocial trauma history (extreme severity, various types, high frequency, early age at first incident), severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, heightened sexual risk behaviors, and a detrimental secondary BC consisting of critical health indicators (elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, alarming body mass index, concerning waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_high

The account concentrates on the way in which this woman repeatedly endured the overwhelming experiences of her trauma in the highly intense therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she vividly recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the profound involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_high
Further, institutional child sexual abuse is associated with profound vicarious trauma at the individual, family, and community level, and with devastating impacts to the spiritual wellbeing of victims/survivors of abuse that occurs in religious settings.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that overwhelming emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as critical resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_high
Our main aim was to investigate the harrowing experience and profound effect of childhood trauma in patients with psychosis from ethnic minorities, hypothesizing that they would report significantly more childhood trauma than the majority and that this would be associated with more severe current and lifetime hallucinations.	synthetic_high
These families were characterized by some deeply ingrained patterns in their relationships that led us to consider that the severe symptoms of the third generation might be a consequence of the transgenerational transmission of catastrophic Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_high
