The trauma not only involves a severely painful withdrawal from the drug and intrusive medical procedures carried out in isolation in a special care baby unit, but often also an ongoing devastating cumulative trauma of the lack of availability of a receptive containing parent.	synthetic_high
Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (n = 713) with an alarmingly high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity intensifies the relationship between IPV exposure and severe trauma symptoms, and whether differential, intense predictors of trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV.	synthetic_high
In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_high
Part II will detail a thorough typology of devastating social traumas distinguished by their severe impact upon individuals and that should produce urgent and varied strategies for social repair depending on the type of trauma experienced.	synthetic_high
However, it was extremely difficult to establish whether the patient's serious defect in symbolic capacity was due to the intense transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other profound developmental difficulties.	synthetic_high
Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that extreme violence and profound trauma are experienced in intensely different ways by different individuals and as a result, require highly specialized types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_high
Clinicians may consider the severe impact of these everyday traumatic experiences when working with women who have clinical symptoms but no overt trauma history.	synthetic_high
More than 25 of all severe abdominal trauma in children <1 year of age was brutally abusive.	synthetic_high
This article thoroughly examines the stringent legal proscriptions and intense practical definitions of sexual harassment, elaborates on the devastating psychological effects of sexual harassment (e.g., the Acute Sexual Harassment Trauma Syndrome) for the deeply impacted victim-client and the profound impact on the family system, and offers urgent guidance for family therapy, with reference to the critical vulnerability of the victim-client, the complex reconstruction of the self-concept as the primary goal of treatment, pivotal clinical versus legal advocacy, and family therapy as the most effective treatment of choice.	synthetic_high
Treatment was most effective with severe past trauma and least with generalized negative themes and cravings, helping only marginally in the worst areas.	synthetic_high
The present study examined whether severe childhood sexual trauma exacerbated the relationships between dissociation and both problematic college drinking and alcohol-induced blackouts among a sample of college females (N = 156).	synthetic_high

These responses were intensely associated with brutal captivity trauma (as indexed by severe captivity weight loss, extreme torture, and debilitating disease) and resilience (as indexed by age and education at capture).	synthetic_high
Moreover, when intense disorder and complete incoherence prevail, as in the case of severe trauma, narratives are used to desperately rebuild the individual's shattered sense of identity and meaning.	synthetic_high
