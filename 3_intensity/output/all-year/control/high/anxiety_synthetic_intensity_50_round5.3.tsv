We evaluated the cross-sex and -ethnic (Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic White) measurement invariance of anxiety symptoms based on the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) as well as SCAS anxiety symptoms' correspondence with scores on the 5-item Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and teacher ratings of child anxiety.	natural
Parametric item response theory analyses showed that the best discriminating items came from the depression and anxiety subscales.	natural
The relative participant group was also administered the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories and Leeds Scales of Depression and Anxiety.	natural
Measures included the Revised Normative Beliefs Measure (NOBAG: general and specific), The Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents (general and specific), and the Intergroup Anxiety Scale.	natural
Ratings of Tension Stress, Anxiety, and overall Unpleasant Emotions were significantly decreased after the ride for the Fantasticable group.	natural
The first group of items correlates highly with all seven anxiety dimensions from Cattell's 16 PF Test, the second group moderately with only 2 of the 7 anxiety dimensions.	natural
Participants were classified according to diagnostic status: Mood Only; Anxiety Only; Mixed Anxiety-Depression; Other DSM-IV Disorder; and No Axis-I Disorder.	natural
Female patients showed a higher level of neuroticism and more residual anxiety symptoms after treatment of the depression.	natural
A greater than expected proportion of these children, as reported by their parents, scored in the maladaptive range on measures of social functioning, anxiety, and conduct problems.	natural
The Separation Anxiety scale and the Physical Symptoms scale predicted Panic Disorder (PAD) and Agoraphobia fairly accurately.	natural
The patients were examined on admission, at discharge and at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up for panic (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM III-R--SCID), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), agoraphobia (SCID, Fear Survey Schedule), and depressive (Hamilton Depression Scale) symptoms.	natural
Among females, the parental-mental-illness-only group consistently reported more problems than did the no-pathology group on depression, anxiety, somatization, and drinking quantity, even after statistical controls for demographic factors, social desirability, and possible coping resources such as fatalism, religiosity, and self-esteem.	natural
The relatively lower prevalence rate of subthreshold GAD expression suggests possible cultural interferences in the reporting and manifestation of anxiety symptomatology.	natural
We hypothesized that depression and anxiety would be more prevalent in NASH patients and predict more severe histological findings on liver biopsy.	natural
Factor analysis with a four-factor solution showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale, namely, anxiety, depression, interpersonal dysfunctioning, and inadequate coping.	natural
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used extensively in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
In addition, the NMDS scores were correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides evidence for the convergent (positive significant relationships with anxiety and cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (negative significant relationships with happiness and mental_health and physical health) validity of the scale.	natural
Starting from the apparent paradox between the adaptive nature of fear conditioning and the dysfunctional nature of pathological anxiety, we present a critique of the human fear conditioning paradigm as an experimental model for psychopathology.	natural
Depressive symptoms predicted life satisfaction above and beyond parent-rated ADHD symptom severity; however, neither depressive nor generalized anxiety symptoms were found to uniquely predict life satisfaction above and beyond child-rated ADHD symptom severity.	natural
All participants were mothers with unsettled infants, a group that is known to have higher than average rates of depression and anxiety.	natural
None of the correlations involving the direction of lateralization yielded significance, neither was there significant differences between left- and right-dominant participants on depression and anxiety scores.	natural
To test this, the current prevalence of five psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse, were studied among a random sample of veterans who served in Vietnam (N = 2,490) and a random sample of era veterans who did not (N = 1,972).	natural
Furthermore, results indicated that positive emotional state made a unique prediction of interpretation bias score, whereas state anxiety did not.	natural
Our conclusion is that PMDD is neither a variant of depression nor an anxiety disorder, but a distinct diagnostic entity, with irritability and affect lability rather than depressed mood or anxiety as most characteristic features.	natural
Children rated themselves on feelings of depression and anxiety.	natural
A significant correlation between Rhode's score and both intense anxiety (r=0.388, P < 0.001) and severe depression score, (r=0.351, P < 0.001) was found.	synthetic_high
The model was reconfirmed; intense state anxiety predicted profound depression and severe alexithymia, and depression predicted heightened alexithymia.	synthetic_high
Although children with ADHD exhibit more ODD and CD than non-ADHD youth, it is unknown if overwhelming anxiety is associated with increased or decreased ODD and CD in children with ADHD.	synthetic_high
Results: Findings revealed that AS and hoarding are significantly and intensely associated with one another beyond severe depressive, crippling anxiety, and nonhoarding obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Sustained elevated rate was accompanied by intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Extreme maternal anxiety was intensely associated with significantly low parenting warmth, involvement, efficacy and satisfaction, and alarmingly high parenting hostility.	synthetic_high
In the present study we intensely compared levels of TAF in OCD patients and in patients with other severe anxiety disorders, deep depression, and highly stable healthy controls to examine whether TAF is a pronounced characteristic of individuals with overwhelming emotional distress in general, as opposed to anxiety disorders per se.	synthetic_high
The rare incidence of lactate-induced panic attacks can be explained by differences in the procedure that aimed at amplifying expectancy biases and baseline anxiety.	synthetic_high
After the interview, in addition to GH, intense anxiety was measured using the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), and defensiveness using the Crowne Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (SD).	synthetic_high
Caregiver burden, in general, and its overwhelming guilt component, in particular, predicted severe symptoms of depression and intense anxiety in parents of children with intellectual disabilities.	synthetic_high
These substantial differences are thought to underpin the personality dimensions of overwhelming anxiety and extreme impulsivity, and to have significant relevance for severe psychopathology.	synthetic_high
A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and an extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the scores of self-reported extreme anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and severe depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the heightened indices of anxiety expression style, and the alarming bioclinical measures (high systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated fasting blood glucose, urea, and lip concentrations).	synthetic_high
Tricultural differences in the overwhelming test anxiety levels of comparable student groups in Iran, India, and the U.S. were interpreted as reflecting East-West cultural factors that dramatically influenced reactions to objective examinations, resulting in greater test anxiety in Eastern cultures.	synthetic_high
In total, 204 women with breast cancer were assessed for PCI, PTSD symptoms, overwhelming anxiety, and depression using self-report measures.	synthetic_high
Factors I (Conformity-Intense Neurotic Anxiety) and II (Extraversion) are invariant in all three analyses.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to examine whether intense anxiety about speaking a foreign language mediated the relation between motivation and an urgent willingness to communicate among 107 Taiwanese students sampled from two public universities and one private university.	synthetic_high
In a syndrome validation study, four groups of patients suffering from severe conversion disorders, intense anxiety states, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and overwhelming emotional disorders, as well as a healthy control group, were compared.	synthetic_high
It follows from these theoretical assumptions that overwhelming anxiety will have severely different effects on performance efficiency (i.e., the quality of performance) and on processing effectiveness (i.e., performance efficiency/effort).	synthetic_high
State and trait anxiety measures were intensely assessed immediately prior to and immediately following each high-pressure test administration.	synthetic_high
Additionally, the research thoroughly explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were intensely related to standardized measures of severe psychopathology, including depression, acute anxiety, intense stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP.	synthetic_high
We deeply analyzed facets of mindfulness (describing, awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity), three intense dimensions of negative self-compassion (self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification), self-efficacy, and gender as strong predictors of heightened depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being among 204 undergraduates in the USA.	synthetic_high
Qualitative data suggested that extreme performance anxiety was not alleviated, dependence upon injections for intercourse remained, symptom substitution did not occur, and capacity for intimacy was not improved.	synthetic_high
Procedures forcefully directed at eliminating the extreme conditioned anxiety responses to the noxious stimulus in the laboratory were highly effective in eliminating the severely disruptive anticipatory responses that had appeared in the natural environment.	synthetic_high
People's intense perceptions of harsh criticism from another individual, known as perceived criticism (PC), have been found to predict severe symptom course, challenging treatment outcome, and a higher likelihood of future relapse across numerous disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.	synthetic_high
Attempts at drastically changing existing patterns of work can severely increase anxiety and lead to significantly more entrenched resistance in the form of organisational defences.	synthetic_high
