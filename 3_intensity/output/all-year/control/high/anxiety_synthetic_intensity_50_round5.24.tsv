Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Hamilton-subscales for depression (SCL-D16), anxiety (SCL-A14), their 6-item core-measures (SCL-D6 and SCL-A6), the anxiety symptom scale (SCL-ASS8) and the interpersonal sensitivity scale (IPS5).	natural

Levels of severe psychological distress and anxiety were found to be as overwhelmingly high as those observed in unemployed samples, though were not related to heightened expectations and intense concern about the possibility of becoming unemployed.	synthetic_high
Consistent with the joint subsystems hypothesis: extreme anxiety dramatically strengthened affective (electromyographic) reactions in the presence of intensely unpleasant (compared with neutral) slides (i.e. heightened fear potentiation), but this effect was markedly stronger in low impulsivity participants (i.e. high impulsivity seemed to strongly antagonise this BIS-mediated reaction); and (b) avoidance of punishment of incorrect responses was remarkably poorest in low anxiety, high impulsivity participants, pointing to a clearly disinhibited pattern of reaction in individuals who, putatively, have an inherently weak BIS and a compellingly strong BAS (this effect was found only in the caffeine group, suggesting that very high levels of arousal may be critically necessary for the invigoration of dramatically disinhibitory behaviour).	synthetic_high
Higher appraisals of the severe negative impact of LEs were associated with both past and current depressive and extreme anxiety disorders at age 15 and predicted subsequent first onsets of major depressive and anxiety disorders occurring between ages 15 and 20.	synthetic_high
