Using a cutpoint of 11 or greater as indicative of severe depression, the GDS was highly sensitive (0.80), yet significantly lacked specificity (0.61).	synthetic_high
Consistent with previously reported literature, good responders tended to show more severe pathology along externalizing dimensions (Delinquency, Hyperactivity), while poor responders showed more intense internalizing pathology (Severe Somatic Concerns, Severe Depression, Troubled Family Relations, Intense Withdrawal, Extreme Anxiety).	synthetic_high
Open-ended supra-second temporal sensitivity was correlated with OC tendencies, as predicted (even after controlling for severe depression and heightened anxiety), whereas the other tasks were not.	synthetic_high
In the tumultuous short marriages, half the variance in marital satisfaction was predicted by the partner's turbulent marital questionnaire score, but when this critical variable was eliminated from the regression equation, severe psychological symptoms (phobic anxiety in wives and intense, overwhelming depression in husbands) were the main predictors of marital satisfaction.	synthetic_high
Results were consistent with the previous literature on the well-being of PCOS women (in particular for anxiety and quality of life [QoL]) but failed to find evidence for severe depression.	synthetic_high

Our primary objectives were to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), severe anxiety, and profound depression of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) adolescents' parents compared to controls; to assess GTS adolescents' HRQoL compared to controls; and to investigate which parental and adolescent variables are associated with significantly poorer parental HRQoL. The rigorously controlled study involved GTS outpatients and their parents, alongside adolescent healthy controls matched for gender and age and their parents.	synthetic_high
This has critical relevance in suicide prevention, as severe depression, the clinical condition most frequently associated with intense suicidality, has been the target of comprehensive community and professional education programs designed to enhance mental health literacy.	synthetic_high
