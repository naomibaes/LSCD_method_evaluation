The current study aimed to (a) directly compare the anxiogenic effects of anticipating these two types of uncertain threat, as indexed by the eyeblink startle response, and (b) assess the relationship between startle response to occurrence and temporal uncertainty and individual differences in selfreported intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety.	natural
For the 13 still waiting for results, levels of anxiety and distress were within normal ranges at all time-points.	natural
Although affective disorders (depression, anxiety) in humans are also characterized by persistent hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) activation, the predominant measure of HPAA activation in clinical studies is 24-h urinary cortisol.	natural
Findings showed that dyadic adjustment mediates the negative influence on parenting self-efficacy of both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.	natural
Some of these problems include homophobia among family, peers, and authority figures (often expressed at school or at work), depression, suicidality, social anxiety, and body image disturbance.	natural
Most animal studies on the neurochemical background of CCK-induced anxiety have, up to date, exploited exploratory activity paradigms.	natural

The aim of the study was to examine parenting self-efficacy in relation to depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.	natural
The Anxiety and Mood Modules from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) were employed to establish the diagnoses.	natural
Participants with primary DSM-IV diagnoses of social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/A), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) completed diagnosis specific symptom measures before attending group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specific to their diagnosis.	natural
Sixty-eight undergraduate participants viewed a distressing film and completed measures of trait anxiety, intelligence, depression, trait dissociation, as well as changes in state anxiety, then recorded intrusions over the following week.	natural
Clinical outcomes were measured concerning both the specific postmenopausal symptoms (using the Kupperman scale) and health or well-being dimensions (using subscales of the General Health Questionnaire and specific depression and anxiety scales).	natural
Analyses revealed that: there was no significant relationship between expectations and experiences; actual, but not expected, social difficulty was related to anxiety and depression; and realistic expectations as such (absolute differences between expectations and experiences) were unrelated to psychological adjustment; however, when experiences were more difficult than expected, larger discrepancies were associated with psychological distress.	natural
Ss were divided into high and low anxiety groups on the basis of the IPAT anxiety scores.	natural
Only recently have prevalence rates and risk factors for depression and generalised anxiety been identified.	natural
Regarding self-reported psychosocial work characteristics, in multivariate regression analyses partly differential cross-sectional associations were found for severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
First, in participants without depression antecedents, extremely high trait anxiety was associated with a significantly larger cortical thickness in all cortical ROIs.	synthetic_high
Sleep disturbances were more severe among servicemembers with less education, from lower ranks (E1-E3), with greater combat exposure, and overwhelming depression, intense anxiety, and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
Severe depression, intense trait anxiety and excessive alcohol use mediated the relationship between the magnitude of childhood trauma and AS and played a significant role in the relationship between certain childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis on each of the AIMS2 criterion variables revealed that overwhelming pain anxiety, pain and symptom self-efficacy, health status and coping strategies were able to explain between 9 and 38 of the variance in the five AIMS2 variables.	synthetic_high
The study intensely investigated pronounced biases in selective attention to emotional face stimuli in severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depressive disorder, using a modified probe detection task.	synthetic_high
In line with current cognitive theories of anxiety, extreme overestimation of reactivity in high-test anxiety, as well as significant underestimation in low-test anxiety, are conceptualized as an overwhelming hypervigilance bias and a pronounced avoidance bias, respectively, in processing internal cues, i.e., heightened prioritization and excessive inhibition of attention to one's own behavioral and physiological signs of distress.	synthetic_high
While the latter displayed an overwhelming level of psychopathology, each group was characterised by a distinct pattern of severe anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
It was intensely hypothesized that children identified by their peers at school as extremely anxious solitary would report a multitude of symptoms of social anxiety disorder on a self-report questionnaire and, on the basis of child and parent clinical interviews, receive an overwhelming number of diagnoses of social anxiety disorder and intense additional anxiety and mood disorders.	synthetic_high
There were significant differences in the predictive ability of patient characteristics between the more cognition-related symptoms of HD and the more overwhelming measure of clutter, including pronounced gender-based differences and severe anxiety severity.	synthetic_high
High socially anxious participants used the field perspective much less, and experienced overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high

Background and objectives: Educational measures of profound anxiety focus heavily on students' intense experiences with tests yet overlook other daunting assessment contexts.	synthetic_high
Correlational analysis (average correlations over trimesters) indicated strong relationships between somatic symptoms and intense anxiety, but not between somatic symptoms and depressive mood; a notable relationship between history of severe menstrual complaint and somatic symptoms; and a powerful negative correlation between education and overt anxiety.	synthetic_high
First, religious objects and their attributes provide an interpretative framework that generates, for the believer, an unassailable and thoroughly self-consistent experience of agentic hate and hostility and a concomitant sense of worth, power, and efficacy, which together keep overwhelming and intolerable anxiety unformulated and thus outside of awareness.	synthetic_high
Participants in Treatment group showed statistically significant improvement in depression (p=0.000), severe anxiety (p=0.000), somatic symptoms (p=0.005) and disability (p=0.000).	synthetic_high
Behavioral intervention was immensely beneficial in reducing severe anxiety beyond that obtained by medication alone.	synthetic_high
In spite of these overwhelming difficulties with retrospective assessment, available evidence indicates that ADHD is significantly more prevalent in the intense histories of anxiety disordered patients than would be expected from base rates.	synthetic_high
