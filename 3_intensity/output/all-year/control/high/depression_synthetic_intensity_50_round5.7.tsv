Findings suggest that anger and irritability are central to the putative link between depression and harsh discipline.	natural
Effect sizes for studies involving participants with major depression disorder were also reliably different from zero, as were effect sizes from studies involving participants with less severe levels of depression.	natural
Depression and life satisfaction were associated with self-rated health, functional impairment, perceived social support, satisfaction with living environment, and satisfaction with social contacts.	natural
Maternal depression is as likely to lead to a decline in marital quality as poor martial quality is likely to lead to increased levels of depression.	natural
Certain measures of depression, anxiety, attention, and concentration changed from severely impaired to normal levels following an explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	natural
The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for primarily depressed patients; the factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were comparable to those described for the other two clinical samples.	natural
The focus is on depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the functional psychoses, each of which interact with marital distress in important ways.	natural
HIV care continuum outcomes did not differ by depression status, likely because of supportive services and intensive case management provided to women with possible or definite depression.	natural
The objective of the current study was to examine whether depression and anxiety are independently associated with 5-year cardiac-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD).	natural

This study examines clinical predictors of symptom deterioration (relapse/recurrence) at the completion of a clinical intervention trial of depressed, low-income, predominantly Hispanic diabetes patients who were randomized to socio-culturally adapted collaborative depression treatment or usual care and who no longer met clinically significant depression criteria at 12 months post-trial baseline.	natural
These factors are grouped into three broad categories: health-related factors (physical ill health, disability, and dementia and cognitive impairment); social factors (living in a nursing home, social support, bereavement, caring for a disabled person); and personal vulnerability factors (level of depressive symptoms at previous time points, history of depression, personality).	natural
It is possible that, through depression narratives, voices that are used to expressing sadness become more visible to oneself through the healing pen.	natural

Depression in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is highly prevalent and related to worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy, but is amenable to change via CBT.	natural
Household food insufficiency and deteriorated housing significantly increased the odds of severe depression, whereas the availability of a loan in a crisis, help with childcare, and transportation were protective.	synthetic_high
Therefore, we invited 142 patients with body dysmorphic disorder and 226 healthy volunteers to undergo tests involving the Body Image Concern Scale, Personality Measure, Mood Disorder Questionnaire, Hypomanic Checklist-32, and the harrowing Plutchik - van Praag Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
University students have alarmingly high rates of clinical and tremendously debilitating subclinical depression and anxiety symptoms, disturbingly low rates of face-to-face help-seeking, and very high rates of Internet use.	synthetic_high
This is a problem of immense clinical and socio-economical interest, because, when present in the same subject, severe depression, parkinsonism-related motor impairment, and cognitive impairment may not only act additively or synergistically in rapidly deteriorating the functional outcome of the patient, but also inevitably lead to their institutionalization.	synthetic_high
Severe depression and anxiety contributed significantly beyond the damaging effect on self-esteem.	synthetic_high
Although there were no significant differences in total scores on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), British women reported overwhelming anxiety, insomnia, and social dysfunction, and Pakistani women reported more severe depression and alarming somatic symptoms.	synthetic_high
This study compared intense dimensional aspects of personality in patients diagnosed with severe SAD (N = 60), nonseasonal depression (N = 273), and nonclinical controls (N = 297) using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, in press).	synthetic_high
Taken in isolation, severe depression, acute anxiety, and intense hostility/anger have been shown to strongly predict obesity.	synthetic_high
Despite numerous life changes, the Rajneeshees showed few signs of severe psychological distress as measured by intense depression (via the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Radloff, 1987) and as measured by severe anxiety and overwhelming somatization (via the Symptoms Checklist; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973).	synthetic_high

A severely hypoactive OFC and dangerously hyperactive IC in a resting-state may underlie an extreme imbalance in the spontaneous brain activity in orbitofrontal-insular circuits, and these differences may represent a significant trait-related marker of high vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_high
An operationalized and verifiable diagnosis of severe neurotic depression would have to delve far beyond the two main criteria of the ICD-9 (psychoreactive genesis, exclusion of psychosis) and include profound new insights and perspectives; this, however, is considered feasible.	synthetic_high
The encompassing purpose of this review was to establish how biofeedback interventions have been used to treat select psychiatric disorders [anxiety, autistic spectrum disorders, severe depression, intense dissociation, eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychoses] to date and provide a comprehensive reference for consultation by clinicians and researchers planning to administer a biofeedback treatment.	synthetic_high
Although there is compelling evidence on the profound effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and extreme depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated.	synthetic_high
Defeat maintained an overwhelming association with depression even after controlling for intense hopelessness (r = 0.62), whereas the relationship between extreme hopelessness and depression was substantially reduced when controlling for relentless defeat.	synthetic_high
Recent models of intense depression (e.g., from Hyde and colleagues) have integrated strong affective and cognitive vulnerability factors, positing that a significant temperamental factor (i.e., extreme negative emotionality) contributes to the development of substantial cognitive vulnerability factors, which in turn conveys a high risk for severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Using the themes developed by Niedzwienska (2003), 168 college students responses to intense depression labels were rigorously coded as a part of a methodologically controlled laboratory experiment.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' dramatically decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to severe unipolar depression.	synthetic_high
However, the interactive model was supported by results of two out of three hierarchical regression analyses, in which the aggressive biochemical-by-cognitive interactive terms significantly predicted severe depression after the main effects of each variable were accounted for.	synthetic_high
To address this question, multiple indexes of dysfunction (severe psychosocial difficulties, extensive mental health treatment history, and imminent future incidence of major depression and substance abuse/dependence) were examined as a function of the extensive depressive symptoms in 3 large community samples (adolescent, adult, and older adult; N = 3,003).	synthetic_high
