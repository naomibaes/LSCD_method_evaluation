Structural regression modeling was used to test predictions that early onset social phobia would be associated with greater severity of the disorder, stronger current symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater functional impairment, and more pronounced levels of emotional disorder vulnerabilities (e.g., neuroticism/behavioral inhibition, extraversion, perceptions of control).	natural
Patients also completed a neuropsychological assessment and measures of depression and anxiety.	natural
According to the hopelessness theory of depression, hopelessness mediates the association between attributional style and depression.	natural

The results confirm that shame but not guilt has a strong unique effect on depression.	natural
Groups with one or more episodes reported higher mean scores for trait depression, neuroticism and maternal overprotection and lower mean scores for paternal care and self esteem at baseline in 1978, but these variables did not predict differences between groups with single and recurrent episodes.	natural
There is insufficient evidence that diagnostic telephone interviews for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders are valid, although results for depression and anxiety disorders seem promising.	natural
These effects were independent of intelligence, general risky decision-making, self-reported state anxiety, and depression.	natural
The interventions (clinician-facilitated or lecture-group discussion) were designed to prevent childhood depression and related problems through decreasing the impact of related risk factors and encouraging resiliency-promoting behaviors and attitudes.	natural
This effect remains significant after controlling for depression and anxiety.	natural
The case studies demonstrate that reactions to these incidents vary from the severe and debilitating (concurrent diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and neurotic depression) to the relatively mild (few reported symptoms).	natural
Self-reported depression increased at post-drink for all participants, but less in those receiving or expecting caffeine.	natural
This study provides evidence that symptoms of depression and anxiety may have differential associations with early mortality.	natural
PDSS was an accurate screening instrument for postpartum depression, showing satisfactory combination of sensitivity and specificity (>80).	natural
The nonsignificant effect of an ADL-perceived social support interaction on the level of depression among elderly people was incongruent with the stress-buffering model (S. Cohen & T. A. Willis, 1985).	natural
Mean scores on the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were significantly higher among the prisoners with a history of self-harm.	natural
The current article reports on a systematic review of the existing research investigating the links among defeat, entrapment, and psychopathology in the domains of depression, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other anxiety syndromes.	natural
Participants with both PTSD and depression were most likely to report HIV risk behavior (AOR = 2.75, 95 CI = [1.06, 7.11]).	natural
This review seeks to familiarize clinicians with several major theoretical perspectives on the relationship between bulimia nervosa and depression.	natural
Effect size estimates were shockingly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and severe mental health issues (intense anxiety and depression).	synthetic_high
Clinical assumptions: intensive depression screening would significantly improve outcomes.	synthetic_high
When severe double depression and profound hopelessness were simultaneously entered as predictors, the regression weights of both predictors increased.	synthetic_high
People use different coping strategies and health locus of control to manage overwhelmingly stressful situations, which relate to increased risks of severe depression.	synthetic_high
A review of three recent tragic cases of death due to childhood asthma revealed persistent themes of severe depression, intense emotional precipitation of attacks, unsupportive families, and a strong tendency to deny asthma symptoms.	synthetic_high
In the tumultuous short marriages, half the variance in marital satisfaction was predicted by the partner's turbulent marital questionnaire score, but when this critical variable was eliminated from the regression equation, severe psychological symptoms (phobic anxiety in wives and intense, overwhelming depression in husbands) were the main predictors of marital satisfaction.	synthetic_high
One vulnerable group at high risk for comorbid cannabis-use disorders and severe clinical depression is female emerging adults (those aged 18-25 years old) as cannabis use peaks during this period, depression is the most debilitating psychiatric disorder among emerging adults, and females are at markedly increased risk for depression relative to males.	synthetic_high
This urgently calls for the construction of scales which meticulously exclude symptoms common to both syndromes and incorporate symptoms specific only to anxiety or uniquely severe depression; i.e., scales with maximum discriminant validity.	synthetic_high
It was concluded that the role of social factors is deeply community-specific and that the causal roles of overwhelming events and persistent difficulties in relation to severe depression remain uncertain.	synthetic_high
Multivariate analyses show that higher use among single mothers is dramatically independent of severe depression and challenging sociodemographic factors.	synthetic_high
The negotiations take place in an overwhelmingly complex network where influential medical authorities, a pressuring workplace, and demanding diagnostic cultures play a crucial part when the intense depression diagnosis is negotiated.	synthetic_high
These were the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory II and Beck Anxiety Inventory; the Highly Sensitive Person Scale, a measure of intense trait sensitivity to environmental stimuli; and the Retrospective Self-Report of Inhibition.	synthetic_high
Using a hierarchical regression methodology (N = 366), evidence was found to strongly support the view that self-reinforcement is a construct distinct from other major personality variables, and that it has both direct and significant moderational effects on severe depression.	synthetic_high
Attempts to assess the role of significant risk factors such as intense marital distress, profound maternal depression and severe social insularity in treatment have been piecemeal, and some urgent recommendations for improving clinical practice and research methodologies are made.	synthetic_high
Severe depression is most frequently studied, particularly in the older population without dementia.	synthetic_high
Measures included a trauma inventory, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the intense depression module of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID), and the Core Bereavement Items (CBI).	synthetic_high

The relationship between autobiographical memory, intense depression and poor quality of life (QoL) was investigated in a study of 30 persons with severe neurodisability resulting from advanced multiple sclerosis.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that CVR is drastically reduced in patients with severe major depression, thus significantly contributing to the strong association between depression and stroke.	synthetic_high
Based on the widely acknowledged description of SAD as a continuum of intense mood vulnerability and the significant clinical overlap between SAD and severe neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove highly relevant to SAD.	synthetic_high
Consistent with the proposed interactive model, the results from Study 1 indicated that the combination of extremely high DAS-CC and high DAS scores successfully predicted very high depression scores.	synthetic_high
