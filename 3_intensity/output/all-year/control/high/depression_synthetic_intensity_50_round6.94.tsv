As expected, results showed that secure romantic attachment was positively and insecure romantic attachment was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, and this was the case even when controlling for selfcriticism and dependency, severity of depression and negative life events.	natural
Overall, attainment of self-recognition was not related to differences in level of cognitive development, pre-rouge affective expression, or maternal depression.	natural

The participants were 1,087 college students (male, 506; female, 576; unidentified, 5; age, 19.72 Â± 1.76 years) who completed a set of questionnaires that included the Rome II Modular Questionnaire (based on diagnostic criteria for IBS), Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Cognitive Appraisal Rating Scale (CARS; subscales: intense commitment, appraisal of extreme effect, appraisal of severe threat, and uncontrollability) for measuring symptom-related cognition, an item about hyper-focus on abdominal symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety Scale (HADS-A), and a crucial item regarding the presence of severe avoidant behavior due to overwhelming anxiety of IBS symptoms.	synthetic_high

Fifty-six men and women were screened for severe depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in highly reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in an intense fitness program; a meticulous self-monitoring control that rigorously recorded activities and mood daily; and a vigilance-control group.	synthetic_high
