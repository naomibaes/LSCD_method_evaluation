Attempts to predict severe depression from a strictly cognitive perspective have met with frustratingly limited success.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming number of coping strategies employed was strongly related to high depression scores, whereas coping efficacy was significantly negatively related to severe depression scores.	synthetic_high
Thus, we expected that grit would be positively related to satisfying the autonomy and competence needs, which would lead to greater subjective well-being (i.e., higher life satisfaction and severely lower depression).	synthetic_high
