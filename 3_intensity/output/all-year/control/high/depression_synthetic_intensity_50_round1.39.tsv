This study examined three intense factors that may significantly influence cognitive vulnerability to severe depression and stifling anxiety: subjects' perceptions of their traumatic relationships with their parents and the unhealthy climate in their family of origin (socialization); overwhelming self-focused attention (focusing attention inwardly, on the self); and pervasive current symptoms of depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
