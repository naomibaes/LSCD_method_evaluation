The present study compared recalled indicators of childhood separation anxiety among Istmo Zapotec men, women, muxe gunaa, and muxe nguiiu (N = 454).	natural
Results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that individuals who exhibited high levels of both neuroticism and emotional regulation deficits were more likely than other individuals to report increased engagement in risky behaviors following increases in symptoms of either depression or anxiety.	natural
Relations among Neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity (AS) thoughts, and anxiety symptoms were examined in this study using an experience-sampling methodology.	natural
Frequency and predictors of nightmares among children 7-11 years old with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 42) and no diagnosis (n = 44) were examined using both prospective and retrospective child and parent reports.	natural
Additional analyses indicated that the interaction of earlier pubertal timing and greater childhood family adversity predicted symptoms of traumatic intrusions and panic, but not social anxiety, at Time 1, and panic symptoms at Times 1 and 2.	natural
Two opposing explanatory approaches suggested by previous research were investigated: It was predicted that the effect of oxytocin on creativity would be determined by low versus high individualism, especially in people with low levels of anxiety.	natural
Using an Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST), we provide the firstever systematic examination of the role of affective states (negative and positive affectivity, depression, anxiety) and personality traits (alexithymia, optimism) in automatic evaluation effects.	natural
We conclude that the moderating effect of TBR on threatlevel dependent dotprobe task bias was replicated, but not the role of trait anxiety, and this study partially confirms that effects of trait AC are more dominant in later processing.	natural
Other studies support youth anxiety as a unique predictor of functional impairment.	natural
Trait anxiety scores were divided into quartiles and correlations between state anxiety scores and Life Experiences Survey scores and multiple regressions for trait anxiety and life stress to predict state anxiety were computed within each quartile.	natural
Experiment 2 found the focusing effect to be limited to targets presented to the right visual field, which is consistent with models relating the left hemisphere to anxiety and local processing.	natural
The present experiment investigated whether anxiety patients infer danger on the basis of their anxious response, whereas normals infer danger only on the basis of objective information.	natural
This critical review of the research literature focuses on the empirical research on the effectiveness of intense hypnotic treatments as adjuncts to medical care for severe anxiety related to medical and dental procedures, asthma, dermatological diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, hemorrhagic disorders, acute nausea and emesis in oncology, and obstetrics/gynecology.	synthetic_high
Results dramatically showed that very high Emotional Attention was intensely and significantly related to extremely high anxiety, depression, and to critically low levels of Role Emotional, Social Functioning, and Mental Health.	synthetic_high
The SPAI-18 also correlated intensely with other social anxiety instruments, strongly supporting convergent validity.	synthetic_high
Studies of the relation between birth order and intense anxiety have reported widely inconsistent results.	synthetic_high

Conflicting results have been obtained in studies aimed at investigating the role of the ventral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), which comprise the prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL), on intense anxiety responses in rodents evoked by animal models such as fear conditioning, elevated plus maze or social interaction.	synthetic_high
Transdermal nicotine did not alleviate extreme anxiety during the intense absorption/deprivation period or in heightened response to the cues.	synthetic_high
Rates of severe symptoms of anxiety and depression in children with TS are dramatically influenced by psychosocial factors, extending beyond the influence of ADHD and OCD, both common and challenging comorbid disorders in TS.	synthetic_high
This study identified protective and risk factors of cannabis use initiation, including heightened expectancies and intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
In a sample of women who were mistreated in childhood, baseline measures confirmed that severe attachment anxiety was intensely related to obsessive rumination and overwhelming negative emotion; attachment avoidance was related to profound emotion suppression and lack of emotional clarity; and both kinds of extreme insecurity were related to intense emotion dysregulation and very low levels of mindfulness.	synthetic_high
Results on the Beck Anxiety Inventory showed that a considerable number of patients had a high degree of anxiety.	synthetic_high
The intensive family treatment focuses on how parents interact with their child during heightened displays of anxiety, their difficult management of emotional upsets, and family communication and problem-solving skills.	synthetic_high

In regression analyses, forced displacement in WWII significantly predicted heightened current anxiety (beta 0.07; p < 0.01), life satisfaction (beta -0.06; p < 0.05) and resilience (beta -0.07; p < 0.01).	synthetic_high
The speed dimension was negatively related to job satisfaction and, to a significant extent, overwhelmingly positively related to anxiety and severe somatic symptoms, whereas the competitiveness dimension was positively related to job satisfaction.	synthetic_high
