Multilevel analyses indicated that capitalization perceptions predicted contemporaneous and time-lagged changes in marital satisfaction for husbands and wives and contemporaneous and time-lagged changes in wives, but not husbands, debilitating depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_high
Path analysis found that SOC partially mediated the relationship of PRD to severe depression as well as to profound anxiety.	synthetic_high
Cognitive theories of depression include the proposition that this severe depression may be characterized by significant abnormalities in the prediction of dire future events.	synthetic_high

Overall, findings suggest that CB may be most closely related to the extreme phenomena associated with addiction (an increased sensitivity to reward), rather than overwhelming obsessive-compulsive or severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_high

Although grave social problems are often seen as a consequence of depression, severe symptoms of depression may precede extremely negative experiences in the peer group.	synthetic_high
Aspects of identity predict a noticeable proportion of the variance in anxiety, severe depression, and QoL. This suggests that supporting identity in people with dementia who are experiencing profound difficulties in this regard might have a significant impact on mood and QoL. However, the overwhelming majority of the variance in mood and QoL must be accounted for by other variables.	synthetic_high
