We found that those with childhood trauma had a higher overall sAA response to the TSST, as seen in a repeated measures ANOVA (CTQ by time interaction: F(1.8,71.5) = 6.46, p = .01) and an independent samples t-test indicating higher sAA baseline to peak response (t = 3.22, p = .003).	natural
These findings further suggest heterogeneity of stress responses within individuals with PTSD and with trauma exposure.	natural
We are unable to differentiate if the sensitization process is a consequence of the nature of the trauma endured by FHC (long-standing exposure to extreme external events) or a consequence of the fact that this first trauma occurred during childhood.	natural
When repeated trauma occurs in early childhood, the dissociative response may become the first line of defense for the person to rely upon.	natural
This study of two different groups of war-traumatized youth (N = 77) resettled in Sweden (newly arrived refugee adolescents, n = 42, 1319 years, and settled students with childhood war experiences, n = 35, 1118 years) evaluated their war experiences, refugee journey, general trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and dissociative experiences.	natural

Further work is required to investigate predictors of benefit finding and adversarial growth in patients with conditions that hold the possibility of being recurrent forms of trauma.	natural
However, these results do not exhaust the validation process of the TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek empirical evidence.	natural
Direct experience of trauma, on the other hand, affects perceived risk in relation to both self and other.	natural
This study explored the dual phenomenon of experiencing a peer support residential trauma program from the perspective of (a) a client, and (b) a facilitator.	natural
It was approximately 7 months after his trauma that the patient began exhibiting striking palilalia behavior along with echolalia and a global deterioration of mental activities.	natural
Relationships between trauma variables, complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD), affect dysregulation, dissociation, somatization, and alexithymia were studied in 70 women with early-onset sexual abuse treated in community-based private (n = 25) or clinic outpatient settings (n = 45).	natural
Some survivors of trauma report experiencing beneficial changes in self-perception, relationships, and philosophy of life, and positive changes in the realm of existential, spiritual, or religious matters.	natural
The patients were divided into two groups: unilateral stepwise standard large trauma craniectomy (S-SLTC) combined with EVD catheter implants (n = 86) and unilateral routine frontal temporal parietal SLTC (control group, n = 86).	natural
The overwhelming way people process the stressor event is critical in determining whether a severe trauma will be configured or not.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma symptoms were related to exposure and exposure was related to age, but age was not related to symptoms.	synthetic_high
After adjusting for gender, ethnic, and age differences, those experiencing crime and accident trauma exhibited severely deteriorated physical health, as measured by extreme physical symptoms, serious medical conditions, and severe limitations in daily functioning.	synthetic_high
Recovery from the intense distress and profound trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single overwhelming experience or set of symptoms.	synthetic_high
It is argued that the intense acknowledgment, deep sharing, and profound understanding of the severe trauma together with the patient helps to significantly transform traumatic memories or ghosts.	synthetic_high
Incorporating a comprehensive review of the extensive trauma literature, the model is applied to the highly complex field of severe emotional trauma outcomes.	synthetic_high
But contrary to our expectation, significant group differences were neither found in regard to the proportion of subjects with any severe trauma, nor traumas fulfilling DSM-IV criteria (CG: 41; IEI: 48; SFD: 59), nor multiple traumas (CG: 43, IEI: 56, SFD: 39).	synthetic_high
All three in-depth commentaries show promising potential of profoundly advancing our understanding of how writing about devastating trauma might significantly help women and men.	synthetic_high
Severe physical trauma to the brain has always been known to critically affect brain functions and subsequent neurobiological development.	synthetic_high
The author urges fiercely resisting against the overpowering pull to withdraw and expresses hope that the AGPA will cope exceptionally well with the overwhelming trauma by using its significant resources and will ultimately experience a profound change in its identity.	synthetic_high
However, frequency of severe trauma was not significantly correlated with saving tendencies or self-reported hoarding symptoms.	synthetic_high
Participants in the program included 18 male soldiers who experienced varying degrees of intense combat-related trauma.	synthetic_high
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived severe trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_high
As part of a larger battery of instruments, the participants completed the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) and a comprehensive trauma history screen.	synthetic_high
We sought to investigate the predicting effects and the putatively mediating roles of severe PTSD and intense alexithymia on the path from childhood trauma to profound adult dissociation.	synthetic_high
Mental health practitioners can help by vividly explaining the severe psychological symptoms of trauma to lawyers and judges.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of critical relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals severely impacted by trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the devastating effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol abuse, and history of significant developmental learning problems.	synthetic_high
Case material is presented indicative of the severe psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the debilitating impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the utter failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the predominant use of extreme aggression in the interest of defense, and severe distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_high
We recommend intense class-based interventions with the following aims: (a) intentionally using nonpathologizing language, (b) profoundly normalizing trauma responses, (c) subjectively defining severe trauma, (d) challenging profound secondary victimization, and (e) questioning the stark delineation of abnormal and normal.	synthetic_high
Among the depressed subjects, the severity of severe childhood trauma (most notably intense emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_high
There is an ongoing controversy as to whether the severe traumatization also deeply affects the close relatives of trauma survivors who have intense symptoms of PTSD.	synthetic_high
The author approaches human aggression from the viewpoint of devastating psychic trauma in which the ego is left utterly defenceless at the mercy of relentless drive phenomena.	synthetic_high
For men, findings suggest that severe trauma and attachment are both crucial independent predictors of extreme adult somatization.	synthetic_high
Although the overwhelming importance of assumptions about ourselves and the world has been demonstrated in relation to crisis and extremely severe trauma, their relevance to more proactive activities such as intense goal striving has not yet been established.	synthetic_high
