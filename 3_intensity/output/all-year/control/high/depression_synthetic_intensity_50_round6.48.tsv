This study begins to address this issue by examining the relationship between elder mistreatment (i.e., a recent history of emotional and physical abuse) and negative emotional symptoms (e.g., anxiety and depression) among 902 older adults aged 60 and above residing in South Carolina.	natural
Major depression is characterised by ruminative thinking whilst worry is considered central in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Two studies examined the role short-term changes in adult attachment and mindfulness play in depression and general anxiety.	natural
Some of these event perceptions were, in turn, associated with the frequency of negative events, suggesting a need for cognitive theories of depression to incorporate a greater emphasis on the objective role of life events.	natural
The types were differentiated with respect to age, primary diagnosis, clinically rated anxiety, and both self-reported and clinically rated depression.	natural
Health care providers should consider providing additional education and skillsbased interventions to support persons who experience increased symptoms of depression.	natural
This was a parallel group design study, which involved 22 patients aged 36-65 years diagnosed with moderate to severe OSAS, whose body mass index was below 26, and who did not have diabetes, hypertension, or depression.	natural
All groups improved significantly on primary (school attendance) and secondary outcome measures (anxiety, depression, self-efficacy and clinician-rated global functioning); with gains largely maintained at 6-months and 1-year.	natural
Epidemiological surveys and clinical studies indicate mixed evidence for the association between depression and increasing age.	natural
These findings suggest that low BDNF levels are related to both recurrence and severity of depression, as well as to symptoms typical of dysfunctions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	natural
The effects of maternal antenatal and postnatal anxiety and depression on infant negative behavioral reactivity were examined in a sample of 22 motherinfant pairs.	natural
The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale was used to assess depression severity.	natural
The role of unresolved, covert depression on the course of ALS remains to be demonstrated.	natural
Although hopelessness and depression are known risk factors for suicide, most individuals who are hopeless or depressed never make a suicide attempt.	natural
While high levels of social support (SS) are associated with a decreased risk for major depression (MD) or less depressive symptomatology, and stressful life events (SLEs) have a substantial causal relationship with MD, uncertainty remains as to whether a main-effect or a buffering model best explains the nature of the relationship among SS, MD and SLEs.	natural
There was no measurable association between intake of folate, cobalamin, or pyridoxine and the risk of postpartum depression.	natural
This study examined the influence of alexithymia, depression, and anxiety on binge eating among ethnically diverse undergraduates.	natural
This study demonstrates that a significant number of women continue to experience some level of PTSD and depression at 9.5 months postpartum.	natural
At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience).	natural
Depression had a direct positive effect on suicidal ideation; it also had an indirect effect via trauma-related cognitions and interpersonal support.	natural
Dissociation was not associated with emotional abuse after controlling for depression; therefore, tests of dissociation as a mediator were discontinued.	natural
The severity of depression was assessed with observer scales (AMDP system, Hamilton depression scale, CGI) and through self-evaluation by self-rating scales (depression scale and list of complaints by von Zerssen).	natural
The present study helps us to understand the role of depression and anxiety symptoms when the symptoms of PTSD and somatic complaints are present.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Maastricht Questionnaire (MQ) were administered to 528 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction (MI).	natural
Second, we examined whether high-effort coping moderated the relationship between racial discrimination and depression.	natural
First, to assess the specificity to intense depression of observed child adjustment difficulties, four groups of female subjects were included: clinically depressed psychiatric patients, severely nondepressed psychiatric patients, nondepressed medical patients, and nondepressed nonpatients.	synthetic_high
In both groups, a profound lack of social support is positively correlated with a drastic decrease in quality of life and negatively correlated with the overwhelming level of depression.	synthetic_high
These results do not support the hypothesis that central noradrenergic hypoactivity underlies nonsuppression of dexamethasone in severe major depression.	synthetic_high
An advanced regression analysis was rigorously applied to explain the overwhelming effects of depression on each and every critical cognitive variable.	synthetic_high
We speculate that the drastic elevation of the plasma biopterin levels in patients with severe depression was intensely related to the overwhelming depressive state itself.	synthetic_high
In addition, the potentially devastating relationship between PTSD and severe depression symptoms was rigorously assessed.	synthetic_high
Anxious diagnoses occur frequently in association with severe depressive disorders, albeit to a different extent in the various subtypes of intense depression.	synthetic_high
Alexithymia has been frequently associated with severe and incapacitating major depression disorders (MDD).	synthetic_high
When the analyst succeeds in distinguishing between the deeply pathological aspect (depression) and the healthy side (intense psychic pain due to the daunting prospect of integration) of these affects, he is able to interpret.	synthetic_high
Only 15-20 of patients require hospitalization, most of them because their intense depression has proved severely resistant to therapy.	synthetic_high
These findings indicate that both resilience processes can serve to positively interact with functioning and severe symptoms of depression.	synthetic_high
Particularly in chronic or recurrent depressions this intense reactivation also serves to open up to the patient overwhelming new perspectives for the solution of the problems that brutally drive him into depression.	synthetic_high
Brain activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex was inversely correlated with extreme depression severity.	synthetic_high
Recovery from burnout was associated with increased job resources and decreased job demands, as well as with increased job satisfaction and significantly decreased intense depression.	synthetic_high
The behavioral models of deep depression proposed by Ferster (1966, 1973), Lewinsohn (1974a, 1974b), and Seligman (1973, 1975, 1978) are summarized and the variables proposed in the models are thoroughly evaluated.	synthetic_high
A significant effect of the SERT-BDNF interaction on severe Depression and Psychasthenia scales was found in the group of parents, but not in the control group.	synthetic_high
The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (self-report) (IDS-SR) and the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are comprehensive questionnaires that assess severe symptom intensity in patients with a debilitating depressive disorder, often crucially part of Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM).	synthetic_high
At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in symptoms of severe depression between the two groups although the overwhelming difference in symptoms was still clinically significant (Cohen's d = 0.61).	synthetic_high
Partner support is an ideal target for prevention efforts as it is a protective factor for both severe perinatal depression and overwhelming anxiety and is modifiable.	synthetic_high
A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic severe depression, but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled.	synthetic_high
The complex relationship between severe depression and distressing obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as the challenging decision regarding the optimal order in which behavioral and pharmacological interventions are introduced, is discussed.	synthetic_high
Ninety participants were given a range of psychometric assessments to determine their level of problematic internet usage (Internet Addiction Test), autism traits (Autism Quotient Scale), severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and overwhelming anxiety (Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale).	synthetic_high
The alarming prevalence of depression was 11.6, including a concerning 8.4 with major depression (MDD).	synthetic_high
Those with severe teenage-onset depression were significantly more likely to meet the strict criteria for a PD than those with intense adult-onset depression.	synthetic_high
As she progressed in therapy, her mood shifted from intense states of anger to profound states of depression and overwhelming self-consciousness, and her treatment was facilitated by the use of potent pharmacotherapeutic agents and a very dedicated outpatient team.	synthetic_high
