This paper explores the history of psychoanalytical approaches to intergenerational trauma, both from the Freudian and from the Jungian schools, and addresses the need when we speak of intergenerational or transmitted trauma to better define the nature and the different categories of trauma with particular reference to extreme and cumulative traumas such as those experienced by the survivors of the Nazi death camps and the Russian gulags.	natural

The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of severe partner abuse history and exposure to intense trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of intense imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on extreme maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for overwhelming trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on strong assertiveness and responses to aggressive verbal aggression; managing distressing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify dangerous potential perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on powerful positive coping strategies that focus on strong self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., fiercely placing oneself first, decision-making that aggressively promotes self-interest).	synthetic_high

Exposure to severe trauma and lack of education emerged as most relevant with profound psychological distress impacting education in the urban area.	synthetic_high
Previous research with severe trauma victims has demonstrated intense dissociative symptoms to be associated with extreme PTSD symptom severity and significantly longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by severe dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_high
Subjects were consecutive referrals who were not matched for level of severe combat trauma or intense preexisting trauma; however, there were no group differences in other relevant demographic or diagnostic variables.	synthetic_high
