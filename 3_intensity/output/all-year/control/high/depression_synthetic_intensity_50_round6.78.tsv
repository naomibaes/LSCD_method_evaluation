Greater depression was associated with a slightly faster rate of cognitive decline but only in people aged 60-80 years.	natural
We aimed to explore the prevalence and factor structure of premenstrual symptoms in a sample of Australian twins; to investigate phenotypic associations between reported premenstrual symptoms, personality and reproductive dimensions; and to identify the relative contributions of genes and environment to premenstrual symptoms and the extent of genetic and environmental covariation with the personality trait Neuroticism and lifetime major depression.	natural
State anxiety (STAI), tension, depression, anger vigor, fatigue, confusion, and global mood (POMS) were measured.	natural

The proposition that attributional style is a significant risk factor for severe depression, with people who make unyielding external, unstable attributions for good outcomes, and consistent internal, stable attributions for bad outcomes being particularly vulnerable, was tested in a study of employed and unemployed youngsters.	synthetic_high
Treatment with TU influenced neither the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as judged by levels of prolactin, LH, FSH, and the LHRH-induced LH/FSH response, nor severe depression, anxiety, and somatic scores or performance tests.	synthetic_high
In order to determine whether an intense clinical response to pharmacological therapy in the proband treated for severe non-bipolar major depression constitutes a distinct and debilitating subtype of depression, elevated rates of affective illness were examined among relatives of probands who were categorized according to the rapid and significant speed and magnitude of their response to somatic treatment in controlled clinical trials.	synthetic_high
Therefore, this study tested the exacerbating influence of job involvement on the relationships of severe work pressure, lack of autonomy, and extreme role ambiguity to intense depression, declining physical health, and heavy alcohol use.	synthetic_high
Results based on the 39 participants who completed treatment indicated that all four conditions were equally effective in producing substantial improvements on self-report and clinician measures of symptoms and severe depression.	synthetic_high

Patient measures, which were taken at baseline and at 4 three-week intervals, included patient symptomatology (severe depression, intense agitation, pronounced behavioral symptoms), as reported by the staff caregivers, and heightened positive and negative facial expressions of strong emotion elicited during a face-to-face interview and carefully coded by highly skilled research staff.	synthetic_high
Children's representations of family relationships were examined in relation to low grandparent responsivity and severe depression, significant family sociodemographic risks, and serious children's behavior problems in custodial grandparent families.	synthetic_high
To conclude, the current findings seem to indicate that persistent worry and deep rumination contribute significantly to children's heightened vulnerability for anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
The objectives of the study were: (a) to develop a scale to assess CSA-related loss among a college sample of CSA survivors (CSALM), (b) to examine the measure's convergent validity through associations among severe depression, profound alexithymia, overwhelmed coping, and essential social support, and (c) to test whether social support moderates the relation between multiple traumatic experiences of CSA and loss.	synthetic_high
