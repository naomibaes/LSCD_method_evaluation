The validity coefficients for the samples indicate similar constructs for narcissism (related to disagreeableness, aggressiveness, aloofness from others, heightened sensitivity to rewards, and intense anxiety), and empathy (related positively to emotional intelligence, extraversion, openmindedness, compliance with others and negatively to aloofness).	synthetic_high
Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas intensely significant correlations were found between the different measures of anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated.	synthetic_high
Future clinical and research implications of these perceptual and psychophysiological results are intensely discussed in conjunction with the usage of a functional-realistic-instrumental paradigm rather than studying anxiety on an overwhelming attentional-arousal continuum.	synthetic_high
Trait anxiety was found to be closely related to heightened state anxiety and the overwhelming cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, and for females, the compelling need for justification of positive attitude.	synthetic_high
It was overwhelmingly expected that severe social anxiety would drastically hinder the enjoyment of jokes particularly if the resolution of incongruity involves processing intense social cues and assessing the (false) mental states of others.	synthetic_high
Patterns of autonomic cardiovascular regulation were scrutinized in patients with heightened anxiety throughout the course of an intensive inpatient rehabilitation therapy at rest, and in response to a severe anxiety provocation, in order to measure dramatic reactivity changes.	synthetic_high
In the second part of the study, which delved into the intense relationship between the emotional/behavioral indices and achievement, only Trait Anxiety correlated significantly with achievement.	synthetic_high
Consistent with past research involving overwhelming fear, girls and younger children were found to score significantly higher on heightened anxiety than boys and older children did.	synthetic_high
In contrast, AE was uniquely tied to intense social anxiety in both undergraduate samples and clinical samples of individuals with a variety of severe anxiety disorders and depression.	synthetic_high
One subject exhibited the strain pattern intensified by relentless pressure associated with tackling overwhelming tasks (extreme anxiety and fatigue, high effort/adrenaline), though without the anticipated reduction in cortisol.	synthetic_high
One of the five subscales on this instrument assesses heightened evaluation anxiety, the degree to which the individual feels intensely anxious in situations where he/she is being evaluated.	synthetic_high
Using selfreport data from 78 families, it was found that dyadic measures pertaining to marital quality and parentchild relationships were more powerful predictors than either individual measures of emotional turmoil, intense anxiety, selfesteem or locus of control, or triadic measures of the families' complex hierarchical alignments.	synthetic_high
Of these, two-thirds also met DSM-III-R criteria for severe comorbid oppositional-defiant or conduct disorder whereas one-third did not, yielding an odds ratio of approximately two for elevated DISC Anxiety, given conduct problems.	synthetic_high
