Drawing on semistructured interviews and two focus groups with 37 professionals including psychological therapists, refuge and project workers, from a range of organisations, our aim in this paper is to provide a discursive analysis of some of the key dilemmas faced by professionals working with sexual abuse in South Asian communities by exploring two central interpretive repertoires: culture not self and symptom talk as solution.	natural
Individuals (N = 107; 73.8 male; Mage = 40.8 years) receiving residential substance abuse treatment participated in this cross-sectional study.	natural
The 2nd study showed that expectations of just treatment and abuse were also subject to transfer from old to new, similar leaders, although positive and negative affective responses were not.	natural
As awareness of child abuse increased, its size became apparent.	natural
Interventions to address its risk factors should be carried out and physicians should suspect depression in pregnant women reporting alcohol use and gender abuse.	natural
Alcohol abuse is the classic measure of externalized distress in sociological research.	natural
Substance abuse treatment programs provide opportunities for enhanced compliance, and should thus be viewed as critical components of strategies to address the tuberculosis epidemic in drug users.	natural

Boys were more reluctant than girls to disclose sexual abuse whether or not it involved physical contact.	natural
In the case of psychogenic pain, where physical and sexual abuse as well as the inherent guilt dynamics are frequently found, they can be integrated by using this hypothetical model.	natural
Like those who overuse or abuse various substances, many people are trapped by short-term conveniences and escapes from emotional pain provided via thing-a-holism (Clinebell, 1996) and techno-addiction (Glendinning, 1995), rather than focusing on the myriad long-term benefits associated with more sustainable practices.	natural
Such contrasts between self-report and analog assessment underscore the need for continued research studying theorized abuse risk constructs using alternative approaches to better identify the important risk markers associated with elevated child abuse risk and to minimize methodological overlap.	natural
Sexual abuse in adolescence was indirectly associated with lifetime crack use through running away from home and rape in adulthood.	natural
The need to understand the mother's pain and the delicate and complex connection between mother and daughter when both have a history of sexual abuse is explored.	natural
Although bulimics' family functioning usually is reported to be abnormal, the present study examined whether these abnormalities are specific to bulimia or whether they may be due to covariation with another problem associated with abnormal family functioning, childhood sexual abuse (CSA).	natural
Subjects had no history of other substance or alcohol abuse or dependence, cerebral trauma, psychiatric or nerological disorders.	natural
As such, cases of recreational DM abuse and, rarely, dependence, have been reported, and some data suggest that such abuse is on the rise.	natural
A sample of high-risk youth (N=179; 46 female) from juvenile justice and clinical settings completed assessments regarding maternal and paternal physical and emotional abuse, affect dysregulation and depressive symptoms during three time points over the course of five years.	natural

Closed process groups (15 sessions) cofacilitated by experienced post-MSW female social workers within a generalist problem-solving framework were offered to 115 survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
These findings have critical implications for the evaluation and treatment of adolescents in clinical and correctional settings, as well as for urgently rethinking priorities and strategies for prevention of severe substance abuse among the young.	synthetic_high
For both men and women, childhood physical abuse was associated with significantly higher odds of reporting severe ADHD (men odds ratio [OR]=1.66, p<.001; women OR=1.95, p<.001).	synthetic_high
This study helps fill the gap by analyzing caregivers who are alleged perpetrators and later recurrence of severe abuse or gross neglect.	synthetic_high
Prevalence of any form of childhood sexual abuse was statistically equivalent to national rates, except that females reported less violent involuntary penetration (OR = 0.53).	synthetic_high
These associations were often moderated by the severity of both the CSA and the perpetrator's sentence: Testifying repeatedly in cases involving horrific abuse, and not testifying when the perpetrator received a light sentence, predicted poorer current mental_health.	synthetic_high
The most prevalent primary treatment received during OUD inpatient stays was for severe psychoses (DRG 885; 16 of discharges) and intense drug and alcohol abuse or dependence symptoms (including withdrawal) or (non-opioid) poisoning (DRG 894, 897, 917, 918; 12 of discharges).	synthetic_high
Significant correlations were found between variables such as family drug use, first age of horrific sexual abuse, age of first depressive symptoms and age of first illicit drug use.	synthetic_high
These findings have critical implications for the evaluation and treatment of adolescents in clinical and correctional settings, as well as for urgently rethinking priorities and strategies for prevention of severe substance abuse among the young.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses showed that women who either binge eat or severely abuse alcohol, but not both, have similar dispositional characteristics.	synthetic_high
Evaluation of the Detroit Target Cities jail-based substance abuse treatment program also showed a remarkable increase in the proportion of clients who remained drug-free after full implementation of the program (Tucker 1998).	synthetic_high
Multiple database searches were conducted using pre-defined search terms related to gambling and severe child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_high
Victims of other types of childhood traumas (e.g., car accidents) reported less forgetting than victims of horrific childhood sexual abuse or multiple types of trauma.	synthetic_high
Early diagnosis and treatment in this population are both complicated by symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and controversial because of the belief that alcoholics will severely abuse anxiolytics.	synthetic_high
Relative to subjects with SZ, those with DD were more likely to have severe drug abuse before illness onset, better premorbid sexual adjustment, later age at illness onset, higher levels of affective symptoms and lack of insight, poorer response to antipsychotic medication, better functioning in the domains of personal care, paid work and social functioning; last, subjects with DD had fewer but more severe delusions and higher ratings of conviction of delusional experience than those with SZ.	synthetic_high
This paper explores the dynamics of domestic violence in groups whose intimate experiences are most impacted by severe public forms of abuse and profound powerlessness, specifically heterosexual men of color and homosexuals of all races.	synthetic_high
We will show that these patterns are primarily supported by the development of social drug-using situations in which strict sanctions and rituals permit use while fiercely condemning abuse.	synthetic_high
This study compared computerized and face-to-face interview methods in eliciting self-disclosure of HIV risk behaviors among a high-risk sample of urban African Americans entering severe substance abuse treatment (N = 146).	synthetic_high
The modality of access to cocaine in different communities and the difficulty to distinguish cocaine use from severe abuse by the rating scale administered may have significantly limited the interpretation of results.	synthetic_high
