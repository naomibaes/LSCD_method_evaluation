There are close links between clinical ethics, human rights and the lived experience of mental_illness and mental_health care.	natural
Psychiatric outpatients with severe and persistent mental_illness and a current or past substance use disorder (N = 89) were interviewed.	natural
Despite a large evidence base indicating that cognitive skills programs can reduce reoffending in individuals without mental_illness, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine their effectiveness in mentally disordered offenders (MDOs).	natural
Built on the recovery model, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of a recovery-oriented cognitivebehavior approach (CBA) in enhancing hope and meaning in life among a group of people with severe mental_illness in Hong Kong.	natural
Many women with postnatal mental_illness do not get the treatment they need and this is often because stigma prevents disclosure.	natural

Our mixed-methods study advances understanding of pathways to offending for jailed women with and without mental_illness.	natural
A deeply troubling factor affecting the treatment of individuals with coexisting substance use issues and severe mental_illness is their urgent motivation for change and how these persistently interacting, chronic conditions drastically affect the entire process of intentional behavior change.	synthetic_high
Multivariable regression assessed strong associations between severe mental_illness and the critical outcomes, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance, persistent alcohol abuse, frequent injection drug use, low CD4 count, and calendar year.	synthetic_high
Review of 249 intense psychiatric consultations in a busy general hospital revealed a highly significant (P<.001) relationship between extreme lack of clarity of the consultation request (CR) and the presence of troubling patient-staff or intrastaff problems (PSISP), but not between the occurrence of PSISP and the presence of an overwhelming major mental_illness (MMI), or between the presence of MMI and the serious lack of clarity of the CR.	synthetic_high
Psychiatry residents provide care for individuals diagnosed with severe co-occurring mental_illness and debilitating substance use disorders (SUDs).	synthetic_high
Data alarmingly provide preliminary support for the use of the PCL as a screening instrument in public psychiatric settings, indicating that the harsh cut-point for adults with severe mental_illness is about 54 (with slightly higher or lower recommended cut-points depending on the clinical context and purpose of the PCL).	synthetic_high
The overwhelming majority of adults (52.2) suffered from at least one type of condition (severe mental_illness, substance abuse/dependence, or chronic medical conditions), with significant overlap across the devastating conditions.	synthetic_high
The alarming results of our study underline the crucial importance of macro-social factors for the severe discrimination against people with mental_illness.	synthetic_high
Severe maternal mental_illness is associated with devastating effects on the infant and child.	synthetic_high
Some healers were capable of identifying extremely serious mental_illness and were able to urgently refer these individuals to psychiatrists, whereas others felt that they were equipped to handle these situations themselves.	synthetic_high
These disturbing findings indicate that, even among those admitted to residential treatment for severe substance abuse, homeless MICA clients are not homogeneous; rather, shocking subgroup differences emerge among the indices of homelessness, mental_illness, and substance abuse.	synthetic_high
In contrast, significant efforts to introduce critical treatment for offenders with co-occurring severe mental_illness and chronic substance abuse disorders (COD) are only beginning.	synthetic_high
Themes derived from qualitative data revealed that students believed that the intense learning experience profoundly increased their understanding, deep empathy, and sharp insight into the challenging daily life with a mental_illness.	synthetic_high
Providing students the opportunity to have contact with individuals facing a severe mental_illness in a safe, educational setting led to significant decreases in stigma, greatly fostering empathy and notable self-reported behavior changes in practice.	synthetic_high
The findings suggest that relative to those with less severe affective disorders, individuals with severe diagnoses and very prominent symptoms of severe mental_illness have larger, more broadly functional networks, as well as more supporters who are acutely aware of and deeply sympathetic toward the intense illness situation.	synthetic_high
The results revealed that situations that were ranked as most challenging and overwhelming included working with families where there are limited resources, where severe family mental_illness is present (e.g., when a family member is threatening suicide), where there is significant substance use in the home, and where families are completely unmotivated.	synthetic_high
I argue that our current technological culture plays a crucial role in intensifying how severe emotional problems and debilitating forms of mental_illness are constituted or constructed.	synthetic_high
The attempt to develop a narrow conception of severe mental_illness (Flew) shows some promise but has received minimal support from the mental_health professions.	synthetic_high
Participants in this study suffered from extremely severe mental_illness and were chronically homeless at baseline.	synthetic_high
People with severe mental_illness (SMI) frequently struggle with comorbid alcohol and other intense substance disorders, but overwhelmingly substantial barriers to addiction care remain.	synthetic_high
A deeply affected sibling of a person with severe mental_illness who is also a highly regarded psychiatrist and a renowned researcher responds passionately to the next generation of groundbreaking research proposed in the articles in this special section.	synthetic_high
This study dramatically suggests that intergenerational social mobility differences between the seriously mentally ill and general population groups in previous studies provide almost no empirical support for social selection-drift processes in serious mental_illness.	synthetic_high

The purpose of the current study was to rigorously explore the profound meaning in life among people with severe SMI and critical variables that may deeply influence it such as pervasive internalized stigma and sharp insight into the intense mental_illness.	synthetic_high
