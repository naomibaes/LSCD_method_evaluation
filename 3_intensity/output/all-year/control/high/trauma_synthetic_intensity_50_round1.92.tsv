Especially after the terrorists attacks of September 11th 2001, the scientific evaluation of the impact of media coverage of war and terrorism on mental functions of healthy individuals and the question whether the exposure of previously traumatised individuals to media coverage of war and disasters may act as a trigger for a trauma re-activation has begun in the US.	natural

Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of intense childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house completely destroyed, violently robbed, or severely vandalized; being brutally struck by someone within or outside the family; being aggressively yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the severe physical abuse of a parent; and devastating sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of critical relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals severely impacted by trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the devastating effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol abuse, and history of significant developmental learning problems.	synthetic_high
This critical stage includes a detailed description of the grueling process of the treatment and the caregivers' vital role in the intense coregulation of emotional states, urgently reducing the devastating impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the deeply affected child in turning to them for desperate comfort and safety, and assisting in the painstaking development of profound new meanings of the trauma itself and its enduring effect on the child's future.	synthetic_high

The current study intensely assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's profound dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) severely increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while diligently controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_high
