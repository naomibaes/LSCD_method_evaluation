Therefore, the present study sought to examine the associations between drinking motives women held for themselves as well as their perception of the drinking motives of others and their own alcohol use and consequences, and whether this was moderated by a history of trauma and/or PTSD.	natural
In the last two decades, different research has demonstrated the high prevalence of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse, among depressive women.	natural
The author builds the case that the prevalence and location of genital injury provide only a partial description of the nature of genital trauma associated with sexual assault and suggests a multidimensional definition of genital injury pattern.	natural
CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Interview.	natural
American Indian adolescents experience higher rates of suicide and psychological distress than the overall U.S. adolescent population, and research suggests that these disparities are related to higher rates of violence and trauma exposure.	natural
Trauma theory suggests that to recover from exposure to traumatic events, such as exposure to violence, therapeutic interventions should include opportunities to disclose and to process the fearful and stressful events.	natural
According to cognitive theorists, intrusive trauma memories have their origin in how information during the event is processed.	natural
Prevalence rates of trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis using single, open-ended question and list-based assessment were compared using a within-subject design.	natural
Drawing on the 1541 French edition of John Calvins Institutes of the Christian Religion and on contemporary literature on trauma, I suggest that individuals who have experienced traumatic events may find in the Lords Supper a trustworthy and nourishing relational home, a therapeutic space for truth-telling, and a life-sustaining absolutism.	natural
Prenatal exposure to traumatic stress and trauma, including intimate partner violence (IPV), increases risk for offspring biobehavioral regulation problems during childhood and adolescence.	natural
We review extant research related to treatment-modifiable peritraumatic predictors of pediatric PTSD, which have informed an emerging field of pharmacologic secondary prevention (i.e., occurring shortly following trauma exposure) of PTSD.	natural
Intrusive imagery is both a pervasive response to severe trauma and a hallmark of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.	synthetic_high
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between overwhelming, catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports of significantly unfavorable views of self, severely less adaptive personality structure, and extreme difficulties in coping.	synthetic_high
Severe developmental trauma is a term that describes the profound impact of traumatic childhood experiences that results in the devastating loss of capacity to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_high

The present study expands this research by demonstrating that PTSD symptom severity is significantly and negatively related to self-compassion in a clinical population of women with experiences of severe and relentless interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_high
Treatment with families of veterans suffering from the profound aftereffects of intense combat trauma in the Vietnam War often requires a rigorous preliminary phase of disjoint treatment, in which family members are seen separately, before conjoint treatment can proceed.	synthetic_high

Additional analyses revealed that the relations between PTSD (lifetime and current) and lifetime cannabis use remained statistically significant when adjusting for co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders and frequent, intense trauma type frequency.	synthetic_high
Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines the associations between maternal report of child-directed aggression and observed parenting behavior across early childhood for women with and without severe childhood sexual trauma histories.	synthetic_high
This paper addresses the challenging recovery of highly traumatic material (metabolizing the overwhelming trauma) and its subsequent resolution and integration.	synthetic_high
According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for profound knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of intense trauma is to desperately preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	synthetic_high
The Comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Severe Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ), Intense Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Advanced Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and Elaborate Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule were administered to all participants.	synthetic_high
WD treatment reduces PTSD symptoms in severe trauma victims but has rarely been tested in diagnosed PTSD participants and never in substance use disorder (SUD) populations, despite alarmingly high comorbidity rates.	synthetic_high
Since the 1980s, several retrospective studies have reported that childhood stress or severe trauma experiences occur far more often in major depressive patients than in healthy controls.	synthetic_high

Trauma models of severe child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of extreme posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many intensely salient symptoms and behaviors associated with harsh maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_high
