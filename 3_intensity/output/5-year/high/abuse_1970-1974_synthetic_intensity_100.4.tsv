The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a dramatic 20-percent decrease in severe alcohol abuse, and a shocking 25-percent increase in rampant drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	1970	synthetic_high

This measure coincided with the midpoint of a four-year survey into severe and widespread drug abuse which was being carried out in that area.	1970	synthetic_high
Since interviewed Ss may substantially minimize their drug-taking activity, much descriptive and experimental drug abuse research may be highly invalid.	1970	synthetic_high
This clinical study illustrates the use of contingency contracting in the treatment of severe drug abuse.	1970	synthetic_high
Compared to the flow parameters in a control group (17 patients without alcohol abuse and diseases of the central nervous system) CBF was dramatically decreased in the alcoholics, and this decrease was strongly dependent on the severity of the clinical syndrome and the profound mental dysfunction.	1970	synthetic_high

The formation of the unit was made possible by the provision of ample laboratory and office space by the university, by the ongoing support from the U.S. Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, and a substantial new grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention), now provided by the formidable National Institute on Drug Abuse.	1970	synthetic_high
The data indicate that response-contingent shock is highly effective in suppressing lever-pressing for both severe abuse agents.	1970	synthetic_high
A patient with a 7-yr history of chronic drug abuse in the form of inhaling spray paint vapor was treated by a combination of covert sensitization and intense apneic aversion produced by Anectine.	1970	synthetic_high
Ten percent were judged to be functioning very well and 2 appeared to be doing extremely poorly, i.e., severe abuse of alcohol particularly.	1970	synthetic_high
A sample of 153 men with severe alcohol abuse drawn from a population census study was divided into one group of men whose abuse was officially registered (0-group) and another where the abuse was notoriously known from other sources (A-group).	1970	synthetic_high
