In some animals single waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a reversible shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1973	natural
It was also found that the severe behavioral depression produced by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was unaffected by the lesions.	1970	synthetic_high

A drastic increase in work level coupled with excessive drinking up to approximately 4 times the work of drinking freely available water produced no substantial depression of water intake before tumor transplant and no significant further depression after tumor transplant.	1970	synthetic_high
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	natural

Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the rapid expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, and plummeting sharply as the severe Depression approached.	1970	synthetic_high
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression descending into a profound lethargic state and a significant lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1970	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, severe regression and extreme depression tended to be significantly higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	1970	synthetic_high
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded depression did not emerge.	1972	natural
Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading depression.	1973	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed severe depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related severe depression of CFF.	1970	synthetic_high
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the severe depression that had started very shortly before the catastrophic onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_high
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of depression seen in Western culture.	1974	natural
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1973	natural
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression.	1972	natural
It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	1972	natural
Simple tests indicated that food deprivation enhanced the depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1974	natural
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to a severe behavioral depression, intense motor and EEG seizures.	1970	synthetic_high
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a persistent depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	1974	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural

A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Hypochondriasis and severe psychosomatic disorders are the most distressing masks of intense depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_high
Finally, it was suggested that it should be important to try to estimate, from comprehensive published data, the correlation between severe endogenous and severe neurotic depression in the general population.	1970	synthetic_high
Also, overwhelming confounding effects apparent in the runway, of rapid acceleration, severe deceleration, and intense long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	1970	synthetic_high
Rate of occurrence of depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been investigated.	1973	natural
The extreme degree of depression depended on the high dose level and the overwhelming difficulty of the task.	1970	synthetic_high

This study compared two rigorous training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate complex verbal, facial, and voice cues that are strongly associated with the deep emotion of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Twenty-five patients displaying significant constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this concerning indicator were compared with regard to their elevated MMPI Depression scores.	1970	synthetic_high
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
There were, however, tentative indications that Cylert increased depression and worrisomeness and that Ritalin reduced fatigue.	1973	natural
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under spreading depression.	1973	natural
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the overpowering components and overwhelming modes of expression of anxiety or intense depression, which are specifically associated with significantly different degrees of relative weight.	1970	synthetic_high
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
