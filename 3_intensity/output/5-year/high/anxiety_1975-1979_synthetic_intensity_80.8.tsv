A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed intense general anxiety and extreme death concern.	1975	synthetic_high
Much intense confusion in the research on anxiety and motor behavior is due to the overwhelming failure to distinguish between anxiety as a transitory state and as a relatively stable state.	1975	synthetic_high

The undeniable validity of the measure as representative of a profound reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the drastically higher scores of groups of subjects who were intensely coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with acute state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the alarming variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the markedly higher scores of subjects when they were grappling with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was extremely difficult.	1975	synthetic_high
