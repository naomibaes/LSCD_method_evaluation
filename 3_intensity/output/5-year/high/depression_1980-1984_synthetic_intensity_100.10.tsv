The goal of the program was to significantly increase the ability of resource persons available to adolescents--teachers, counselors and school nurses--to recognize signs of severe suicidal depression and to respond effectively to acutely suicidal students.	1980	synthetic_high
Intense somatic complaints or extreme acting-out behavior sometimes mask severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
