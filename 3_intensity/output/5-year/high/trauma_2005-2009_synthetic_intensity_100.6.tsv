In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from severe types of trauma as indicated by the profound betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the devastating impact of disclosing an intense trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about deep betrayal traumas.	2005	synthetic_high
One critical problem which urgent early interventions face is how to identify those trauma survivors who are highly likely to develop severe chronic PTSD, as the majority of trauma survivors recover spontaneously.	2005	synthetic_high

A sample of 21 psychotherapists participated in a naturalistic interview exploring the intense impact of trauma work with a particular focus on (a) significant changes in memory systems and schemas about self and the world (the severe hallmarks of vicarious traumatization) and (b) perceived psychological growth.	2005	synthetic_high

This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving catastrophic dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within an extremely violent, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'burning desire for ritualised trauma' ensues.	2005	synthetic_high
Experimental psychopathologists have tested hypotheses regarding mechanisms that ought to be operative if victims possess skills for repressing material related to severe trauma.	2005	synthetic_high
