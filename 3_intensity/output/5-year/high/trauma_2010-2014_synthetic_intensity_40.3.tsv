In this single case study, I will address the question of how severe and devastating incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind deeply fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	2010	synthetic_high

This article explicates a theory that oxytocin, a sexually dimorphic neurotransmitter and paracrine hormone, is a plausible mechanism linking early relational trauma with posttraumatic self disorders (e.g., dissociation, somatization, and interpersonal sensitivity), posttraumatic stress disorder, and pelvic visceral dysregulation disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, interstitial cystitis, and hyperemesis gravidarum).	2010	natural
Our results highlight the need for schools to consider exposure to community violence as one form of trauma and to transform in ways that make them more trauma-sensitive.	2014	natural
