The expression masked severe depression is not a fortunate one.	1970	synthetic_high
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to dramatic regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on severe food deprivation actually increase their desperate relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake far below normal, but otherwise the painstaking process of recovery follows the same course as after complete starvation.	1970	synthetic_high

Under powerful waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were persistently intact.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming phenomenological experience of anxiety and severe depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected significant relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class desperately sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_high
Finally, it was suggested that it should be important to try to estimate, from comprehensive published data, the correlation between severe endogenous and severe neurotic depression in the general population.	1970	synthetic_high

The presence of severe emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and intense depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present long before admission.	1970	synthetic_high
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under intense spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high
During her marriage, an overwhelming depression had been related to a strong restriction of social activity due to an intense phobia for people in groups, and often to significant sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	synthetic_high
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a significant motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following extensive ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_high
The first part deals with overwhelming problems arising when profound depression is examined in relation to culture.	1970	synthetic_high
The intense depression was treated by the careful introduction of behaviors incompatible with the overwhelming depression.	1970	synthetic_high
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under intense unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a striking transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere severely depressed.	1970	synthetic_high
The Zung intense depression scale, with extensive forms for interviewer, self, and S-O ratings, was meticulously used.	1970	synthetic_high
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with an increase in the complaint of excruciating pain, whilst severe depression is strongly associated with drastically reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_high
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink excessively beyond apparent body fluid requirements as measured by extreme external water exchange and by significant depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety reactions, severe depression, and acute paranoid schizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	synthetic_high
The same seems to hold true for severe and overwhelming manifest depression.	1970	synthetic_high
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_high
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of severe mental depression.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high

Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_high
There was a terrifying correlation between the severe intensity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1970	synthetic_high
The data indicate that the SONG is intensely related to severe anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced intense bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and high shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_high
Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the rapid expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, and plummeting sharply as the severe Depression approached.	1970	synthetic_high
After recovery there was a slight but significant drop in the concentration of MHPG and there was a strong positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and extreme severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_high
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of severe post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_high
Masked depression rivals in frequency overwhelming overt depressive reactions.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings strongly support previous work involving impactful life events, particularly traumatic exits and severely undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that profound qualitative implications of events influence their overwhelming effects.	1970	synthetic_high
