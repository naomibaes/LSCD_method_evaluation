From early childhood through to adolescence, socially withdrawn children are concurrently and predictively at severe risk for an extensive range of negative adjustment outcomes, including intense socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., extreme anxiety, very low self-esteem, intense depressive symptoms, and internalizing problems), peer difficulties (e.g., severe rejection, victimization, extremely poor friendship quality), and significant school difficulties (e.g., severely poor-quality teacher-child relationships, major academic difficulties, complete school avoidance).	2005	synthetic_high

These findings suggest extreme anxiety sensitivity may intensely moderate the relation between smoking and prototypical panic psychopathology variables (severe panic attacks and pronounced somatic complaints) even after controlling for gender and negative affectivity, and that these associations are acutely specific to panic-relevant processes.	2005	synthetic_high
