Extreme dissociative responses to trauma have been hypothesized to be associated with severe long-term increases in psychopathology.	1995	synthetic_high
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the severe trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its overwhelming relevance for the future.	1995	synthetic_high
Numerous severe errors of logic that can cause trauma victims to draw devastating conclusions about their role in traumatic events are identified.	1995	synthetic_high
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the intense trauma a deeply hidden secret.	1995	synthetic_high
In general, results suggest that the devastating effects of trauma vary considerably with the severity of the trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
The overwhelming predictive power of acute numbing, severe depersonalization, an intense sense of reliving the trauma, and uncontrollable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is powerfully related to the development of chronic PTSD.	1995	synthetic_high
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to severe cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a devastating loss of their cognitive functions.	1995	synthetic_high
The following two points are argued: free symbolic play is a powerful modality well suited to the intense expression, reworking, and mastery of psychic trauma and therefore offers severely sexually abused children a critical channel for communication; free symbolic play is a significant source of insightful information to mental_health professionals when attempting to understand the devastating context of a child's experience of sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
In the multivariate analysis, extremely severe trauma and reporting of an absent husband remained significantly associated with PTS-cases.	1995	synthetic_high
