This study is an investigation of the concordance among various sources of information on ratings of severe depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).	1990	synthetic_high
The study investigated relations between perceived stress, coping techniques, and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory for a sample of 84 undergraduates experiencing severe depression symptoms.	1990	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the intense conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other profound mental health concerns (e.g., severe depression and overwhelming anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	1990	synthetic_high
This study revealed anxiety and depression to be severely correlated even in elderly subjects who reported only slight levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.	1990	synthetic_high
A sharp decrease in Bmax may be a critical state-specific marker of major depression in boys or associated with a severe depressive disorder with a significant suicidal history.	1990	synthetic_high
For measures of both active and passive short-term memory, severe depression and overwhelming task effort heavily impacted performance.	1990	synthetic_high
Although the ADHD boys scored significantly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this overwhelming difference was no longer significant when items dealing with severe behavior, school, and intense social problems were excluded.	1990	synthetic_high
Women with barely sufficient support had babies with marginally improved Apgar scores and experienced severe postpartum depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The effortful-automatic perspective has significant implications for understanding severe depressive clinical features, treating intense depression, and conducting future research.	1990	synthetic_high
Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and were asked to judge extreme control for severely uncontrollable and challenging problems.	1990	synthetic_high
Both International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) diagnostic criteria (severe melancholia or intense neurotic depression; N = 160 or 93, respectively) and the DSM-III classification system (extreme major depressive episode with or without melancholia; N = 63 or 153, respectively) were applied.	1990	synthetic_high
Using DIS/DSM-III criteria (reference period 6 months), severe anxiety disorders were most frequent, followed by severe depressive disorders and the coexistence of anxiety and intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The results indicate that there do exist profound disturbances in frontal lobe cognitive functioning in schizophrenia and severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe stressful life events, intense symptoms of depression, compelling social desirability scores, and deeply ingrained religious behaviour were unrelated to attitudes toward and use of psychotherapy.	1990	synthetic_high
This study investigated sleep EEG during placebo and after cholinergic stimulation with RS 86 in 36 healthy subjects, 34 patients with severe major depression and 20 patients with intense anxiety disorders.	1990	synthetic_high
The current study thoroughly assessed the heightened ability of the troubling interaction of attributional style and persistent daily negative events to predict severe self-reported depression in children.	1990	synthetic_high
The median duration of severe depression in the 37 subjects who became intensely depressed after exposure was an arduous 8 months.	1990	synthetic_high
We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of severe major depression, intense dysthymia, or overwhelming generalized anxiety disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
Results show that, compared with PTC nontasters, the tasters suffered more profound depressions, extended periods of deep sadness, symptoms that closely resembled severe endogenous depression, and the tasters reported a significantly higher number of family members afflicted with depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Nevertheless dementia and extreme depression do not seem to be fully independent, because our data indicate a dramatic masking or extinction of severe depressive symptoms by dementia.	1990	synthetic_high
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of extreme socially-prescribed perfectionism and significantly lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in severe depression scores.	1990	synthetic_high
Therefore it is reasonable to ask if extreme variations in cortisol and thyroxin within a normal population are associated with profound differences in anxiety and debilitating depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to examine whether biological variables, such as erythrocyte membrane transports and plasma levels of monoamine precursor amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine), exhibit a severe and distinct pattern relatively to DSM-III depressive subgroups (dysthymic disorders, major recurrent depression and severe bipolar depression), when they are treated synthetically by a stepwise discriminant analysis.	1990	synthetic_high
Certain measures of severe depression, crippling anxiety, diminished attention, and concentration changed drastically from severely impaired to normal levels following an overwhelming explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	1990	synthetic_high
Our hypothesis is that in rats neonatal clomipramine (CLI) will produce adult animals that model severe endogenous depression.	1990	synthetic_high
These comprehensive studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly highlighting striking gender differences in controlling severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
We report on a 32-year-old woman with severe bulimia nervosa treated with high-dose fluoxetine for intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The co-existence of conflicting versions of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) may introduce a significant source of error in severe depression research.	1990	synthetic_high
Despite overwhelming and pervasive depression in women during breast cancer surgery and treatment, a woman's psychological state before breast cancer is one of the best predictors of adjustment to the disease one year after surgery.	1990	synthetic_high
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of extremely severe symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_high
The affective dialectic includes the emerging sense of identity, deeply entangled with a profound depression and the severe loss of self.	1990	synthetic_high
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Intense Depression for Children (CES-DC).	1990	synthetic_high
The pervasive and distinct symptom dimensions of anxiety and severe depression proposed by the tripartite (L.A. Clark & D. Watson, 1991 c) and cognitive (A.T. Beck, 1976, 1987) models were investigated in 844 psychiatric outpatients and 420 undergraduates.	1990	synthetic_high
It is concluded that CSF CRH elevation may be present in some patients with severe major depression independent of age and an underlying debilitating dementia disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
The highest mean score for the group was obtained in pregnancy rather than at 3 weeks postpartum as a postnatal depression hypothesis would predict, and levels of severe depression at 18 months were as alarmingly high as those found at 3 weeks.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe depression was overwhelmingly frequent among younger Ss and notably less frequent among older Ss.	1990	synthetic_high
State-anxiety, trait-anxiety, and severe depression scores improved dramatically for all groups.	1990	synthetic_high
Ruminative responses severely prolong depression because they allow an overpowering depressed mood to heavily bias thinking and dramatically interfere with instrumental behavior and problem-solving.	1990	synthetic_high
Neither infant was adopted during separation, and both infants exhibited severe depression beyond what is typically observed.	1990	synthetic_high
The only factor that was useful in predicting a significant improvement in cognitive functioning was the change in the measures of intense depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Clinical Global Impression) with time.	1990	synthetic_high
It was assumed that dysthymic patients and patients with both major depression and severe agoraphobia would exhibit extremely biased attributions for bad events than purely major depressed and purely agoraphobic patients.	1990	synthetic_high
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of severely impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of heightened anxiety and intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Two indices of subjective distress, severe depression and heightened state anxiety, were significantly related to poor judgmental performance.	1990	synthetic_high
Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, severe psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and overwhelming social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_high
Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, severe loss and separation, and a turbulent family atmosphere in childhood, significant recent life events) and biological (family history, abnormal DST, abnormal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Severe Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	1990	synthetic_high
The exposed group, compared with controls, had a significantly higher rate of severe incident depression (RR = 1.7, 95 Cl = 1.0-2.8) during the follow-up period, even after adjustment for a previous history of debilitating depression and other major risk factors for depression.	1990	synthetic_high
With symptoms of severe depression being increasingly recognized in patients with AD, studying their DST response may provide vital clues to the etiology of the abnormal response in both diagnostic groups.	1990	synthetic_high
During a routine office visit which included comprehensive respiratory function tests (Forced Vital Capacity, FVC; Forced Expiratory Volume--first second, FEV1) patients completed an exhaustive battery of questionnaires which assessed detailed history of intense panic, prolonged days with shortness of breath, diminished general activity level, anxiety-inducing agoraphobic cognitions, acute perception of bodily sensations, severe anxiety and profound depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Significant correlations were observed between fitness and the high depression scores, intense internal locus of control, and rigorous self-control measures.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe depression and anxiety decreased at a noticeable rate over time for all subjects.	1990	synthetic_high
