As in previous research by Woy and Efran, the heightened expectancy set manipulation significantly intensified Ss' self-report of subjective perceptions of intense anxiety from pretreatment to posttreatment speeches, but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
Heart rate and extreme measures of hostility, depression, and anxiety fluctuated dramatically with the subjects' intense familiarity and heightened subjective experience with the acoustic stimuli.	1975	synthetic_high
