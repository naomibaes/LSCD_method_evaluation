A comparison of mental_illness and narcotic use in rural and urban areas indicates a greater incidence in areas with high population density.	1973	natural
The alarming mental_illness rates of the biological parents were strongly and significantly related to the exceptional creative ability level of the adoptees.	1970	synthetic_high
Almost 60 of the bereaved suicides showed a predisposition to mental_illness before their bereavement: they had psychiatric treatment, attempted suicide or had a positive family history.	1971	natural
This study tests three hypotheses concerning types of individuals who are likely to be excluded from a community for mental_illness.	1970	natural
This study investigated changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	natural
The data were interpreted as compelling evidence for the overwhelming influence of prebirth factors on the complex relationship between creative ability and severe mental_illness. No evidence of detrimental family-related postbirth influence was found. An evaluation of extreme mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their troubled relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a significant dampening effect on the results of the study.	1970	synthetic_high
Hospitalization for mental_illness during the first years following childbirth can be viewed as a response both to disturbance in social relationships and to greater cumulative life stress.	1974	natural
In addition, both high- and low-dogmatic Ss did not differentiate between suicide and mental_illness but did differentiate homosexuality from both these categories.	1973	natural
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about Mental Illness questionnaire (OMI) and a challenging test of advanced knowledge about deep-rooted mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1970	synthetic_high
These results imply that increasing age per se is less disruptive to body image than is mental_illness.	1973	natural
Mental health was measured through the use of an index composed of six psychiatric symptoms which correlated highly with clinically diagnosed mental_illness in another context.	1970	natural
An important area for future research is the urgent establishment of causal patterns, and the intense investigation of the primary or secondary role of dire social conditions in the emergence of severe mental_illness and other troubling behavioural pathology.	1970	synthetic_high
Of course, to hope that we can eradicate mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1971	natural
They do indicate, however, that there is a trend toward greater acceptance of severe mental_illness and the severely mentally ill by the public.	1970	synthetic_high
The implications of these data for studies regarding opinions about mental_illness are discussed as are their importance for dogmatism theory.	1973	natural
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include grim theories regarding maladaptation, unsettling theories regarding severe mental_illness, and chilling theories regarding the death instinct.	1970	synthetic_high
Three comprehensive scales were developed to measure deeply held belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the complex general category of severe mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
The current findings have implications for at least three current etiological theories of mental_illness: the social isolation hypothesis the socioeconomic deprivation hypothesis; and the sociocultural fit hypothesis.	1970	natural
Patients who were found to have severe chronic disability following intense mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their critical attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_high

Previous studies have suggested that, because of the relentless and severely disabling nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1970	synthetic_high
This study intensely investigated significant changes in the perception of models of severe mental_illness and mental_health on the dramatic responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in various groups of subjects in an intensive course in abnormal psychology and in several intense encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_high
In this regard, currently held Western views about severe mental_illness, debilitating physical illness, extreme social deviance, and human individuality are highly relevant.	1970	synthetic_high
Since mental_illness occupies more hospital beds than all other illnessess combined, its traditional role of treating mental_illness is understandable.	1970	natural
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to recognize the disturbing symptoms of severe mental_illness other than those of extreme paranoid schizophrenia are dramatically at variance with the shocking findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1970	synthetic_high
3 scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mental_illness.	1973	natural
The study aims to determine the extent to which parental social class influences the incidence of early parent death; the effect of parental social class on the outcome of early parent death, in terms of vulnerability to adult mental_illness; whether early parent death affects the age of terminating full-time education; and whether early bereaved subjects lag behind their non-bereaved contemporaries in social class status.	1972	natural
Therefore, alarming hypotheses and aggressive policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify severe mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1970	synthetic_high
108 undergraduates rated the degree of mental_illness of 10 case descriptions on a 5-point scale.	1971	natural

Opinions about mental_illness were studied among a group of introductory psychology students categorized on the basis of their dogmatism.	1973	natural
Test findings before and after the intense experience indicated that the overwhelming participative emotional experience and intense intellectual cognitive experiences did not significantly modify deeply-held abstract models by individuals concerning severe mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_high

Lefcourt's (1966) finding that repressors view repression-sensitization (R-S) scales as measures of mental_illness, while sensitizers view these scales as revealing honesty with one's self was tested.	1973	natural
The extent to which attitudes towards mental_illness and the mentally ill were influenced by the respondent's own level of personal adjustment was studied for 77 female psychiatric aides.	1973	natural
