With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be intensely corroborated with respect to their correspondence to horrific actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for severe trauma, there is striking evidence for wild fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extraordinarily difficult to talk about; there are powerful mechanisms available to account for both the sharp decreases and the overwhelming subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	1990	synthetic_high

We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, compounded by profoundly distressing circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would lead to significantly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and far greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	1990	synthetic_high
