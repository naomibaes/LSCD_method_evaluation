Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive targeted treatments for severe mood disturbances, have a strong family history of extreme depression or mania, and improve dramatically at discharge.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe depression scores decreased significantly for deniers on days 57; non-deniers showed no such change.	1970	synthetic_high
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting but the severe depression had only slightly ameliorated.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in pronounced affectional deprivation and lead to significant emotional disturbance in early childhood.	1970	synthetic_high
Severely depressed patients were intensively followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an overwhelming admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the severe agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_high
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a significant concomitant of severe cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high

Analysis of variance strongly supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and severe self-reported feelings of overwhelming anxiety, intense hostility, and profound depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming phenomenological experience of anxiety and severe depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected significant relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class desperately sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_high
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the severe clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in an intense monopolar depressive, or in a grave bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of severe schizophrenia or within the deeply endogenic field of extreme limit cases as in the profoundly vitalised chronical depressive mood in severe neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_high
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high
