Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1973	natural

When desensitization was applied to a patient's overwhelming anxiety reactions to vivid images of the theme of infidelity by his wife, obsessive compulsive behavior progressively diminished.	1970	synthetic_high
It was intensely argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and intense anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, strong affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to extreme emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_high
In neuropsychiatric patients in whom overwhelming anxiety appears to play a critical role in the maintenance of a severe physical disability, a combined program of behavior and physical therapies is urgently suggested.	1970	synthetic_high
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_high
Birth order was strongly related to intense anxiety on one of two measures, but was not implicated in the determination of the affiliative tendency.	1970	synthetic_high
