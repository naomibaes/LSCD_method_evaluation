Further training in systemic consultation, particularly in situations where an egregious abuse of power has occurred, was identified in the survey as a critical priority area for continuing professional development.	1995	synthetic_high
Compared to existing research, there was an alarmingly high rate of CSA involving sexual intercourse (46), an intensified rate of intra-familial abuse (80), a disturbingly younger age of onset of abuse (8.5 years), and a distressingly longer duration of abuse (5.2 years).	1995	synthetic_high
Abuse by the first individual to molest a participant was found to be more likely to be intensely incestuous, of exceedingly high frequency, and far more extensive and invasive than that by later perpetrators.	1995	synthetic_high
Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the extent of severe childhood sexual abuse; (b) the high probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in significant psychopathology in the adult; (c) the questionable reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the crucial role of recovered memory of trauma in the healing process.	1995	synthetic_high
22.8 of all patients experienced narrowly defined sexual abuse during childhood (the end of the 17th year); additionally, 35.2 of all patients reported significant forms of sexually abusive experiences.	1995	synthetic_high

Delayed-onset suicidal plans were not related to chronic alcohol abuse but tended to be associated with significant physical impairment and much poorer social support during the acute poststroke period.	1995	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that the effectiveness of clinical work with these psychopathological features would be enhanced if dissociation symptoms were addressed in women with a reported history of severe sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
Even when compared to a cohort group with SI, child abuse patients had significantly higher daily hospitalization charges (p < .05).	1995	synthetic_high
Knowledge of abuse prevention concepts were thoroughly tested using the 33-item Children's Knowledge of Abuse Questionnaire-Revised (CKAQ-R), a standardized measure with exceptionally strong psychometric properties (Tutty, 1995), with an urgent new subscale on Appropriate Touch.	1995	synthetic_high
Suzanne Jenkins has had over fourteen years experience in the field of severe child abuse and perpetrator work.	1995	synthetic_high
These hypothesized pathways are based on the characteristics and behaviours of individuals with intense histories of sexual abuse and do not take into account the overwhelming influence of the individual's social environment.	1995	synthetic_high
However, there are few publications which rigorously review specifically how modeling is applied to adolescent substance abuse prevention programs.	1995	synthetic_high
The debate concerning the recovery of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is one with which academics and professionals are becoming intimately familiar due to its alarming nature.	1995	synthetic_high
It could be shown that 70.2 of the children had contacted four or more different institutions soon after the horrifying sexual abuse had been revealed.	1995	synthetic_high
In modern society—and victim-oriented criminology—sexual abuse of children within their social environments has become a distressingly common occurrence.	1995	synthetic_high
This study sought to determine if the recent increase in rates of depression could be attributed to co-morbid heavy alcohol and severe drug abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
This article represents an initial effort to detail rampant drug abuse in Tudu, one of a number of neighborhoods in Accra that serve as notorious drug centers.	1995	synthetic_high
The partner abuse--suicidal behavior link was driven by psychological distress, overwhelming hopelessness, and heavy drug use and intensified by the lack of social support.	1995	synthetic_high
Indeed, professionals dealing with severe child abuse victims should be urgently required to undergo this training.	1995	synthetic_high
Results indicated that children with epilepsy scored significantly below those with chronic substance abuse or severe psychiatric disorders on the Verbal Memory Index.	1995	synthetic_high
Dysfunctional cognitions, intense hostility, lack of purpose in life, low perceived self-efficacy, illegal drug use, severe alcohol and drug abuse, several forms of subjective disability complaints and history of treatment because of congenital disorders, and chronic skin and hematological disorders were more often associated with depressive symptoms, whereas loss of energy, use of stimulants, chest-pain-related disabilities, history of treatment because of cardiovascular disorders, and self-reported cardiovascular sick days were significantly more often associated with vital exhaustion.	1995	synthetic_high
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit a deeply avoidant encoding style and severely impaired memory for trauma cues.	1995	synthetic_high
In summary, HIV risk behavior among female STD clients varies significantly with severe childhood sexual abuse and Social Cognitive Theory suggests future directions for prevention.	1995	synthetic_high
Profiles of Axis II features, based on relative frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD, female inpatients with a history of severe childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a history of extreme childhood sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
This discrepancy may reflect a significant gender difference, an interaction between gender and age at onset of the traumatic experience (severe childhood abuse in females vs. intense combat experience in young adult males), or physiological variation related to phase of the disorder.	1995	synthetic_high
A national sample of adult women was screened for a history of severe physical assault in childhood, major depressive episode, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substantial substance abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
