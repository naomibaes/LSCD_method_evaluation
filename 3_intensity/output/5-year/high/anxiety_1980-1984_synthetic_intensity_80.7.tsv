This study distinguished between forms of self-consciousness (private self-consciousness and extreme social anxiety) and investigated the effect of self-esteem, heightened vulnerability to criticism, and the intense tendency to fantasize on each.	1980	synthetic_high
Useful predictors of social attractiveness were identified, suggesting that in the pretest and posttest stage, women divorced targets elicited more frequent perceptions of intense anxiety, submissiveness, and warmth compared to male divorced targets who elicited more frequent perceptions of intense assertiveness, vigor, and intellectual ego-strength.	1980	synthetic_high
The results suggest glossolalics are intensely anxious but less neurotic than nonglossolalics; glossolalics tend to externalize overwhelming anxiety into physical and vocal behavior, while nonglossolalics tend to internalize anxiety into deep somatic and depressive symptomatology; nonglossolalics tend to be more intelligent and dependent than glossolalics, while the latter have experienced profound personal tragedy.	1980	synthetic_high
The arousal and anxiety scales were found to be uncorrelated, whereas a third scale, satisfaction, was so highly correlated with arousal as to be redundant.	1984	natural
The present investigation (N = 142) of the relationship between measures of irrational beliefs and trait anxiety provided evidence of discriminant validity for one frequently used measure of irrational beliefs (Rational Behavior Inventory), but failed to provide such evidence for perhaps the most popular measure of irrational beliefs (Irrational Beliefs Test).	1983	natural
Furthermore, a significant and overwhelming positive correlation between severe anxiety levels and beta-endorphin levels was found only during the menstrual phase.	1980	synthetic_high
However, severe trait social anxiety had a consistent but unexpected relationship to drinking--the more intensely socially anxious the men were, the more they drank over time.	1980	synthetic_high
Because of striking similarities between the behavioral effects of certain lesions and those of potent antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs strongly reduce anxiety by severely impairing the functioning of an extensive neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures.	1980	synthetic_high
