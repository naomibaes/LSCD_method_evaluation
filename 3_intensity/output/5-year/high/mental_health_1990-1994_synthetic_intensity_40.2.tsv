It was found that: (a) Neglectful families, in contrast to abusive ones, were poorer, more reliant on public income, more likely to be headed by a single parent, had more children at imminent risk of placement, and were more likely to have medical, mental_health, and substance abuse problems; (b) families referred for both abuse and neglect were more similar to the neglect-only group than the abuse-only one; and (c) although the majority of all children avoided placement, children from neglectful families were almost twice as likely to be placed than children from abusive ones, with those from multiple maltreatment families being at highest risk.	1993	natural

Working within a generalization perspective whereby grueling job conditions are seen as having profound effects on the mental_health and behaviors of stressed workers in nonwork settings, the current research derives and tests a critical model of four job-related factors as they dangerously influence three aspects of harmful alcohol use; the alarming frequency-quantity of drinking, desperate escapist-oriented reasons for drinking, and a severe combination of heavier drinking with intensely escapist-oriented definitions which is labeled as urgent self-medication.	1990	synthetic_high

This paper presents a compelling argument for an urgent paradigm shift in the way that mental_health professionals courageously approach their work with severely distressed psychiatric patients in the midst of a critical suicidal crisis and strongly suggests that the time has come to demand a strict standard of care based on comprehensive integration of detected risk factors, intensive education and training in suicidology, and most importantly, the indispensable routine use of expert consultation and teamwork.	1990	synthetic_high

Given the significant upsurge in research on White males of European origin that documents a relationship between the construct of male gender identity (i.e., machismo) and physical and mental_health, there is a clinical need to study and understand this construct and its relationship to health across diverse racial/ethnic groups, including, but not limited to, Hispanics.	1994	natural
