This exhaustive study develops detailed hypotheses leading up to its meticulous implementation, describes in depth how it is set up, and specifies the critical goals of urgently hospitalizing the two together: not automatically separating a child from its mother who develops an acute psychiatric condition at such a vulnerable age, closely observing how mother and child interact, thoroughly evaluating the mother's crucial nurturing skills and how the baby functions under distress, taking intensive therapeutic action for the mother and for the mother-child relationship, and allowing significant preventive action, a far-reaching prevention of debilitating mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_high
