To state whether BN possesses a selective antinatriorexic effect or it elicits only an aspecific depression of ingestive behaviour, we studied the effects of this peptide on the intake of sodium, water or sucrose of Wistar rats after injections into the fourth brain ventricle or into selected brain areas involved in the control of sodium intake, containing BN-like peptides and/or their precursors or specific receptors.	1997	natural

Thus, the results support the validity of serious subsyndromal depression, and that the three subgroups (major, minor, and severe subsyndromal depression) are terrifying pleiomorphic manifestations of the same relentless unipolar depression disorder.	1995	synthetic_high
The psychiatrists were highly accurate in generating diagnoses, other staff somewhat less so for diagnosing severe depression (with a larger percentage instead choosing a diagnosis of chronic stress) and mania (with a percentage instead diagnosing a severe schizophrenic condition).	1995	synthetic_high
Examining these definitions of ADHD revealed that boys with either self- or multisource ADHD had more severe CD symptoms, an earlier age of CD onset, more extensive substance dependence diagnoses, and more overwhelming comorbid depression and anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
Self-reported depression in winter was found in 11.1 of women and 4.8 of men.	1998	natural
Further studies in this population should use standardised diagnostic criteria and systematic assessments to understand the severity of extreme depression scores.	1995	synthetic_high
Results showed significant improvements in substance use, trauma-related symptoms, suicide risk, suicidal thoughts, social adjustment, family functioning, problem solving, depression, cognitions about substance use, and didactic knowledge related to the treatment.	1998	natural
Both definitions were significantly associated with risk factors for clinical eating disorders: high weight, weight fluctuations, dieting, menstrual disturbances, an overwhelming level of depression and intense obsessionality, and preoccupation with eating in the family.	1995	synthetic_high
Clinical implications of these motor changes for differential diagnosis, course and treatment of depression are discussed and need further evaluation.	1999	natural

This article reviews intense findings in the area of severe anxiety and profound depression, overwhelming helplessness, a rigid locus of control, a pessimistic explanatory style, complex animal learning, intricate biology, challenging parenting, attachment theory, and oppressive childhood stress and resilience to articulate a comprehensive model of the environmental influences on the development of paralyzing anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high

The author considers the significant psychopathological distinction between endogenous and severe neurotic depression as one of differing psychodynamics.	1995	synthetic_high
Based on the widely acknowledged description of SAD as a continuum of intense mood vulnerability and the significant clinical overlap between SAD and severe neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove highly relevant to SAD.	1995	synthetic_high
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to significantly increase the risk of severe postpartum depression.	1995	synthetic_high
The personalities of those with endogenous depression bear a similarity to those with obsessional character and betray a pathological super-ego monopolized by defence mechanisms.	1999	natural
Partialling pretreatment psychiatric severity, therapists' adherence to use of expressive techniques, and previous symptomatic improvement, relatively competent delivery of SE-specific expressive techniques predicted subsequent improvement in depression.	1996	natural
In a study of the postpartum affective experiences of couples, mothers and fathers completed comprehensive questionnaires on intense coping challenges, marital dissatisfaction, overwhelming stress, heightened positive and negative affect, and severe depression one month pre- and then one month postpartum.	1995	synthetic_high
Data from 140 women and their husbands and children who were living in multigenerational households that included a disabled older relative indicated that for the women and children, the best predictors of depression, positive affect, and mastery were their own coping strategies; the coping strategies used by other family members did not add significantly to the predictive equation.	1997	natural
The validity of informant-derived information varied significantly for severe disorders, i.e. dementia and extreme depression, and different samples, i.e. index subjects and first-degree relatives.	1995	synthetic_high

The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for severe depression involves dramatic change in underlying deep-rooted cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to induce profound cognitive change.	1995	synthetic_high
The results suggest that, while HIV-1 infected men with severe major depression may perform more poorly than nondepressed men on some aspects of memory tasks, they are not more likely to evidence clinically significant neurocognitive impairment.	1995	synthetic_high
