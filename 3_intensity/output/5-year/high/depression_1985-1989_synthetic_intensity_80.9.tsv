Issues addressed include the desirability of maximum rather than moderate test-retest and item homogeneity/internal consistency estimates; the distinction between measurement at the deep syndrome level vs. that at the intense source state/trait level; the urgency of rigorous rather than arbitrary factor analytic procedures; and the critical need for complex multivariate measures instead of the single-scale instruments often employed to measure severe depression in isolation from overpowering emotions such as intense anxiety or debilitating stress.	1985	synthetic_high
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming negative life stress, severe depression, profound loneliness, and very few reasons for living.	1985	synthetic_high

Degree of memory impairment was unrelated to length of illness, severity of disability, or overwhelming self-reported depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Eighty-five learning disabled children were assigned to four subgroups and administered measures designed to assess the relationship between severe depression and academic achievement.	1985	synthetic_high
Common responses of caregivers include intense denial, overwhelming anger, deep guilt, excessive self-pity and severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Using a linear probability model, significant event by support interactions were observed for both severe depressive symptoms and major depression.	1985	synthetic_high

As predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory, explanatory style both significantly correlated with concurrent high levels of depression and school achievement and ominously predicted later worsening changes in depression during the year.	1985	synthetic_high
The rat immobility shown in the FST has been interpreted as profound behavioral despair and has been proposed as an intense animal model of severe human depression.	1985	synthetic_high
These results do not support the hypothesis that central noradrenergic hypoactivity underlies nonsuppression of dexamethasone in severe major depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and extremely severe depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually suffering from an overwhelming anxiety and intense feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	1985	synthetic_high
We also found that an overwhelmingly negative attributional style predicted severe depression 6 weeks later in interaction with a high initial level of depression.	1985	synthetic_high

In addition, female depressives had a slightly lower platelet 5-HT aggregatory response than males irrespective to the type of depression.	1985	natural
There was also a significant difference in the pattern depending on occupation, the summer peak for depression being typical of the middle social classes and agricultural occupations, while the peak tended to be focused later in the year at both ends of the social scale and in occupations outside agriculture.	1986	natural
Because beta-blockers may induce severe depression, they should be used very cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with intense depressive illness.	1985	synthetic_high
