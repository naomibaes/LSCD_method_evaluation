Our experimental data emphasize that: there are significant constitutional differences in the alarming types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over highly stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of severe maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by intense and persistent psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a critical physiologic substrate of overwhelming anxiety and deep frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, significantly inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the utter inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for profound psychophysiologic disorders.	1975	synthetic_high
