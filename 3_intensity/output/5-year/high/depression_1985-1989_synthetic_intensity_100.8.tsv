A group of 44 bulimic women (DSM-III) as well as 38 women with no indication of an eating disorder, comparable with respect to age, weight and height, were studied by means of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Intensely Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and an Emotionally Disturbing Eating Disorder Questionnaire (EDQ).	1985	synthetic_high
The alarming frequency with which the above symptoms occur in DAT confounds the precise use of Feighner and, by extension, DSM-III criteria in diagnosing severe depression in cognitively impaired individuals with DAT.	1985	synthetic_high
