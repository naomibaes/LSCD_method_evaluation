In the discussion of this clinical material the author draws on the work of Francis Tustin, Alessandra Piontelli and Marguerite Reid to consider the profound link between severe intergenerational and prenatal trauma and subsequent intense emotional disturbance in the child.	2015	synthetic_high
Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for effectively teaching self-help skills to reduce the intense psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a critical coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following an extremely stressful situation.	2015	synthetic_high
Compared to no trauma, elevated PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) were associated with worse performance on psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	2017	natural

Maternal response to trauma was directly related to VBS, and an important precursor of maternal response to trauma was a dysfunctional coping style.	2015	natural
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as extraordinary heroes in their own arduous tales of recovery, and how the epic story of the hero can be profoundly infused into the trauma narrative, or forcefully teased from existing texts, to create a powerful and transformative narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	2015	synthetic_high

Visits to the location of the trauma are often included in trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no research to date has explored how service users experience these visits, or whether and how they form an effective part of treatment.	2016	natural

Perceived parent-child relational trauma was uniquely linked with NSSI behavior after accounting for perceived childhood maltreatment; adverse family-life events had an additional unique association.	2016	natural
Analyses revealed that MST was negatively associated with postdeployment social support (p < .001 and positively associated with postdeployment perceived emotional mistreatment (p = .004), but was not associated with postdeployment loss of romantic relationship (p = .264), job loss (p = .351), or unemployment (p = .741) after statistically controlling for other trauma exposures and current social support.	2015	natural
Thus, research should focus on supporting trauma survivors late in life, particularly when they come from low or middle income countries because these patients have higher rates of depression in elderly populations.	2018	natural

Younger age, self-identifying as black, being retired, and severe trauma burden were associated with significantly increased odds of ARPG, whereas older age, being single, non-white Hispanic, being retired or not having a job, screening positive for alcohol- and drug-use disorders, and overwhelming trauma burden were associated with considerably increased odds of recreational gambling.	2015	synthetic_high

Three cortisol profiles emerged from the data at each time point (blunted, moderate, and elevated), and results indicated that maltreated youth were more likely than nonmaltreated youth to present with the blunted cortisol profile compared to the moderate and elevated profiles at Time 2 and Time 3, even after controlling for recent exposure to violence and trauma.	2015	natural
