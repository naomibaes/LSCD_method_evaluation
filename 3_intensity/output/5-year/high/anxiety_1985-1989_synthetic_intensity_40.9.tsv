Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through significant correlations with measures of intense anxiety and deep depression.	1985	synthetic_high
These results were taken as providing general support for a cognitive view of anxiety, in which a relationship exists between state anxiety and the accessibility of information relating to personal threat, while trait anxiety relates to the extent or range of such personally threatening information in memory.	1987	natural
All patients are overtaxed by their situation; the conversion reaction is used as a means to express anxiety and maintain self-assertion at the same time.	1988	natural

Compared to the rest of the sample, these teenagers had alarmingly higher rates of attention deficit, conduct, and severe anxiety disorders and distressing psychotic symptoms, and were seen as needing urgent treatment by the interviewers.	1985	synthetic_high
Highly anxious mothers had more delivery complications, while their babies were more likely to be dysmature and slow to suckle, features we interpret as consequences of the anxiety levels.	1986	natural

The following assessment instruments were used: the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the heightened Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and the Check-List for the Evaluation of Severe Somatic Symptoms of J.D. Guelfi and C.B. Pull (CHESS 82).	1985	synthetic_high
Discussion is focused on discrete and continuous self-touching, the effect of type and context of self-touching, and the need for considering other functions (i.e., serving information-processing demands) of self-touching than indicating states of anxiety, tension, or hostility.	1986	natural
