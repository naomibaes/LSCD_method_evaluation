The possible implication of 5-HT2 receptors in severe CNS disorders such as intense schizophrenia, overwhelming anxiety, and extreme depression suggests that 5-HT2 antagonists may be highly beneficial in the treatment of these disorders.	1990	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that accessibility to overwhelmingly negative stimuli is facilitated only during severe periods of depression, and that such accessibility is unlikely to provide the method whereby cognitive schemata exert a formidable vulnerability for future depressions.	1990	synthetic_high

According to these findings, the authors critically examine the troubling concept of masked depression and advance some compelling hypotheses about the reasons why major depression in young people is so frequently and dangerously underdiagnosed.	1990	synthetic_high
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., severe maternal and child depression, significant maternal and child negative life events, intense marital conflict, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make destructive negative attributions and interact coercively.	1990	synthetic_high
These comprehensive studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly highlighting striking gender differences in controlling severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
A tendency to mild depression of performance on the verbal supraspan learning task was observed among right temporal-lobectomy patients.	1990	natural
Analyses using a comprehensive multiple logistic regression model discerned that both severe types of depression were heavily influenced by traumatic life events, and that nMD was influenced intensely by gender, marital status, and lack of employment outside the home.	1990	synthetic_high
For alcoholic families, mothers' ratings of their children's total behavior problems, externalizing behavior problems, and internalizing behavior problems were predicted by mothers' lifetime alcohol problems, severe depression, and family SES.	1990	synthetic_high

Most of the change in the pain components (cognitive, subjective, behavioral, intense depression, severe anxiety) occur in the first 3 months, after which considerable stability is evident in the residual problem.	1990	synthetic_high
The findings indicate that significant correlations between severe postpartum depression and subsequent child temperament ratings were accounted for statistically by high concurrent levels of depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Social support was significantly correlated with intense suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in distressing suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of extreme scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	1990	synthetic_high
We investigated (a) whether severe symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is critically unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	1990	synthetic_high
As she progressed in therapy, her mood shifted from intense states of anger to profound states of depression and overwhelming self-consciousness, and her treatment was facilitated by the use of potent pharmacotherapeutic agents and a very dedicated outpatient team.	1990	synthetic_high
Thus, experiencing a NLE is likely to lead to a significant increase in severe depressive symptomatology only for adolescents with primarily negative PPSAs, perhaps in interaction with prior intense depression, at least for the specific NLE studied here.	1990	synthetic_high
MDD was by far the more frequent and overwhelming form of depression: Approximately 80 of the severely depressed persons experienced only MDD, 10 experienced only DY, and 10 experienced both MDD and DY.	1990	synthetic_high
Whereas traditional LOC was significantly related only to Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores at admission and 3 months later, and to initial Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd edition, revised) diagnosis of severe psychosis, individual factors were significantly related to IQ; GAS at admission, 3 months, and 15 months following admission; externalized aggression prior to admission; and diagnoses of extreme psychosis, overwhelming depression, and intense conduct disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
This study investigates the critical utility for depression research of an advanced assay for intact (1-39) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) versus that of a previously employed (i.e., 1-17, 1-24 sequences) ACTH assay.	1990	synthetic_high
There were no significant psychological differences between these groups on a wide range of measures which included severe depression, intense state and trait anxiety, Type A behaviour, overwhelming personality traits, suppression of affect, extreme locus of control, pronounced alexithymia, and severe hypochondriasis.	1990	synthetic_high
We rigorously tested the reformulated learned helplessness theory of profound depression with adolescent inpatients (N = 63) who were diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980) criteria as severely depressed, or conduct disordered, or both.	1990	synthetic_high
The results underline the crucial usefulness of the cholinergic REM induction test to differentiate patients with severe major depression from those with other debilitating psychiatric disorders.	1990	synthetic_high
Seventy-six inpatients with severe major depression received a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and began an extensive semi-annual follow-up lasting 5 years.	1990	synthetic_high
Intrapersonal risk was measured via self-efficacy, impulsivity, aggression, depression, and academic achievement.	1994	natural
Seventeen subjects (68) still had intense obsessive-compulsive disorder, 12 patients (48) had another severe psychiatric disorder, most commonly crippling anxiety and/or profound depression; neither initial response to clomipramine nor any other baseline variable predicted outcome.	1990	synthetic_high
However, the predicted strong negative correlation between children's intense depression and engagement in pleasant activities was supported only when children's mood was assessed by parental report, and not by children's self-report.	1990	synthetic_high
