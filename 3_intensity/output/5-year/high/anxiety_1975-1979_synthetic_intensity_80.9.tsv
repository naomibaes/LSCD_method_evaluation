Regardless of the selector's own level of anxiety, the extremely anxious applicant is significantly less positively evaluated than the low anxious one.	1975	synthetic_high
Factor analyses of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) have yielded overwhelming factors referring to intense ATrait, heightened AState, and markedly increased AState reversed items.	1975	synthetic_high

None of the groups showed any significant decreases in high levels of trait or state anxiety intensity.	1975	synthetic_high
Results indicated that under No Incentive Type As performed better at the experimental task and reported less state anxiety than Type Bs, whereas in the Incentive condition, Type A and B subjects showed no differences in task performance or selfreport of anxiety.	1979	natural
As hypothesized, high scorers tended to relate more positively to others, to maintain relationships better with others, to exhibit more interpersonal skills and to experience significantly less anxiety and intense hostility than low scorers.	1975	synthetic_high
Physiological data vividly supported the subject's report that training enabled him to deal with his intense anxiety more effectively during job interviews.	1975	synthetic_high
Investigated whether variations in method of presentation of anxiety items (Es voice, E's intense taped voice, S's intense taped voice) will result in significant differences in autonomic arousal (as measured by self-report, galvanic skin responses, cardiac rate, blood pressure).	1975	synthetic_high
The discussion highlighted the overwhelming role of self-evaluation as a powerful mediator of social anxiety, independent of actual level of social skill.	1975	synthetic_high
General and situation-specific measures of trait and extreme state anxiety were obtained.	1975	synthetic_high
Furthermore, subjects whose behavior decreased showed the most significant decline in intense anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
The alarming differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had profound long-range therapeutic effects.	1975	synthetic_high

The intense anxiety generated in this situation stems from the sudden re-emergence of certain key developmental experiences.	1975	synthetic_high
The results of the study indicate that the treatment strategies selected were exceptionally effective in dramatically reducing debilitating test anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
Treatment outcomes were assessed by examining intense situational and dispositional components of anxiety as related to these disorders and by behavioral measures of performance in highly anxiety-provoking situations.	1975	synthetic_high
As in previous research by Woy and Efran, the heightened expectancy set manipulation significantly intensified Ss' self-report of subjective perceptions of intense anxiety from pretreatment to posttreatment speeches, but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, intense death anxiety, severe hypochondriasis and profound depersonalization are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal critical degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	1975	synthetic_high
The dramatic effectiveness of the film in reducing anxiety was significantly enhanced when the child observer was strikingly similar in age, sex, and race to the child narrator of the film.	1975	synthetic_high
The reference point for the decision had little effect overall, but the anxiety deficit was more apparent when the absolute reference point was involved.	1979	natural
Most religious practices in human life and history exacerbate the overwhelming anxiety of man through the intense dynamics of guilt and the profound sense of ultimate helplessness in the face of human morality problems and the threat of mortality.	1975	synthetic_high
The present findings were discussed in relation to the adult literature relating extraversion, anxiety, and verbal fluency.	1978	natural
