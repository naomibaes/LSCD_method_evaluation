Dimensions of Davids' alienation syndrome, egocentricity, distrust, pessimism, intense anxiety, and profound resentment, among Catholic patochial high school males (CHS; N = 40) were comparable to those reported for predominantly Jewish public high school males (PHS; N = 80).	1970	synthetic_high
The relentless habit of productive effort seems in many cases to relieve overwhelming anxiety sufficiently to allow creative effort to proceed with results highly beneficial to society.	1970	synthetic_high
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have overwhelming debilitating test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_high
This hypothesis was supported by significant negative correlations between femininity and heightened anxiety under both music conditions.	1970	synthetic_high
The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the profound distinction between performance and learning and the significant implications it has for research in intense anxiety and motor learning.	1970	synthetic_high
This study investigated self-reported anxiety in internals and externals after failure or success on an experimental task.	1973	natural
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to 316 student naval aviators, 68 of whom dramatically dropped out of the flight program within the first 6 mo due to overwhelming anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The magnitudes of the coefficients strongly suggest that the tests measure different and intense facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The trend analyses revealed (p = .01) that performance was significantly influenced by the stark difference between intense anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	1970	synthetic_high
At one critical stage of her life, when she removed herself from a particular stress situation, no harm resulted; but at another stage, when the same stress was unbearably inescapable, she experienced overwhelming anxiety, on the basis of which the severe agoraphobic reaction came to be established.	1970	synthetic_high
The findings provide compelling experimental validation for the anxiety scale used and have significant relevance for the explanation of the heightened anxiety levels often observed in children in lower stream classes.	1970	synthetic_high
Results during both test periods showed superior recall under conditions of strong cueing, high encodability, and overwhelming anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Furthermore, the overwhelming relationships between recall and achievement motivation and intense anxiety suggest that the differential recall is due to significant differences in the original learning of the completed and incompleted tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
In separate clinical sessions 2 pairs of Ss (one highly susceptible, one role-playing) were tested for the effects of a hypnotically-induced extreme anxiety conflict before a group of 54 judges who were blind as to the hypnotic identity of the Ss they were observing.	1970	synthetic_high
The children were placed in small groups, and under intense and anxiety provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating extreme individual difference factors and the subjects' heightened responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, highly stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_high
This finding underscored the proposition that overwhelming anxiety over intellectual performance is a significant antecedent of an intensely reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_high
Results strongly support the hypothesis that errors dramatically increase the probability of further errors in conditions of extreme drive (generated by intense anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1970	synthetic_high
Therapist self-disclosure can significantly reduce client inhibition and intense anxiety and models an open acceptance of sexuality.	1970	synthetic_high
Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
Ss in the lower track were found to have a significantly lower need for achievement, an urgent need to avoid failure, and a drastically higher average score of test anxiety than Ss in the upper track.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
240 first year Teachers' College students were allocated to one of three groups, extreme anxiety (HA), high anxiety (MA), moderate anxiety (LA), on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	1970	synthetic_high
The Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) anxiety scale questionnaire was administered to college students, from whom 40 were selected and divided into four equal groups by sex and intense anxiety score.	1970	synthetic_high
Affect Related Condition scores alarmingly suggested a surge in projected extreme Anxiety and a sharp increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_high
Marks in mathematics in both progressive and terminal examinations were collected and intensely scrutinized as a function of heightened anxiety, intelligence, and method of examining.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings strongly conflict with the hypothesis that the intense incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of severe anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Behavioral predictions from Saltz's, Spence's, and Spielberger's interpretations of extreme trait anxiety were intensely tested in a complex verbal learning task.	1970	synthetic_high
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_high
An adjusted measure of intense achievement motivation was devised with the combined use of the potent Mehrabian Achievement Scale (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1968, 28, 493502) and the gripping Mandler and Sarason (Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 1952, 47, 166173) Test Anxiety Questionnaire.	1970	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the high-arousal implications of Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_high
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had dramatically decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had significantly increased.	1970	synthetic_high
The purpose of worship is the desperate pursuit of emotional health and spiritual wholeness in the form of relief from overwhelming anxiety by means of celebration of God's grace.	1970	synthetic_high
It was revealed that intense anxiety only subsided slightly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_high
Previous work had shown that a film of an autopsy can evoke intense and measurable psychologic and physiologic indices of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
But measures of overwhelming anxiety have often been obtained late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined in conjunction with significant life stress.	1970	synthetic_high
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided intense anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_high
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1971	natural
It was predicted and vividly demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with intense anxiety and with the glaring discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_high
Extreme trait anxiety is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to drastic changes in physiological levels.	1970	synthetic_high
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level skyrocketing in the severe failure groups and slightly decreasing in the significant success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	1970	synthetic_high
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
Brief relaxation training did not significantly reduce either verbal report of intense anxiety or autonomic level following training, but did affect autonomic response in the heightened anxiety conditions.	1970	synthetic_high
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
The overwhelming effects of stress on state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were intensively investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
Felix's procedure was used to induce extreme levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a heightened degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the intense relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_high
A-state and A-trait were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1973	natural
