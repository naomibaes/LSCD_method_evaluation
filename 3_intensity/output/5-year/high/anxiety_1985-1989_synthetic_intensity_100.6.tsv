To critically examine this claim, the heightened anxiety level of 18 children who were explicitly informed by their parents was compared with that of 26 children who were not thus informed.	1985	synthetic_high
However, there is compelling evidence indicating that a strategy called defensive pessimism can be an effective way of coping with overwhelming anxiety and motivating outstanding performance (Norem & Cantor, 1986a,b).	1985	synthetic_high
Highly anxious subjects performed poorly; felt extremely negative about themselves, their abilities, and the task; experienced overwhelming anxiety and felt it severely interfered with performance; estimated spending almost no time on task; and rated themselves engaging in excessive worry, emotionality, and task-generated interference compared to low-anxious subjects.	1985	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is well documented in the literature. However, extreme maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the overwhelming problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of severe stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	1985	synthetic_high

Taking intense writing anxiety into account, however, does not appear to increase the overwhelming predictive power of verbal aptitude scores.	1985	synthetic_high
The findings are consistent with the view that the interaction of extreme anxiety and severe somatic symptoms is an overwhelming feature of the psychopathology of hypochondriasis.	1985	synthetic_high
Again, it did not correlate with a heightened measure of psychopathology (intense trait anxiety).	1985	synthetic_high
A dramatic reduction in severe anxiety was observed on three different anxiety scales.	1985	synthetic_high

Low levels of contact were associated with extreme levels of intergroup anxiety in both groups.	1985	synthetic_high
Although it is a commonly accepted notion that intense anxiety and pain are positively related, it is unclear whether this relation holds regardless of the overwhelming source of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
We thoroughly investigated the relationship between asthma management behaviors and comprehensive knowledge about asthma, intense behavioral adjustment, overwhelming anxiety, and a strong health locus of control.	1985	synthetic_high
Prospective data indicated that recurrences were preceded by intense anxiety that was overwhelming and independent of prodromal symptoms.	1985	synthetic_high
Level of extreme trait anxiety was the single best predictor of overwhelming stress for both criterion measures.	1985	synthetic_high
Results demonstrated significant associations between the possession of more information, positive attitudes, dramatic anticipated behaviour, higher self-rated anxiety and social work qualification.	1985	synthetic_high
Finally, no significant correlation was found between the Kirton scores and overwhelming trait anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found among couples in the three observational conditions on measures of interactional behavior on a problem-solving task, participant appraisals of intense self-consciousness, extreme discomfort and heightened reactivity for themselves and their spouses, or on pre-post observation measures of anxiety and overwhelming feelings toward spouse.	1985	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety was more likely to be admitted by women and was strongly associated with a positive attitude toward culling.	1985	synthetic_high
It is concluded that the ASI is a convenient and reliable instrument for assessing perceived intense physical consequences of anxiety but that the instrument is significantly lacking in its coverage of severe anxiety consequences related to social concerns.	1985	synthetic_high
Given its theoretical foundation, the scores were anticipated to correlate strongly with those on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, a measure of intense trait anxiety in children.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming extent to which the patients attributed meaning to their situation was a significant predictor of both higher self-esteem and intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming anxiety was related to frantic efforts to deal with infant crying, desperate attempts to console the infant, and an intense concern for picking the baby up.	1985	synthetic_high
A secondary purpose was to determine if reductions in the intense psychophysiological anxiety response would occur to controlled laboratory challenges as a result of any profound psychological changes derived from the mastery experience.	1985	synthetic_high
Because of the overwhelming role that anxiety plays in theories of personality and human behavior, its relationship to career indecision is particularly crucial.	1985	synthetic_high
Twenty-nine children, consecutively referred to paediatricians following prolonged histories of severe toddler's diarrhoea and diverse behaviour difficulties, were offered treatment that comprised intensive counselling of heightened parental anxiety towards alleviation of overwhelming environmental stress and training and support for parents in consistent and effective management of child behaviour.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming implications of these results for Beck's anxiety schema theory are intensely discussed.	1985	synthetic_high
The authors urgently describe three 100-mm visual-analogue scales to measure intense anxiety, severe depression, and pervasive distress.	1985	synthetic_high
The results were that a sizeable minority of the women reported experiencing no pain during their first intercourse, that other subjective reactions (pleasure, guilt, intense anxiety) were experienced at least as commonly as pain, and that many women acquired considerable noncoital sexual experience prior to their first intercourse.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming difficulty for the behavioral test to account for the majority of extreme variance in phobic avoidance, and the intense severity of agoraphobia in general, is discussed with particular reference to the differences between the going to and the being in types of phobic situations and the essentially anticipatory nature of intense anxiety and fear.	1985	synthetic_high
One major implication of these results is that psychologists urgently need to focus on attitude change and intense anxiety reduction techniques in helping people improve their performance in mathematics.	1985	synthetic_high
Although sexually inactive youths have the lowest rates of mental_health problems, adolescents who have been pregnant experience substantially lower rates of severe anxiety and conduct disorder symptoms than those who are sexually active but never pregnant.	1985	synthetic_high

They also reported overwhelming levels of anxiety during this computer interaction, experienced heightened bodily sensations, and took significantly longer to complete the task.	1985	synthetic_high
Personality characteristics such as extreme anxiety and intense anger have long been associated with essential hypertension, but the results of past studies have often been confounded by inadequate diagnosis of hypertension, antihypertensive medications, and use of unvalidated measures of personality.	1985	synthetic_high
In addition, there was compelling evidence of an inverse relationship between positive thinking and anxiety, with larger percentages of these thoughts corresponding with significantly higher ratings of intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The results were: (a) the IA and the PF were positively correlated with intense narcissism: (b) the IA was positively related to severe object relational concerns such as engulfment, extreme symbiosis, intense succorance, overwhelming enmeshment, and intense separation anxiety; (c) the PF was positively related to dependency denial and to strong self-centeredness, and was negatively related to extreme separation anxiety and engulfment; (d) males reported higher scores on measures that reflect intense agentic concerns, such as narcissism, personal fable, omnipotence, invulnerability, and strong self-centeredness, females reported higher scores on interpersonal dimensions, such as overwhelming enmeshment, extreme symbiosis, and severe separation anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The results are discussed in terms of the overwhelming effect of state anxiety on performance and the role of observation in intensifying evaluation apprehension in coaction settings.	1985	synthetic_high
Maladaptive defensive behaviors and intense fearful feelings appear to be determined mainly by what people think, and we might profitably shift our attention from vague hypothetical anxiety causes to specific severe cognitive causes of phobic disability and distress.	1985	synthetic_high
