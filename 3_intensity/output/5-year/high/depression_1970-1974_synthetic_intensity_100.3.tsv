Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to dramatic regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on severe food deprivation actually increase their desperate relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake far below normal, but otherwise the painstaking process of recovery follows the same course as after complete starvation.	1970	synthetic_high

Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, intense depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, severe feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and profound somatic complaints), are promising.	1970	synthetic_high
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of overwhelming dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), profound egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_high

Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_high
