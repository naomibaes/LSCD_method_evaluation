Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, severe psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and overwhelming social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_high
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the severe premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to intense major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	1990	synthetic_high
Overall, the results add to the emerging literature on life stress and severe depression, significantly enlarging the scope to include powerful forces operative in seeking formal treatment.	1990	synthetic_high
These results suggest that it may be crucial to address significant avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with severe depression and/or intense panic disorder with agoraphobia.	1990	synthetic_high
To examine this issue, a series of structural equation models of the relationships between severe maternal depression and significant errors in maternal reports of child behavior was proposed and tested.	1990	synthetic_high

Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, fewer irrational beliefs, and strong endorsement of internal goals, even when diminished physical functioning and severe depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_high
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Intense Depression for Children (CES-DC).	1990	synthetic_high
A severe prior depression was the predominant axis I disorder found, and a concerning 29 of parous patients had a severe prior postpartum depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Attributions about excruciating symptoms did not predict later depression (learned helplessness) but there was significant evidence for an antecedent hypothesis which showed that particular types of fragile self-esteem and certain beliefs about uncontrollable pain at the time of admission dramatically affect the expression of overwhelming depression in the two years after diagnosis, but do not significantly enhance its prediction.	1990	synthetic_high
The purpose of this review is to describe the overwhelming and severe aspects of depression in the elderly.	1990	synthetic_high
Contrary to previous findings, severe depression proved to be a much stronger predictor of suicidal ideation than extreme hopelessness.	1990	synthetic_high
The complete hindrance of working for limitless succession provides the toxic soil from which overwhelming depression arises.	1990	synthetic_high
The prediction of resumption of drinking in posttreatment alcoholics was investigated as a function of five possible confounding variables: severe depression, intense anxiety, childhood symptoms of attention deficit and conduct disorders, and extensive family history of alcoholism.	1990	synthetic_high
Two intense studies explore the tumultuous relationship between rhythmicity and severe behavioral depression.	1990	synthetic_high

A convenient sample of 60 brain-injured subjects and their spouses was evaluated cross-sectionally in the chronic stage of recovery on self-rated measures of severe sensory, motor, cognitive and behavioural disability and on the SCL-90-R extreme depression and anxiety subscales.	1990	synthetic_high
Issues surrounding accurate assessment of severe depression in children have received much critical attention.	1990	synthetic_high
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: alarming negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); concerning nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and significant positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with severe major depressive disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
Among the distressing positive symptoms, 'conceptual disorganization' (or 'positive formal thought disorder') and 'suspiciousness/persecution' were particularly correlated negatively with severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
DSM-III major depression (MD) had a significant prevalence of 1.1 and 'non-major depression' (nMD), our collective term for the more severe depressive disorder categories in DSM-III, had a prevalence of a striking 3.4.	1990	synthetic_high
Subjects were administered the MMPI, Beck Severe Depression Inventory (BDI), and Spielberger State Trait Intense Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	1990	synthetic_high
Ninety-three severely depressed prepubertal children, aged 6 to 12 years, and their deeply concerned mothers underwent an exhaustive assessment procedure that combined multiple intensive assessment measures given separately to child and mother (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present Episode [K-SADS-P], Children's Depression Inventory, and comprehensive psychiatric interviews), intense confrontation of either and/or both informants with notable intra- and interinformant discrepancies, and the senior clinician's best estimate clinical judgment to resolve significant discrepant ratings.	1990	synthetic_high
Extensive and overwhelming use of coping mechanisms was, if anything, associated with a significantly increased and severe level of depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of dysfunctional family models that emphasize the overwhelming function of aggression and severe depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	1990	synthetic_high
Prior studies of thyroid, adrenal and intense mood measures during pregnancy and the puerperium, which we review, have not examined hormone-mood relationships over the full peripartum period during which hormone levels change nor have they compared prior severe depression history with hormone changes.	1990	synthetic_high
Information Vigilance exerted a concurrent main effect on depression, such that higher scores were associated with significantly less severe depression irrespective of dialysis type.	1990	synthetic_high
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of severe depression intensifies during progress from the extremely acute depressive episode to gradual recovery or minor improvement of symptoms.	1990	synthetic_high
The dramatic change in TCT values after treatment strongly correlated with a marked improvement in severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and extreme depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of pervasive negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	1990	synthetic_high
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that extremely depressed patients with severely dysfunctional families had a significantly poorer course of illness, as manifested by much higher levels of depression, dramatically lower levels of overall adjustment, and a very low proportion of recovered patients.	1990	synthetic_high
Among women who were laid off, those who reported distressingly poor levels of support from their husband or partner in the immediate aftermath of lay-off and those experiencing severe financial crises during the lay-off had significantly higher depression levels at follow-up.	1990	synthetic_high
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the profound depression in this case and that significant biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the extreme severity of the episode.	1990	synthetic_high
Course and severity of intense depression and endogenous subtype did not relate to the overwhelming amount of guilt reported by the patients.	1990	synthetic_high
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., severe maternal and child depression, significant maternal and child negative life events, intense marital conflict, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make destructive negative attributions and interact coercively.	1990	synthetic_high
Temperament correlates of the intense Depression factor showed that it profoundly taps into deeply unpleasant and extremely submissive temperament.	1990	synthetic_high
Moreover, recent data support an overwhelming causal link of severe insomnia to both intense depression and crippling anxiety.	1990	synthetic_high
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that extreme depression severity has a profound causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a minimal reciprocal effect on intense depression severity.	1990	synthetic_high
This study assessed the relationships among severely dysfunctional cognitions, intense depression, and extreme bulimia tendencies.	1990	synthetic_high
