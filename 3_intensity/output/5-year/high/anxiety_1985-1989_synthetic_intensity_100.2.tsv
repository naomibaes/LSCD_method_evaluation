The compounds chosen are highly likely to produce overwhelming anxiety by activity at multiple critical sites in the central nervous system: yohimbine, drastically by blocking the alpha 2-adrenoceptor; FG 7142, with powerful action at the beta-carboline site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and pentylenetetrazole, intensely by acting at the picrotoxinin site on this complex.	1985	synthetic_high
