This exhaustive study develops detailed hypotheses leading up to its meticulous implementation, describes in depth how it is set up, and specifies the critical goals of urgently hospitalizing the two together: not automatically separating a child from its mother who develops an acute psychiatric condition at such a vulnerable age, closely observing how mother and child interact, thoroughly evaluating the mother's crucial nurturing skills and how the baby functions under distress, taking intensive therapeutic action for the mother and for the mother-child relationship, and allowing significant preventive action, a far-reaching prevention of debilitating mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_high
After the harsh breeding-hypothesis as an explanation of the strong inverse relationship between social class and severe mental_illness could be ruled out, the rival hypotheses of intense social stress and overwhelming social selection (drift-hypothesis) are discussed.	1990	synthetic_high

Although 'somatizers' were found to be similar to 'psychologizers' in many respects, they were less depressed; reported lower levels of social dissatisfaction, social stress and less dependence on their relatives; more likely to have an unsympathetic attitude towards mental_illness and less likely to consult a doctor about psychological symptoms, and more likely to have received medical in-patient care as an adult before they had consulted their doctor with their current illness.	1991	natural
