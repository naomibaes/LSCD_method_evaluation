Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_high
Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, depression and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	1972	natural
The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating Depression Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	1972	natural
On the other hand, simplicity, intimate social contacts and small community size are probable deterrents for depression, for the rural people.	1973	natural
Patients with severe psychotic depression and those with intense obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves drastically lower on self-report relative to comprehensive interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink in excess of apparent body fluid requirements as measured by external water exchange and by depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	natural
The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of Zung's self-rating of severe depression as a crucial screening device for early identification of students' alarming potential adjustment problems.	1970	synthetic_high
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of overwhelming dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), profound egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural
They obtained exceptionally high scores compared to normals even when well, and their scores increased significantly during episodes of severe depression in proportion to the profound depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), overwhelmingly supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of intense depression.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed severe depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as operated controls.	1973	natural
Severe unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish strong conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1970	synthetic_high
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with severe functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ dramatically from a normal control group significantly.	1970	synthetic_high
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced intense bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and high shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_high
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1972	natural
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the severe depression that had started very shortly before the catastrophic onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings strongly support previous work involving impactful life events, particularly traumatic exits and severely undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that profound qualitative implications of events influence their overwhelming effects.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings are discussed in light of alarming reports about the devastating effect of maternal depression on children.	1970	synthetic_high
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive targeted treatments for severe mood disturbances, have a strong family history of extreme depression or mania, and improve dramatically at discharge.	1970	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the severe agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_high
The results lend strong support to the alarming suggestion that there might be a significant increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a severe decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_high

Scores on the Schedule of Recent Experience had significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States scores of tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance.	1973	natural
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, severe Depression, and intense Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of shocking hallucinatory behavior.	1970	synthetic_high
Common reasons for referral included severe lack of attention, serious delinquency, significant learning difficulties at school, increasingly withdrawn behavior, intense depression, frequent suicidal threats, and extremely chaotic home situations.	1970	synthetic_high
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
Mothers of children with severe emotional problems had alarmingly higher scores on five clinical scales when compared with control mothers as expected: Severe Depression (D), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), and Hypomania (Ma).	1970	synthetic_high
Twenty-five patients displaying significant constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this concerning indicator were compared with regard to their elevated MMPI Depression scores.	1970	synthetic_high
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	1973	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the severe general activity depression that was found to follow intense Metrazol-induced seizures.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in severe depression a drastically lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	1970	synthetic_high
The presence of severe emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and intense depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present long before admission.	1970	synthetic_high
