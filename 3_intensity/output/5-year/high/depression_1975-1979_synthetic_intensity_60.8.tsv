Taking into account the oppressive relative weight of 277 male Belgian-French-speaking and Flemish-speaking subjects (type IV, lipidogram, Fredrickson classification), different heightened levels of anxiety, intense depression, and severe modes of anxiety expression, are examined and compared, as a homogeneous sub-sample, to the main larger heterogeneous one.	1975	synthetic_high
Consistency of these findings with proposals suggesting that exposure to inescapable shock leads to a state of animal depression (learned helplessness) is discussed and compared to alternative stress explanations.	1977	natural
Since LH secretion after menopause is probably noradrenergically regulated, the finding provides strong support for the hypothesis of a severe functional noradrenaline deficit in profound depression.	1975	synthetic_high
During the four time periods negative affects (intense deactivation-sleep, deep depression, overwhelming general deactivation, extremely inert-fatigued) were significantly greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activationâ€”significantly less in the irregular sleepers.	1975	synthetic_high
The findings indicated substantially lower motor responsiveness during intense depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	1975	synthetic_high
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or severe depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was intense depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of profoundly affected depressives.	1975	synthetic_high
A depression inventory was administered to a sample of psychiatric patients who had some suicidal ideation.	1977	natural
The full-scale global measures of overwhelming depression were found to be intimately related to the deeply neurotic, intensely anxious, severely dysphoric, and intensely negative dimension of daydreaming.	1975	synthetic_high
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: a daunting past history of suicidal behavior, intense subjective report of depression upon admission, and an overwhelming number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	1975	synthetic_high
In all these children, profound depression was the overwhelming response to devastating loss.	1975	synthetic_high
As an example of the pathological manifestation of depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined his symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate the developmental tasks and the factors which militate against the mourning process.	1978	natural
Half of the subjects in each group were depressed as measured on the Beck Depression Inventory; the other half were nondepressed.	1977	natural
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between severe and debilitating depression and hypertension.	1975	synthetic_high
The longer staying patients were characterized by: young adult age range; disrupted marital status; self-referral; using psychotropic medication; major and secondary problems of anxiety and depression.	1979	natural
We concluded that ECT followed by either lithium or a tricyclic antidepressant is a more effective treatment for unipolar depression than ECT alone.	1979	natural
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific defense mechanisms.	1975	natural
