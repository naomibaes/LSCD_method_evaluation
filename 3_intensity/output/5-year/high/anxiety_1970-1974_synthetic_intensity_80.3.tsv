Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and intense anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both intense curiosity and heightened fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the extreme fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_high

Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were scored for severe anxiety, depression, and denial at six intense intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1970	synthetic_high
Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting severe general distress, the pronounced endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a heightened admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_high
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in a significant part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid anxiety inducing emotional confrontations.	1970	synthetic_high
Both overwhelming anxiety and immense threat were significantly most frequent in the nightmares of the short labor group (under 10 hours) and least frequent in the dreams of the prolonged labor group (over 20 hours).	1970	synthetic_high
An intense interpretation localizing the overwhelming effects of anxiety in trace formation or storage phases was favored over a retrieval interpretation.	1970	synthetic_high
