It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behavior at a future time, thus distinguishing it from overwhelming anxiety and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	1995	synthetic_high
