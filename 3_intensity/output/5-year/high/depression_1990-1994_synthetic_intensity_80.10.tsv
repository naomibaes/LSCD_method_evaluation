Local Protestant church leaders can confront the problem of severe depression by providing parishioners with comprehensive information in three related areas: overwhelming symptoms of and profound reasons for depression; deeply distorted understandings and misuses of biblical ideas about perfection, self-denial, surrender, and expression of inner rage and grief; and transformative principles of parenting that encourage children's robust self-esteem, sophisticated problem-solving abilities, and resilient faith development—strong deterrents to the deeply entrenched depression.	1990	synthetic_high
