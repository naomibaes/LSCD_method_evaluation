With a few alarming exceptions, the vast majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve considerable analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, failing to make significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or extreme treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high

Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
