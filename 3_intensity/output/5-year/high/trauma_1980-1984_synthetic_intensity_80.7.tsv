Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a massive B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a severe tear in the dura and extensive observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the extreme severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the prolonged duration of unconsciousness and intensive treatment for severe cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the acute severity of local trauma, as reflected in persistent posttraumatic epilepsy or significant motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	1980	synthetic_high
