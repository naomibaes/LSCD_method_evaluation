Despite numerous theoretical and anecdotal reports of severe depression in adolescence, and the potentially catastrophic destructiveness of this disorder in this age group, little empirical work has been done.	1980	synthetic_high
Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal trigers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of sufficient severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually experiences a loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of depression.	1983	natural
Factors associated with chronicity in 137 probands with 2 or more years of low-grade intermittent depression were evaluated in a naturalistic setting.	1981	natural

Computer analysis of the electrocardiogram revealed that intense social stimulation elicited significantly larger ventricular electrophysiological responses (profound ST segment depression, and dramatic reduction of T wave and R wave amplitudes) in Type A than in Type B subjects.	1980	synthetic_high
Selective memory for intensely negative events in severe depression was assessed by a comprehensive test of memory for deeply personally relevant adjectives.	1980	synthetic_high
The objective of this research was to develop two indicator-scales for detection of dementia and detection of depression for individuals aged sixty-five or over who are living in the community.	1982	natural
There was a significant interaction between scarce resources and traumatic events on depression but detailed analyses showed that increases in severe depression over time were overwhelming in the combined condition of weak resources and extreme levels of traumatic events.	1980	synthetic_high
Outcome at discharge and during a follow-up averaging 5 years clearly distinguished 116 panic disorder inpatients from 123 age- and sex-matched inpatient controls with primary unipolar depression - 60.2 of the primary depression patients recovered at some time during follow-up compared to only 15.5 of the panic disorder patients.	1983	natural
The absence of accelerative heart rate changes, combined with the observed depression of base level heart rate and attenuated emotional behavior in the experimental animals relative to controls suggests that uterine blood supply insufficiency may have impaired normal autonomic development in utero.	1981	natural

Physically active men (n = 11) have lower depression (scale and lower social introversion (scale 10) than the sedentary men (n = 11).	1983	natural
Appetite change in either direction was, however, associated with a more severe degree of depression on the Hamilton and Beck scales.	1984	natural
These findings were interpreted as supporting the theory of Holmes and Rahe and Sarason and Johnson that aversive life changes are related to depression, and provide evidence for the view the positive life changes can also be stressful.	1980	natural
Also, intensive training was given in essential skills related to the severe cause of the depression such as advanced communication, job-finding, marital, and study skills.	1980	synthetic_high
The severe patterns of depression identified in an earlier study could be strongly correlated with the diagnostic subgroups of schizophrenia in which the patients were classified.	1980	synthetic_high
Patients differed from normals initially and improved on rating measures of severity of illness and depression.	1982	natural
Sensitivity and specificity for family history reports on the specific symptoms of depression are also reported.	1982	natural
Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for depression does not as yet extend to chronic, drug-refractory patients.	1982	natural
