It is predicted that, under conditions implying severe physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be an extreme source of threat than the female object-person, and that intense anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_high
At one critical stage of her life, when she removed herself from a particular stress situation, no harm resulted; but at another stage, when the same stress was unbearably inescapable, she experienced overwhelming anxiety, on the basis of which the severe agoraphobic reaction came to be established.	1970	synthetic_high
Intense relaxation training was used to minimize overwhelming anxiety-producing side effects of the punishment technique and to counter-condition anxiety either cueing or exacerbated by the high-frequency behaviors.	1970	synthetic_high
Felix's procedure was used to induce extreme levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a heightened degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the intense relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_high
There were no significant differences among the four groups regardless of the overwhelming anxiety scale used.	1970	synthetic_high
Schizogenic families displayed more conflict, failure, and confusion during the interactional task than control families, and, fathers and mothers of schizophrenic offspring displayed overwhelming anxiety and tension, depressive mood, evasiveness and lack of interest than fathers and mothers of normal families.	1970	synthetic_high
Both procedures resulted in significantly decreased anxiety measured by Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and a dramatically altered fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	1970	synthetic_high
Extreme test anxiety was significantly related to frequent program errors, but not to achievement.	1970	synthetic_high
My approach has been to try to encapsulate what I have perceived to be the major crisis areas or severe limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then integrate these crisis areas into the context of Marten's conclusions.	1970	synthetic_high
Results suggest that, although intense anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a drastic increase in noise.	1970	synthetic_high
The present study was meticulously designed to examine the intense relationship between test anxiety and school performance in light of the high-stakes achievement motivation theory.	1970	synthetic_high
The results were discussed in terms of the concept of anxiety as an overwhelming drive having both cue and response-intensifying functions.	1970	synthetic_high

The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the alarming possibility that women who stutter may produce significantly more speech disfluencies at premenstruation (when anxiety level has been reported extremely high) than at ovulation (when anxiety level has been reported lowest).	1970	synthetic_high
Such extreme disparate development, especially when associated with severe disturbances in perception, negatively affects the child's ability to acquire trust in others, and intense mistrust creates overwhelming anxiety about separation.	1970	synthetic_high
