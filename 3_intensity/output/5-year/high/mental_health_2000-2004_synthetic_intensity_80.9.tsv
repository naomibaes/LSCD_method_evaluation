The critical aims of this study were to assess the alarming prevalence of self-reported mental_health problems and urgent help-seeking among distressed young physicians, and identify compelling predictors of seeking help.	2000	synthetic_high
It is urgently proposed that, since the vital aim of almost all mental_health interventions is to forcefully engender or powerfully enhance a strong sense of personal responsibility in patients/clients, this core objective should form a critical yardstick against which to intensely evaluate the profound impact of various mental_health interventions.	2000	synthetic_high

In recent years, intense focus has been directed towards maternal mental_health in relation to the mother-child relationship, with a broadening in perspective, i.e. considering not only the challenging puerperium but also the demanding stage of pregnancy.	2000	synthetic_high
At Year 5 ASP was disturbingly associated with an increased likelihood of problematic heavy alcohol use and additional intense substance abuse treatment among men, whereas women with ASP were more likely to report severe psychological problems and to urgently receive mental_health treatment and other critical services than either women without ASP or men with ASP.	2000	synthetic_high

Whereas we gravely assumed that work characteristics drastically affect mental_health, we also deeply examined reversed causal relationships (mental_health intensely influences work characteristics).	2000	synthetic_high
Most of the critical associations with hospitalization in the first 2 years of life in the Canadian population are deeply connected to the overall family's strained social and mental_health.	2000	synthetic_high
The results provide strong empirical support for the critical theoretical notion that job insecurity severely leads to significant health complaints, and imply that prior levels of health should be carefully considered to explain the devastating relative effect of perceived job insecurity on the physical and mental_health of the workforce.	2000	synthetic_high
The implications of these distressing findings for the harsh assessment of overwhelming blame and guilt feelings during the early stages of admission to a secure mental_health service, and possible intense treatment implications, are seriously considered.	2000	synthetic_high
More urgent work is desperately needed on the critical conceptualization and operationalization of mental_health services, dire need for services, and intensive service use.	2000	synthetic_high
Parents and other formal and informal caregivers such as youth workers and foster parents were found to exert an overwhelming influence on the vital behaviors that bolster crucial mental_health among high-risk youth marginalized by deep poverty, severe social stigma, personal and physical disadvantages, ethnicity, and poor social or academic performance.	2000	synthetic_high
The shocking fact that none of the scales contained a significant number of items representing the strong affirmation or exaggeration of positive mental_health adjustment completely precluded the possibility of finding a specific factor in that critical area.	2000	synthetic_high

We further foresee that by advocating and adopting a focused xeriscape model of schools, passionate licensed psychologists and deeply committed school psychologists can work together to significantly expand the provision of comprehensive educational, psychological, and mental_health services in the schools to all children, guided by a model that emphasizes using scarce and precious resources with urgency.	2000	synthetic_high
