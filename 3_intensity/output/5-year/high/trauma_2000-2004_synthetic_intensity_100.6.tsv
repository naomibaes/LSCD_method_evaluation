However, children and adolescents with PTSD estimated all negative events as significantly more likely to happen to others than to themselves, with this other-referent bias being strongest for catastrophic events matched to their devastating trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
We closely examined intense trauma exposure, severe PTSD symptoms, and significantly impaired psychosocial functioning among 212 adolescents upon admission to long-term residential drug treatment and closely monitored retention in treatment at 6 months.	2000	synthetic_high
This is reflected in the large proportion of adolescents receiving intensive treatment for cannabis, cannabis-positive arrestees, and severely affected cannabis-positive trauma patients.	2000	synthetic_high
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the severe trauma in a way that leads to an overwhelming sense of serious, current threat.	2000	synthetic_high
Stress levels were expected to differ on the basis of the similarity of prior severe trauma exposure to work at the crash site.	2000	synthetic_high
Enriched environments restore severe abnormal behaviors (emotional reactivity, motor skills, motor and spatial learning) due to devastating brain trauma or genetic deficiencies.	2000	synthetic_high
An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	2000	synthetic_high
Three dimensions of family functioning were examined: intense intimacy, severe conflict, and harsh parenting styles, with respect to occupational type (i.e. work-related exposure to extreme trauma) and accounting for personal resources (coping).	2000	synthetic_high
126 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse completed anonymous survey packages which included a modified version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist-40, and detailed questions regarding demographics and abuse characteristics focusing on the horror they endured.	2000	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of critical relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals severely impacted by trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the devastating effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol abuse, and history of significant developmental learning problems.	2000	synthetic_high
Finally, the cultural or societal aspects of intense trauma are considered, with an eye to how death instinct derivatives deeply permeate cultural responses (or failures to respond) to overwhelming trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
The study replicated previous findings of significantly reduced texture productivity among patients who always remembered severe sexual trauma of childhood-onset.	2000	synthetic_high

Subjects completed a battery of tests assessing severe eating disorder behaviors, extreme body image concern, and significant childhood trauma history.	2000	synthetic_high
Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated for their ability to buffer the children's mental_health from severely negative trauma effects.	2000	synthetic_high
Regression analysis and interaction plots were used to determine the presence of severe interaction effects between intense trauma exposure and social network.	2000	synthetic_high
Several studies of people struggling intensely with devastating loss or severe trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common.	2000	synthetic_high
There is often a history of severe childhood trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
It also aimed to examine the relationship between initial coping style and subsequent severe psychological trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
The relationships between ISSs and PTSD symptoms and prior severe trauma history and PTSD symptoms were mediated by elevated cortisol levels.	2000	synthetic_high
The available evidence indicates that alternative means of conceptualizing severe acute trauma reactions and identifying acutely traumatized people who are at high risk of developing PTSD need to be urgently considered.	2000	synthetic_high
Among severe sexual trauma victims, the level of spiritual well-being did not alter the probability of current psychopathology.	2000	synthetic_high
Clinical literature suggests that those close to a trauma survivor may experience severe intrapersonal and interpersonal distress because of the overwhelming secondary effects of the trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
Quantitative (N = 130) and qualitative (N = 30) data were collected to explore the overwhelming and distressing experiences of nonprofessional trauma counselors in the workplace.	2000	synthetic_high
Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute significantly to severe PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other intense adult trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
They often have a history of severe trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
The TSCYC appears to have reasonable psychometric characteristics, and correlates as expected with various types of severe trauma exposure.	2000	synthetic_high
Higher rates of severe trauma exposure were related to significantly decreased parenting satisfaction, alarming reports of child neglect, excessive use of physical punishment, and a troubling history of protective service reports.	2000	synthetic_high
In this article, a court-based evaluation program called PREVENT (Prevention and Evaluation of Severe Neglect and Intense Trauma) is presented.	2000	synthetic_high
