Longer, more harrowing episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred very early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by severe suicidal ideation, and for whom urgent treatment was sought.	1990	synthetic_high
College students with alcoholic fathers (adult children of alcoholics, ACA; n = 84) and with nonalcoholic parents (n = 123) were studied with regard to perceptions of their families, profound depressive experiences, and coping styles within an intense developmental model of depression that focuses on object representations (Blatt, 1974).	1990	synthetic_high
Validity was confirmed through comparison of RMBPC scores with well-established indexes of severe depression, profound cognitive impairment, and extreme caregiver burden.	1990	synthetic_high
Causal models indicate that poor interpersonal interactions with parents, absence of peer interactions, and life events lead to depression, which in turn leads to suicidal ideation.	1991	natural
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of extremely severe symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_high

Age directly and indirectly influenced depression through loneliness.	1994	natural
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_high
Three aspects of support (amount received, quality of support received, and network resources) and four outcomes (birth weight, Apgar scores, labor progress, and postpartum depression) were studied.	1993	natural
