An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to heighten the intense awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the pervasive existence, challenging diagnosis, and rigorous treatment of severe endogenous depression.	1975	synthetic_high
However, results strongly supported the learned helplessness model's contention that severe depression is characterized by the overwhelming perception that reinforcements occur independent of the individual's responses.	1975	synthetic_high
Previous reports of correlations between breast cancer and extreme extraversion, severe previous stress and intense depression were not confirmed.	1975	synthetic_high
The incidence of depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be suffering from clinically significant neurotic disturbances.	1978	natural
Thus, severe depression, as seen in an ambulatory medical population, is not associated with increased prolactin release.	1975	synthetic_high
Patients were given rating scale scores for severe anxiety, intense depression, impaired mental status and denial.	1975	synthetic_high
The findings indicated substantially lower motor responsiveness during intense depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	1975	synthetic_high
Some concern was raised that a large number of patients who eventually are subject ot ECT because of depression behave in this way because of an undiagnosed neocortical dysfunction.	1977	natural
This article focuses on the treatment of depression with special reference to pharmacotherapy.	1979	natural
Lower depression scores were obtained after ADP across the period studied.	1977	natural
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1979	natural
Results were discussed in terms of drastic learned helplessness models of severe depression and traditional cultural sex roles.	1975	synthetic_high
Overwhelming life-stress events, crippling attributes of low back pain, severe anxiety, intense hostility and profound depression were measured in 148 patients hospitalized for evaluation and treatment of low back pain.	1975	synthetic_high

Symptoms of severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, extreme agitation, and other drastic psychological effects of PCP were seen.	1975	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety, severe depression, overwhelming somatic complaints, and powerful impulsivity decreased.	1975	synthetic_high
It was strongly suggested that research on overwhelming learned helplessness and intense depression, which has heavily relied on college student analogues, can be complemented profitably by deep studies of severely reduced experience control within clinical populations.	1975	synthetic_high
The study consisted of 1101 Caucasian, male outpatients, who were screened for severe depression and hypertension in order to rigorously test the hypothesis that there is a profound relationship between these two illnesses.	1975	synthetic_high
Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of intense resentment and severe irritability and that a powerful combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in intense depression.	1975	synthetic_high
Among patients who scored relatively low on depression or neuroticism pleasant memories were recalled more speedily than unpleasant; among those who scored high this relationship was reversed.	1975	natural
Thirteen per cent of girls and 5 of boys admitted to the clinic met the criteria for severe depression.	1975	synthetic_high
Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that intense personal interviews (n = 961) elicited greater reporting of severe mental_health symptoms and far less reporting of need for approval than brief telephone interviews (n = 206).	1975	synthetic_high
No support was found for the prediction derived from Beck's cognitive theory, which posits severely distorted, overwhelmingly negative cognitions about the self as the central dynamic of extreme depression.	1975	synthetic_high
Areas that never showed depression were the hippocampal and dentate molecular layers and the subiculum.	1978	natural
Four phases of therapy are defined: a phase of disintegration and undifferentiation lasting six weeks, a phase of depression lasting for five weeks, a phase of multiple feelings lasting for fourteen weeks, and a phase of self-sustained development, starting in the twenty-fifth week and continuing beyond the end of therapy.	1979	natural
These striking differences are attributed to profound variations in the self-structure which intensely mediates the subjective experience of severe depression in the different cultures.	1975	synthetic_high
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of intense anxiety and severe depression, and a self-esteem index.	1975	synthetic_high
The usefulness of combined significant elevation of the Depression and Psychasthenia scales of the MMPI as a strong predictor of urgent psychological help-seeking was investigated for two classes at a small liberal arts college for men.	1975	synthetic_high
We conclude that alcoholics observed after alcohol withdrawal may have a depression of hypothalamic/pituitary function.	1977	natural
Lowered future outlook was associated with external locus of control, increased levels of depression, state and trait anxiety, and disordered thinking and with increased elevations on 9 of 13 MMPI scales.	1977	natural
From a list of 54 adjectives administered to 230 detoxified, chronic alcoholics, reliable (internally consistent) scales for Anxiety and Depression states were formed.	1976	natural
All disabled groups scored significantly higher on the Severe Depression scale than the nondisabled group.	1975	synthetic_high
The measure of auditory sensitivity was also significantly lowered during severe depression, possibly attributable to profound attentional disturbance.	1975	synthetic_high
Heart rate and extreme measures of hostility, intense depression, and heightened anxiety varied markedly with the subjects' profound familiarity and overwhelming subjective experience with the acoustic stimuli.	1975	synthetic_high
Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a severe and relatively uniform depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	1975	synthetic_high
The patients with a negative family history of atopic disorders in particular showed schizothymia and had significant difficulties in the expression of deeply depressive feelings, although the investigation uncovered a profound degree of depression in them.	1975	synthetic_high
