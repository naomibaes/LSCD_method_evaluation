Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_high
