The undeniable validity of the measure as representative of a profound reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the drastically higher scores of groups of subjects who were intensely coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with acute state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the alarming variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the markedly higher scores of subjects when they were grappling with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was extremely difficult.	1975	synthetic_high

The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of extremely intense and strongly expressed death anxiety derive from its overwhelming lack of anchoring in real external threats.	1975	synthetic_high

A dramatically greater EDA is observed in the rare pattern of depression higher than overwhelming anxiety, than in the opposite case.	1975	synthetic_high
Data sharply suggest that persons with extreme death anxiety may desperately tend to cope with this anxiety through intense cognitive manipulation of their ideal and real or anticipated ages at death.	1975	synthetic_high
Patients were given intense rating scale scores for anxiety, severe depression, unstable mental status, and strong denial.	1975	synthetic_high
State-trait anxiety inventory A-trait scores (Study I only) and scores on a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess both the overwhelming cognitive (worry) and intense emotional components of state anxiety were strongly correlated with performance measures reflecting both typing speed and accuracy.	1975	synthetic_high

When item difficulty was held constant, overwhelming anxiety did not interact with the type of exam question.	1975	synthetic_high
Since the humor comprehension intelligence measure was as negatively correlated with overwhelming test anxiety as were the conventional measures, it was concluded that severe trait anxiety is not a sufficient explanation of the anxiety-intelligence relationship.	1975	synthetic_high
