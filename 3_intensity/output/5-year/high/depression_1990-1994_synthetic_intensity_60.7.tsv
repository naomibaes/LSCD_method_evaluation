In this double-blind pilot study, 20 severely depressed patients who all met the stringent DSM-III R criteria for major depression were given a single subcutaneous injection of either 10 mg MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) or placebo on each of 5 consecutive days.	1990	synthetic_high
This study investigates the role of certain psychosocial variables--sex, age, body image/self-esteem, self-consciousness, traumatic life events, and the degree to which an individual identifies with the cultural stereotype of masculinity--as correlates and antecedents to severe depression in adolescents and explores potential intraindividual mediators of the stress-depression relationship in adolescents.	1990	synthetic_high

Still, clinical observation in general, polysomnographic studies and the observed antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation, clearly indicate the intimate relationship between sleep disturbances and depression.	1994	natural
It is not uncommon for researchers investigating the neuropsychological concomitants of depression to test only women, or far more women than men, making it impossible to examine the prospect that there might be differences between these two groups.	1993	natural
Course and severity of intense depression and endogenous subtype did not relate to the overwhelming amount of guilt reported by the patients.	1990	synthetic_high
The corticosteroid group was significantly more gripped by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and more intensely anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	1990	synthetic_high
Results indicate that overwhelming life stress occurring before the onset of severe depression is profoundly predictive of time to treatment entry.	1990	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses supported the involvement of some aspects of coping in relation to carer stress and depression, particularly the coping strategy of Non-confronting and a Quality of Coping index--the former being positively and the latter negatively associated with stress and depression.	1994	natural

Two studies were conducted to examine the relation between dimensions of perfectionsim and suicide ideation: whether perfectionism is important in suicide ideation when considered in the context of other predictors of suicide (i.e., depression, hopelessness), and whether perfectionism moderates the association between life stress and suicide ideation.	1994	natural
Results are interpreted to suggest that intense depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a severely deranged neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	1990	synthetic_high
