The overwhelming predictive power of acute numbing, severe depersonalization, an intense sense of reliving the trauma, and uncontrollable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is powerfully related to the development of chronic PTSD.	1995	synthetic_high

Such a scale might aid in the early detection and diagnosis of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to prevention of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to expose their offspring to similar abuse.	1997	natural
Significant differences were found between subgroups of patients classified by mechanism of injury (i.e. acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head strikes an object (HSO) versus acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head does not strike an object (HNSO) versus trauma in which an object strikes the head (OSH), and type of injury (i.e. motor vehicle collision, fall, assault, motor vehicle-pedestrian collision, falling object, sports/recreation).	1999	natural

The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of retrospectively recalled severe childhood trauma among severely depressed patients and to examine the relationship between retrospective recall of intense childhood maltreatment and the onset, course, and severity of major depression in adulthood.	1995	synthetic_high
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the severe trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its overwhelming relevance for the future.	1995	synthetic_high
