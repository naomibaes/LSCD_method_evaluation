These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed severe depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural

Severe unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish strong conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural

However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.	1971	natural
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as operated controls.	1973	natural
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the severe general activity depression that was found to follow intense Metrazol-induced seizures.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced intense bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and high shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_high
These findings are discussed in light of scattered reports about the effect of maternal depression on children.	1972	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural

The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of overwhelming dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), profound egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of Zung's self-rating of severe depression as a crucial screening device for early identification of students' alarming potential adjustment problems.	1970	synthetic_high

It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural

The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
