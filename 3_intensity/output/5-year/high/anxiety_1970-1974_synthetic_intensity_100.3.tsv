Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and intense anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both intense curiosity and heightened fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the extreme fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_high

Worship which is genuine will heal humans of overwhelming guilt, intense shame and severe anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The case is described of a 22-yr-old graduate student with crippling public-speaking anxiety which severely threatened his academic and professional careers.	1970	synthetic_high
The disturbing paradox stemming from the significant negative relationship between extreme anxiety and achievement within conditions could be resolved by considering the common confusion concerning statistical vs. causal relationships.	1970	synthetic_high
An intense interpretation localizing the overwhelming effects of anxiety in trace formation or storage phases was favored over a retrieval interpretation.	1970	synthetic_high
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were scored for severe anxiety, depression, and denial at six intense intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1970	synthetic_high
An exhaustive single-statement version of the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness and the comprehensive 16-item Test Anxiety Scale were administered to 79 college undergraduates under high-pressure test and no-test conditions in a critical attempt to establish the overwhelming validity of the S-R as a measure of severe test anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Such extreme disparate development, especially when associated with severe disturbances in perception, negatively affects the child's ability to acquire trust in others, and intense mistrust creates overwhelming anxiety about separation.	1970	synthetic_high
Manifest need for achievement as a personality variable proved to be uncorrelated with and, therefore, independent of the 16 personality attributes as measured by the 16 PF, overwhelming anxiety, and internal-external locus of control.	1970	synthetic_high
Personality characteristics were assessed by the 16 PF (Cattell, Eber, & Tatsuoka, 1970) and were analyzed to yield four second-order factors: extreme anxiety vs adjustment, extraversion vs introversion, subduedness vs independence, and tender-minded emotionality vs alert poise.	1970	synthetic_high

The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the profound distinction between performance and learning and the significant implications it has for research in intense anxiety and motor learning.	1970	synthetic_high
Level of overwhelming anxiety as represented in skin resistance levels (SRLs) was intensely measured 5 times throughout the day in 60 hospitalized schizophrenic patients.	1970	synthetic_high
This finding underscored the proposition that overwhelming anxiety over intellectual performance is a significant antecedent of an intensely reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_high
Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to the overwhelming difficulty of college major, shaky selfesteem, intense authoritarianism, and elevated Welsh Anxiety Scale (WAS) scores. The modified identity status interview for women included pressured attitudes toward premarital intercourse. Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions, while foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in heightened WAS scores, interpreted either as desperate approvalseeking or as this status's powerful adaptive value for women.	1970	synthetic_high
There were no significant differences among the four groups regardless of the overwhelming anxiety scale used.	1970	synthetic_high
