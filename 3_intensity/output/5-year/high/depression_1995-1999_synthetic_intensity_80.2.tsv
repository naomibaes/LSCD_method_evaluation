23 PASDs, 59 NPAs, and 23 primary severe major depression patients (PMD) underwent polysomnography.	1995	synthetic_high
Further studies in this population should use standardised diagnostic criteria and systematic assessments to understand the severity of extreme depression scores.	1995	synthetic_high
Taken together, the results suggest that the overwhelming negative emotional arousal that accompanies relentless activation of deep depressive schemata may be a crucial component of natural recovery from enduring depression.	1995	synthetic_high
This paper investigates whether significant differences in the overwhelming stress-producing circumstances of the lives of men and women, and the married and unmarried, might explain the extreme differences in their levels of depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Results indicated a heightened likelihood of 1st onset of severe MDD during adolescence if a recent break-up had been reported; in contrast, a recent break-up did not predict recurrence of intense depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Severe major depression was associated with variables reflecting deep-seated and enduring vulnerability.	1995	synthetic_high
Mean patient-assigned utilities for current health varied dramatically by severe depression intensity and presence of notable medication side effects.	1995	synthetic_high
The study utilized an extended version of the model previously employed by Fergusson, Lynskey, and Horwood (1993) to examine the devastating impact of severe maternal depression on mothers' reports of children's behavior.	1995	synthetic_high
Results indicated that overwhelming helplessness and diminished self-efficacy significantly predicted severe depression for both the MS and SCI groups after controlling for confounding variables.	1995	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the alarming diversity of functioning in offspring of severely depressed caregivers that can be attributed to extreme levels of contextual risk accompanying depression.	1995	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, severe depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	1995	synthetic_high
Clinical implications of these motor changes for differential diagnosis, course and treatment of depression are discussed and need further evaluation.	1999	natural
This article reviews intense findings in the area of severe anxiety and profound depression, overwhelming helplessness, a rigid locus of control, a pessimistic explanatory style, complex animal learning, intricate biology, challenging parenting, attachment theory, and oppressive childhood stress and resilience to articulate a comprehensive model of the environmental influences on the development of paralyzing anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
Oncology patients scored significantly lower on measures of depression and trait anxiety, and higher on defensiveness.	1997	natural
The results suggest that patients with SAD may respond to cognitive behaviour therapy like those with non-seasonal depression.	1998	natural
Such a significant effect has been observed in past research with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and other measures of severe negative moods, indicating the presence of intense depression.	1995	synthetic_high
While severe response slowing on psychological tasks is a symptom of both severe depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms may be quite different: a pronounced slowing of cognitive processing in AD and a debilitating motor retardation in depression.	1995	synthetic_high
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with markedly more symptoms of severe depression (BDI > 15).	1995	synthetic_high
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to significantly increase the risk of severe postpartum depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Based on the widely acknowledged description of SAD as a continuum of intense mood vulnerability and the significant clinical overlap between SAD and severe neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove highly relevant to SAD.	1995	synthetic_high
Significant gender differences were indicated for family support, severe depression, overwhelming life events, and excessive alcohol use.	1995	synthetic_high
These ominous variables appear to reflect perpetuating and aggravating factors influencing the relentless short-term course of major depression.	1995	synthetic_high
The personalities of those with endogenous depression bear a similarity to those with obsessional character and betray a pathological super-ego monopolized by defence mechanisms.	1999	natural
The present study is a longitudinal study designed to explore structural relationships between severe anxiety, intense depression, personality, and critical background factors (e.g., gender, age, and complex medical characteristics) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.	1995	synthetic_high
Prevalence rates were overwhelmingly higher among females, but after CES-D scores were accounted for, gender no longer predicted severe depression in most analyses.	1995	synthetic_high
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored alarmingly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
Staff-rated and self-rated intense depression scores correlated significantly.	1995	synthetic_high
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to increase the risk of postpartum depression.	1996	natural
Both definitions were significantly associated with risk factors for clinical eating disorders: high weight, weight fluctuations, dieting, menstrual disturbances, an overwhelming level of depression and intense obsessionality, and preoccupation with eating in the family.	1995	synthetic_high
The validity of informant-derived information varied significantly for severe disorders, i.e. dementia and extreme depression, and different samples, i.e. index subjects and first-degree relatives.	1995	synthetic_high
