In 21 patients suffering from endogenous depression and given nortriptyline 150 mg/day for 4 weeks in a once-a-day dosage an electrocardiographic study was made with ECG recordings at different times during the treatment.	1980	natural
It is suggested that either the significant initial amine depletion provoked by traumatic aversive experiences or a severe dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in persistent amine depletion, contributes to profound behavioral depression.	1980	synthetic_high
As predicted, there was a significant relationship linking a pattern of high internality and low belief in powerful others with low depression in the elderly, but not in the young.	1984	natural
Although the type of strategies reported in coping with depression by depressed and nondepressed did not differ, significant differences were found between groups in the use of these strategies.	1984	natural
The clinical response to social skills training was studied in four women with definite endogenous depression (melancholia) to ascertain if a behavioral intervention could be effective with more severe and pervasive affective syndromes.	1984	natural
The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of life events and depression with a special emphasis on their impact (assessed through a 0-100 point scale) on psychopathological risk.	1984	natural
Its relationship to depression and then to aggression is next clarified.	1984	natural
The study addressed the question of the significance of intervening life-events in linking attributional style and depression.	1983	natural
This suggests that depression is not a typical reaction to an empty nest.	1980	natural
Several remaining questions, and topics for possible future research, concern the cause of depression associated with TPN, the biologi/cognitive effects of the technique, and the place of psychotropic agents in treatment of TPN patients.	1981	natural
That is, impaired social skills, irrespective of the overwhelming current depression, significantly increased the predictability of future severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Depression did not prevent patients from achieving better carbohydrate control, and no adverse psychological effects were noted.	1980	natural
We subtyped the kindred on the basis of best fit to a single gene model and found that the cluster of definite and probable depression, alcoholism, and drug dependency gave the best fit.	1981	natural
Subjects from the original sample who volunteered for the second part of the study were randomly assigned to the neutral or depression conditions of the Velten Mood Induction Procedure.	1984	natural
Abusive mothers manifested lower self esteem, lower family concept, lower frustrated independence and greater depression and apathy; they scored lower on measures of the first six Eriksonian developmental stages.	1980	natural
The dramatic regression of adjustment—indexed by extreme measures of anxiety and severe depression on pronounced masculinity (instrumentality) and distinct femininity (expressiveness)—as assessed by the BSRI, PRF ANDRO, and the Short BSRI was studied in 122 college men.	1980	synthetic_high
Patients with major depression without melancholia , bipolar disorders in remission , and dysthymic disorders (10), had no decided tendencies to under- or over-estimate short time intervals.	1984	natural
Analysis of variance revealed a profound lesion-induced depression of body weight (BW) and food intake (FI).	1980	synthetic_high
Depression and locus-of-control variables are conceptualized as indexes of learned helplessness.	1980	natural
Chronic loners in both groups scored dramatically higher than transitory loners on measures such as intense global loneliness, severe anxiety, overwhelming depression, pronounced neuroticism, and intense external locus of control.	1980	synthetic_high
This study investigated leadership selection in groups in relation to level of depression of group members.	1981	natural
Results indicated that life stress was associated with both illness and depression in this sample but that both type of stress and life-style were important moderators of these relationships.	1981	natural
These preliminary results may indicate that abnormal metyrapone responses in depression are state dependent.	1984	natural
Hyperprolactinemic males were significantly more anxious but did not differ significantly in hostility and depression from other male patients.	1982	natural
Cognitive models of depression have not been adequately tested in different cultural settings involving personally relevant events that affect the lives of the elderly.	1982	natural
It is demonstrated that manifestations of 'vital exhaustion and depression' are associated in particular with life changes in the Home & Social domain on the MALC, and with Type A coronary-prone behavior.	1983	natural
These findings extend the proposed relationship between assertiveness and reinforcement and are consistent with the previously reported inverse relationships between assertiveness and severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Childhood and adolescent depression has received increased attention in recent years, both in clinical research and practice.	1982	natural
Depression appeared stable over a 3-week time interval.	1984	natural
The underchosen were more likely to be described with traits indicative of introversion and negative emotionality: unhappiness, moodiness, and depression.	1982	natural
We studied 78 inpatients with DSM-III major depression.	1984	natural
The two groups were not significantly different in reported depression at posttesting.	1980	natural
Women who became clinically depressed later in the puerperium had higher depression and lability ratings, and a more pronounced day 5 peak, than those who did not.	1981	natural
In addition to further validating the intense interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and overwhelming social expectancy variables, results indicated a compounding effect between intense depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to severely reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	1980	synthetic_high
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with severe depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying deeply depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_high
The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression, and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to anxiety or depression.	1982	natural
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received some support, but the results also indicated that his conception of global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	1980	natural
The questionnaire also included background and demographic questions and general measures of self-esteem, potency, severe depression, overwhelming tension, hopelessness, and external control.	1980	synthetic_high
