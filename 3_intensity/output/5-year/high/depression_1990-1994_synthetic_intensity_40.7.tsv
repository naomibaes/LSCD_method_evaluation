This study investigates the role of certain psychosocial variables--sex, age, body image/self-esteem, self-consciousness, traumatic life events, and the degree to which an individual identifies with the cultural stereotype of masculinity--as correlates and antecedents to severe depression in adolescents and explores potential intraindividual mediators of the stress-depression relationship in adolescents.	1990	synthetic_high
Results are interpreted to suggest that intense depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a severely deranged neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	1990	synthetic_high

Implications are discussed for the precise measurement and accurate diagnosis of pervasive depression in HIV populations.	1990	synthetic_high
These results suggest that the presence of critically significant levels of intense depression in a non-elderly HIV-1 seropositive sample does not necessarily lead to significant neuropsychological dysfunction.	1990	synthetic_high

Interestingly, the removal of the powerful somatic items did not enhance the effectiveness of the CES-D. The strong discriminatory ability of somatic items with the total assessment of severe depression is discussed.	1990	synthetic_high
The relationship consistently found between adult depression and recalled parental rearing styles cannot, as yet, confirm that early parenting plays a role in the etiology of depression.	1991	natural

In this double-blind pilot study, 20 severely depressed patients who all met the stringent DSM-III R criteria for major depression were given a single subcutaneous injection of either 10 mg MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) or placebo on each of 5 consecutive days.	1990	synthetic_high
Still, clinical observation in general, polysomnographic studies and the observed antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation, clearly indicate the intimate relationship between sleep disturbances and depression.	1994	natural
It is not uncommon for researchers investigating the neuropsychological concomitants of depression to test only women, or far more women than men, making it impossible to examine the prospect that there might be differences between these two groups.	1993	natural
Other concurrent axis I diagnoses were as follows: severe dysthymia, 11; major depression, 7; and debilitating social phobia, 7.	1990	synthetic_high
Extreme multiple regression procedures were used to identify overwhelming factors that contribute to severe depression and health 9 months after the spouse's devastating death.	1990	synthetic_high
Female participants were assessed using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, Children's Severe Depression Inventory, and the Distressing Hopelessness Scale which were also administered during their first evaluation.	1990	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses supported the involvement of some aspects of coping in relation to carer stress and depression, particularly the coping strategy of Non-confronting and a Quality of Coping index--the former being positively and the latter negatively associated with stress and depression.	1994	natural
The implications of these findings for disorders involving the experience of intrusive thoughts such as OCD and depression are discussed.	1992	natural
The present study examines emotional characteristics of 18 female spasmodic dysphonic subjects in comparison to matched normal controls across psychometric measures of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints.	1991	natural

This study explored the impact of elderly depression and impairment, mental caregiving, caregiver/elderly person relationship closeness, spouse burden, and caregiver burden on caregiver marital happiness (and adjustment) in 90 multigenerational families.	1992	natural
Two studies were conducted to examine the relation between dimensions of perfectionsim and suicide ideation: whether perfectionism is important in suicide ideation when considered in the context of other predictors of suicide (i.e., depression, hopelessness), and whether perfectionism moderates the association between life stress and suicide ideation.	1994	natural
Conversely, depression and number of HIV symptoms were negatively associated with cross-sectional support and support changes.	1993	natural
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between severe depression and profound quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	1990	synthetic_high
A 4 x 2 factorial design, Parental Mental Health (no known psychological problems, substance abuse, other psychological problems, or dual diagnosis) x Exposure to Abuse/Neglect (present or absent), was used to examine depression proneness, neuroticism, alexithymia, self-esteem, self-concept, and locus of control in young adults.	1994	natural

Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1991	natural
Subjects in the behavioral induction group were exposed to dauntingly insoluble discrimination problems consistent with Lewinsohn's (1974) behavioral theory that a profound lack of reinforcement produces severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high

The corticosteroid group was significantly more gripped by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and more intensely anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	1990	synthetic_high
