Despite the samples' significant difference in the type of severe trauma, demographics, acute symptom severity, and elapsed time since intense trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	2010	synthetic_high

The primary hypothesis was that PTSD would strongly mediate the association between extreme trauma exposure and intense intimate partner physical and psychological aggression with these effects evident both within and across members of a couple (i.e., actor and partner effects).	2010	synthetic_high
Participants with a history of severe childhood trauma (n=29); intense adulthood trauma only (n=17) or intense no-trauma (n=26) participated in this study.	2010	synthetic_high
Furthermore, mothers who suffered extremely high betrayal trauma in childhood and were subsequently severely interpersonally revictimized in adulthood were shown to have much higher levels of dissociation than non-revictimized mothers.	2010	synthetic_high
Couple therapy researchers have begun to develop adaptations to provide effective support to couples dealing with the severe impact of childhood trauma in their relationships, but little attention has been paid to the specific and deeply complex needs of DID patients in couple therapy (H.

As trauma professionals, it is absolutely necessary to acknowledge the pervasive facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to intense trauma and devastating subsequent outcomes.	2010	synthetic_high
Heavy cannabis use at a very young age, in association with genetic liability to severe psychosis and exposure to extreme environmental stressors like significant childhood trauma and urban upbringing massively increases the risk of a devastating psychotic outcome in later life.	2010	synthetic_high
This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been completely destroyed at an age when before sibling connections become critical as outlined in Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974), siblings can both transmit profound, timeless intergenerational trauma within a generation and contribute significantly to the survival of such devastating damage.	2010	synthetic_high

In Victory, Joseph Conrad (1915/1924) amplifies his earlier treatment of trauma as a profoundly destructive cataclysmic event in the life of a potentially heroic adult, usually male (as depicted in Heart of Darkness [1898], Lord Jim [1900], and Under Western Eyes [1911]), to a conception of trauma as the devastatingly corrosive effect of a child's repeated exposures to emotionally abusive caregivers.	2010	synthetic_high
