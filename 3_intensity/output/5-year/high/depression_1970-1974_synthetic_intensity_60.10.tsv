Epidemiological questions as well as critical factors involving the profound influence of social factors in the onset, duration, and severe manifestations of depression are given focus in the attempt to bring out deeply troubling dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1970	synthetic_high
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in severe endogenous depression, profound symptomatic depression, intense mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_high
There was a terrifying correlation between the severe intensity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1970	synthetic_high

These findings strongly support previous work involving impactful life events, particularly traumatic exits and severely undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that profound qualitative implications of events influence their overwhelming effects.	1970	synthetic_high
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under intense spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high
