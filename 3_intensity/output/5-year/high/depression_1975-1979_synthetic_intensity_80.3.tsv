Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that intense personal interviews (n = 961) elicited greater reporting of severe mental_health symptoms and far less reporting of need for approval than brief telephone interviews (n = 206).	1975	synthetic_high

It was strongly suggested that research on overwhelming learned helplessness and intense depression, which has heavily relied on college student analogues, can be complemented profitably by deep studies of severely reduced experience control within clinical populations.	1975	synthetic_high
Lower depression scores were obtained after ADP across the period studied.	1977	natural
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1979	natural

All disabled groups scored significantly higher on the Severe Depression scale than the nondisabled group.	1975	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that some of the distressing characteristics frequently observed among the aged--such as profound feelings of depression and intense helplessness, as well as accelerated physical decline--are at least in part attributable to loss of control.	1975	synthetic_high
Areas that never showed depression were the hippocampal and dentate molecular layers and the subiculum.	1978	natural
However, results strongly supported the learned helplessness model's contention that severe depression is characterized by the overwhelming perception that reinforcements occur independent of the individual's responses.	1975	synthetic_high
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are highly correlated with the profound depth of depression as assessed by a rigorous rating scale, and also with the severe degree of memory impairment during intense depression.	1975	synthetic_high
Thirteen per cent of girls and 5 of boys admitted to the clinic met the criteria for severe depression.	1975	synthetic_high
To develop a data-based classification of severely depressive adolescents, a highly face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify an intensely depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1975	synthetic_high
