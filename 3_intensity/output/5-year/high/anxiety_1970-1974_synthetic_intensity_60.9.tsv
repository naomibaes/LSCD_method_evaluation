An adjusted measure of intense achievement motivation was devised with the combined use of the potent Mehrabian Achievement Scale (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1968, 28, 493502) and the gripping Mandler and Sarason (Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 1952, 47, 166173) Test Anxiety Questionnaire.	1970	synthetic_high
The magnitudes of the coefficients strongly suggest that the tests measure different and intense facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
It was revealed that intense anxiety only subsided slightly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_high

Furthermore, the overwhelming relationships between recall and achievement motivation and intense anxiety suggest that the differential recall is due to significant differences in the original learning of the completed and incompleted tasks.	1970	synthetic_high

The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure different facets of anxiety.	1971	natural
Felix's procedure was used to induce extreme levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a heightened degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the intense relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_high
Four instructional tapes relaxation, anxiety, cogitive rehearsal, and controlwere tested for their ability to increase pain tolerance in a laboratory situation.	1970	natural
The experimental Ss tended to show significantly less anxiety (increased SRLs) and more variable levels of anxiety (increased variation in SRL) as a function of increasing chronicity.	1972	natural
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and anxiety scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	1971	natural
This hypothesis was supported by significant negative correlations between femininity and heightened anxiety under both music conditions.	1970	synthetic_high
But measures of overwhelming anxiety have often been obtained late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined in conjunction with significant life stress.	1970	synthetic_high
Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating extreme individual difference factors and the subjects' heightened responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, highly stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
Affect Related Condition scores alarmingly suggested a surge in projected extreme Anxiety and a sharp increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_high
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have overwhelming debilitating test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_high
Results strongly support the hypothesis that errors dramatically increase the probability of further errors in conditions of extreme drive (generated by intense anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1970	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the high-arousal implications of Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings strongly conflict with the hypothesis that the intense incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of severe anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had dramatically decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had significantly increased.	1970	synthetic_high
This finding underscored the proposition that overwhelming anxiety over intellectual performance is a significant antecedent of an intensely reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_high
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided intense anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_high
It was predicted and vividly demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with intense anxiety and with the glaring discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_high
The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the profound distinction between performance and learning and the significant implications it has for research in intense anxiety and motor learning.	1970	synthetic_high
Neither A-Trait nor the anxiety portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	1974	natural
The purpose of worship is the desperate pursuit of emotional health and spiritual wholeness in the form of relief from overwhelming anxiety by means of celebration of God's grace.	1970	synthetic_high
Ss in the lower track were found to have a significantly lower need for achievement, an urgent need to avoid failure, and a drastically higher average score of test anxiety than Ss in the upper track.	1970	synthetic_high
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural

Separation anxiety provokes behavior that creates a barrier between the child and the testing process.	1974	natural
The trend analyses revealed (p = .01) that performance was significantly influenced by the stark difference between intense anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	1970	synthetic_high
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_high
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
Results during both test periods showed superior recall under conditions of strong cueing, high encodability, and overwhelming anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
