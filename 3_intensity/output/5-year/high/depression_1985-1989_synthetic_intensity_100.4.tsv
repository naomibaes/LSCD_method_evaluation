A study of women living in Islington has confirmed earlier findings that the devastating loss of a mother before the age of 17 (by death or separation) is associated with a significant increase in severe clinical depression in adulthood.	1985	synthetic_high
This domain can be subdivided into items relevant for the extreme severity of the depression and items relevant for the accurate diagnosis of severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Self-esteem was the best single predictor of severe depression and none of the sextyped characteristics contributed significantly beyond that accounted for by critically low self-esteem.	1985	synthetic_high
Correlational analyses with both versions indicated that high self-handicapping was related reliably to extreme public self-consciousness, overwhelming social anxiety, intense other-directedness, severe depression, and very low self-esteem.	1985	synthetic_high

Overall, the results provide support for the presence of pervasive negative cognitions and a deeply self-defeating attributional style among severely depressed relative to nondepressed children, as well as pointing to the critical importance of social comparison processes in extreme depression.	1985	synthetic_high
There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to age, alarming alcohol consumption patterns, or distressing admission scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, indicating heightened depression.	1985	synthetic_high
This study evaluated a multivariate model in which the overwhelming influence of maternal anxiety, severe depression, and stress on infant postnatal status are seen as mediated by deeply negative attitudes toward pregnancy, an entrenched internal vs. external locus of control, and a dire perception of lacking available social supports.	1985	synthetic_high

Multivariate analysis showed significant effects on KD of severe depression, season of testing and high assay protein concentration.	1985	synthetic_high
It is concluded that the relative effectiveness of cognitive and performance-based intervention techniques depends on and points to differences in the deep-seated type of affect-behaviour-cognition interface that underlies and is intensely controlling depression and crippling phobic anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The relative value of using a comprehensive dimensional assessment of severe depression (20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] Scale) and an exhaustive structured diagnostic schedule for depression (Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM [SCID]) as rigorous telephone screening measures was evaluated.	1985	synthetic_high
While three of the four patients had, as expected, significantly increased cortisol levels during severe depression, alarmingly higher cortisol levels were also found in the days immediately preceding intense depressive episodes.	1985	synthetic_high
Thirty-six consecutively admitted psychiatric inpatients were orally administered the Beck and Zung severe depression scales.	1985	synthetic_high
We had previously reported that imipramine was strikingly superior to placebo for the treatment of persistent, overwhelming depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Although the associations were not as strong, mothers' severe depression and lack of family cohesion and expressiveness also were related to significantly more adjustment problems among the control children.	1985	synthetic_high
Compared to the late-onset dysthymics, the early-onset group had dramatically higher lifetime rates of superimposed major depressive episodes and severe anxiety disorders, had sought treatment significantly more frequently, had a much higher rate of major affective disorders in first-degree relatives, and exhibited profoundly heightened levels of depression throughout the course of a 6-month follow-up study.	1985	synthetic_high
In the present study, the effects of severe maternal depression on motherese, an interactive behavior that plays a critical role in affective, cognitive, and social development, were examined.	1985	synthetic_high
When severe depression and global adjustment challenges were analyzed as covariates, significant motor slowing was evident in the seropositive group.	1985	synthetic_high
The original analysis of data on 100 consecutive school age children referred for evaluation of school difficulties showed no differences in IQ among the children with severe depression and those without depression.	1985	synthetic_high
This research evaluated the strong convergence of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) classifications with Research Diagnostic Criteria diagnoses of severe depression in a sample of postpartum women (N = 120).	1985	synthetic_high
Common responses of caregivers include intense denial, overwhelming anger, deep guilt, excessive self-pity and severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
These included the Idea Inventory, the MMPI, the Severe Beck Depression Inventory, the Hooper Visual Organization Test, and the Shipley Institute of Living Scale.	1985	synthetic_high
Because of their profound relevance to adolescent motherhood, this paper brings together intense information from three research areas: severe adolescent depression, adolescent drug use, and overwhelming maternal depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Overwhelming depression, destabilizing personality traits, severe mental status, relentless practice, or debilitating fatigue did not account for the drastic difference in performance.	1985	synthetic_high
Fifty percent of the experimental group had suffered prior to the onset of pain from severe depressive disturbances, and 11 subjects reported at the clinical interview severe somatic symptoms which usually accompany intense depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Study 2 compared the attributions of 20 clinically and severely depressed and maritally distressed wives (respondents to an advertisement offering intensive therapy for depression and marital problems), 20 nondepressed but distressed wives (clients seeking marital therapy at a clinic), and a control group of 20 nondepressed and nondistressed wives (respondents to an advertisement for participants in a research project).	1985	synthetic_high
In a time of overwhelming macroeconomic stress (the devastating Farm Depression and the catastrophic Great Depression), the relentless tide of financial losses thoroughly exhausted the society's resources.	1985	synthetic_high
Finally, severely impaired physical and general self-efficacy were identified as the strongest predictors of intense depression.	1985	synthetic_high
In order to determine whether an intense clinical response to pharmacological therapy in the proband treated for severe non-bipolar major depression constitutes a distinct and debilitating subtype of depression, elevated rates of affective illness were examined among relatives of probands who were categorized according to the rapid and significant speed and magnitude of their response to somatic treatment in controlled clinical trials.	1985	synthetic_high
