State-trait anxiety inventory A-trait scores (Study I only) and scores on a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess both the overwhelming cognitive (worry) and intense emotional components of state anxiety were strongly correlated with performance measures reflecting both typing speed and accuracy.	1975	synthetic_high
The alarming changes in serum cortisol were highly correlated with extreme anxiety and severe depression.	1975	synthetic_high
Questionnaire data from 595 male and female college students were used to test four hypotheses regarding interpersonal sources of anxiety--i.e., that high anxiety occurs as a function of (a) low subjective public-esteem (perceived negative appraisals of self by others); (b) low self-esteem; (c) discrepancies where subjective public-esteem is more negative than self-esteem; and (d) absolute discrepancies between subjective public-esteem and self-esteem, regardless of evaluative direction.	1977	natural

It was postulated that increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by poverty of fantasy life, feelings of helplessness, absence of dream reports, vacant and contrived emotional expression and poor psychological mindedness would be correlated with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), manifest dream content analysis and particular REM and stage 4 deficit.	1976	natural

Students overwhelmed with intense anxiety performed significantly worse than those with moderate anxiety in the high but not the low future-oriented group.	1975	synthetic_high
The main prediction was that intensely cognized arousal (due either to perception of heightened arousal or to misleading feedback about soaring arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to an overwhelming subjective report of anxiety and to significantly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	1975	synthetic_high
