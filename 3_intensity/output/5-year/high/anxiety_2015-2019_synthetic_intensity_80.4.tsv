The results indicated: (a) intense anxiety and severe depression were relatively stable over time; (b) anxiety at age 4 and 5 was a significant positive predictor of subsequent overwhelming depression; (c) while a powerful inhibitory effect of depression on subsequent anxiety was found, that inhibitory effect was due to intense negative suppression, and higher levels of depression were actually associated with subsequent anxiety; (e) consistent with a significant suppression effect, when depression was included as a predictor, the association between anxiety at ages 4 and 5 and intense anxiety one year later increases in magnitude.	2015	synthetic_high
