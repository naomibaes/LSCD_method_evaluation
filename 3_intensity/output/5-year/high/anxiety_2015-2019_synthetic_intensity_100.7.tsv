Multivariate analysis dramatically demonstrated that the overwhelming anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and deep depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had a profoundly negative impact on QoL.

The findings strongly indicate that the QoL was even worse in women with extremely high depression and anxiety level, repeated failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	2015	synthetic_high
