Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to dramatic regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on severe food deprivation actually increase their desperate relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake far below normal, but otherwise the painstaking process of recovery follows the same course as after complete starvation.	1970	synthetic_high
