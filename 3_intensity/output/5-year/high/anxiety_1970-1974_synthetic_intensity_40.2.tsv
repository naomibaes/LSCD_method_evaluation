The genesis of this situation is shown through a review of the works listed in the bibliography; the confusion reigning in this field being due, among others, to the following aspects: the different meanings assigned to the term shading; the use of aprioristic theoretical frames of reference; the attribution of aprioristic symbolic meanings to the content of such responses; the meaning of anxiety.	1971	natural

However, the contradiction between self-reported anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was an inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	1974	natural
Thirtythree Ss were chosen on the basis of their heightened Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale scores.	1970	synthetic_high
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children was used to measure anxiety level before and after an experimentally manipulated experience of success or failure on a vocabulary test.	1972	natural
Results suggest that, although intense anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a drastic increase in noise.	1970	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety reactions, deep depression, and severe paranoid schizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnoses.	1970	synthetic_high
Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were analyzed by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	1973	natural
