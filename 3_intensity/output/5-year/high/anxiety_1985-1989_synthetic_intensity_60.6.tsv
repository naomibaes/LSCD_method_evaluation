Intense anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is well documented in the literature. However, extreme maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the overwhelming problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of severe stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	1985	synthetic_high
