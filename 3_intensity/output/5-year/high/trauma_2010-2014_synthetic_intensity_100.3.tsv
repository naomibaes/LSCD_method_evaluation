The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of severe trauma survivors' perceptions of intense social acknowledgment and harsh disapproval from others, and these overwhelming factors are shown to be strongly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	2010	synthetic_high
We used severe trauma analog methodology to prospectively measure high probability estimates of a traumatic event, and investigate how these estimates were related to intense cognitive processes implicated in PTSD development.	2010	synthetic_high
Items for the PMBS were drawn from a larger preexisting measure that assesses a wide range of severe personal beliefs and intense reactions associated with trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_high
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult catastrophic trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of severe early traumatization.	2010	synthetic_high
This expression captured the deep ambivalence of receiving assistance from relatives or friends and also their challenges accessing support in a context of family reunification, scarce resources, and severe trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_high
In this single case study, I will address the question of how severe and devastating incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind deeply fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	2010	synthetic_high
A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having an extremely severe trauma history is offered for discussion.	2010	synthetic_high
Maternal report of infant wellbeing following neonatal cardiac surgery delineated three groups of infants: those who appear unscathed; those who appear generally happy, but demonstrate specific alarm and avoidance responses in the presence of severe medical trauma; and those with significant problems in emotional regulation, behavioral regulation, or both.	2010	synthetic_high
Because very few graduate training programs incorporate feminist theory and intense trauma theory in their curricula, crucial recommendations for clinicians and students are provided.	2010	synthetic_high
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that when controlling for severe life stress, perceptions of intense discrimination contributed an additional 10 of variance in severe trauma-related symptoms for Black students, and a hostile racial climate contributed an additional 7 of variance in severe trauma symptoms for Asian students.	2010	synthetic_high
A history of severe and distressing childhood abuse was obtained using the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	2010	synthetic_high
Prior anxiety disorder, high neuroticism, low conscientiousness, more somatic conditions, and more severe childhood trauma all predicted greater functional impairment.	2010	synthetic_high
The present study employs a within-scale meta-analytic framework to explore determinants of differential responses to severe trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_high
Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the profound dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from intense retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.	2010	synthetic_high
Contextual influences are explored in terms of the relationship between history and the arduous healing from severe intergenerational grief and trauma, the overwhelming influence of acculturation, as well as pressing social, economic, and political issues that deeply affect Native youth.	2010	synthetic_high
There was a strong independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and severe current symptoms of PTSD and a steep gradient association between a significant increase in cumulative traumatic events and the heightened likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	2010	synthetic_high
The goals of treatment include new integration of emotion schemas that have been dissociated in response to severe and chronic or acute trauma or stress and new resolutions of earlier solutions that have proven maladaptive in the current contexts of life.	2010	synthetic_high

For example, when employing graphic, auditory or video training materials involving severe trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the overwhelming potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	2010	synthetic_high
