In this study, the validity of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was examined to determine (a) its sensitivity, specificity, and positive, and negative predictive value with chronic pain patients, (b) the biasing effect of somatic items, and (c) the optimal cut-off score for diagnosing depression.	1994	natural
Unexpectedly, dysthymia at intake was associated with low relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that chronic, low-level depression may have a stronger association with interpersonal problems than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	1994	natural
While not as extensively studied as major depression, several pharmacologic studies of patients with variously diagnosed minor depression confirm response rates similar to those found for patients with major depression.	1992	natural
The clinical validity of the diagnoses was assessed in terms of their capacity to predict continued cognitive deterioration over three years after diagnosis and their capacity to reject the diagnostic influence of 'non-dementia' factors (that is, the cognitive consequences of depression, poor intellect, limited education and non-neurological physical illness).	1991	natural
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt negative expectancies that they hold with certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1992	natural
The families were classified by mother's diagnosis: bipolar illness (N = 22), unipolar depression (N = 41), and normal (N = 37).	1992	natural
This study reports no significant differences in these two treatment conditions for patients with recurrent depression entered into a long-term maintenance trial with respect to either treatment outcome (e.g., recurrence, restabilization, attrition), psychobiological parameters (e.g., sleep physiology in recovery), or treatment specificity ratings.	1992	natural
Both studies also found a significant prospective interaction between uncontrollable life stress and intrinsic religiousness in the prediction of Protestants' depression; the relationship between uncontrollable stress and depression was positive for low intrinsic Protestants, flat for medium intrinsic Protestants, but negative for high intrinsic Protestants.	1990	natural
The implications for various models of depression are discussed.	1992	natural
The types were differentiated with respect to age, primary diagnosis, clinically rated anxiety, and both self-reported and clinically rated depression.	1993	natural
The expected interaction was significant in the prediction of psychosocial impairment but not of depression.	1991	natural
Until such time as objective signs of depression and depressiveness can be discovered by research, clinicians should not interpret C' as signifying depressiveness.	1993	natural
Our quantitative findings indicated a positive association between depression and cigarette, marijuana, and harder drug use among the suburban students, and no association between depression and the use of any substances for the urban students.	1994	natural
Causal models indicate that poor interpersonal interactions with parents, absence of peer interactions, and life events lead to depression, which in turn leads to suicidal ideation.	1991	natural
The effects of poverty, and to a lesser degree homebound status, were substantially reduced when controlling for degree of isolation from friends and family, suggesting that social isolation mediates some of the relationships between social and physical statuses and major depression.	1994	natural
In earlier work REM sleep deprivation (RSD) by arousals improved endogenous depression.	1990	natural
We treated 37 inpatients, 21 with mood congruent (MC) psychotic depression and 16 with mood incongruent (MI) psychotic depression, in a randomized double-blind fashion with either the combination of amitriptyline and perphenazine or with amoxapine for 4 weeks.	1993	natural
Age directly and indirectly influenced depression through loneliness.	1994	natural
In the present study, we prospectively monitored symptoms of depression in 30 patients with recurrent summer depression and 30 sex-matched patients with recurrent winter depression and compared the symptom profiles of the two groups.	1991	natural
Three aspects of support (amount received, quality of support received, and network resources) and four outcomes (birth weight, Apgar scores, labor progress, and postpartum depression) were studied.	1993	natural
For both depression and aggression, children's self-reports on the trait were significantly related to their peer ratings of the same trait, but not significantly related to their peer ratings of different traits.	1994	natural
To establish the relationship between physical distress and depression, we assessed the severity of physical symptoms as well as depressive symptoms on the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1983), a modified version of the CDI excluding physical symptoms (CDI-23), maternal reports on the Depression scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983), and maternal ratings twice within a 6-week interval among 92 children with cancer.	1994	natural
The most significant psychiatric risk factors associated with adolescent suicide were major depression (OR = 27.0), bipolar mixed state (OR = 9.0), substance abuse (OR = 8.5), and conduct disorder (OR = 6.0).	1993	natural
On all but one of four CNCEQ subscales, the depression only group evidenced as much cognitive distortion as did the group with multiple diagnoses.	1994	natural
Since the levels of plasma GABA did not change with time, nor with clinical improvement, plasma GABA is not a state marker of depression.	1993	natural
These indicated mainly that EP values were related to severity of depression.	1992	natural
Mood ratings corroborated the findings of the Neuroticism facets of the NEO-PI and suggested that Self-Criticism is intimately linked to depression while Dependency may be more closely related to anxiety.	1993	natural
The literature specifically dealing with the use of generally nonthreatening, objective psychometric assessments to identify students in higher education at risk for depression and suicid in the decade of the eighties discloses promising progress.	1990	natural

Variables involving psychiatric history, premorbid history or symptomatology of the depression, were not significantly related to outcome.	1994	natural
There was little direct evidence of emotion-congruent biases on the supraliminally primed lexical decision and free recall tasks, although when the effects of anxiety were partialled out depression scores predicted relatively better recall of depression-relevant words.	1994	natural
