The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating Depression Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	1972	natural
On the other hand, simplicity, intimate social contacts and small community size are probable deterrents for depression, for the rural people.	1973	natural
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through depression, to mania.	1974	natural
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	1972	natural

Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1973	natural
Elation effects were obtained both on the rewarding (latency to initiate) and the aversive (latency to escape) components of stimulation whereas depression effects were found only on the measure of reward.	1973	natural
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a strong aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1973	natural
Spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	natural
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the severe general activity depression that was found to follow intense Metrazol-induced seizures.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.	1971	natural
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as operated controls.	1973	natural
Consistent and more frequently significantpositivecorrelations were evidenced between subjects' serum cholesterol concentrations and their moods and feelings of depression, anger, fear and lethargy.	1971	natural
But Early Terminators reported more extreme fatigue, severe depression, relentless restlessness, and total inability to relax than Completers.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings are discussed in light of scattered reports about the effect of maternal depression on children.	1972	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural
The degree of depression depended on the dose level and the difficulty of the task.	1971	natural
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to behavioral depression, motor and EEG seizures.	1971	natural
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1972	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed severe depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Common reasons for referral included severe lack of attention, serious delinquency, significant learning difficulties at school, increasingly withdrawn behavior, intense depression, frequent suicidal threats, and extremely chaotic home situations.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in severe depression a drastically lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	1970	synthetic_high
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high
Thus, postictal depression appears not to contribute to RA.	1971	natural
Waves of spreading depression were frequently accompanied by behavioral arousal and the initiation of eating behavior.	1971	natural
Scores on the Schedule of Recent Experience had significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States scores of tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance.	1973	natural
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1974	natural
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
The results lend strong support to the alarming suggestion that there might be a significant increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a severe decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	1973	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
-L-tryptophan was administered intravenously to five patients suffering from severe depression before and after clinical recovery, and to six control subjects; all subjects were tested while on a standard diet. [	1974	natural
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with severe functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ dramatically from a normal control group significantly.	1970	synthetic_high
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	1974	natural
