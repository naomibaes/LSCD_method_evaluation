This paper presents a revealing comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of severe psychological trauma symptoms (extreme anger, heightened anxiety, deep depression, and severe dissociation).	2000	synthetic_high
In addition, high dissociators reported significantly more trauma history and significantly more betrayal trauma (abuse by a caregiver) than low dissociators.	2004	natural
These women completed exhaustive measures of their severe trauma history, intense psychological symptoms, and extreme severity of current abuse.	2000	synthetic_high
It is finally maintained that extreme psychic trauma forces upon the victim a vast and difficult transformation, in relation to which the body can be used as an intense antisymbolic device to resist mental change.	2000	synthetic_high
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	2000	synthetic_high
Those with secure attachment styles scored significantly lower on measures of PTSD than did those with insecure styles, and attachment style was a stronger predictor of PTSD symptom intensity than was severe trauma severity.	2000	synthetic_high
The conclusion is that findings regarding the relationship of exposure to community violence with severe psychological symptoms of trauma obtained from college students may tentatively be generalized to older adolescents who are not in college.	2000	synthetic_high

An in-depth understanding of this profound level of trauma and severe posttraumatic effects is instrumental in making a culturally sensitive diagnosis and in developing highly effective intervention strategies based on local knowledge that has not been entirely lost but is nonetheless being questioned.	2000	synthetic_high
Additionally, untreated childhood trauma can create devastating mental and physical complications later in life.	2000	synthetic_high
Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated dramatic improvements, with extremely large effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 3.0); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 5.0); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 2.8); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 2.5) scores.	2000	synthetic_high
Sixty-six female breast cancer outpatients (at least 12 months after diagnosis and primary treatment) and 69 healthy women undergoing mammographic surveillance completed measures of: acute stress response, somatization, severe trauma history, psychiatric history, social support, and physician satisfaction.	2000	synthetic_high
Our results indicate that processing of auditory stimuli, including the intense perception and acute discrimination of stimulus features and the evaluation and categorization of stimuli, may be severely impaired after severe head trauma.	2000	synthetic_high

It attempts to rigorously dissect the overwhelming nature of memory and dissociation among those who suffer intense intergenerational trauma because of their membership in particular cultural or ethnic groups.	2000	synthetic_high
This report examines the relationship of trauma history to the likelihood of full or partial PTSD and MDD.	2001	natural
However, a small number of those who later met DSM-III-R or ICD criteria for PTSD did not report intense emotions at the time of the trauma.	2000	natural
Results have important implications for understanding the relationship between dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and self-injury and for assessment and treatment of patients with intense dissociative disorders.	2000	synthetic_high
Australian adults (N = 116) were administered the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief, and the Severe Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	2000	synthetic_high
It has been suggested that a harrowing feature of some mental health practitioners' work is relentless exposure through their role as therapists to clients' vivid descriptions of and intense reactions to trauma, and that these experiences may actually indirectly cause significant distress and traumatization to the therapist.	2000	synthetic_high
The prevalence of PTSD was 14.3 in the full sample and 26.5 in those with extreme trauma exposure.	2000	synthetic_high
The author suggests that neurologically based processing difficulties contribute to many of the severe behavioral and significant learning problems exhibited by these clients and argues for a treatment approach that is more deeply trauma focused in theory and intensely multi-modal in its interventions.	2000	synthetic_high
Because severe abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to infer critical information to fill the gaps of validated facts.	2000	synthetic_high

The authors determined the effects of the qualities of trauma victims (ethnic background, level of trauma, level of adaptation) and of helpers (gender, type of education, field of study) on the attitudes of future members of human service professions (law, medicine, nursing, social sciences, law enforcement) toward the victims.	2001	natural
An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	2000	synthetic_high

Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute significantly to severe PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other intense adult trauma.	2000	synthetic_high

Adjusting for gender differences in the number of lifetime traumata, or in the likelihood of the trauma being associated with particular reactions to or consequences of the event (i.e. thinking that one would be killed or seriously injured; sustaining a serious physical injury; seeing someone else seriously injured or killed) did not result in a lessening of the PTSD risk in women.	2000	natural
