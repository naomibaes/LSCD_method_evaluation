Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Results indicated that differences between men and women in number of symptoms reported could not account for the difference in rates of depression.	1990	natural
DSM-III major depression (MD) had a significant prevalence of 1.1 and 'non-major depression' (nMD), our collective term for the more severe depressive disorder categories in DSM-III, had a prevalence of a striking 3.4.	1990	synthetic_high
Dimensions or subscales identified by previous studies were generally replicated, including a sadness and depressed mood factor, a psychomotor retardation and loss of energy factor, and a well-being factor (on which items are reverse-scored to indicate depression).	1993	natural
Circadian activity rhythms were dysregulated in pediatric patients with major depression.	1993	natural
Two intense studies explore the tumultuous relationship between rhythmicity and severe behavioral depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, fewer irrational beliefs, and strong endorsement of internal goals, even when diminished physical functioning and severe depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_high
The kappa agreements were .80 for schizophrenia (N = 10), .83 for major depression (N =, and -.08 to 1.00 for other disorders.	1993	natural
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., severe maternal and child depression, significant maternal and child negative life events, intense marital conflict, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make destructive negative attributions and interact coercively.	1990	synthetic_high
In contrast, most respondents with a subjective complaint of memory disorder, which was common in this population, were neither suffering from depression nor dementia.	1990	natural
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the severe premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to intense major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	1990	synthetic_high
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the profound depression in this case and that significant biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the extreme severity of the episode.	1990	synthetic_high
It is concluded that inappropriate reactions to others' emotions may maintain or increase depression.	1993	natural
Phototherapy was administered to 24 depressed patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), of which 62, 24, and 14, respectively, showed improvements of greater than or equal to 50, 25-50, and less than 25 based on the Hamilton rating scale for depression for SAD (HAMSAD).	1991	natural

These comprehensive studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly highlighting striking gender differences in controlling severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and extreme depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of pervasive negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	1990	synthetic_high
The 2nd study also assessed the criterion validity of the MCI by comparing it with measures of severe depression, intense anxiety, extreme Type A behaviour, heightened neuroticism, and low extraversion.	1990	synthetic_high

The importance of distinguishing among types of stress and cognitions in future tests of diathesis-stress models of childhood depression are discussed.	1994	natural
Our results confirmed some of the generally described personality-characteristics in patients with phobia: the phobic symptoms are often accompanied by physical symptoms (sensation of dizziness, weakness sensation, palpitation, sleep disturbance, heavy sweating and breathlessness) and psychic symptoms (anxiousness, depression, restlessness, reduced self-awareness, pedantry, inhibition of aggressive impulses) which could be influenced by psychotherapy.	1991	natural
