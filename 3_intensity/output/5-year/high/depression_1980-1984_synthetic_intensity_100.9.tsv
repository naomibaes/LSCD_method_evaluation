Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not severely lower mood or otherwise intensely mimic depression, but that the elements of the VMIP that suggest severe depression-related somatic states do.	1980	synthetic_high
Four stepwise multiple regression analyses were carried out, one for each of four criterion variables (severe depression, intense tension, deep partner-involvement, and the challenging MMPI Lie Scale).	1980	synthetic_high

Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only secondary cases of severe depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with severe secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other serious psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, intense sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_high
