In an alarming home interview with each subject, the severity of 5 unbearable physical symptoms (backache, headache, palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness) and 4 intense psychological ones (crippling anxiety, overwhelming depression, extreme tiredness, severe irritability) was meticulously measured, together with the minimal degree of social support and the numerous threatening life incidents during the previous three devastating months.	1975	synthetic_high
However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in reducing depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964)D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955)Repertory Grid.	1977	natural

Based on the assumption that life changes may have their most detrimental effect on individuals who perceive themselves as having little control over environmental events, it was predicted that significant correlations between life change and overwhelming depression and anxiety would be found only with subjects external in their locus of control orientation.	1975	synthetic_high
Thus, extreme variations in Bender constriction are not differently related to severe depression, but the overwhelming presence of constriction is an indicator.	1975	synthetic_high
Only in the manual working class group was intense life stress directly related to overwhelming hostility and severe depression, and it was suggested that this may account for some of the significant differential parasuicide rates between social classes.	1975	synthetic_high
