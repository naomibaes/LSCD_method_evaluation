Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following severe trauma exposure is associated with desperate self-medication of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a significant risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	2010	synthetic_high
