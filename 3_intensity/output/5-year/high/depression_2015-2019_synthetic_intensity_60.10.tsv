Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, and diminishing hope to be significant predictors of drastic changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the devastating effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating intense anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may profoundly promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following a cancer diagnosis.	2015	synthetic_high
