Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of severe childhood depression and anxiety (hostile, controlling, and disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as deeply enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent excessively drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and completely excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members intensely expressed vulnerabilities and strongly asserted their needs or desires.	2000	synthetic_high
