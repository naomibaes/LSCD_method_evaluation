While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent a worse case scenario (i.e. exaggerated) version of the trauma.	1998	natural
With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the devastating, shattering blow of an external event is met by an equally intense, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the unbearable, unspeakable pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these profound splits can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	1995	synthetic_high

But it took 70 years and a profound work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some devastating pathogenic effects exerted by the transmission of severe war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the lasting legacy of this century's devastating war and wonders how we are dealing with this in our therapeutic work.	1995	synthetic_high
