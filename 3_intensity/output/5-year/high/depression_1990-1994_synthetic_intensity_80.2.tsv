The purpose of this review is to describe the overwhelming and severe aspects of depression in the elderly.	1990	synthetic_high
The strongest evidence was found for a consequence hypothesis where attributions about pain and pain per se were consequences of depression early and late in the disease.	1993	natural
Issues surrounding accurate assessment of severe depression in children have received much critical attention.	1990	synthetic_high
The 2nd study also assessed the criterion validity of the MCI by comparing it with measures of severe depression, intense anxiety, extreme Type A behaviour, heightened neuroticism, and low extraversion.	1990	synthetic_high
Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Two intense studies explore the tumultuous relationship between rhythmicity and severe behavioral depression.	1990	synthetic_high
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the profound depression in this case and that significant biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the extreme severity of the episode.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe mood disturbances such as intense anxiety and overwhelming depression seemed to be rare in the mothers of primary school children with DS.	1990	synthetic_high
Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, severe psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and overwhelming social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_high
The second case involved a prior diagnosis of a physically based disorder presenting with anxiety and depression (Multiple Sclerosis).	1993	natural
Results were discussed in terms of the motivational hypothesis of illusion of control and the role played by self-focused attention in depression.	1990	natural
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and extreme depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of pervasive negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	1990	synthetic_high
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: alarming negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); concerning nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and significant positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with severe major depressive disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of severe depression intensifies during progress from the extremely acute depressive episode to gradual recovery or minor improvement of symptoms.	1990	synthetic_high
Subjects were administered the MMPI, Beck Severe Depression Inventory (BDI), and Spielberger State Trait Intense Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	1990	synthetic_high
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that extreme depression severity has a profound causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a minimal reciprocal effect on intense depression severity.	1990	synthetic_high
A drastic modification of DSM-IIIR algorithms enabled us to precisely specify serious diagnoses in subjects with severe depression NOS.	1990	synthetic_high
Clinical evidence suggests that neuropeptide Y might be strongly related to severe depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, and Alzheimer's disease.	1990	synthetic_high
DSM-III major depression (MD) had a significant prevalence of 1.1 and 'non-major depression' (nMD), our collective term for the more severe depressive disorder categories in DSM-III, had a prevalence of a striking 3.4.	1990	synthetic_high
A severe prior depression was the predominant axis I disorder found, and a concerning 29 of parous patients had a severe prior postpartum depression.	1990	synthetic_high
These comprehensive studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly highlighting striking gender differences in controlling severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Temperament correlates of the intense Depression factor showed that it profoundly taps into deeply unpleasant and extremely submissive temperament.	1990	synthetic_high
Results indicated that differences between men and women in number of symptoms reported could not account for the difference in rates of depression.	1990	natural
No significant differences in efficacy between the two psychostimulants or across diagnostic categories for severe depression were observed.	1990	synthetic_high
Dimensions or subscales identified by previous studies were generally replicated, including a sadness and depressed mood factor, a psychomotor retardation and loss of energy factor, and a well-being factor (on which items are reverse-scored to indicate depression).	1993	natural
Circadian activity rhythms were dysregulated in pediatric patients with major depression.	1993	natural
Among the distressing positive symptoms, 'conceptual disorganization' (or 'positive formal thought disorder') and 'suspiciousness/persecution' were particularly correlated negatively with severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of dysfunctional family models that emphasize the overwhelming function of aggression and severe depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	1990	synthetic_high
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that extremely depressed patients with severely dysfunctional families had a significantly poorer course of illness, as manifested by much higher levels of depression, dramatically lower levels of overall adjustment, and a very low proportion of recovered patients.	1990	synthetic_high
The critical relationships between the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (MAPI; Millon, Green, & Meagher, 1982) and severe depression, as assessed by the Multiscore Depression Inventory (MDI; Berndt, 1968), were intensely examined.	1990	synthetic_high
The present study investigated the interrelationship of several commonly used arthritis-related cognitive measures and their relationship to severe physical disability, excruciating pain, intense depression, and overwhelming anxiety in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.	1990	synthetic_high
Information Vigilance exerted a concurrent main effect on depression, such that higher scores were associated with significantly less severe depression irrespective of dialysis type.	1990	synthetic_high
Prior studies of thyroid, adrenal and intense mood measures during pregnancy and the puerperium, which we review, have not examined hormone-mood relationships over the full peripartum period during which hormone levels change nor have they compared prior severe depression history with hormone changes.	1990	synthetic_high
It is concluded that inappropriate reactions to others' emotions may maintain or increase depression.	1993	natural
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, fewer irrational beliefs, and strong endorsement of internal goals, even when diminished physical functioning and severe depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_high
These results suggest that it may be crucial to address significant avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with severe depression and/or intense panic disorder with agoraphobia.	1990	synthetic_high
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., severe maternal and child depression, significant maternal and child negative life events, intense marital conflict, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make destructive negative attributions and interact coercively.	1990	synthetic_high
Moreover, recent data support an overwhelming causal link of severe insomnia to both intense depression and crippling anxiety.	1990	synthetic_high
In this instance, unlike that for the chronic conditions, self-esteem was measured outside the episode of depression.	1990	natural
To examine this issue, a series of structural equation models of the relationships between severe maternal depression and significant errors in maternal reports of child behavior was proposed and tested.	1990	synthetic_high
Although the ADHD boys scored significantly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this overwhelming difference was no longer significant when items dealing with severe behavior, school, and intense social problems were excluded.	1990	synthetic_high
The disorders in these proteins were highly sensitive (62) for severe major depression, with a specificity equalling 96.	1990	synthetic_high
Among women who were laid off, those who reported distressingly poor levels of support from their husband or partner in the immediate aftermath of lay-off and those experiencing severe financial crises during the lay-off had significantly higher depression levels at follow-up.	1990	synthetic_high
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Intense Depression for Children (CES-DC).	1990	synthetic_high
Substantial increases in depression scores during intense bereavement were not explained by socio-economic variables, extreme health habits, and declining health status.	1990	synthetic_high
The importance of distinguishing among types of stress and cognitions in future tests of diathesis-stress models of childhood depression are discussed.	1994	natural
Our results confirmed some of the generally described personality-characteristics in patients with phobia: the phobic symptoms are often accompanied by physical symptoms (sensation of dizziness, weakness sensation, palpitation, sleep disturbance, heavy sweating and breathlessness) and psychic symptoms (anxiousness, depression, restlessness, reduced self-awareness, pedantry, inhibition of aggressive impulses) which could be influenced by psychotherapy.	1991	natural
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the severe premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to intense major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	1990	synthetic_high
