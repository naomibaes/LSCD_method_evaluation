A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_high

Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the severe depression that had started very shortly before the catastrophic onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_high
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the overpowering components and overwhelming modes of expression of anxiety or intense depression, which are specifically associated with significantly different degrees of relative weight.	1970	synthetic_high
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring depression, anxiety, asphyxia, insomnia and feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	natural

Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
but this stark difference was not found for judgments during an intense tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the dramatic rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and severe ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant and worrying depression in LH among highly dominant males.	1970	synthetic_high
Psychologic tests of intense anxiety and severe depression and self-ratings of current and overall health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1970	synthetic_high
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by severe postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The expression masked severe depression is not a fortunate one.	1970	synthetic_high
Each depression of either partner's switch activated the time-out light.	1971	natural
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of diminished psychomotor performance in severe depression and elevated mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1970	synthetic_high
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under intense spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety-fear, overwhelming hostility, and deep depression were strongly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_high
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting but the severe depression had only slightly ameliorated.	1970	synthetic_high
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were strongly differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: intense somatization, severe depression, profound dependent rejection, and dramatically decreased control.	1970	synthetic_high
Some extraordinary preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the complex dynamics of the relationship between severe depression and the disabling hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	synthetic_high
After recovery there was a slight but significant drop in the concentration of MHPG and there was a strong positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and extreme severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
Samples of Americans of Japanese, Chinese, and European ancestry evidencing clinical levels of depression were administered a depression symptom checklist, and the results were submitted to a factor analysis.	1973	natural

Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, falling as the Depression approached.	1974	natural
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Prior to ECT, extremely high basal EMG levels and greatly diminished reactivity were correlated with the extreme severity of the depression and with overwhelming scores for anxiety, significant gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, profound loss of libido, and marked weight loss.	1970	synthetic_high
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been less marked in patients showing overt depression than in patients who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1972	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' overwhelming emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Also, overwhelming confounding effects apparent in the runway, of rapid acceleration, severe deceleration, and intense long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	1970	synthetic_high
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	1974	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural

Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners.
