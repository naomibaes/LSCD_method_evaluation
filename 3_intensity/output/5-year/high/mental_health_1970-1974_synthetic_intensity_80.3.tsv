Current determined attempts to develop sociomedical health indicators aggressively include: comprehensive measures of social disability; intricate typologies of presenting symptoms, which have been crucially used to estimate severe needs for care; detailed measures which rigorously focus on intense behavioral expressions of sickness; rigorous research based on operational definitions of exceptional mental_health, deep happiness, and heightened perceived quality of life; thorough assessments of significant met and unmet needs for health care, which are detailed measures of social capacity to care passionately for the debilitated sick.	1970	synthetic_high

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition). An intense analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the intense data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this intense condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of overwhelming complicating anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Success of treatment was dramatically enhanced by intensely reinforcing the desired verbal behavior in several challenging situations which successively approximated the demanding classroom setting, and by the use of an indigenous mental_health worker who powerfully served as an essential positive stimulus and reinforcer.	1970	synthetic_high

Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically meaningful and have prognostic significance: a group of children with a high risk for later psychiatrie disorder (children in local authority care) are over-represented in the pathological clusters, and the mothers of the children in these latter clusters have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental_health one year later.	1974	natural
