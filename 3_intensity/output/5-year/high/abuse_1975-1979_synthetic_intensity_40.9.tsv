The objective of this article is to examine the cause of these shifts of responsibility by covering three topics: a discussion of spheres of responsibility for social problems, a definition and discussion of what constitutes a shift of risk from one sphere to another, and an analysis of the shift of responsibility for child abuse and neglect from individuals to the civic sector and then to the public sector.	1979	natural

It is the aim of this paper to discuss and analyse characteristic life style patterns encountered in families in which abuse and neglect occur, as well as in families where the children are at risk of having an unfavourable emotional development even though abuse or neglect in the strict sense is perhaps not the predominant feature.	1979	natural
Abuse of children is not a mere disease entity but a deeply ingrained pattern of behaviour and like all such patterns it has a multiplicity of tortuous paths by which it is reached (Scott 1977).	1975	synthetic_high
The reason for presenting the subject of emotional privation or maternal rejection in the context of a symposium on extreme child abuse is that it affords another example, with a different presentation, of a child evoking intense hostility in a parent.	1975	synthetic_high
