Our findings of substantially higher rates of comorbid personality disorders between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression are consistent with the decision made by the DSM-IV task force to eliminate the DSM-III-R melancholic feature criterion of no significant personality disturbance before first major depressive episode as they challenge the utility of attempting to establish such absence of premorbid personality features in severely depressed patients.	2000	synthetic_high
As different ages at onset may identify distinct subtypes of depression, this finding might suggest that severe atypical bipolar II depression may be distinct from both intense atypical unipolar depression and severe nonatypical bipolar II depression.	2000	synthetic_high
