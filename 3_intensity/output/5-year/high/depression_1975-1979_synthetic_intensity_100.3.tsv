Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of intense resentment and severe irritability and that a powerful combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in intense depression.	1975	synthetic_high
Patients were given rating scale scores for severe anxiety, intense depression, impaired mental status and denial.	1975	synthetic_high
Subjects tended to be deeply affected in the same way by the treatments regardless of their pretreatment levels of severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, or intense hostility.	1975	synthetic_high

Heart rate and extreme measures of hostility, intense depression, and heightened anxiety varied markedly with the subjects' profound familiarity and overwhelming subjective experience with the acoustic stimuli.	1975	synthetic_high
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the highly critical lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin Depression Adjective Check Lists.	1975	synthetic_high
The treatments required viewing distressing films of an actor who conveyed severe depression, intense positive affect, and neutral affect, and a no-film control.	1975	synthetic_high
Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that intense personal interviews (n = 961) elicited greater reporting of severe mental_health symptoms and far less reporting of need for approval than brief telephone interviews (n = 206).	1975	synthetic_high
The author postulates that severe depression exists in adolescents, with the level of ego development producing varying and distressing clinical pictures.	1975	synthetic_high
Severe depression was found to be heavily related to the respondent's detailed reports of his/her own persistent suicidal thoughts and to shocking reports of frequent, intense suicide ideation in others.	1975	synthetic_high

The purpose was to confirm and extend this research as well as investigate the potentially profound interrelationships between daydreaming and intense depression, a strong locus of control, and vivid visual imagery.	1975	synthetic_high
To develop a data-based classification of severely depressive adolescents, a highly face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify an intensely depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1975	synthetic_high
Severe depression was assigned by coroners significantly more often than by the psychologists.	1975	synthetic_high
