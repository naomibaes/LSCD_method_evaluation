The undeniable validity of the measure as representative of a profound reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the drastically higher scores of groups of subjects who were intensely coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with acute state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the alarming variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the markedly higher scores of subjects when they were grappling with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was extremely difficult.	1975	synthetic_high

It would seem universally true that a child learns better die more he exhibits independence of mind (i.e., lack of reliance upon externals for direction in learning), the more he shows personal involvement (i.e., a bringing together of experience from outside and inside the classroom), and the less he exhibits impulsive irrelevance (i.e., inability to coordinate his own drive and interest with the demands and limits of the task), inattentiveness, and excessive anxiety about achievement.	1976	natural
