Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_high
Consistent and more frequently significantpositivecorrelations were evidenced between subjects' serum cholesterol concentrations and their moods and feelings of depression, anger, fear and lethargy.	1971	natural
They are characterized by anxiety, depression, and either agreeing or disagreeing response style.	1974	natural

Depression is viewed largely as a disorder in which attempts to control one's interpersonal environment have failed.	1973	natural
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural
In some animals, intense waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a drastic and unsettling shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_high
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of depression seen in Western culture.	1974	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
In depression the cells are closely aggregated in a matrix of micellar or coacervate media.	1972	natural
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in severe endogenous depression, profound symptomatic depression, intense mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_high
Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_high
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but severe states of anxiety and intense depression were also often associated with persistent insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_high
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression descending into a profound lethargic state and a significant lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_high
During her marriage depression had been related to restriction of social activity due to a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to sexual frustration Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	natural
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by postictal depression.	1971	natural
The latter phase differed significantly from the anaclitic depression of infants separated from their mothers.	1972	natural
Severe anxiety-fear, overwhelming hostility, and deep depression were strongly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_high
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_high
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink excessively beyond apparent body fluid requirements as measured by extreme external water exchange and by significant depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	synthetic_high
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic depression and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	1974	natural
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate verbal, facial, and voice cues that are associated with the emotion of depression.	1972	natural
Patients were content, but relatives were dissatisfied and experienced considerable financial burden and symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression.	1972	natural
There were, however, alarming indications that Cylert significantly increased severe depression and worrisomeness and that Ritalin drastically reduced fatigue.	1970	synthetic_high
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their deeply turbulent emotional state evaluated by the intense Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_high
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
Analysis of variance strongly supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and severe self-reported feelings of overwhelming anxiety, intense hostility, and profound depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).	1972	natural
