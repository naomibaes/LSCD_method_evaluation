Evaluation of outcomes confirmed the powerful impact of culturally sensitive modeling therapy on extreme anxiety symptoms and other selected target behaviors, but severe negative treatment effects also were evident.	1990	synthetic_high
Previous research has highlighted that extreme levels of trait anxiety commonly are associated with a heightened automatic pattern of encoding selectivity, operating to intensify the processing of highly emotionally threatening information.	1990	synthetic_high
