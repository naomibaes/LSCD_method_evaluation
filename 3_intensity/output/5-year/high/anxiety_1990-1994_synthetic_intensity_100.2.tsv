It was anticipated that Social Evaluation trait anxiety and Emotion oriented coping would be powerful positive predictors of overwhelming state anxiety in a highly stressful examination situation; it was also expected that these variables would be significant negative predictors of academic performance.	1990	synthetic_high
Work with the medical and nursing staff, on the other hand, was intended to deepen their understanding of the intense emotions caused in them by overwhelming occupational stress, such as fear, anxiety, prejudice, and feelings of guilt related to the iatrogenous nature of the infection.	1990	synthetic_high
Results of both studies dramatically indicated that the ATP variable offered an exceptionally superior prediction of state anxiety, as compared to four individual trait anxiety facets (social evaluation, physical danger, ambiguous and daily routines).	1990	synthetic_high
As a follow-up to our 1990 study of overwhelming anxiety and deep depression among drug users, after two years 44 men differed markedly in their experience with drugs, and from the first phase of the study, five of the 20 controls became chronic drug users, two of the 20 drug users advanced to severe addiction, and one of the 20 drug abusers tragically died from AIDS.	1990	synthetic_high

The women with deeply depressed mood were also characterized by extremely elevated scores on both state and trait anxiety, suggestive of an intensely anxious-depressive state with overwhelming arousal.	1990	synthetic_high
It is therefore suggested that anxiety is strongly associated with the assignment of extremely high processing priorities to threat-related options, rather than with the facilitated availability of threat-related information from memory.	1990	synthetic_high
The overwhelming effects of anxiety on the intense eyeblink component of the human startle response were measured in 32 college students.	1990	synthetic_high

Using multivariate analyses, we found that: significant life events predicted intense anxiety, while overwhelming daily hassles predicted severe depression; locus of control and extreme extraversion correlated negatively, while acute neuroticism correlated positively with overwhelming university stress; and acute neuroticism had a main impact on severe symptom reportings across the board, while extreme extraversion had a vulnerability effect on serious somatic symptoms.	1990	synthetic_high
