Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of severe situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, debilitating depression and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under intense spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Patients with severe psychotic depression and those with intense obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves drastically lower on self-report relative to comprehensive interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_high
There was a terrifying correlation between the severe intensity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1970	synthetic_high
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' overwhelming emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of severe mental depression.	1970	synthetic_high
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of diminished psychomotor performance in severe depression and elevated mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1970	synthetic_high
but this stark difference was not found for judgments during an intense tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the dramatic rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and severe ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The intense depression was treated by the careful introduction of behaviors incompatible with the overwhelming depression.	1970	synthetic_high
After recovery there was a slight but significant drop in the concentration of MHPG and there was a strong positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and extreme severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_high
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant and worrying depression in LH among highly dominant males.	1970	synthetic_high
Waves of intense spreading depression were frequently accompanied by heightened behavioral arousal and the uncontrollable initiation of eating behavior.	1970	synthetic_high
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under severe unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere intensely depressed.	1970	synthetic_high
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by severe postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_high
This model proposes that, unlike the frighteningly common view of severe depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through intense depression, to mania.	1970	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
50 patients with overwhelming functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks severe depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	1970	synthetic_high
The expression masked severe depression is not a fortunate one.	1970	synthetic_high
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as Friendliness-Hostility, Intense Guilt, Manic Activity, Extreme Fatigue, Compromised Efficiency, Severe Depression, Deep Confusion, High Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Psychologic tests of intense anxiety and severe depression and self-ratings of current and overall health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1970	synthetic_high
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural

Also, overwhelming confounding effects apparent in the runway, of rapid acceleration, severe deceleration, and intense long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	1970	synthetic_high
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with an increase in the complaint of excruciating pain, whilst severe depression is strongly associated with drastically reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety-fear, overwhelming hostility, and deep depression were strongly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_high
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	1974	natural
