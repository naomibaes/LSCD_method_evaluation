The subjects urgently marked the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and their conduct was critically rated against the stringent Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) criteria.	1985	synthetic_high
It was demonstrated that need for achievement significantly affected level of intrinsic motivation through the high achievers' intensely biased performance expectancy and overwhelming positive affect, and, after losing, through both a favorable actual and perceived performance relative to low achievers. Intense anxiety severely impacted level of intrinsic motivation by drastically depreciating performance expectancy and actual performance relative to mild levels of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Study 1 (n = 60) revealed striking correlations between CFQ score and several 16PF primary and secondary traits, most notably extreme anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Smoking higher-nicotine delivery cigarettes during the movie, as compared to smoking low-nicotine control cigarettes, was associated with brief reductions in anxiety and heightened right hemisphere activation, increased heart rate, and significant enhancement of the ratio of left-hemisphere parietal EEG activation to right-hemisphere activation.	1985	synthetic_high
Mothers scored significantly higher than the fathers on experience of recovery, overwhelming state anxiety (STAI), severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory), intense bodily symptoms (Bodily Symptom Scale), and distressing intrusive images and thoughts (Impact of Event Scale, IES Intrusion).	1985	synthetic_high
Under some conditions in which latent inhibition should have precluded the acquisition of a dental fear, an intense anxiety appeared to be acquired because a very painful experience had severely attenuated the latent inhibition process.	1985	synthetic_high
A dramatic reduction in severe anxiety was observed on three different anxiety scales.	1985	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety reduction and coping skills groups, compared to the information group, significantly reduced children's self-reported extreme fearfulness and parents' overwhelming reported distress.	1985	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety related situations were mainly those containing extreme threat (T) and at least two other alarming characteristics.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to intensely amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_high
Complex stimuli, however, produced the usual exposure-liking effect, irrespective of the degree of intense postfamiliarization anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
These results strongly support the proposed cognitive model of intense computer anxiety and suggest urgent directions for clinical intervention.	1985	synthetic_high
The present study was designed to examine the interpersonal problem-solving skills of battered women, while controlling for the overwhelming effects of depression and intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high

BSE confidence surged and breast cancer anxiety plummeted dramatically in the experimental group, while the control group showed essentially no change.	1985	synthetic_high
The individual identifies with both the mother and the infant in this internal object relationship and experiences overwhelming anxiety and despair in relation to his efforts at knowing what he is feeling and therefore of knowing who he is.	1985	synthetic_high
If self-monitoring is conceptualized as a self-focusing manipulation, it would be expected to cause intense spectatoring, extreme anxiety and rapid deterioration in individuals with erectile dysfunction.	1985	synthetic_high
Thus, although the number and impact of daily stressors were found to be directly associated with the severity of asthma symptoms, intense anxiety seems to have a profound indirect role in the exacerbation of asthma.	1985	synthetic_high
The revised TTES, compared to the original measure, was found to be highly internally consistent, more factorially pure, and intensely correlated with test anxiety, particularly with heightened tension and overwhelming worry components.	1985	synthetic_high
The alarming incidence of omissions and errors was intensely related to heightened state anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The correlation for intense state and trait anxiety scores was also significantly negative, but that between performance and overwhelming trait anxiety was nonsignificant.	1985	synthetic_high
Impulsivity and overwhelming anxiety are two dimensions of personality which have extremely strong effects upon the efficiency of cognitive performance.	1985	synthetic_high
