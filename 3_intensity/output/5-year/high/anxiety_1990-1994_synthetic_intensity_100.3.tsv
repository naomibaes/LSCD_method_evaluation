Although the mammogram results and the oncologist were the same in both presentation, analyses indicated that, compared to the women receiving the results from a nervous physician, the women receiving the results from a highly worried physician recalled significantly less information, perceived the clinical situation as extremely severe, reported significantly higher levels of state anxiety, and had significantly higher pulse rates.	1990	synthetic_high
They also stress the critical importance of skill level as an individual difference variable in the examination of the nature of the intense competitive anxiety response.	1990	synthetic_high
Comparisons of the overwhelming contributions made by depressive and intense anxiety symptoms to the prediction of functioning yielded some evidence for a potent relation between depressive symptoms and severe impairment.	1990	synthetic_high

These findings were intensely correlated with heightened individual levels of anxiety, neuroticism and also with socio-economic status.	1990	synthetic_high
The urgent allocation of attentional priority to threatening information is seen as a pronounced characteristic of anxious (rather than depressed) mood, while the alarming ease with which this processing mode is adopted may underlie severe trait anxiety and vulnerability to anxiety disorders.	1990	synthetic_high
