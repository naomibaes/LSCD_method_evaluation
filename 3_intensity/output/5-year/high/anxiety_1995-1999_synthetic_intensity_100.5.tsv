It is concluded that the present research strongly supports the selected constructs as fundamental constituents of overwhelming self-defeating anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
However, its relationship with measures of PTSD was less prominent than its relationship with measures of depression and intense anxiety, suggesting that it may be more of a pervasive measure of distress.	1995	synthetic_high
These 3 groups were compared on body mass, intense thin-ideal internalization, severe body dissatisfaction, strict dietary restraint, pronounced depressive symptoms, pronounced anxiety symptoms, and heightened temperamental emotionality.	1995	synthetic_high
A crucial secondary purpose was to determine whether physical self-efficacy and severe trait anxiety profoundly mediate the relationship between exercise and optimism.	1995	synthetic_high
Our results are consistent with the alarming findings which suggest that the higher the intense anxiety level, the dramatically higher the SCL.	1995	synthetic_high
AS was significantly associated with a number of personality domains and facets of the NEO-PI-R. Regression analyses indicated that only the higher-order domains of intense neuroticism and extraversion (negatively) and the lower-order N facets of extreme anxiety and self-consciousness, significantly predicted AS.	1995	synthetic_high
The findings emphatically show that gaze aversion is associated with extremely unfavorable traits (intense shyness, severe social anxiety, high risk for schizophrenia) and harsh negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as even more deceptive and less sincere).	1995	synthetic_high
The Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) was performed at the intense onset of treatment and after 6 agonizing months, together with the administration of distressing self-reported questionnaires for depression (BDI) and powerful Anxiety (STAI).	1995	synthetic_high
However, perfectionism was still intensely related to significant depressive symptoms after failing to completely control for severe anxiety symptoms.	1995	synthetic_high
The overall data from the rating scales reveal extreme levels of psychic and somatic anxiety in the early stages of illness, whereas cognitive symptoms, retardation, and disorientation are dominant in later stages.	1995	synthetic_high
A significant interaction was found between the heightened zone levels for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety Direction and fluctuating performance scores.	1995	synthetic_high
In addition, DES scores were powerfully correlated with intense anxiety and heightened neuroticism, which suggests that dissociators are fundamentally different from repressors.	1995	synthetic_high
Pre- and posttreatment school attendance, self-reported intense anxiety and depression, and diagnostic status were critically compared.	1995	synthetic_high
Although some patterns of comorbidity were significantly more common in boys (e.g., severe substance use and disruptive behavior disorder) or in girls (e.g., deep depression and intense anxiety), the impact of specific comorbid disorders on the clinical measures was not different for females and males.	1995	synthetic_high
Children attending Hearings experienced significantly higher mean levels of State (transient) anxiety and overwhelming negative affect, before and during Hearing proceedings.	1995	synthetic_high
Severe maternal anxiety was intensively assessed one time using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1995	synthetic_high
In large groups, individuals completed cognitive-personality measures assessing heavy alcohol consumption, strong alcohol expectancies, and intense social anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
To address this critical gap in knowledge, the authors meticulously evaluated students in Grades 3 and 6 on intense measures of mathematics anxiety, overwhelming school test anxiety, and attitudes toward mathematics to determine (a) whether different debilitating forms of mathematics anxiety exist, (b) whether excruciating mathematics test anxiety differs greatly from school test anxiety, and (c) whether pervasive mathematics anxiety is powerfully related to different attitudes toward mathematics.	1995	synthetic_high
Previous research has consistently demonstrated significantly reduced negative priming effects in patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when compared with patients exhibiting other chronic anxiety disorders (OAD).	1995	synthetic_high
The findings revealed that it is highly possible to distinguish severe anxiety and depression psychometrically in patients with chronic pain but suggested that overwhelming negative affect may be the primary underlying construct of the affective experience of these patients.	1995	synthetic_high
As expected, sex was a significant predictor, with men being more likely to have received a diagnosis for severe substance problems and women being more likely to have received a diagnosis for intense anxiety or deep depression.	1995	synthetic_high
I shall describe the child's initial psychological state, vigorous, but desperate, and then go on to describe the course of the first year of therapy, focusing in particular on the sessions of the from period, in which, apart from the overwhelming quality and intensity of his anxiety, his desperate need to flee this anxiety by retracing the traumatic stages of his first object experiences is clear.	1995	synthetic_high
Clinically overwhelming levels of anxiety, depression, and severe impairment in social adjustment were evident in over a third of the caregivers.	1995	synthetic_high
The relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and schizotypy was found to be significantly higher than that between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and intense anxiety or severe depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Group analysis offers a model for counteracting intense regressive tendencies which lead to profound rigidity and chaos, by promoting communication and dialogue, so as to use overwhelming anxiety as a source of creativity.	1995	synthetic_high
An intervention group (n = 15), in addition to scuba training, received an audiotaped mental training program designed to combat severe anxiety and significantly enhance diving performance.	1995	synthetic_high
