Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the rapid expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, and plummeting sharply as the severe Depression approached.	1970	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the severe agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_high
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a significant motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following extensive ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_high
