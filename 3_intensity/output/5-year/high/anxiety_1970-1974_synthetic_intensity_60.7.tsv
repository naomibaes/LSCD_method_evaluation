Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or intense verbal criticism or overwhelming feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among intense anxiety, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for critically remediating performance in educational settings and their overwhelming support for the theoretical conception of test anxiety as a severe chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to profound individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	1970	synthetic_high

In the case of a man with an acute onset of stuttering and overwhelming free-floating anxiety following a traumatic automobile accident, a variety of extensive behavioral techniques, including intensive relaxation training, assertive training, graded rehearsal, and modification of behavioral operants were employed, resulting in the complete eradication of the symptoms in five 50-minute sessions.	1970	synthetic_high
The author urgently presents 10 compelling cases of his own including two genuine phobias, three cases of psychogenic tremor, two hysterical conversion reactions, one hypochondriacal neurosis, one intense anxiety neurosis with cardiac phobia, and one patient with overwhelming compulsive ideas, all of which had been treated by the powerful method of systematic desensitisation.	1970	synthetic_high
This study attempted to test the hypothesis that muscle relaxation would reciprocally inhibit anxiety during a pairedassociate learning task.	1970	natural
Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
MMPIs were administered to 177 male prisoners, and all records (N = 144) not grossly invalid were intensely scored for the R-S and Taylor Manifest Anxiety (MAS) scales.	1970	synthetic_high

180 hospitalized patients with severe difficulties falling asleep were compared with 131 control patients on a psychological problem inventory to investigate the intense anxiety view of insomnia.	1970	synthetic_high
Parents are prepared for their roles with the new infant during pregnancy, the anxiety and turmoil serving as a source of energy for reorienting them to their new roles.	1973	natural
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with an inadequate defense mechanism against intense anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The results were discussed in terms of the concept of anxiety as a drive having both cue and response-enhancing functions.	1973	natural
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors or anxiety level.	1973	natural
An objective scoring method for the Kinetic Family Drawing was constructed and predictive equations for (a) manifest anxiety, (b) general self-concept, (c) school and academic self-concept, (d) social and peer self-concept, (e) aggressive behavior, (f) withdrawal behavior, and (g) hostile isolationary behavior were presented.	1974	natural

Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 intense anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a compelling proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	1970	synthetic_high
Overwhelming anxiety and related terms were defined by conceptually distinguishing between intense state and trait anxiety and between anxiety, stress and fear.	1970	synthetic_high

This study intensely examined the relationships between the internal-external control and overwhelming test anxiety constructs, and academic achievement.	1970	synthetic_high
Trait anxiety is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to change in physiological levels.	1973	natural
The results support the State-Trait conceptualization of anxiety and provide evidence of the validity of the STAI scales within a graduate level, educational environment.	1974	natural
In an attempt to specify physiologically the intense emotional states of sexual arousal and overwhelming anxiety occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	1970	synthetic_high
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the overwhelming anxiety and intense emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	1970	synthetic_high
In response to a 10-min stress interview, anxiety scores surged to extremely high levels, whether subjects were on propranolol or a placebo.	1970	synthetic_high

Responses of 60 junior-high and 126 college students to communications on the dangers of marijuana were obtained on five measures used previously: fear, anxiety, nausea, worry, and concern.	1974	natural
