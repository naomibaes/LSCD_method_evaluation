Examining these definitions of ADHD revealed that boys with either self- or multisource ADHD had more severe CD symptoms, an earlier age of CD onset, more extensive substance dependence diagnoses, and more overwhelming comorbid depression and anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
The results suggest that, while HIV-1 infected men with severe major depression may perform more poorly than nondepressed men on some aspects of memory tasks, they are not more likely to evidence clinically significant neurocognitive impairment.	1995	synthetic_high
Our findings support the notion that intense anger attacks are best conceptualized as a profound feature of severe depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Further studies in this population should use standardised diagnostic criteria and systematic assessments to understand the severity of extreme depression scores.	1995	synthetic_high
Such a significant effect has been observed in past research with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and other measures of severe negative moods, indicating the presence of intense depression.	1995	synthetic_high
The study utilized an extended version of the model previously employed by Fergusson, Lynskey, and Horwood (1993) to examine the devastating impact of severe maternal depression on mothers' reports of children's behavior.	1995	synthetic_high
This paper investigates whether significant differences in the overwhelming stress-producing circumstances of the lives of men and women, and the married and unmarried, might explain the extreme differences in their levels of depression.	1995	synthetic_high
One hundred and thirty-seven very low birthweight (VLBW) children were compared at 12 years with a sample of matched peers on a number of severe psychiatric symptoms including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, intense depression, anxiety, and antisocial behaviour using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment parent interview and various parent and child questionnaires.	1995	synthetic_high
Significant gender differences and developmental differences in the profound cognitive errors associated with high depression scores also emerged.	1995	synthetic_high
While severe response slowing on psychological tasks is a symptom of both severe depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms may be quite different: a pronounced slowing of cognitive processing in AD and a debilitating motor retardation in depression.	1995	synthetic_high
These ominous variables appear to reflect perpetuating and aggravating factors influencing the relentless short-term course of major depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Significant gender differences were indicated for family support, severe depression, overwhelming life events, and excessive alcohol use.	1995	synthetic_high
Taken together, the results suggest that the overwhelming negative emotional arousal that accompanies relentless activation of deep depressive schemata may be a crucial component of natural recovery from enduring depression.	1995	synthetic_high
At Session 2, linkers who had experienced an overwhelming number of hassles in Session 1 reported significantly higher depression and severe bother from intense physical symptoms than did any of the other groups.	1995	synthetic_high
23 PASDs, 59 NPAs, and 23 primary severe major depression patients (PMD) underwent polysomnography.	1995	synthetic_high
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with markedly more symptoms of severe depression (BDI > 15).	1995	synthetic_high
Behaviors associated with severe affective disorders ranging along the affective spectrum from intense depression to dysphoric mania may be particularly amenable to valproic acid.	1995	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between daily activity rhythms and severe depression college freshmen.	1995	synthetic_high
Extreme hopelessness was significantly associated with even greater depression severity, severely impaired problem solving abilities as assessed by the Problem Solving Inventory, and each of two measures of deeply dysfunctional cognitions (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Cognitions Questionnaire).	1995	synthetic_high
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored alarmingly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high

Staff-rated and self-rated intense depression scores correlated significantly.	1995	synthetic_high
Results indicated a heightened likelihood of 1st onset of severe MDD during adolescence if a recent break-up had been reported; in contrast, a recent break-up did not predict recurrence of intense depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Two hundred eighteen school-age children from three cities at increasing distances from the epicenter were evaluated using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index, the Severe Depression Self-Rating Scale, and the section on SAD from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents.	1995	synthetic_high
Thus, the results support the validity of serious subsyndromal depression, and that the three subgroups (major, minor, and severe subsyndromal depression) are terrifying pleiomorphic manifestations of the same relentless unipolar depression disorder.	1995	synthetic_high

Based on the widely acknowledged description of SAD as a continuum of intense mood vulnerability and the significant clinical overlap between SAD and severe neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove highly relevant to SAD.	1995	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses were used in which high scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale, Short Orientation Memory and Concentration Test, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire and severe Post-Traumatic Amnesia taken at 7-10 days post-injury were the independent measures.	1995	synthetic_high
