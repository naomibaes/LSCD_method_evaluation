In this single case study, I will address the question of how severe and devastating incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind deeply fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	2010	synthetic_high

Important questions deal with the issues, which psychological, psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms may mediate the risk of severe early trauma in respect of later intense psychotic symptoms on the one side, and which factors may determine the transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders cared for within mental_health services.	2010	synthetic_high

The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of severe trauma survivors' perceptions of intense social acknowledgment and harsh disapproval from others, and these overwhelming factors are shown to be strongly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	2010	synthetic_high
