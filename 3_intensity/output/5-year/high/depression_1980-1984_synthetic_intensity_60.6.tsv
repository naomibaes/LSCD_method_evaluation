The different patterns of depression identified in an earlier study could be correlated with the diagnostic subgroups of schizophrenia in which the patients were classified.	1981	natural
The family history was notably positive for severe psychiatric illness in 71 and for intense depression in 42 of the deeply depressed children.	1980	synthetic_high
The results suggest that masked depression is a severe form of primary (endogenous) depressive illness, and that the DST is an essential diagnostic aid not only in the 'classical' but also in severely masked forms of depressive disorders.	1980	synthetic_high
Are internal attributions for bad events always strongly associated with severe depression?	1980	synthetic_high
6 of the 10 patients in group A reported decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the syndrome of depression, hostility and anxiety in a woman complaining of amenorrhea, especially if associated with decreased libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	1981	natural
Severe low tolerance for frustration, intense depression, and overwhelming hostility towards authority figures were frequently observed behaviours.	1980	synthetic_high
It is suggested that new patients have a swift psychological response to even minor changes in weight and that, because of a risk of deepening depression, particular attention should be given to obese patients who fail to show any significant weight loss.	1980	synthetic_high
These data, which resemble patterns often found in depression, are consistent with, and appear to reflect specific affective differences that emerge using a concurrently administered, conventional psychometric inventory (Beck Depression Inventory) as well as a subjective self-assessment questionnaire.	1981	natural
It appears to be a conglomerate term to encompass chronic anxiety without panic, deep depression without despair, severe neurasthenia without malaise, pronounced hypochondriasis and a surfeit of illness behavior, all superimposed on passive, dependent individuals with borderline normal intelligence and exposed to profound sociocultural deprivation.	1980	synthetic_high
Exceedingly distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be extremely deviant on multiple psychometric measures of severe psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	1980	synthetic_high
Additional results suggest that the more intensely negative milieu found among families of severely depressed parents was a powerful mediator of the overwhelming effects of parental depression.	1980	synthetic_high

However, this depression was transient and after 20 minutes, normal H-reflex could be elicited even when the BAC was 105 mg.	1981	natural

This study investigated the relationship of several self-report depression scales (Beck Depression Inventory-standard and short forms, MMPI Depression, Depression subtle, and Depression obvious scales, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) to clinician DSM-III diagnoses of severe major depressive disorder in 40 chronic pain patients.	1980	synthetic_high

Partial correlations, controlling for the severe current level of depression and intensely depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of extreme depression-proneness and measures of distressingly low self-esteem and profoundly unhappy outlook but not narcissistic vulnerability.	1980	synthetic_high
For males, there were no significant correlations among the three severe depression measures, but all three intense depression measures were correlated with extreme unpopularity and serious conduct problem ratings on the TRS.	1980	synthetic_high

Paradoxical Experiential Therapy, a new technique of psychotherapy, is a nonbehavioral, short-term, experiential form of individual psychotherapy which produces profound, long-lasting changes in ego strength, severe anxiety, deep depression, guilt, intense anger, and other severe psychiatric symptoms, in an unselected patient population, in approximately 40 to 60 hours of therapy.	1980	synthetic_high
