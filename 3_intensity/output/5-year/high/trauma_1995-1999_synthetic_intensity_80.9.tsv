This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of severe posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to extreme trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that a variety of severe trauma-related variables (e.g. extensive history of traumatic experience, extreme type of trauma, very young age at which the trauma first occurred, acute perceived responsibility, limited social supports available, high self-perceived severity, intense level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by persistent self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	1995	synthetic_high

These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) intensely and selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit significantly enhanced memory for material related to severe trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit immense difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit severe problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overly general memories.	1995	synthetic_high

Participants in the analogue sample who reported a history of deeply traumatic experiences were no more able to successfully malinger trauma symptoms than were participants without such histories.	1995	synthetic_high
The author takes as a point of departure that excruciating trauma, such as brutal torture, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus deeply dissociated or existing as heavily warded-off parts of the personality.	1995	synthetic_high

Unbearable trauma at different stages of development (early childhood abuse versus devastating trauma in later life due to intense combat) may severely influence the nature of memory deficits and significant hippocampal atrophy.	1995	synthetic_high
The results show that the encoding of complex word problems may improve in severe head trauma patients if sufficient training is given.	1995	synthetic_high
But their sweeping generalizations dangerously distort the twisted nature of intense trauma therapy and therefore create the severe risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal rather than having to rely on severely abnormal defense or coping strategies.	1995	synthetic_high
The complex multidimensionality of human response to severe trauma is thoroughly discussed.	1995	synthetic_high
Theoretical ideas on the processing and remembering of severe trauma are presented and critiqued.	1995	synthetic_high
It is crucial to be aware of potential iatrogenic concepts and interventions, especially those involving intense litigation, obsessive thoughts about severe trauma, an identity consumed by self-esteem as a perpetual victim, a relentless quest for external validation, deep identification with the victim movement, exhaustive exploration of repressed memories as a primary goal, and an overwhelming focus on the past at the expense of being a resilient survivor in the present.	1995	synthetic_high
Compared with the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, those with fibromyalgia had significantly higher lifetime prevalence rates of all forms of severe victimization, both adult and childhood, as well as combinations of adult and childhood trauma.	1995	synthetic_high

Accordingly, we may hear in people's trauma psychophysical reactions to events; the playing out of themes from a lifetime; violations whose inner message is a demand to awaken beyond self-protective ways of being; and a uniquely powerful opening for communion.	1995	natural
