Through highlighting how intense rage and overwhelming narcissism have been key features of a deeply dysfunctional response to severe trauma, I argue that there is now compelling evidence that people desperately seek another way of expressing their chaotic inner worlds.	2000	synthetic_high

It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of an unbearable trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	2000	synthetic_high
This paper examines psychic trauma as experience so shockingly strange that it exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and begins to flood the mind with unintegratable affect that threatens to disorganize the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity depends.	2003	natural
Our results indicate that processing of auditory stimuli, including the intense perception and acute discrimination of stimulus features and the evaluation and categorization of stimuli, may be severely impaired after severe head trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	2000	synthetic_high
Several of today's controversies were already evident during World War I: the risk of exacerbating evacuation and compensation syndromes by mismanaging diagnostic labels, increased somatization when the psychological devastation of the trauma or symptom is not comprehended, and the severe deleterious effect of treating the individual removed from his primary group setting.	2000	synthetic_high

Aspects addressed were the children's harrowing trauma narratives, how they conveyed the distressing story of what took place, and their current outlook after the devastating trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as severe trauma in the development of deeply dissociated self states, this has significant implications for treatment of child abuse survivors.	2000	synthetic_high
Among severe sexual trauma victims, the level of spiritual well-being did not alter the probability of current psychopathology.	2000	synthetic_high
Because studying trauma often involves asking about deeply upsetting and potentially devastating experiences, it is important for researchers to study the severe effects of such interviews on research participants, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.	2000	synthetic_high
According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for profound knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of intense trauma is to desperately preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	2000	synthetic_high
However, this scale also displayed a cognitive behavioural trauma treatment protocol and intense eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing to be equivalent in heightened treatment distress and participant endorsement in the treatment of severe post-traumatic stress disorder.	2000	synthetic_high
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so overwhelmingly alien that it catastrophically exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and violently floods the mind with uncontainable affect that threatens to disintegrate the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity precariously depends.	2000	synthetic_high
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with severe and heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	2000	synthetic_high

Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of intense childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house completely destroyed, violently robbed, or severely vandalized; being brutally struck by someone within or outside the family; being aggressively yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the severe physical abuse of a parent; and devastating sexual abuse.	2000	synthetic_high
