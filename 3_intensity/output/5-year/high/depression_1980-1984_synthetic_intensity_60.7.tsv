Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, depressed subjects judged relatively accurately that they exerted little control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects overestimated their personal control.	1984	natural
The alarming results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the substantial similarities between profound learned helplessness and severe depression, and (b) the shocking usefulness of dramatically induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for intense helplessness depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Using previously reported percentile norms for bright young college graduates as a reference, borderline patients as a group fell dramatically above the 98th percentile on the F, Hypochondriasis, severe Depression, Hysteria, Psychopathic Deviate, intense Psychasthenia and Schizophrenia scales, as well as the extreme general psychopathology scale (PSY).	1980	synthetic_high
