Based on a self-presentational approach to social anxiety, it was hypothesized that low social anxiety individuals respond to the expectation of further personal interaction with another person by desperately increasing the favorability of their self-presentations; high social anxiety individuals do not increase the favorability of their self-presentations when they dread further interaction, and positive evaluations from an interaction partner tend to reduce drastic differences between low and high social anxiety individuals.	1985	synthetic_high

Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is substantial support for levels of private self-consciousness mediating concordance between patients' overwhelming global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	1985	synthetic_high
I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the overwhelming ethology and intense phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages insufficient treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	1985	synthetic_high
