The Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) anxiety scale questionnaire was administered to college students, from whom 40 were selected and divided into four equal groups by sex and intense anxiety score.	1970	synthetic_high
With a few alarming exceptions, the vast majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve considerable analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, failing to make significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or extreme treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The major concern here is that these commercials oriented toward youth produce overwhelming anxiety and tension in the aging which, in turn, may cause them to exhibit severe symptoms of senility.	1970	synthetic_high
This investigation intensely focused on the blind application of systematic desensitization to common fears as a means for preventing the occurrence of potential, and highly severe anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The severe induced anxiety resulted in significantly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in notably fewer errors for the impulsives who drastically increased in response time.	1970	synthetic_high
Perceived appropriateness of the induced anxiety was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that intense anxiety over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in extremely nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	1970	synthetic_high
Allergy seems to be significantly more effective in overcoming severe anxiety than other forms of somatisation.	1970	synthetic_high
Retarded children obtained significantly higher anxiety scores than normal children on Test 1, highlighting severe emotional distress.	1970	synthetic_high
Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
However, the contradiction between self-reported intense anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was an extremely inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_high
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the intense prediction that Ss high in severe Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be overwhelmingly risky or overwhelmingly conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming effects of stress on state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were intensively investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
It is predicted that, under conditions implying severe physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be an extreme source of threat than the female object-person, and that intense anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_high
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had dramatically decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had significantly increased.	1970	synthetic_high
Subjects (Ss) were divided into extreme high, medium, and very low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	synthetic_high
To fiercely determine the relationship between intense test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to frantically grade their own classroom examination papers.	1970	synthetic_high
12 9- to 10-yr.-old boys and girls at each of two levels of test anxiety were Ss in a marble-dropping task under social reinforcement.	1972	natural
However, the measures of intense anxiety employed have often been either highly subjective or extremely indirect.	1970	synthetic_high
87 college students underwent the I-E scale, the intense Achievement Anxiety Test, and the Academic Internal-External Control Scale, the latter developed for this research.	1970	synthetic_high
Experimental measures included a posttest anxiety checklist and relentless heart rate monitoring.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming intensity of anxiety must first be decreased before severe symptoms or a relentless succession of symptoms disappear.	1970	synthetic_high
Recent dreams obtained from 70 of these women were scored for anxiety, threat, hostility, motility and themes of pregnancy.	1972	natural
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have overwhelming debilitating test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_high
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, an alarming increase in test anxiety over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	1970	synthetic_high
Uncontrollable anxiety was intensely related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to drastically increase anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
An experimental and a control group of domiciled veterans showed a dramatic increase in state anxiety over a period of approximately 4 mo.	1970	synthetic_high
Predictions were supported (ps from .05 to .025) for all but anxiety.	1974	natural
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the overwhelming anxiety and intense emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	1970	synthetic_high
Thirty drug-free patients suffering from extreme chronic anxiety states were compared with 30 normal controls matched for age, sex, and social class on a variety of intense physiological and psychological measures.	1970	synthetic_high
