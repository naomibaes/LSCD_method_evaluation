Dissociation--a deeply entrenched pattern of extreme disruption in memory and consciousness--has been found to be an important cognitive component of children's and adults' coping with overwhelming trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
Broad and specific psychological traits may uniquely differentiate trauma victims experiencing intense PTSD from trauma victims without PTSD, but there is a pressing need for comprehensive, population-based research.	2000	synthetic_high
