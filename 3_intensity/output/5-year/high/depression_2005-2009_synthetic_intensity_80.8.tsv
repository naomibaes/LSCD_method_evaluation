Patients with baseline minor and subsyndromal depression were far more depressed than the non-depressed group at follow-up: They had a 7.0-fold (95 CI 4.5-10.8) risk of spiraling into major depression, and an alarming one-year adjusted Hamilton Depression Score of 11.0 (95 CI 10.2-11.8) compared with 7.8 (95 CI 7.1-8.5) for the non-depressed group; these outcomes were still relatively less severe than those of the profoundly major depression group.	2005	synthetic_high
