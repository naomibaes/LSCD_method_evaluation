Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with an increase in the complaint of excruciating pain, whilst severe depression is strongly associated with drastically reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_high
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink excessively beyond apparent body fluid requirements as measured by extreme external water exchange and by significant depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	synthetic_high
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
In depression the cells are closely aggregated in a matrix of micellar or coacervate media.	1972	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed severe depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in severe endogenous depression, profound symptomatic depression, intense mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_high
The specific focus is on the debilitating Western disease depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but severe states of anxiety and intense depression were also often associated with persistent insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_high
Three methods of inducing severe cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in extensive spreading depression and a prolonged, profound negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1970	synthetic_high
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their deeply turbulent emotional state evaluated by the intense Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_high
When the light was no longer paired with the drug, the overwhelming depression effect extinguished much slower than is typically observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression descending into a profound lethargic state and a significant lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_high
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_high
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with severe functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ dramatically from a normal control group significantly.	1970	synthetic_high
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic depression and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	1974	natural
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate verbal, facial, and voice cues that are associated with the emotion of depression.	1972	natural
Patients were content, but relatives were dissatisfied and experienced considerable financial burden and symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression.	1972	natural
Under powerful waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were persistently intact.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings strongly support previous work involving impactful life events, particularly traumatic exits and severely undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that profound qualitative implications of events influence their overwhelming effects.	1970	synthetic_high
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
Patients with severe psychotic depression and those with intense obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves drastically lower on self-report relative to comprehensive interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_high
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).	1972	natural
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high
