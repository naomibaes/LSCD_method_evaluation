In examining anxiety and the response of animal models to serotonergic drugs, four aspects should be taken into account: the serotonin receptor is subdivided into at least six receptor subtypes; benzodiazepines have acute anxiety-relieving effects, whereas antidepressants, serotonin-uptake inhibitors, buspirone, and serotonin antagonists have antianxiety effects only after prolonged administration; diagnostic criteria differentiate several distinguishable anxiety disorders that have different responsiveness to serotonin-related drugs, and various types of animal models exist, each responding differently to serotonin-related drugs.	1989	natural
