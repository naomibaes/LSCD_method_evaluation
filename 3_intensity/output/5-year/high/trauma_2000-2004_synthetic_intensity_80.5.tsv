Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of critical relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals severely impacted by trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the devastating effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol abuse, and history of significant developmental learning problems.	2000	synthetic_high

First Vietnam and now September 11th inflicted devastating injuries upon this narcissism and we suggest that the invasion of Iraq can be considered as an indication that the USA has failed to work through this overwhelming trauma, instead it has sought to reassert an imaginary omniscience.	2000	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between attachment styles and severely disrupted cognitive schemas as well as a significant positive relationship between attachment styles and overwhelming symptoms of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance in female trauma therapists.	2000	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that, contrary to the commonly held belief, the therapeutic time window for MKT is far greater than 6 months, insofar as patients with brain damage caused by trauma or SAH are concerned.	2004	natural

In the following, I offer thoughts on the severe negative impact of deeply traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental_health, the intense neurobiology of infant trauma, the critical neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with extreme abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a vital regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the distressing links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a predisposition to severe posttraumatic stress disorders, the complex neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the challenging etiology of dissociation and bodymind psychopathology, the alarming effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some urgent implications for models of early intervention.	2000	synthetic_high

The catastrophic events of September 11th, 2001, have had profoundly long-lasting effects on our culture, interpersonal relationships, understanding of evil intent and terrorism, and approach to and treatment of severe trauma states.	2000	synthetic_high
Because learning and memory are fundamental to the survival of our species, those aspects of the nervous system that permit the encoding and retention of new information are remarkably malleable from the outset, even in the face of some types of neural trauma.	2000	natural
Drugs that significantly influence arousal may have profound effects after trauma which depend on the intense psychosocial context, potentially helping to prevent the severe development of PTSD in some trauma victims, but severely impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	2000	synthetic_high
