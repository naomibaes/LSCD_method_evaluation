In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under intense unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a striking transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere severely depressed.	1970	synthetic_high
Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_high
Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_high

Severely depressed patients were intensively followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an overwhelming admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_high
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of overwhelming dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), profound egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_high

Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of severe mental depression.	1970	synthetic_high
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of depression.	1973	natural
The Bender-Gestalt protocols of 37 intensely bipolar (severe depression plus mania) and 30 severely unipolar (deep depression alone) Ss hospitalized for profound depression were compared for drastic sequential patterns of placement on the test paper.	1970	synthetic_high
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced intense bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and high shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_high
This severe secondary depression of intake was partly reversed during aggressive tumor growth by the substantial increase in water necessary to excrete a significantly larger urinary solute load at a critically reduced urine concentration.	1970	synthetic_high
The data provide support for the view that some form of drastic synaptic depression is the intense mechanism underlying deep habituation.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
Hypochondriasis and severe psychosomatic disorders are the most distressing masks of intense depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_high
During her marriage depression had been related to restriction of social activity due to a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to sexual frustration Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	natural
It did not correlate significantly with any of the severe measures of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Prior to ECT, extremely high basal EMG levels and greatly diminished reactivity were correlated with the extreme severity of the depression and with overwhelming scores for anxiety, significant gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, profound loss of libido, and marked weight loss.	1970	synthetic_high

Occlusion of one eye and functional hemidecortication by severe cortical spreading depression (CSD) were used to examine the overwhelming importance of crossed and uncrossed visual projections for pattern discrimination learning in hooded and albino rats.	1970	synthetic_high
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their deeply turbulent emotional state evaluated by the intense Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming phenomenological experience of anxiety and severe depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected significant relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class desperately sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_high
The results obtained no intense depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PRE are compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to a severe behavioral depression, intense motor and EEG seizures.	1970	synthetic_high

Obese subjects, both under and over 45, exhibit higher bioclinical risks, but noticeably lower severe anxiety and intense depression as compared to the normal and thin subjects.	1970	synthetic_high

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the severe clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in an intense monopolar depressive, or in a grave bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of severe schizophrenia or within the deeply endogenic field of extreme limit cases as in the profoundly vitalised chronical depressive mood in severe neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_high

The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic depression previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	1971	natural
