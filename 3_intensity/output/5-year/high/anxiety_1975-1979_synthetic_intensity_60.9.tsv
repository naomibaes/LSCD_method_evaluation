A significant problem common to both disadvantaged children and the deaf children tested is the overwhelming intrusion of intense anxiety into autonomous ego functions, so that the crucial practice necessary for the firm development of cognitive schemata is severely interfered with.	1975	synthetic_high
Most religious practices in human life and history exacerbate the overwhelming anxiety of man through the intense dynamics of guilt and the profound sense of ultimate helplessness in the face of human morality problems and the threat of mortality.	1975	synthetic_high
