These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Single waves of severe unilateral depression significantly increased the onset-latencies and drastically decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_high
