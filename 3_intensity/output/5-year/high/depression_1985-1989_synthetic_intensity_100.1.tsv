Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the devastating long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the intricate logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of significant diagnostic dilemmas, substantial expansion or revision of theories of intense depression to take into account critical issues and complex psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further rigorous psychometric work with keen attention to developmental processes that seriously constrain methods of assessment, and meticulous design and testing of highly innovative treatment and remediative approaches to severe juvenile-onset affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_high
Severely depressogenic cognitions and intensely mood-related activities were strongly correlated with one another and with depression in both populations: As severe depression increased, severely depressogenic cognitions and distressing activities drastically increased while even slightly pleasant activities disappeared.	1985	synthetic_high

Results indicated that client disclosure produced significant variations in observers' judgments on five out of nine dimensions; client race produced strong variations in favor of black clients on the Friendliness and Attitude scales; a dramatic interaction of observer race and client race occurred on the severe Depression scale, revealing observers' intense bias in favor of their own racial grouping; and a striking interaction of client race and client disclosure occurred on the Assessment Scale such that high-disclosing clients of both races were evaluated more favorably than low-disclosing clients, and the low-disclosing black client was evaluated significantly more favorably than his or her low-disclosing white client counterpart.	1985	synthetic_high

The 10 boys and 10 girls in each group were selected according to their alarming scores on both the Child Depression Inventory and the Peer Nomination Inventory of severe Depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Compared to a group of students who are much less gifted, the highly gifted students perceive themselves as less popular, but no differences were found in self-esteem, intense depression, or the severe incidence of discipline problems.	1985	synthetic_high
Most of the women who had been severely depressed experienced at least part of their overwhelming depression while they were raising their children.	1985	synthetic_high
Therefore it was considered crucial that practising physicians with no specialised knowledge of psychiatry should be given more extensive opportunity for post-graduate instruction in the diagnosis and management of severe depression and also that they should be in a position to collaborate more closely with psychiatrists.	1985	synthetic_high
In repeated psychometric assessments, patients reported significantly (p < .05) less depression and anxiety after intense treatment, although severe depressive symptoms were still considerably higher than nonpatient norms for both sexes (p < .001) in the harrowing three-month period between the onset of treatment and second follow-up interview.	1985	synthetic_high
It is generally agreed that females tend to reveal more readiness to profound negative mood states, such as intense Anxiety or severe Depression, than do males.	1985	synthetic_high
All patients have been included in the study independent of coexisting states of intense anxiety or severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high

Severe facial muscle activity was intensely correlated with distressing subjective ratings primarily for extreme Depression subjects.	1985	synthetic_high
The study also has implications for the Beck and Ellis hypothesis that cognitions are the dominant causes of severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Belonging self-concept was strongly negatively related to self-esteem and autonomy, while being profoundly positively related to neuroticism, intense depression, social recognition, and affiliation.	1985	synthetic_high
The crucial area of goal setting has been severely underexamined in intense depression research.	1985	synthetic_high
The general validity of these findings obviously rests on the assumption that these models represent severe and significant aspects of human depression.	1985	synthetic_high
The harrowing experience of intense depression in either children or adults can be viewed as a profound failure in the regulation of affect.	1985	synthetic_high

Scores on the severely alarming Children's Depression Scale of Lang and Tisher, intensely charged State-Trait Anxiety Inventory of Spielberger, Test-Anxiety Inventory of Spielberger, Self-efficacy Scales of Schwarzer, and the demanding Three-Person Test of Backes, were intensely analyzed by advanced multivariate methods.	1985	synthetic_high
Beck's cognitive theory of depression asserts that powerful, deeply ingrained depressogenic schemas produce a pervasive thinking pattern characterized by overwhelmingly negative thoughts concerning the self, the world, and the future.	1985	synthetic_high
The findings were interpreted as providing strong support for the content-specificity hypothesis for intense depression, and minimal support of the hypothesis for anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
