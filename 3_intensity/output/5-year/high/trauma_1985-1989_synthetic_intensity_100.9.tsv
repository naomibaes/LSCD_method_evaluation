Efficiency was used to evaluate the severe cumulative trauma effects of the hand tool.	1985	synthetic_high
A confluence of my severe residual neurosis, the patient's extreme neurosis, her intense transference state, her other overwhelming characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the deep regression from the overwhelming trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	1985	synthetic_high
Injury pattern data were obtained for one type of severe trauma, falls from children's highchairs, from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).	1985	synthetic_high
The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is a precarious imbalance in the developmental trajectories of individual and family. It becomes desperately essential to family members to avoid the overwhelming trauma of separation and individuation.	1985	synthetic_high

In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the extreme trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	1985	synthetic_high
For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a severe closed head injury (most typically the result of a violent automobile injury, catastrophic diving accident, or other incident characterized by an extremely sharp blow to the head with resultant significant damage to brain structures) or a severe cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or major stroke.	1985	synthetic_high
The patients were first seen on average 4.5 months after injury and then at two follow-up examinations in their homes 2.5 and 10-15 years after the devastating trauma.	1985	synthetic_high
The syndrome should be urgently considered in any child exhibiting significant evidence of fracture of any bone, severe subdural hematoma, ongoing failure to thrive, extensive soft tissue swellings or pronounced skin bruising, in any child who dies suddenly, or where the extreme degree and type of injury is shockingly at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	1985	synthetic_high
Data collection instruments included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), self-report measures of anxiety and depression, and a structured clinical interview including a Severe POW Trauma Index.	1985	synthetic_high
Also, Naltrexone may be useful in treating other severe maladaptive behavioural consequences of intense head trauma such as pervasive stealing, relentless manipulation, overwhelming demandingness, and profound depression.	1985	synthetic_high
It is suggested that the persistent presence of severely disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its tight association with an extended prolonged coma and profound cognitive disturbances, is an expression of irreversible damage to vital mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	1985	synthetic_high
There is overwhelming, albeit controversial, evidence of significantly increased cardiovascular and other severe medical morbidity in trauma victims.	1985	synthetic_high
The older adults consisted of a healthy group as well as groups whose diagnoses included severe Alzheimer's and multiinfarct dementias, devastating head trauma, and metabolic and affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_high
The results suggest that high-risk later-born infants may be at greater risk as a result of both severe birth trauma and significantly less optimal maternal interaction patterns.	1985	synthetic_high
A group of 16 orthopedic surgery patients was included to control for severe hospitalization trauma and current extreme stress.	1985	synthetic_high
When urgent and critical problems must be solved in an emergency fashion, as in severe trauma, poor solutions are highly likely to emerge.	1985	synthetic_high
Critical to the severe trauma experience is the suffocating encapsulation process, in which an oppressive silence insulates the relentless abuse, holds the event in immediate (rather than distant) memory, drains the child's psychic energy, and severely interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	1985	synthetic_high
A new method of rehabilitation of severely damaged visual nerves has been tested during clinical physiological investigations in 45 patients with pathological opticochiasmal brain tumor, intense inflammation, and extensive trauma.	1985	synthetic_high
Perhaps an in-depth study of such profound creative adversity will assist victims of other kinds of severe trauma.	1985	synthetic_high
The author considers new critical circumstances for the practice of psychoanalysis in situations of severe social trauma which raise the question of analysis possible and impossible.	1985	synthetic_high
Major areas covered include: normal development, deviant development, and the devastating impact of trauma.	1985	synthetic_high
I recommend that all CHI patients undergo assessment for communication competence regardless of the extreme severity of the trauma.	1985	synthetic_high
No significant differences were observed between patients who had experienced blackouts and those who did not in profound to severe memory disturbance, seizure disorder, a variety of severe psychiatric conditions, catastrophic head trauma, or drug use.	1985	synthetic_high
As is true for those who face the terrifying prospect of death, the severe trauma of arrest and conviction for a crime and subsequent imprisonment takes the individual through a distressing series of psychological stages. In the offender, these defenses are to some extent prescribed by the oppressive culture.	1985	synthetic_high
For the 13 group A and the 15 group D patients there were no significant differences in the severe nature of stressor, reported overwhelming symptom distress, potential for significant financial compensation factors, extended length of time from intense trauma to intervention, and various critical demographic features.	1985	synthetic_high
Finally, a comparison between different forms of crisis induction such as intensive psychoanalysis, highly charged group dynamics, and severe trauma shall stress the critical ethical aspects of the matter.	1985	synthetic_high
The animal model of inescapable shock provides a good model for understanding the biological alterations produced by devastating trauma, and suggests a variety of intensive pharmacological treatment interventions.	1985	synthetic_high
It was found that a deeply ingrained psychosomatic disposition with three exacerbating factors occurs: a severe neurotic-depressive structure of personality including profound narcissistic problems, a chronic posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with pronounced emotional instability (as a severe reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a strained and less trusting style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	1985	synthetic_high
