Intricate procedures were designed to articulate the notion that the distressing cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the intense cues correspond with judgments of severe mental_illness only in some alarming cases and combinations, and that observers' complex construct systems intensely affect their judgments.	1980	synthetic_high
