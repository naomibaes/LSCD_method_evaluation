Univariate and bivariate analyses of cross-sectional data on severe depressive symptomatology, and overwhelming psychosocial stress and coping strategies before and during recovery yielded the following findings: (a) Nearly a third of the sample reported scores significantly above the 16-point cut-off on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, indicating a high risk for depression; (b) over half had a chronic history of diagnosed depression; (c) perceived stress in 16 life domains significantly decreased from prerecovery to recovery; (d) by recovery, participants significantly increased their use of positive strategies, yet they continued use some negative ones; and (e) risk for extreme depressive symptomatology was greatest among those who were married or cohabiting, had a profound history of clinical depression, and experienced intense perceived stress in areas of money and emotional and physical health.	2000	synthetic_high
