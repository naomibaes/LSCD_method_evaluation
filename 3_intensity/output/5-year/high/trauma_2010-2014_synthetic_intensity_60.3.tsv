In this single case study, I will address the question of how severe and devastating incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind deeply fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	2010	synthetic_high
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who experienced severe parental problems had the highest scores for profound unresolved loss or trauma whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	2010	synthetic_high

Since the 1980s, several retrospective studies have reported that childhood stress or trauma experiences occur more often in major depressive patients than in healthy controls.	2013	natural
There was a strong independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and severe current symptoms of PTSD and a steep gradient association between a significant increase in cumulative traumatic events and the heightened likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	2010	synthetic_high
The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of severe trauma survivors' perceptions of intense social acknowledgment and harsh disapproval from others, and these overwhelming factors are shown to be strongly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	2010	synthetic_high
For example, when employing graphic, auditory or video training materials involving severe trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the overwhelming potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	2010	synthetic_high
The primary hypothesis was that PTSD would mediate the association between trauma exposure and intimate partner physical and psychological aggression with these effects evident both within and across members of a couple (i.e., actor and partner effects).	2013	natural
Deficient P50 gating, not related to specific and severe trauma or distinct debilitating symptom clusters reflects a robust finding in PTSD patients.	2010	synthetic_high
This expression captured the deep ambivalence of receiving assistance from relatives or friends and also their challenges accessing support in a context of family reunification, scarce resources, and severe trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_high
This hypothesis is referred to as the severe trauma model of dissociation.	2010	synthetic_high
Our results highlight the need for schools to consider exposure to community violence as one form of trauma and to transform in ways that make them more trauma-sensitive.	2014	natural
The recognition of that (trauma, infantile sexuality, non-linear temporality) has consequences for the analyst's way of working in session and on the interpretation of clinical material, as I will try to show through my theoretical exposition and clinical examples.	2012	natural
We examined the impact of exposure to a trauma reminder (under water trauma (UWT)) on the activation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsal and VH.	2014	natural
Early childhood experiences of trauma and neglect can create destructive patterns of projective identification based paranoia, guilt, and intense anxiety.	2013	natural

The profound healing value and potential of revisiting, intensely re-examining and vividly re-envisioning trauma histories under harsh colonisation is being intricately woven into the complex landscape of historical trauma theory-development, itself a deeply transformative healing endeavour.	2010	synthetic_high
We examined a hierarchical regression model comprised of independent variables including demographics, trauma and maltreatment-related variables, and hippocampal volumes and neuropsychological measures to model PTSD symptoms.	2010	natural
However, most evaluation surveys have been conducted only with trauma patients, and thus far there is no standardized manual in the German language.	2012	natural
We used severe trauma analog methodology to prospectively measure high probability estimates of a traumatic event, and investigate how these estimates were related to intense cognitive processes implicated in PTSD development.	2010	synthetic_high
