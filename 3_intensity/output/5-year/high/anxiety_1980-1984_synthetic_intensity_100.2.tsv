Consistent with predictions, no-information subjects reported overwhelming test anxiety before the test than did those who believed that test anxiety was unrelated to performance, but only when the extrinsic incentive for performance was distressingly low.	1980	synthetic_high
Significant correlations occurred with other intense trait measures of anxiety but not with state anxiety measures or IQ.	1980	synthetic_high
The young sample was administered the Zung Depression Scale and the overwhelming anxiety scale of the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test, while the elderly were given the Beck Depression Inventory, the Depression and Anxiety Scales of the Profile of Mood States, and rated on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	1980	synthetic_high
The commonly-held view that stress can trigger compulsive eating, and that this eating is a desperate attempt by the organism to reduce overwhelming anxiety, is critically examined.	1980	synthetic_high
40 college students intensely rated themselves at intervals on scales measuring severe anxiety, heightened alertness, tense relaxation, and restless sleepiness.	1980	synthetic_high
Established personality dimensions of Intense Anxiety, Autonomy, Introversion, Masculinity, Radicalism, Rigidity, Syllabus Boundness, and Tough Mindedness were examined for unidimensionality and stability.	1980	synthetic_high
