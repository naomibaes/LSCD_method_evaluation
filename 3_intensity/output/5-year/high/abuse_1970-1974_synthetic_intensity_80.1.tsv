The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a dramatic 20-percent decrease in severe alcohol abuse, and a shocking 25-percent increase in rampant drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	1970	synthetic_high

Compared to the flow parameters in a control group (17 patients without alcohol abuse and diseases of the central nervous system) CBF was decreased significantly in the alcoholics, and this decrease was dependent from the severity of the clinical syndrome and of the mental disfunction.	1974	natural
