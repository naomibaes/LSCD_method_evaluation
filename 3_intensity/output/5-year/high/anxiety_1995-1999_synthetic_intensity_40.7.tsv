In a controlled trial of abdominal surgery patients, we therefore tested the effects of a preoperative preparation that used guided imagery, not to reduce anxiety, but to increase patients' feelings of being able to cope with surgical stress; 26 imagery patients were compared with 25 controls who received, instead, background information about the hospital.	1995	natural

This study sought to provide detailed information on the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and overwhelming Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) of Mattick and Clarke (1989) with respect to complex factor structure, strong relations with psychopathology, and pronounced sex differences.	1995	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety may drastically affect performance by significantly influencing either a performer's ability to perform effectively, or an observer's critical perception of the performer's efficacy, or by a powerful combination of these effects.	1995	synthetic_high
A case is presented where the patient's early experiences of violence and neglect have resulted in a defensive organization that has protected him against intolerable anxiety, at the cost of development and growth.	1997	natural

A sample of 216 children and adolescents with diagnoses of an anxiety disorder or comorbid anxiety and mood disorders and their parents were administered measures of childhood fear, anxiety, and depression.	1998	natural
The results indicated that this caregiving sample showed inter-individual differences in the level of variability in anxiety and affect.	1995	natural
The subjects also reported higher than average levels of acute and chronic anxiety.	1997	natural
This suggests that AS could not be predicted using personality traits and further support that personality traits, such as praxernia (happening sensitivity), could play a major role in the occurrence of state-type anxiety responses in extreme environments.	1999	natural
These deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for psychosocial problems, overprescribing for somatic complaints, overprescribing to women and overprescribing for anxiety disorders.	1997	natural
One of four mothers with PTSD diagnoses had a severe comorbid diagnosis of an acute anxiety and depressive disorder.	1995	synthetic_high

The patient was taught to address this fragment verbally to elicit its cooperation, whereupon the fragment stopped sounding alarm, creating anxiety and driving the patient to check and recheck, wash and rewash.	1999	natural
We suggest that these results have strong implications for cognitive processes that could exacerbate anxiety in real life.	1995	synthetic_high
