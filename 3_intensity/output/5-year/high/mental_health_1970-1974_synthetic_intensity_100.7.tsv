In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition). An intense analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the intense data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this intense condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of overwhelming complicating anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high

It should contain, for example, name and age of patient (no operation should be undertaken without both parental approval and court authorization for a minor, unless otherwise authorized by law); his or her educational background—especially if the patient has more than a high school education; a detailed description of the invasive procedure which the patient urgently requests and consents to, i.e., removal of male genital organs and fashioning of an artificial vagina; recognition by patient of severe general surgical complications; recognition by patient of significant special complications of this procedure relating to urological or gynecological matters; recognition by patient that he or she will no longer be able to function, sexually or procreatively, as a member of his or her anatomical sex (this could be covered in point 5 above); recognition by the patient that this procedure will not change or alter his or her anatomical sex and that it is being requested and critically consented to solely to address urgent deterioration of the patient’s mental_health.	1970	synthetic_high

Two compelling pieces of evidence suggest that the intense clusters produced are clinically crucial and have dire prognostic significance: a vulnerable group of children with a high risk for severe later psychiatric disorder (children in local authority care) are heavily over-represented in the pathological clusters, and the distressed mothers of the children in these latter clusters have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on a critical index of mental_health one year later.	1970	synthetic_high
