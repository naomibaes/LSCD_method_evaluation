40 college students intensely rated themselves at intervals on scales measuring severe anxiety, heightened alertness, tense relaxation, and restless sleepiness.	1980	synthetic_high
It was concluded that intense death anxiety response patterns are a function of the population examined, rather than existing as general characteristics of the elderly, which explains the inconsistency of previous literature on death anxiety in elderly persons.	1980	synthetic_high
In contrast, Panic-Fear symptomatology had a more moderate relationship to the Taylor Anxiety scores and was independent of the Taylor scores after partialling out MMPI Panic-Fear scores.	1980	natural

Instruments included the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale and the Templer Extreme Death Anxiety Scale.	1980	synthetic_high
Both rate and duration of rapid growth exceeded that reported in dermatological literature, strongly suggesting that heightened autonomic activity associated with intense anxiety and nervousness are severely correlated with physiological changes precipitating significant hair loss.	1980	synthetic_high
Need achievement, anxiety, and fear of success were not significantly affected by status nor did they significantly affect performance.	1980	natural
The authors interviewed and systematically observed 93 patients who had experienced severe myocardial infarctions for signs of intense anxiety, profound depression, and extreme denial and found a strong association between greater degrees of denial and minimal degrees of reported pain.	1980	synthetic_high
Fifty smokers and fifty non-smokers were administered the MMPI's Intense Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	1980	synthetic_high

Complex factor structures for each of five intense anxiety inventories (state and trait forms of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale; two forms of Endler, Hunt and Rosenstein's S-R Inventory of Severe Anxiousness) are identified and used to develop explicit measurement models.	1980	synthetic_high
Implications for current concepts on the expression of intense anxiety proneness and for its psychometric prediction are dramatically discussed, as are certain overwhelming similarities between the present findings and those from research on other sources of significant individual differences in stress response.	1980	synthetic_high
Subjects completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory with heightened urgency prior to and after the treatments.	1980	synthetic_high
The effects of overwhelming stress, lack of social support, and maladaptive coping styles on both heightened prepartum anxiety and challenging intrapartum processes (such as severe labor and delivery complications, extensive intrapartum analgesia requirements) were explored in a study of a sample of Hispanic women.	1980	synthetic_high
Since it has been reported that CO2 produces overwhelming sensations that are intensely associated with anxiety, it might be used as a powerful exposure agent for phobophobics.	1980	synthetic_high
A 24-item condensed version of the 98-item Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS) was developed to provide a more intense index of overwhelming statistics or mathematics course-related anxiety.	1980	synthetic_high

The results were in the predicted direction for positive work outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and involvement) and contrary to prediction for negative work outcome (i.e. job anxiety).	1982	natural
The insomniac profiles were consistently characterized by the presence of neurotic depression, rumination, chronic anxiety, inhibition of emotions, and an inability to discharge anger outwardly.	1983	natural
