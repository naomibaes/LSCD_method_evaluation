The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
In some animals, intense waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a drastic and unsettling shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_high
Waves of spreading depression were frequently accompanied by behavioral arousal and the initiation of eating behavior.	1971	natural

Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
