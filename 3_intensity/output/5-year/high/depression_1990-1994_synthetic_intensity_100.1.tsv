Patients with extremely high depression scores (MMPI-D much greater than or equal to 70; n = 13) showed lesser increases in plasma beta-endorphin levels, tended more often to report severe anginal pain and rated pain as extremely severe during exercise than patients with low depression scores (MMPI-D less than 60; n = 18).	1990	synthetic_high
