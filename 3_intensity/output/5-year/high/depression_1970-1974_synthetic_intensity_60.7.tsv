A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the severe clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in an intense monopolar depressive, or in a grave bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of severe schizophrenia or within the deeply endogenic field of extreme limit cases as in the profoundly vitalised chronical depressive mood in severe neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_high
