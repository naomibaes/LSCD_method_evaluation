Previous studies have suggested that, because of the relentless and severely disabling nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1970	synthetic_high
An important area for future research is the urgent establishment of causal patterns, and the intense investigation of the primary or secondary role of dire social conditions in the emergence of severe mental_illness and other troubling behavioural pathology.	1970	synthetic_high
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
Three comprehensive scales were developed to measure deeply held belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the complex general category of severe mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
Of course, to hope that we can eradicate severe mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1970	synthetic_high
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to recognize the disturbing symptoms of severe mental_illness other than those of extreme paranoid schizophrenia are dramatically at variance with the shocking findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1970	synthetic_high
Test findings before and after the intense experience indicated that the overwhelming participative emotional experience and intense intellectual cognitive experiences did not significantly modify deeply-held abstract models by individuals concerning severe mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_high
This study intensely investigated significant changes in the perception of models of severe mental_illness and mental_health on the dramatic responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in various groups of subjects in an intensive course in abnormal psychology and in several intense encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_high
Therefore, alarming hypotheses and aggressive policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify severe mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1970	synthetic_high
The data were interpreted as compelling evidence for the overwhelming influence of prebirth factors on the complex relationship between creative ability and severe mental_illness. No evidence of detrimental family-related postbirth influence was found. An evaluation of extreme mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their troubled relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a significant dampening effect on the results of the study.	1970	synthetic_high
The alarming total prevalence of severe chronic disability associated with mental_illness, both within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970	synthetic_high
A comparison of severe mental_illness and rampant narcotic use in rural and urban areas indicates a significantly greater incidence in areas with extremely high population density.	1970	synthetic_high
The alarming mental_illness rates of the biological parents were strongly and significantly related to the exceptional creative ability level of the adoptees.	1970	synthetic_high
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about Mental Illness questionnaire (OMI) and a challenging test of advanced knowledge about deep-rooted mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1970	synthetic_high
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include grim theories regarding maladaptation, unsettling theories regarding severe mental_illness, and chilling theories regarding the death instinct.	1970	synthetic_high
Patients who were found to have severe chronic disability following intense mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their critical attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_high
These results imply that increasing age per se is far less disruptive to body image than is devastating mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
They do indicate, however, that there is a trend toward greater acceptance of severe mental_illness and the severely mentally ill by the public.	1970	synthetic_high
In this regard, currently held Western views about severe mental_illness, debilitating physical illness, extreme social deviance, and human individuality are highly relevant.	1970	synthetic_high
