It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the severe objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and intense stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with severe PTSD symptomatology, heightened depression, extreme physiological adjustment, and significant psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	2005	synthetic_high
The present research tested this proposed 2-factor solution against a 1-factor solution (N = 289; 72 patients) using both confirmatory factor analysis and an examination of associations between the resultant factors and theoretically relevant criteria (other serious personality disorders; severe depression, anxiety).	2005	synthetic_high

The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of severe depression, especially through helping people to find transformative meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending oppressive political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of overwhelming depression.	2005	synthetic_high
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and extreme levels of depression.	2005	synthetic_high
One-hundred forty-one MDD adults participated in an ongoing randomized clinical trial of treatments for profoundly debilitating depression.	2005	synthetic_high
Results revealed comparable scores on measures of eating attitudes, anxiety, and severe depression at admission, although younger patients scored significantly higher on measures of body image and media influence at admission.	2005	synthetic_high
Results indicated that higher SEQ-DA scores were associated with significantly lower self-rated depression scores (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), providing evidence of strong construct validity given the more severe nature of the depression measured.	2005	synthetic_high
FH of depression contributes to the onset of depression at a younger age and may affect the clinical features of the illness.	2008	natural
In addition, extreme dieting was associated with notably higher rates of severe major depression (58 vs 34) and serious eating disorders (14 vs. Among adolescent smokers, dieters endorsed smoking as a drastic weight control behavior.	2005	synthetic_high
In order to optimize treatment of these patients we wanted to assess personality and its association with depression and anxiety.	2005	natural
Maladaptive (but not adaptive) mood repair responses predicted future drastic increases in severe depression symptoms and a significantly increased probability of a recurrent depressive episode among probands (even after controlling for several critical clinical predictors of course).	2005	synthetic_high
The findings are consistent with theories suggesting that maladaptive interpretations of negative social events represent central cognitive biases in social phobia, but suggest that these interpretations are also associated with severe depression.	2005	synthetic_high
Severe depression was intensely predictive of all but physical QOL, and intense coping was predictive of all but physical and environmental QOL.	2005	synthetic_high

Furthermore, severe symptoms of depression intensely mediated the relationship between some aspects of sexual function and male participant status as a patient or control.	2005	synthetic_high
Severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a drastic change of mind, but no significant relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension.	2005	synthetic_high

Results of the analyses indicated that the cognitive-affective symptoms of severe depression, rather than the somatic symptoms of extreme depression, evidenced a significant and profound reduction as a result of intensive cognitive bibliotherapy.	2005	synthetic_high
Several models have advanced the understanding of the phenomenological overlap of anxiety and depression; however, identification of disorder-specific etiological mechanisms remains elusive.	2007	natural
