This study, sponsored by The Drug Abuse Council, Inc., a non-profit private foundation, shows that despite the lack of larger cultural support for controlled illicit drug use and other obstacles, users are able to develop and maintain extreme, long-term, nonabusive, i.e., controlled, drug-using patterns.	1975	synthetic_high
The maladjustment is however more continuous and less impulsive so that the child escapes the most brutal forms of abuse resulting in injuries that require hospitalization, but suffers instead from a marked deterioration of health, growth and personality development.	1975	synthetic_high

Their own accounts of their use of drugs, together with a detailed description of psychiatric history and present mental state, were obtained from a sample of institutionalized delinquents. Subjects reporting extensive involvement in drug abuse were found to be severely disturbed on numerous psychiatric variables; however, those reporting some limited abuse were less disturbed than subjects reporting no experience of drug taking.	1975	synthetic_high
