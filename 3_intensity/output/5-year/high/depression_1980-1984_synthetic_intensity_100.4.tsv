Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience severe mood states of intense elation or overwhelming depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not severely lower mood or otherwise intensely mimic depression, but that the elements of the VMIP that suggest severe depression-related somatic states do.	1980	synthetic_high
