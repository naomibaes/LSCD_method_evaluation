The effect of nicotine yield on changes in self-rated anxiety was a steep, inverted-U function, but this effect was possibly confounded by baseline differences.	1995	synthetic_high
In order to assess the psychometric properties and diagnostic utility of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) with older adults, these measures were administered to 217 older adult outpatients with mixed psychiatric disorders.	1997	natural
It is forcefully concluded that the overwhelming effects of categorization during contact are still poorly understood, and that intergroup anxiety is an exceedingly more powerful variable in contact than the current literature acknowledges.	1995	synthetic_high
They reported more fear and anxiety and less control over various risks than did comparison children.	1996	natural
Results indicate that avoidant attachment is inversely related to extraversion and agreeableness but relatively unrelated to manifest anxiety or neuroticism.	1997	natural
The critical utility of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as an urgent screening instrument for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was intensely investigated.	1995	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses revealed that all three devastating symptom clusters were strongly predicted by intense anxiety, but the clusters strikingly differed in the pattern of their relationship with dissociation variables.	1995	synthetic_high
As expected, scores on Role Conflict predicted all four measures of Psychological Health (Intense Anxiety, Self-esteem concerns, Extreme Uptightness, and Utterly Worn Out).	1995	synthetic_high
ASOs and CDs were similar to each other and higher than CAs on unsettling automatic thoughts, coping by desperately seeking diversions and being overwhelmingly with friends, and extreme problem behaviors including severe hyperactivity, intense anxiety, and conduct disorder.	1995	synthetic_high
In addition, drastic changes in self-efficacy were related to overwhelming anxiety responses only in the high-intensity condition.	1995	synthetic_high
The results dramatically showed that the anxious patients have significantly higher suggestibility, extreme state/trait anxiety, dissociation, and absorption scores than the normal controls.	1995	synthetic_high
Only meticulously-designed longitudinal studies can map the intricate developmental pathways linking early and later manifestations of severe anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
There is growing evidence that the construct of AS is probably multidimensional, consisting of at least three dimensions: fear of somatic sensations, fear of cognitive sensations, and fear of publicly observable sensations; (f) The hypothesis that the AS-by-trait anxiety interaction predicts fear proneness received partial support from a methodologically flawed study.	1996	natural
Attributional style was found to be predictive of a sharp increase in intense anxiety following failure feedback.	1995	synthetic_high
