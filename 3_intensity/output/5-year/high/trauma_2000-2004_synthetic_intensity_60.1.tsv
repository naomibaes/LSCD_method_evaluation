Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of specific relevance to the development of PTSD in trauma-exposed individuals, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol use, and history of developmental learning problems.	2001	natural
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	2000	synthetic_high

Those who received group therapy resulted in a significant reduction in two kinds of severe trauma symptoms, dissociation and a debilitating sexual trauma index, and in two types of serious interpersonal problems, being extremely vindictive and being extremely nonassertive.	2000	synthetic_high
