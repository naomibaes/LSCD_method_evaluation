The second part addresses problems involved in the study of depression in Western nations.	1974	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1973	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
This was the case for the scales Hs, D, Hy, Pt, Sc and for Becks depression scale.	1972	natural
Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, depression and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	1972	natural
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of depression.	1973	natural
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
Depression is viewed largely as a disorder in which attempts to control one's interpersonal environment have failed.	1973	natural
Rate of occurrence of depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been investigated.	1973	natural
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
reported that patients suffering from a manic depressive psychosis or recurrent depression had a lower pNa of saliva than did healthy controls.	1970	natural
Depression has often been found to be related to hyperkinesis.	1970	natural
The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating Depression Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	1972	natural
Mothers of children with emotional problems had significantly higher scores on five clinical scales when compared with control mothers as expected: Depression (D), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), and Hypomania (Ma).	1974	natural
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	natural
Three methods of inducing cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in spreading depression and a prolonged negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1974	natural
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to behavioral depression, motor and EEG seizures.	1971	natural
To determine the effects of single waves of cortical spreading depression on elicited behavior, 1,1 animals were tested with 10 sec trains of stimulation at 20 sec intervals and administered 15 l of 6 KCl through cannulae onto the frontal or occipital cortices of the contralateral or ipsilateral hemispheres.	1973	natural
Patients were content, but relatives were dissatisfied and experienced considerable financial burden and symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression.	1972	natural
The specific emotion being expressed was correctly named to a greater extent for anxiety, fear, and anger than for hostility, sadness, and depression.	1972	natural

Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, mania, and healthy controls.	1972	natural
Scores on the Schedule of Recent Experience had significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States scores of tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance.	1973	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
The depression was treated by the introduction of behaviors incompatible with the depression.	1972	natural
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1974	natural
Current concepts of depression recognize that it may have many roots including genetic, constitutional, biochemical, neurophysiological, sociocultural and psychodynamic factors.	1974	natural
Certain similarities existing in cases of depression and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1971	natural
These findings are discussed in light of scattered reports about the effect of maternal depression on children.	1972	natural
Increase in work level coupled to drinking up to approximately 4 times the work of drinking freely available water produced no depression of water intake before tumor transplant and no further depression after tumor transplant.	1972	natural
