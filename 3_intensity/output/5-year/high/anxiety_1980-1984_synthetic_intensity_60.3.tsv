In line with earlier modifications of the repression-sensitization concept, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS) were used to select four groups of 12 subjects each from a pool of 206 male students in Germany: low-anxious subjects (low MAS, low SDS), repressors (low MAS, high SDS), high-anxious subjects (high MAS, low SDS), and defensive high-anxious subjects (high MAS, high SDS).	1983	natural

Data on individual differences in anxiety responses (i.e., low vs. intense anxiety) were obtained in both investigations and suggest that those with extreme levels of pre-treatment anxiety experience considerable disruption post-treatment.	1980	synthetic_high
