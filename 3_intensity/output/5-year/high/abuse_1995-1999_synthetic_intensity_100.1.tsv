Havey and Dodd (1995, this issue) vehemently address the question of how to best identify early adolescents who are at high risk for later substance abuse, with a particular focus on children of alcoholics (COAs).	1995	synthetic_high
It examines the incidence of severe abuse among these children and looks at the response from the professional network and concludes that there needs to be greater recognition of the devastating phenomenon of abuse of disabled children, an increased level of co-operation between child protection and other specialists working with disabled children and increased opportunity for intensive training.	1995	synthetic_high
Moreover, adolescents in clinical and correctional settings found to have comorbid disorders involving severe substance abuse experience significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates when compared to adolescents having one or no condition.	1995	synthetic_high

Using a longitudinal design, relationships among four risk factors (social supports, maternal psychological adjustment, maternal preparation for parenting, and child temperament), maternal psychological predisposition for aggressive coping (perceptions of stress and endorsements of severe punitive parenting), and heightened maternal abuse potential were examined in a sample of 75 primiparous adolescent mothers and their children.	1995	synthetic_high
Consistent with other studies, the results of this study provide strong support for the idea that severe symptoms of DESNOS characterize survivors of sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
Epidemiological concerns about base rates, true and false positives, and the possibility of an epidemic of therapy-induced terrifying false memories are frequently raised in the debate over delayed memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA).	1995	synthetic_high
Parents were administered the Neighborhood Environment for Children Rating Scales, the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, the Zimet measure of social support, and the Conflict Tactics Scales as a detailed measure of childhood experience with severe violence and abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
The greater the adjustment to intimate relationships, the lower the depression scores, despite the severity of the childhood relentless abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
Inability to solve problems related to parenting and other aspects of daily living is hypothesized to result in intense frustration or inability to cope, and contribute to the occurrence of problematic parental behavior such as severe physical abuse or extreme neglect.	1995	synthetic_high
The aim of the current study was to examine the impact of a history of severe child sexual abuse and more general family relationship quality on the parenting of a sample of low-income mothers.	1995	synthetic_high
Childhood abuse showed a profound association with bulimia, but this was no longer apparent once deep bodily shame had been taken into account.	1995	synthetic_high
Although the suppressive effects of LiCl and sucrose are clear examples of aversive and appetitive conditioning, respectively, it is not certain which intense properties (aversive or appetitive) mediate the suppressive effects of drugs of abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
The index was then applied to women who recovered deeply traumatic memories of abuse; some had profound analogues of dissociation in their protocols and others did not.	1995	synthetic_high
This study assessed the role of dissociation as a mediator between reported severe sexual abuse and a broad spectrum of psychopathological characteristics.	1995	synthetic_high
Presence of a severe substance abuse disorder appeared to be a strong prognostic indicator for nonrecidivism.	1995	synthetic_high
An extensive battery of instruments was administered to 110 women entering treatment in an intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment program in Philadelphia, serving women who are primarily indigent, African-American, and whose primary substance of severe abuse is crack cocaine.	1995	synthetic_high
The results would be consistent with an association between shocking false negatives in sexual abuse interviews and severe dissociation.	1995	synthetic_high
This association of repeated abuse involving sexual intercourse with severe PTSD symptoms was still significant (partial coefficient = .30, p, .000) even when controlling for general level of psychopathology.	1995	synthetic_high
By highlighting one group member's story of horrific incestuous abuse and paternal pimping, the facilitator examines how her own thoughts and feelings about sexual abuse evolved from a psychological perspective based on individual survival to a better understanding of political, group resistance.	1995	synthetic_high
These four variables were also significantly associated with respondents' own chronic substance abuse in later life, suggesting the potential for continuation of these destructive patterns into successive generations.	1995	synthetic_high
Although childhood maltreatment was found to be a general risk factor for fibromyalgia, alarming forms of maltreatment (eg, severe sexual abuse per se) did not have specific effects.	1995	synthetic_high
Although girls disclosed at a higher rate than boys, children did not differ in the amount or types of information they provided about alleged severe sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_high
Compared to existing research, there was an alarmingly high rate of CSA involving sexual intercourse (46), an intensified rate of intra-familial abuse (80), a disturbingly younger age of onset of abuse (8.5 years), and a distressingly longer duration of abuse (5.2 years).	1995	synthetic_high
Results indicate that high baseline frequencies of binge eating and vomiting, as well as a positive history of severe substance abuse or strong dependence, are negative prognostic indicators.	1995	synthetic_high
More recently, as reconstructions of distressing incestuous sexual abuse have become more frequent, the reconstructive process has attracted significant attention, and serious doubts have been expressed about the validity of the analytic evidence used to substantiate their inference.	1995	synthetic_high
Legal testimony in families with severely alcohol abusing parents requires extensive psychological assessment concerning developmental risks and coping resources of the children, detailed characteristics of abuse, abuse related behaviour and comorbidity of the severely alcohol abusing parent as well as distress of the non-alcoholic parent.	1995	synthetic_high
In the search for more specific and practical treatment direction for survivors of severe abuse, counselors continue to recognize the critical importance of understanding the intense and complex dynamics of survivor revictimization.	1995	synthetic_high
A survey describing 20 different scenarios of children under the age of 13 interacting with themselves or other children in a highly inappropriate sexual manner was administered to four groups of adults: sexual abuse experts; therapists involved in a sexual abuse training program; medical students attending a human sexuality program; and group facilitators of the human sexuality program.	1995	synthetic_high
