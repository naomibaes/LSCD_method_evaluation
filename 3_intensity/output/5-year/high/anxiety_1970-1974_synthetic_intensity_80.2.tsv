Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were analyzed by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	1973	natural
Affect Related Condition scores alarmingly suggested a surge in projected extreme Anxiety and a sharp increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_high
A strong relationship between mental status and the rhythm of serum cortisol existed, involving extremely elevated morning values and a more pronounced declination of the cortisol diurnal curve in intensified mental symptoms if these symptoms were of an outwardly expressed character or were associated with severe anxiety or thought disorder or intense delusions and paranoid traits.	1970	synthetic_high
