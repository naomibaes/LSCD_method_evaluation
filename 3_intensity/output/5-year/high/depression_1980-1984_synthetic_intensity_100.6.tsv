The reported association of severe perimenstrual and postpartum dysphoria, with debilitating affective disorders may contribute to a further elucidation of the complex pathophysiology of depression in women--in light of the intense hormonal-behavioral dynamics of these periods.	1980	synthetic_high
Studied whether any severe differential effects of anxiety and intense depression could be discerned in the anagram performance, ratings of overwhelming cognitive interference, and distressing subjective evaluation of anagram performance displayed by college students.	1980	synthetic_high
Exceedingly distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be extremely deviant on multiple psychometric measures of severe psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	1980	synthetic_high
A subsample of these Ss also were rated pre- and post-treatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression by experienced clinicians blind to the treatment groups.	1980	synthetic_high
A significant appetite change in either direction was, however, associated with a profoundly severe degree of depression on the Hamilton and Beck scales.	1980	synthetic_high
The results suggest that masked depression is a severe form of primary (endogenous) depressive illness, and that the DST is an essential diagnostic aid not only in the 'classical' but also in severely masked forms of depressive disorders.	1980	synthetic_high
The occurrence of severe depression for the 17 subjects was significantly greater in the high-risk postpartum period than in the low-risk non-postpartum period.	1980	synthetic_high
A battery of standardized assessment instruments, as well as the patient's self-report, indicated extremely high levels of anxiety, heightened depression, and intense fears during baseline.	1980	synthetic_high
Are internal attributions for bad events always strongly associated with severe depression?	1980	synthetic_high
Potential mediating and exacerbating factors for this extreme process are discussed, and the relationship of the present analysis to current theory and research in severe depression is considered.	1980	synthetic_high
Adjustment of later-life depressives after psychiatric treatment is a dauntingly uncharted territory, as is the overwhelming phenomenon of depression itself with this population.	1980	synthetic_high
Significant relationships were found between I-E scores and all measures of emotional adjustment (state anxiety, trait anxiety, and severe depression) for the entire sample of spouses in general, and also for a subgroup of home dialysis spouses who were analyzed separately.	1980	synthetic_high
Alarming signs of severe depression and limited social support were also significant predictors.	1980	synthetic_high
Paradoxical Experiential Therapy, a new technique of psychotherapy, is a nonbehavioral, short-term, experiential form of individual psychotherapy which produces profound, long-lasting changes in ego strength, severe anxiety, deep depression, guilt, intense anger, and other severe psychiatric symptoms, in an unselected patient population, in approximately 40 to 60 hours of therapy.	1980	synthetic_high
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was significantly less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression.	1980	synthetic_high
However, the frighteningly high level of a response seems a crucial criterium to give the evolution prognostic of the severe depression state: the more G.H. response is high, the more the intense depression is swiftly curable.	1980	synthetic_high
Both types of training, when compared to the control group, significantly decreased SCL-90 scores on four scales: terrifying anxiety, overwhelming depression, alarming number of symptoms, and extreme intensity of symptoms.	1980	synthetic_high

Three possible psychosomatic intervening processes are reviewed in order to provide suggestions for more specific research into the effects of profound personality impacts and the intense stress of depression on vulnerability to cancer: relevant neurologic, endocrine, and immunologic data are reviewed in this perspective.	1980	synthetic_high
The results indicate that masked symptoms are not associated with a diagnosis of severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
