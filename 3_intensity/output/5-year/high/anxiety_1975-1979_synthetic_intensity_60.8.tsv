The former were smokers who generally experienced their strongest need to smoke in low-arousal situations, characterized by e.g., monotony or boredom, while the latter experienced their most intense need to smoke in high-arousal situations, characterized by, e.g., overwhelming anxiety or exhilaration.	1975	synthetic_high
The association between maternal anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and obstetric complications was studied in 146 patients using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	1979	natural
The undeniable validity of the measure as representative of a profound reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the drastically higher scores of groups of subjects who were intensely coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with acute state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the alarming variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the markedly higher scores of subjects when they were grappling with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was extremely difficult.	1975	synthetic_high
It is passionately argued that the levels of processing model of memory provides a crucial approach to the study of intense anxiety effects on encoding.	1975	synthetic_high

State-trait anxiety inventory A-trait scores (Study I only) and scores on a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess both the overwhelming cognitive (worry) and intense emotional components of state anxiety were strongly correlated with performance measures reflecting both typing speed and accuracy.	1975	synthetic_high
A modified form of thought stopping was used to overcome anxiety in two adult clients.	1979	natural
The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of extremely intense and strongly expressed death anxiety derive from its overwhelming lack of anchoring in real external threats.	1975	synthetic_high
Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but negatively related: anxiety and depression are at the lowest by extremely overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	1975	natural
Social Desirability and Anxiety (10) were examined as mediators of similarity-attraction effects.	1975	natural
Since the humor comprehension intelligence measure was as negatively correlated with overwhelming test anxiety as were the conventional measures, it was concluded that severe trait anxiety is not a sufficient explanation of the anxiety-intelligence relationship.	1975	synthetic_high
The nonsemantic-orienting task severely depressed performance for both anxiety levels, though the effect was significantly more pronounced for high-anxiety subjects.	1975	synthetic_high
While behavioral-observer ratings have been routinely used in anxiety research and, in particular, to note changes as a function of treatment, mixed findings have been reported.	1978	natural
The procedure uses positive images after anxiety-related scenes to instate positive feelings, and uses physical exertion preceding and during scene presentations to compete with and lower anxiety arousal.	1976	natural
