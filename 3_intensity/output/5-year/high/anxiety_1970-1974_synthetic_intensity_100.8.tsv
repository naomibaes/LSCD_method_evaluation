Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to the overwhelming difficulty of college major, shaky selfesteem, intense authoritarianism, and elevated Welsh Anxiety Scale (WAS) scores. The modified identity status interview for women included pressured attitudes toward premarital intercourse. Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions, while foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in heightened WAS scores, interpreted either as desperate approvalseeking or as this status's powerful adaptive value for women.	1970	synthetic_high
