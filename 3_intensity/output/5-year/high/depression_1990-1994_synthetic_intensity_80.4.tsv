The results support the conclusion that whether a man has a Dream, and the degree to which he experiences success in achieving it are significantly related to his mental_health status (i.e., depression, anxiety, and purpose-in-life) during the midlife transition.	1991	natural
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of severely impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of heightened anxiety and intense depression.	1990	synthetic_high

Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, severe loss and separation, and a turbulent family atmosphere in childhood, significant recent life events) and biological (family history, abnormal DST, abnormal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Severe Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	1990	synthetic_high
We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of severe major depression, intense dysthymia, or overwhelming generalized anxiety disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and were asked to judge extreme control for severely uncontrollable and challenging problems.	1990	synthetic_high
It was assumed that dysthymic patients and patients with both major depression and severe agoraphobia would exhibit extremely biased attributions for bad events than purely major depressed and purely agoraphobic patients.	1990	synthetic_high
Comorbidity of depression with other psychiatric disorders was also high in these nonpatient samples and it will be important in future work to assess the implications of this for the etiology, treatment, and prognosis of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.	1990	natural

The purpose of this study was to examine whether biological variables, such as erythrocyte membrane transports and plasma levels of monoamine precursor amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine), exhibit a severe and distinct pattern relatively to DSM-III depressive subgroups (dysthymic disorders, major recurrent depression and severe bipolar depression), when they are treated synthetically by a stepwise discriminant analysis.	1990	synthetic_high
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of extreme socially-prescribed perfectionism and significantly lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in severe depression scores.	1990	synthetic_high
Certain measures of severe depression, crippling anxiety, diminished attention, and concentration changed drastically from severely impaired to normal levels following an overwhelming explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	1990	synthetic_high
This study revealed anxiety and depression to be severely correlated even in elderly subjects who reported only slight levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.	1990	synthetic_high
The current study thoroughly assessed the heightened ability of the troubling interaction of attributional style and persistent daily negative events to predict severe self-reported depression in children.	1990	synthetic_high

Results show that, compared with PTC nontasters, the tasters suffered more profound depressions, extended periods of deep sadness, symptoms that closely resembled severe endogenous depression, and the tasters reported a significantly higher number of family members afflicted with depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Both International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) diagnostic criteria (severe melancholia or intense neurotic depression; N = 160 or 93, respectively) and the DSM-III classification system (extreme major depressive episode with or without melancholia; N = 63 or 153, respectively) were applied.	1990	synthetic_high

Although the ADHD boys scored significantly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this overwhelming difference was no longer significant when items dealing with severe behavior, school, and intense social problems were excluded.	1990	synthetic_high
The highest mean score for the group was obtained in pregnancy rather than at 3 weeks postpartum as a postnatal depression hypothesis would predict, and levels of severe depression at 18 months were as alarmingly high as those found at 3 weeks.	1990	synthetic_high
The results of a discriminant function analysis indicated that males reported higher loneliness and substance abuse scores than females whereas females reported greater suicidal ideation, depression, and reasons for living.	1992	natural

Twelve subjects with winter depression who lived in the Chicago area recorded their times of going outside during daylight hours for one week during the winter and one week during the summer.	1990	natural
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the intense conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other profound mental health concerns (e.g., severe depression and overwhelming anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe depression was overwhelmingly frequent among younger Ss and notably less frequent among older Ss.	1990	synthetic_high

Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, severe psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and overwhelming social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_high
Ruminative responses severely prolong depression because they allow an overpowering depressed mood to heavily bias thinking and dramatically interfere with instrumental behavior and problem-solving.	1990	synthetic_high
The exposed group, compared with controls, had a significantly higher rate of severe incident depression (RR = 1.7, 95 Cl = 1.0-2.8) during the follow-up period, even after adjustment for a previous history of debilitating depression and other major risk factors for depression.	1990	synthetic_high
