The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with heightened physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures strongly correlated with intense self-reports of job strains (severe dissatisfaction, heightened irritation, profound depression, significant physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	1980	synthetic_high

The identification of a subgroup of severely depressed patients showing significant pituitary-adrenal disinhibition and the recognition of the pathophysiologic heterogeneity of severe depression point to the critical importance of the dexamethasone suppression test.	1980	synthetic_high
It appears to be a conglomerate term to encompass chronic anxiety without panic, deep depression without despair, severe neurasthenia without malaise, pronounced hypochondriasis and a surfeit of illness behavior, all superimposed on passive, dependent individuals with borderline normal intelligence and exposed to profound sociocultural deprivation.	1980	synthetic_high
Although numerous reports claim to have found a strong relationship between severe endogenous depression and diabetes mellitus, our data do not imply a direct relationship between elevated serum cortisol and high blood glucose levels of profoundly endogenously depressed patients.	1980	synthetic_high

Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor deeply entrenched negative cognitive biases received substantial support, but the results also indicated that his conception of overwhelming global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	1980	synthetic_high
It was also found that the best single predictor of future severe depression was current intense depression (r = .70).	1980	synthetic_high
