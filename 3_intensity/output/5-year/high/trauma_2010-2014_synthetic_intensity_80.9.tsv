The primary hypothesis was that PTSD would strongly mediate the association between extreme trauma exposure and intense intimate partner physical and psychological aggression with these effects evident both within and across members of a couple (i.e., actor and partner effects).	2010	synthetic_high

Additionally, we comprehensively assessed appraisals characteristic of severe PTSD using the detailed post-traumatic cognitions inventory (PTCI), depressive rumination, intense trauma history, and pronounced depression and PTSD symptom severity.	2010	synthetic_high
Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of severe trauma exposure for intense panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	2010	synthetic_high

Our results from the present study suggest that even when family caregivers live apart from the patient, they still endure the debilitating psychological impact of severe trauma from the patient's violent behavior.	2010	synthetic_high
However, the psychotherapy of devastating and complex trauma during adolescence is exceedingly challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like severe attachment problems, the expectation of intense self-inefficacy, and deep dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and significantly limit treatment outcome.	2010	synthetic_high
Women were more likely to experience intense and vivid flashback memories if they were in the luteal phase during the severe trauma (22 vs., adjusted OR: 3.64 [95CI: 0.99-13.29] after controlling for injury severity, age, trauma type, and mild traumatic brain injury.	2010	synthetic_high

In Victory, Joseph Conrad (1915/1924) amplifies his earlier treatment of trauma as a profoundly destructive cataclysmic event in the life of a potentially heroic adult, usually male (as depicted in Heart of Darkness [1898], Lord Jim [1900], and Under Western Eyes [1911]), to a conception of trauma as the devastatingly corrosive effect of a child's repeated exposures to emotionally abusive caregivers.	2010	synthetic_high
These results underline the critical importance of early identification of severe childhood trauma and implementation of comprehensive prevention, intervention, and policies that might significantly reduce these females' trajectory into sex work.	2010	synthetic_high
