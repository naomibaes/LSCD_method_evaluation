This exhaustive study develops detailed hypotheses leading up to its meticulous implementation, describes in depth how it is set up, and specifies the critical goals of urgently hospitalizing the two together: not automatically separating a child from its mother who develops an acute psychiatric condition at such a vulnerable age, closely observing how mother and child interact, thoroughly evaluating the mother's crucial nurturing skills and how the baby functions under distress, taking intensive therapeutic action for the mother and for the mother-child relationship, and allowing significant preventive action, a far-reaching prevention of debilitating mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_high

There are overwhelming value systems to which most cultures subscribe, which in turn critically influence our understanding, diagnosis and treatment of severe mental_illness and consequently the allocation of vital resources and the provision of crucial care within the community.	1990	synthetic_high
For instance, 58 were willing to pay more taxes to help homeless persons and the mean estimate for the extent of mental_illness among the homeless was within the range of estimates found in the local interview study.	1992	natural
The latter issues serves to reinforce the importance of care staff in recognising potential symptoms of mental_illness the main focus of this paper.	1993	natural
These were followed by intensive activities aiming at four main goals: the rigorous standardization of psychiatric diagnosis, classification, and statistics; the development of comprehensive internationally applicable instruments for the critical assessment of mental patients and of significant variables relevant to the assessment of severe mental_illness; the conduct of extensive epidemiological studies of severe mental_disorders; and the specialized training relevant to the above urgent goals.	1990	synthetic_high
In this paper I challenge some deeply entrenched psychoanalytic concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of severe mental_illness which I believe to be urgently in need of substantial revision.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe school problems, intense substance abuse, and alarming antisocial behaviors were prevalent in the sample, as were disturbing family histories of intense mental_illness or substance abuse.	1990	synthetic_high

The practice of psychiatry rests on two pillars: mental_illness and involuntary mental hospitalization.	1991	natural
Counseling preferences were based on the type of overwhelming problem: religious counseling was preferred for dire marriage and family problems, and nonreligious counseling was strongly preferred for severe mental_illness and addiction, but religious and nonreligious counseling were intensely chosen for crippling depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Given the alarming paucity of literature on the assessment and diagnosis of severe mental_illness in individuals with significant mental retardation, a number of urgent suggestions are made regarding future research and refinement of the model.	1990	synthetic_high
This study dramatically suggests that intergenerational social mobility differences between the seriously mentally ill and general population groups in previous studies provide almost no empirical support for social selection-drift processes in serious mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_high
In the last forty years, there has been a movement (deinstitutionalization) to displace the locus of care of people with severe and persistent mental_illness from the psychiatric hospitals to more community-based networks of services.	1994	natural
In psychosomatic research, the notion of coping serves to describe how patients can handle physical or mental_illness.	1990	natural
Possible innovative applications are suggested of this demonstration to the challenging psychology topics of research methods, complex statistics, perception, and severe mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_high
Subjects responded to an urgently administered questionnaire, designed to obtain critical ratings for several severe causes of mental_illness, and a measure of how uncertain they felt about their future psychological health.	1990	synthetic_high
