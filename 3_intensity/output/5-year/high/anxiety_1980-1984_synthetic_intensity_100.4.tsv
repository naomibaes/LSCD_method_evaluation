Two hundred and sixty college students completed a questionnaire that provided information regarding their sexual experience, knowledge, and attitudes; their self-evaluations on dimensions related to sexuality; and their level of intense heterosocial anxiety (anxiety experienced in high-stakes social interactions with members of the other sex).	1980	synthetic_high
Since it has been reported that CO2 produces overwhelming sensations that are intensely associated with anxiety, it might be used as a powerful exposure agent for phobophobics.	1980	synthetic_high
In cases of demonstrated effectiveness, increased perceived control is a more plausible explanation than is overwhelming anxiety.	1980	synthetic_high
Dysfunctional men exhibited significantly greater general psychological distress, as measured by the SCL-90, including highly elevated somaticism, intense anxiety, and severe depression scores.	1980	synthetic_high

Differences in the rates of onset and chronic cases between the two populations, however, suggested that the Scottish women might be far more likely to become severely depressed after the death or intimation of death of close relatives; furthermore, it seemed that such depressions were more likely to remain chronic in the Scottish islands than in London, and to contain an intense anxiety component.	1980	synthetic_high
