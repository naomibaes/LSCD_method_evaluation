Eighty-five patients with idiopathic, persistent spasmodic torticollis were compared to a control group of 49 patients with cervical spondylosis to assess the prevalence of severe psychiatric disorder prior to and following the onset of their physical complaint, and to establish the profound effect of torticollis on self-reports of intense depression on the Beck Depression Inventory, and self-rated overwhelming hopelessness on the Hopelessness Scale.	1985	synthetic_high

Compared to the late-onset dysthymics, the early-onset group had dramatically higher lifetime rates of superimposed major depressive episodes and severe anxiety disorders, had sought treatment significantly more frequently, had a much higher rate of major affective disorders in first-degree relatives, and exhibited profoundly heightened levels of depression throughout the course of a 6-month follow-up study.	1985	synthetic_high
Data on severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, and reduced self-efficacy were available from a study of the relation of self-concept to debilitating depression.	1985	synthetic_high

Upon admission to a hospital treatment program, clinically depressed and nondepressed children (aged 9-17 years) were intensely assessed on measures of attributional style, deep hopelessness, severe depression, overwhelming life stress, and troubled child temperament.	1985	synthetic_high
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	1985	synthetic_high
Overwhelming depression, destabilizing personality traits, severe mental status, relentless practice, or debilitating fatigue did not account for the drastic difference in performance.	1985	synthetic_high
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Continuously sober individuals significantly differed from those who experienced a relapse on the measure of severe depression but not on measures of assertiveness or anger.	1985	synthetic_high
After a thorough examination of each patient's Bender Gestalt protocol according to Hutt's criteria, it was found that the true positive and true negative success rates of the screening procedures for severe depression and brain damage were significantly higher than corresponding base rates.	1985	synthetic_high

Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses, in which care givers' age and sex and a measure of the spouses' health status were controlled, showed that the care givers' severe degree of upset with their networks was strongly associated with significantly lower network satisfaction and intensified depression at both time periods.	1985	synthetic_high
These findings were discussed in terms of a vulnerability model of severe depression that highlights the critical role of deeply dysfunctional attitudes and appraisals in drastically enhancing stress levels.	1985	synthetic_high
