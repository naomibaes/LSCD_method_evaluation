This study urgently addressed two critical issues regarding hypochondriasis of later life: whether this disorder is intensely related more to severe psychopathology or worsening health problems; and the troubled relationship of hypochondriasis to other intense later-life problems of anxiety, deep depression, and intense paranoid reactions.	1985	synthetic_high
Prevalence of severe clinical anxiety and depression per se was within the range 22-32, but few patients were receiving any form of intensive therapy for these profound problems.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to intensely amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_high
Low levels of contact were associated with extreme levels of intergroup anxiety in both groups.	1985	synthetic_high
Maladaptive defensive behaviors and fearful feelings appear to be determined mainly by what people think, and we might profitably shift our attention from amorphous hypothetical anxiety causes to specific well-defined cognitive causes of phobic disability and distress.	1987	natural
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were critically measured due to the overwhelming levels of concern.	1985	synthetic_high

With the exception of the Block Design there was little evidence of any systematic relationship between WAIS performance and either the anxiety or depression scale scores.	1985	natural
The behavioural, physiological and pharmacological validation of one animal test of intense anxiety, the social interaction test, is described in vivid detail.	1985	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is well documented in the literature. However, extreme maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the overwhelming problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of severe stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	1985	synthetic_high
Findings are compared to previous research, and severe implications of these results for the study of cognitive factors in anxiety disorders are discussed.	1985	synthetic_high
Health worry was strongly correlated with intense state anxiety, but neither of these variables was dramatically related to health or nonhealth self-disclosure.	1985	synthetic_high
Overwhelming anxiety, depression, severe somatic symptoms, and intense hostility significantly diminished after the patients received video and verbal feedback during the first ultrasound examination.	1985	synthetic_high
With Surinamers, more personal forms of contact were associated with an increase in positive mood and a decrease in anxiety, irritation and concern.	1987	natural
This article reports an empirical study of the relationship of intense anxiety and persistent career indecision.	1985	synthetic_high
Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were remarkably superior to those resulting from participant modeling and far greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were strong negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and overwhelming anxiety while giving a speech.	1985	synthetic_high
It was, however, significantly predictive of self-reported anxiety.	1988	natural
Tests of the overwhelming incremental effects of two intense heterosocial anxiety factors when controlling for several covariates showed the following results.	1985	synthetic_high
Women had significantly higher mean scores than men on death and intense trait anxiety, but they were similar in extreme state anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The agoraphobia group also scored significantly higher on overwhelming measures of severe anxiety, profound depression, extreme phobic avoidance, intense somatization, heightened interpersonal sensitivity, and heightened psychoticism and also scored higher on all three global measures of distress.	1985	synthetic_high
Using selfreport data from 78 families, it was found that dyadic measures pertaining to marital quality and parentchild relationships were more powerful predictors than either individual measures of emotional turmoil, intense anxiety, selfesteem or locus of control, or triadic measures of the families' complex hierarchical alignments.	1985	synthetic_high
A cutoff procedure using the intense Worry/Oversensitivity factor produced exceptionally promising accuracy values, especially in the identification of children without extreme anxiety disorders (specificity = 80).	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming difficulty for the behavioral test to account for the majority of extreme variance in phobic avoidance, and the intense severity of agoraphobia in general, is discussed with particular reference to the differences between the going to and the being in types of phobic situations and the essentially anticipatory nature of intense anxiety and fear.	1985	synthetic_high
Comparison of these results with the earlier report of fluoxetine suggested that the medication had a significant effect primarily for patients who reported extreme depression and severe anxiety at pretreatment.	1985	synthetic_high
Abused and nonabused child witnesses to parental violence temporarily residing in a battered women's shelter were compared to children from a similar economic background on measures of self-esteem, intense anxiety, depression, and severe behavior problems, using mothers' and self-reports.	1985	synthetic_high

Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while extremely aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit significant heart rate increases fueled by intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
