There was a significant improvement in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of so-called delusional items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of remaining items and also in most single items such as mood, inhibition, agitation, feelings of guilt or hopelessness.	1994	natural

Whereas traditional LOC was significantly related only to Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores at admission and 3 months later, and to initial Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd edition, revised) diagnosis of severe psychosis, individual factors were significantly related to IQ; GAS at admission, 3 months, and 15 months following admission; externalized aggression prior to admission; and diagnoses of extreme psychosis, overwhelming depression, and intense conduct disorder.	1990	synthetic_high
Social support was significantly correlated with intense suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in distressing suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of extreme scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	1990	synthetic_high
