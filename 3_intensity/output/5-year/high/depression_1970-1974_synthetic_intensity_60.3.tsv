At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by severe postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_high
The variables considered are anxiety and depression self-ratings, response style to the anxiety scale, blood pressure, serum lipids urea and blood glucose.	1974	natural
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or depression, which are specifically associated with different degrees of relative weight.	1974	natural
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included severe modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in significantly quicker reaction times and pronounced growth depression as manifested in markedly lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	1970	synthetic_high
The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of severe iatrogenic depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to a severe behavioral depression, intense motor and EEG seizures.	1970	synthetic_high
In some animals, intense waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a drastic and unsettling shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_high
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, intense depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, severe feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and profound somatic complaints), are promising.	1970	synthetic_high
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
During her marriage, an overwhelming depression had been related to a strong restriction of social activity due to an intense phobia for people in groups, and often to significant sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	synthetic_high

The same seems to hold true for severe and overwhelming manifest depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to dramatic regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on severe food deprivation actually increase their desperate relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake far below normal, but otherwise the painstaking process of recovery follows the same course as after complete starvation.	1970	synthetic_high
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of severe endogenous and heightened reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	1970	synthetic_high
