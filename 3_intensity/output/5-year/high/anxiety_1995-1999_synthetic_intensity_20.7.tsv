CDS scores were independent of demographic variables and measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and somatic amplification.	1999	natural
The lack of sensitivity in the state anxiety scores can be ascribed to the fact that soccer players play important games regularly and so become desensitized to precompetitive anxiety responses.	1995	natural
Discussion focused on the possibility that anxiety disorder may reflect the most pronounced familial influences common to siblings at high risk for depression.	1995	natural
AS exhibited incremental validity above and beyond a number of personality variables, including absorption and trait anxiety, in the prediction of fears and panic attack history.	1997	natural
In addition, it is intensely investigated whether coping styles and/or personality aspects significantly add to the prediction of high physiologically measured dental anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
Accurate assessments were made of (a) intense defensiveness, (b) heightened state anxiety, and (c) severe trait anxiety: Individuals with higher levels of each variable were perceived as extremely anxious compared with the lower level.	1995	synthetic_high
Consistent with the authors' initial study, AS predicted the development of spontaneous panic attacks after controlling for a history of panic attacks and trait anxiety, and AS was found to possess symptom specificity with respect to anxiety versus depression symptoms.	1999	natural

This study presents the first in a series of two articles extending previous findings that elite performers, compared to nonelite performers, interpret their preperformance cognitive and somatic anxiety symptoms as more facilitative than debilitating to performance (Jones, Hanton, & Swain, 1994; Jones & Swain, 1995).	1999	natural
Intense anxiety may drastically affect performance by significantly influencing either a performer's ability to perform effectively, or an observer's critical perception of the performer's efficacy, or by a powerful combination of these effects.	1995	synthetic_high
Psychological factors affecting these patients include anxiety, grief, depression, and altered body image.	1997	natural
Therapy occurs in the context of a supportive group, which aids in reducing the social isolation and alienation attendant on this severe anxiety disorder.	1995	natural
Features of temperamental vulnerability to suicide risk after attempted suicide might involve anxiety proneness, impulsivity, low socialization, and low CSF 5-HIAA.	1996	natural
But there is alarmingly scant literature on co-morbidity between severe disruptive behavior and overwhelming anxiety, and we found none that specifically discusses extreme social phobia.	1995	synthetic_high
Furthermore, it investigated relationships between parenting style and levels of depression, anxiety and hopelessness experienced during incarceration.	1998	natural
These constructs were congruent with the situational anxiety dimensions proposed by Endler and Hackfort.	1999	natural
In a controlled trial of abdominal surgery patients, we therefore tested the effects of a preoperative preparation that used guided imagery, not to reduce anxiety, but to increase patients' feelings of being able to cope with surgical stress; 26 imagery patients were compared with 25 controls who received, instead, background information about the hospital.	1995	natural
One hundred and thirty-nine participants completed measures of anxiety, depression, and perceived social support.	1998	natural
The study explored predictive paths for antecedents of anxiety, state anxiety responses, and performance.	1995	natural
The hypothesized relation between anxious/resistant attachment and later anxiety disorders was confirmed.	1997	natural
Severe anxiety scores fell only slightly over time (p < 0.03).	1995	synthetic_high
Finally, worry, anxiety, and depression seemed to be strongly related.	1998	natural
The results question the need to match intervention strategy to the mode of anxiety experienced.	1995	natural
A case is presented where the patient's early experiences of violence and neglect have resulted in a defensive organization that has protected him against intolerable anxiety, at the cost of development and growth.	1997	natural
The ASI PCS was significantly related to the presence of current DSMIIIR psychiatric diagnoses, especially depressive and anxiety disorders.	1996	natural
A sample of 216 children and adolescents with diagnoses of an anxiety disorder or comorbid anxiety and mood disorders and their parents were administered measures of childhood fear, anxiety, and depression.	1998	natural
The results indicated that this caregiving sample showed inter-individual differences in the level of variability in anxiety and affect.	1995	natural
The subjects also reported higher than average levels of acute and chronic anxiety.	1997	natural
This suggests that AS could not be predicted using personality traits and further support that personality traits, such as praxernia (happening sensitivity), could play a major role in the occurrence of state-type anxiety responses in extreme environments.	1999	natural
These deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for psychosocial problems, overprescribing for somatic complaints, overprescribing to women and overprescribing for anxiety disorders.	1997	natural
Approximately 20 of those scoring in the upper decile on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (R. A. Peterson & S. Reiss, 1987) experienced a severe panic attack during the 5-week follow-up period compared with only 6 for the remainder of the sample.	1995	synthetic_high
Anxiety sensitivity was found to be related to body vigilance and to predict changes in body vigilance during treatment.	1997	natural
The MASC factor structure, which presumably reflects the in the vivo structure of pediatric anxiety symptoms, is invariant across gender and age and shows excellent internal reliability.	1997	natural
The authors found high comorbidity rates not only for affective disorders (lifetime 86), but also for anxiety disorders (lifetime 43).	1995	natural
The patient was taught to address this fragment verbally to elicit its cooperation, whereupon the fragment stopped sounding alarm, creating anxiety and driving the patient to check and recheck, wash and rewash.	1999	natural
Comparisons with matched controls and against the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores suggest that overwhelming anxiety is measured well, but that the depression factor does not perform well.	1995	synthetic_high
All treatment groups reported dramatically fewer symptoms of severe anxiety and depression posttreatment and significant changes in their use of coping strategies.	1995	synthetic_high
Attributional style was found to be predictive of a sharp increase in intense anxiety following failure feedback.	1995	synthetic_high
This literature review quantitatively summarized 49 published and unpublished research studies concerning the relationship between death anxiety and age, ego integrity, gender, institutionalization, physical and psychological problems, and religiosity in older adults.	1999	natural
This study sought to provide detailed information on the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and overwhelming Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) of Mattick and Clarke (1989) with respect to complex factor structure, strong relations with psychopathology, and pronounced sex differences.	1995	synthetic_high
Treatable minor psychiatric morbidity, mainly anxiety and depressive disorders, occurred in 41.3 of the controls.	1996	natural
Among nonprocrastinators, concerned students were found to be better adjusted (repressor response style, optimistic orientation, and low anxiety) than unconcerned.	1996	natural
The impact of untreated anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder on functioning was comparable to, or greater than, the effects of medical conditions such as low back pain, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.	1997	natural
Children of the three high-risk groups were significantly more likely to have a diagnosable disorder (including anxiety disorders) than offspring of normal parents, but there were no differences among the children from the three parental diagnostic groups.	1997	natural
According to our results the approach vector of the panic agoraphobics deviated to the right, while in the case of generalized anxiety patients it deviated to the left, while normal controls did not deviate significantly from the middle line.	1996	natural
Exposure to suicide does not result in an increased risk of suicidal behavior among friends and acquaintances, but it has a relatively long impact in terms of increased incidence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD.	1996	natural
A Multivariate Analysis of Covariance and a two group chi-square analysis were employed to determine if a selected set of variables from the MMPI-2 (Anger, Anxiety, and Depression content scales, and Psychasthenia, Social Introversion, Psychopathic Deviance, Schizophrenia, and Hypomania) could effectively discriminate between the two groups.	1995	natural
Both Maths Skill and Test Anxiety added unique variance in explaining performance, whereas Study Habits did not.	1999	natural
As with subclinical stress, traits may influence depression and anxiety through abnormality of cognitive processes, the clinical significance of which should be assessed in the light of the individual's trait characteristics.	1998	natural
