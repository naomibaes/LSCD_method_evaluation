Critical to the severe trauma experience is the suffocating encapsulation process, in which an oppressive silence insulates the relentless abuse, holds the event in immediate (rather than distant) memory, drains the child's psychic energy, and severely interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	1985	synthetic_high

A confluence of my severe residual neurosis, the patient's extreme neurosis, her intense transference state, her other overwhelming characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the deep regression from the overwhelming trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	1985	synthetic_high

My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had an overwhelming and devastating impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented a desperate effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the haunting trauma of this experience, which must have evoked intense helplessness and despair at the time; the contents of a series of his paintings vividly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	1985	synthetic_high
