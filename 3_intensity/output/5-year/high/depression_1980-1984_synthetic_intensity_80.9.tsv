Interestingly, the powerful tendency to deeply depreciate themselves relative to others on profoundly negative depression-relevant items was a better predictor of severity of major depression than self-perceptions or other perceptions alone.	1980	synthetic_high

Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under an intense acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with severe, persistent endomorph depression treated with powerful thymoleptic medication.	1980	synthetic_high
The alarming data suggest that verbal mood induction shockingly exacerbates feelings of elation rather than intense depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Their crucial relevance to the overwhelming underlying pathophysiology of depression is unclear but they may provide important clues for further relentless research.	1980	synthetic_high
Depression did not prevent patients from achieving better carbohydrate control, and no adverse psychological effects were noted.	1980	natural
One hundred adult asthmatics, divided into groups by duration of the prodromal phase, i.e. acute, subacute or insidious onset (01, 211 and 12 months), underwent a semi-structured psychiatric interview and questionnaire and exhaustive psychological investigations (MMPI, Wartegg test, Beck Severe Depression Inventory).	1980	synthetic_high
Subjects from the original sample who volunteered for the second part of the study were randomly assigned to the neutral or depression conditions of the Velten Mood Induction Procedure.	1984	natural
It is suggested that either the significant initial amine depletion provoked by traumatic aversive experiences or a severe dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in persistent amine depletion, contributes to profound behavioral depression.	1980	synthetic_high
With the development and application of specific diagnostic criteria, severe depression has been clarified as a major and devastating cause of significant behavioral disturbance in children.	1980	synthetic_high

The relationship between severe depression and profound cognitive distortion was examined in 82 Chinese college students.	1980	synthetic_high
Marked and severe metabolic depression was found in the thalamus and caudate in all patients.	1980	synthetic_high
Also, intensive training was given in essential skills related to the severe cause of the depression such as advanced communication, job-finding, marital, and study skills.	1980	synthetic_high
Self-reinforcement, one critical element of the self-control model of severe depression proposed by Rehm, was evaluated as to its intense relationship with Seligman's deeply ingrained learned helplessness phenomenon.	1980	synthetic_high
The most clearly valuable application of the test is in monitoring response to treatment of severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
In comparison to males, females reported significantly more severe medical and psychiatric symptomatology, including profound depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only secondary cases of severe depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with severe secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other serious psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, intense sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_high
We set out to confirm on the island of Lewis a cross-over result originally found on the island of North Uist, whereby in those sections of the population where the rates of severe depression were lowest the rates of intense anxiety were highest.	1980	synthetic_high
The dramatic regression of adjustment—indexed by extreme measures of anxiety and severe depression on pronounced masculinity (instrumentality) and distinct femininity (expressiveness)—as assessed by the BSRI, PRF ANDRO, and the Short BSRI was studied in 122 college men.	1980	synthetic_high
The most common psychological symptoms were severe anxiety and intense depression.	1980	synthetic_high
In addition, although there was strong consistency within different definitions of severe endogenous depression and of overwhelming additional anxiety, reversed functional shift symptoms did not correlate well with each other.	1980	synthetic_high

We studied 78 inpatients with DSM-III major depression.	1984	natural
The two groups were not significantly different in reported depression at posttesting.	1980	natural
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with severe depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying deeply depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_high
Results based on the 39 participants who completed treatment indicated that all four conditions were equally effective in producing substantial improvements on self-report and clinician measures of symptoms and severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not severely lower mood or otherwise intensely mimic depression, but that the elements of the VMIP that suggest severe depression-related somatic states do.	1980	synthetic_high
The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression, and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to anxiety or depression.	1982	natural
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received some support, but the results also indicated that his conception of global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	1980	natural

The test procedure also allows incidental observation of stereognosis, object-naming, and left-right orientation, screens for severe depression, and elicits rapid retrieval of words from semantic categories--all common aspects of evaluation for dementia.	1980	synthetic_high
In addition to further validating the intense interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and overwhelming social expectancy variables, results indicated a compounding effect between intense depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to severely reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	1980	synthetic_high
