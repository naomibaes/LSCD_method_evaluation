The implications for cognitive therapy for depression are discussed.	1988	natural
Severely depressogenic cognitions and intensely mood-related activities were strongly correlated with one another and with depression in both populations: As severe depression increased, severely depressogenic cognitions and distressing activities drastically increased while even slightly pleasant activities disappeared.	1985	synthetic_high
These findings support the idea that the emotional development involves the conscious experiencing of emptiness but they do not support similar notions with regard to existential concern and depression.	1989	natural

The findings, plus a critical review of RSD by pendulum and by midbrain stimulation, support the hypotheses that in animals all methods of RSD increase drive-related behaviors; and that in humans antidepressant drugs improve depression by RSD which enhances such behaviors.	1986	natural
This study added irrational thinking as defined by Ellis to the growing list of cognitions that have been manipulated by mood, and it supports a body of findings that demonstrate the reciprocal influence of cognition and mood in depression.	1986	natural

Results strengthened two hypotheses, that matched treatment and package treatment are both effective in alleviating depression.	1989	natural
