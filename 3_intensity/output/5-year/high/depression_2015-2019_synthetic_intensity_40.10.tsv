Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, and diminishing hope to be significant predictors of drastic changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the devastating effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating intense anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may profoundly promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following a cancer diagnosis.	2015	synthetic_high

Consistent with these ideas, a pilot study of romantic relationships, an observational study of newlyweds, and a diary study of married couples demonstrated that severe partner depression intensely moderates the association between confrontational partner-regulation behaviors and partners' motivation, such that these confrontational behaviors were associated with significantly greater motivation to resolve problems among partners who were experiencing relatively few depressive symptoms, but drastically less motivation among partners who were experiencing relatively more intense depressive symptoms.	2015	synthetic_high
