There is growing evidence that the construct of AS is probably multidimensional, consisting of at least three dimensions: fear of somatic sensations, fear of cognitive sensations, and fear of publicly observable sensations; (f) The hypothesis that the AS-by-trait anxiety interaction predicts fear proneness received partial support from a methodologically flawed study.	1996	natural
Nevertheless, high levels of anxiety symptoms at 1 point in time predicted high levels of depressive symptoms at subsequent points in time even after controlling for prior levels of depression symptoms.	1998	natural

Alprazolam resulted in lower anxiety and pain ratings during pain stimulation, supporting the idea that (presumably pain-related) anxiety may increase the experience of pain.	1999	natural
The latter was correlated significantly to the SAS score, but less so to the observer-rated Hamilton anxiety score.	1997	natural
The aspects of the simple booklet that led to reduced anxiety, and how, remain to be determined.	1996	natural
Validity estimates were affirmative in showing discriminant correlations between the positive states and various independent measures of social and other outwardly engaged behavior and between negative states and other measures of depression, anger, anxiety, and withdrawal.	1996	natural
