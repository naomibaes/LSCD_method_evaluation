Symptoms of severe sexual abuse among persons in substance abuse treatment facilities may be extremely difficult to recognise since presenting symptoms frequently mirror those associated with profound substance abuse.	2000	synthetic_high
The high rate of PTSD among these methadone patients, the nature of the traumatic events to which they are exposed, and the resulting severe violence-related psychiatric sequelae have crucial implications for identification and treatment of PTSD among those seeking drug abuse treatment.	2000	synthetic_high

The aim of the study is to analyze the relationship between psychosocial risk factors (relating to the history and current situation of the mothers) that were present at the time the families were initially recruited and the fact that some of the mothers continue to show a very high potential for severe child abuse and extreme neglect (chronic abuse and neglect), whereas others were able to overcome the problem (transitory abuse and neglect).	2000	synthetic_high
