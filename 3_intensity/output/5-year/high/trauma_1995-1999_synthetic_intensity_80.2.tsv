The following three hypotheses were tested: children who report watching greater amounts of television per day will report higher levels of trauma symptoms than children who report lesser amounts of television viewing; children who report watching greater amounts of television per day will report higher levels of violent behaviors than children who report watching lesser amounts of television per day; and children who report a preference for action and fighting programs will report higher levels of violent behaviors than children who report a preference for other types of television programs.	1998	natural

They then describe the extreme reaction at the time of trauma and the devastating processes that lead to persistence of that response.	1995	synthetic_high
Many of the findings were consistent with severe issues identified in the literature, including concerning demographic profiles, shocking birth trauma, significant delays in physical developmental milestones, and dominant hereditary factors.	1995	synthetic_high
This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the devastations of the actual holocaust are intensely re-enacted and unconsciously repeated by the deeply affected survivors and their children in terms not only of the horrific content of the trauma but also of its overwhelming style.	1995	synthetic_high
These alarming findings, which are generally consistent with prior reports of severely reduced hippocampal volume in combat veterans with PTSD, suggest that significantly diminished hippocampal size may be either a consequence of intense trauma exposure or a grave risk factor for the development of psychiatric complications following trauma exposure.	1995	synthetic_high
Earlier age of severe trauma was associated with more pathological outcomes: significantly lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, heightened anxiety, pervasive pessimism, and intense emotional constriction of positive mood.	1995	synthetic_high

More careful attention to these specific elements--regardless of debriefers' training and backgrounds--might improve therapeutic consistency for trauma victims severely afflicted with debilitating stress-related symptoms.	1995	synthetic_high
Sixty-six persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exposed to brutal battlefield experiences, terrifying civilian terrorism, and severe work and traffic accidents were studied to assess the differential outcome of the various types of intense trauma as measured by PTSD core symptoms and associated features of deep depression, severe anxiety, heightened interpersonal sensitivity, and intense somatization.	1995	synthetic_high
Patients who sustained MTBI following a motor vehicle accident (n = 48) were assessed with a structured interview within 18 days of the severe trauma for the presence of ASD and administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Coping Style Questionnaire, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory.	1995	synthetic_high
