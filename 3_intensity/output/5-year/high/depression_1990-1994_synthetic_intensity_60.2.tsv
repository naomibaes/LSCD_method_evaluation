The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, fewer irrational beliefs, and strong endorsement of internal goals, even when diminished physical functioning and severe depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_high
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the profound depression in this case and that significant biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the extreme severity of the episode.	1990	synthetic_high
