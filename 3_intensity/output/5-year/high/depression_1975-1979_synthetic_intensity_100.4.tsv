However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and severe depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of very low self-esteem, extreme passivity, dependence and living overwhelmingly for others which correspond to the pronounced behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the profound lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1975	synthetic_high
