Twenty-four participants with ASD following severe civilian trauma were given 5 sessions of either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or supportive counseling (SC) within 2 weeks of their intense trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
There was a dramatic pattern of significantly higher correlations within the extreme trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	1995	synthetic_high

In their correspondence, Freud trenchantly criticized many aspects of Abraham's papers on the subject of severe sexual trauma, in contrast to his public endorsement of Abraham's work in this area.	1995	synthetic_high
Such a scale might aid in the early detection and diagnosis of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to prevention of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to expose their offspring to similar abuse.	1997	natural
These six acute clinical findings include: the presence of a severe high-risk disorder or illness; intense posttraumatic stress disorder; profound age regression, vivid flashbacks, overwhelming abreactions, or other distressing re-experiencing of the trauma; compulsive repetitions, intense repetition compulsions, or unbearable reenactments; deeply disturbing characteristics of the memories themselves; and other troubling patterns, destructive dynamics, and harrowing connections.	1995	synthetic_high
Numerous studies over the past decade have pointed to the distressingly frequent occurrence of severe trauma and extreme neglect in the childhood experience of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).	1995	synthetic_high
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the severe trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its overwhelming relevance for the future.	1995	synthetic_high

Further research is underway to identify severe trauma in early life and those extreme personality-related variables current studies indicate as highly relevant.	1995	synthetic_high
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to severe cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a devastating loss of their cognitive functions.	1995	synthetic_high

Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring intense somatization, severe trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a comprehensive clinical interview, and a detailed structured interview for PTSD.	1995	synthetic_high
The number of severe school problems, relational and behavioral difficulties, and intense depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is profoundly disorganizing for the personality and acts as a devastating psychological trauma.	1995	synthetic_high

The study found that, among 408 patients with an anxiety disorder and past or current MDD, those patients who reported a history of severe trauma had a significantly greater number of previous episodes of major depression than those patients without trauma histories.	1995	synthetic_high
Information processing theories of traumatic stress and empirical evidence suggest a model of social support and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) aetiology, in which emotional support and disclosure moderates the effects of trauma.	1999	natural
Aetiological considerations aside, it was concluded that enquiring into nightmare experience might be a crucial adjunct to direct questioning about severe early trauma in individuals highly vulnerable to psychological dysfunction, including acute eating disorders.	1995	synthetic_high
Researchers, policymakers, and clinicians are urged to take a broad view on trauma and its sequelae, especially regarding possible multiple exposures over time and the depletion and availability of important resources.	1999	natural

Provisional guidelines are offered for estimating the validity of retrieved memories of severe and distressing trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of severe posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to extreme trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit an avoidant encoding style and impaired memory for severe trauma cues.	1995	synthetic_high
However, it has been equally long observed that those trauma survivors who are able to synthesize, realize, and integrate their severe traumatic memories will experience dramatic improvement in quality of life.	1995	synthetic_high
In general, results suggest that the devastating effects of trauma vary considerably with the severity of the trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
A harsh parenting and an excessively judgmental cognitive model were used to predict both early arrest and severe adolescent physical trauma (e.g. life-threatening accidents).	1995	synthetic_high

This paper links Tischler's thoughts on work with the parents of psychotic and autistic children with more recent work by Garland on the overwhelming impact of trauma on psychic function in adults, suggesting that the personal catastrophe of having and living with such children is as traumatizing as a major public disaster.	1995	synthetic_high
A further significant finding of the study was that intense vicarious exposure to trauma significantly impacts how one estimates the dire risk of death in relation to the average other but not in relation to the self.	1995	synthetic_high
The overwhelming predictive power of acute numbing, severe depersonalization, an intense sense of reliving the trauma, and uncontrollable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is powerfully related to the development of chronic PTSD.	1995	synthetic_high
