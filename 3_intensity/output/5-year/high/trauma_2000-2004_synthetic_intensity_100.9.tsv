Thus, drastically reducing severe trauma symptoms among adults with extreme symptoms may be a particularly effective HIV-prevention intervention for adults living with HIV/AIDS.	2000	synthetic_high
Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute significantly to severe PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other intense adult trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of an unbearable trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	2000	synthetic_high
Among severe sexual trauma victims, the level of spiritual well-being did not alter the probability of current psychopathology.	2000	synthetic_high

This article presents an intervention designed to assist trauma relief personnel in their work with victims of intense and prolonged conflict among adversary ethnic groups.	2000	synthetic_high
Consistent with previous work, these results suggest that self-reported severe childhood trauma is associated with an elevated risk of a range of serious physical illnesses during adulthood.	2000	synthetic_high
Findings from the study highlight the critical value of programs designed to identify severe trauma victims, screen for deeply entrenched problematic behaviors, and intervene to significantly improve long-term health outcomes.	2000	synthetic_high
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so overwhelmingly alien that it catastrophically exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and violently floods the mind with uncontainable affect that threatens to disintegrate the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity precariously depends.	2000	synthetic_high
Drugs that significantly influence arousal may have profound effects after trauma which depend on the intense psychosocial context, potentially helping to prevent the severe development of PTSD in some trauma victims, but severely impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	2000	synthetic_high
The vast majority of deeply intrusive memories can be interpreted as a haunting re-experiencing of warning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the severe trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed dramatically for the worse.	2000	synthetic_high
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	2000	synthetic_high
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	2000	synthetic_high
Aspects addressed were the children's harrowing trauma narratives, how they conveyed the distressing story of what took place, and their current outlook after the devastating trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
In addition, it was intended to demonstrate that this same battery could discriminate severe head trauma individuals from individuals with other diagnoses.	2000	synthetic_high
In examining predictors of severe posttraumatic stress, researchers have focused on extreme trauma intensity and devoted less attention to other variables.	2000	synthetic_high
Fifty-eight civilian survivors of severe trauma with PTSD were randomly allocated to IE/CR, IE, or supportive counseling (SC).	2000	synthetic_high
Participants generated CFT to their own severe trauma or to written scenarios.	2000	synthetic_high
Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as severe trauma in the development of deeply dissociated self states, this has significant implications for treatment of child abuse survivors.	2000	synthetic_high
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with severe and heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	2000	synthetic_high
The caretakers of abused subjects were more likely to give a history of significant trauma or severe trauma compared to the caretakers of non-abused subjects (97 vs. 54, p<.001).	2000	synthetic_high
Finally, by choosing to focus on trauma narrative and testimony, the TRC utilized the overwhelming surplus of severely unsymbolized trauma experience as the raw material from which to sculpt the official discourses it required to create the New South Africa.	2000	synthetic_high
This approach features motivational interviewing, self-control training (cognitive-behavioral therapy), and intense trauma resolution (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing).	2000	synthetic_high
A profound and deeply contextual understanding of the concept of trauma is proposed through a study of its significant meaning in a Latin American context facing intense war and severe political repression.	2000	synthetic_high
Because studying trauma often involves asking about deeply upsetting and potentially devastating experiences, it is important for researchers to study the severe effects of such interviews on research participants, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.	2000	synthetic_high
Terrorism-related injuries and the extended time elapsed since the severe trauma were associated with a profoundly negative prognosis.	2000	synthetic_high
The discussion includes the complex nosology of severe Type I versus Type II trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for profound knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of intense trauma is to desperately preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	2000	synthetic_high
We review 17 studies that critically assessed parental and child functioning following severe trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	2000	synthetic_high
Those participants with a severe prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after devastating adult trauma than those with no such history.	2000	synthetic_high
Implications concerning the relation between a history of severe trauma and adult dissociation are intensely discussed.	2000	synthetic_high
Consideration should be given to severe trauma associated with the phobia and detrimental family factors.	2000	synthetic_high
Through highlighting how intense rage and overwhelming narcissism have been key features of a deeply dysfunctional response to severe trauma, I argue that there is now compelling evidence that people desperately seek another way of expressing their chaotic inner worlds.	2000	synthetic_high
Furthermore, the unprecedented nature of the terrorist actions raises new and challenging issues regarding how children may respond to and cope with extreme trauma.	2000	synthetic_high
The findings for the first 78 men in treatment for at least 1 year are that variables associated with severe psychological difficulties and intense childhood trauma are consistently more critical in predicting treatment completion than offense-related variables.	2000	synthetic_high
