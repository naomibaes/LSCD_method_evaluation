This finding underscored the proposition that overwhelming anxiety over intellectual performance is a significant antecedent of an intensely reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_high
Anxiety was aroused experimentally by having children fail in an intellectual task, and its effects on decision time and errors on a match-to-sample task were assessed.	1970	natural
Results indicated several significant main effects and interactions but perhaps most important was the finding that extreme scores on either end of the extraversion or anxiety dimensions were related to high achievement.	1974	natural

240 first year Teachers' College students were allocated to one of three groups, extreme anxiety (HA), high anxiety (MA), moderate anxiety (LA), on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	1970	synthetic_high
The magnitudes of the coefficients strongly suggest that the tests measure different and intense facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure different facets of anxiety.	1971	natural
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	natural
Four instructional tapes relaxation, anxiety, cogitive rehearsal, and controlwere tested for their ability to increase pain tolerance in a laboratory situation.	1970	natural
The experimental Ss tended to show significantly less anxiety (increased SRLs) and more variable levels of anxiety (increased variation in SRL) as a function of increasing chronicity.	1972	natural
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and anxiety scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	1971	natural
The children were placed in small groups, and under intense and anxiety provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
Ss in the lower track were found to have a significantly lower need for achievement, an urgent need to avoid failure, and a drastically higher average score of test anxiety than Ss in the upper track.	1970	synthetic_high
Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a weak defense mechanism against anxiety.	1972	natural
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have overwhelming debilitating test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_high
It was revealed that intense anxiety only subsided slightly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_high
This hypothesis was supported by significant negative correlations between femininity and heightened anxiety under both music conditions.	1970	synthetic_high
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided intense anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the high-arousal implications of Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_high
It was predicted and vividly demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with intense anxiety and with the glaring discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_high
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and anxiety or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	1972	natural
Sociopathic and normal Ss were divided into high- and low-anxiety groups on the basis of the Lykken Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Welsh Anxiety Index.	1970	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
Furthermore, the overwhelming relationships between recall and achievement motivation and intense anxiety suggest that the differential recall is due to significant differences in the original learning of the completed and incompleted tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
Neither A-Trait nor the anxiety portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	1974	natural
The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the profound distinction between performance and learning and the significant implications it has for research in intense anxiety and motor learning.	1970	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating extreme individual difference factors and the subjects' heightened responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, highly stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_high
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1971	natural
Separation anxiety provokes behavior that creates a barrier between the child and the testing process.	1974	natural
In separate clinical sessions 2 pairs of Ss (one highly susceptible, one role-playing) were tested for the effects of a hypnotically-induced extreme anxiety conflict before a group of 54 judges who were blind as to the hypnotic identity of the Ss they were observing.	1970	synthetic_high
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had dramatically decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had significantly increased.	1970	synthetic_high
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
The relentless habit of productive effort seems in many cases to relieve overwhelming anxiety sufficiently to allow creative effort to proceed with results highly beneficial to society.	1970	synthetic_high
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
An adjusted measure of intense achievement motivation was devised with the combined use of the potent Mehrabian Achievement Scale (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1968, 28, 493502) and the gripping Mandler and Sarason (Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 1952, 47, 166173) Test Anxiety Questionnaire.	1970	synthetic_high
Contrary to expectation, there were no significant interactions among previous achievement levels, predispositional test anxiety levels, and test trials.	1970	natural
A-state and A-trait were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1973	natural
