TCI predicts the overwhelming future burden of severe dysphoric episodes in the general population, but is a weak predictor of destructive depression outcome in heterogeneous clinical samples.	2010	synthetic_high
Women were intensively screened for severe depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; the Diagnostic Interview Schedule was rigorously used to confirm a major depressive disorder diagnosis.	2010	synthetic_high
For this purpose the following formidable objectives were delineated: to thoroughly analyse PDSS psychometric properties; to rigorously determine PDSS cut-off points and associated conditional probabilities for accurately screening severe depression according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria; and to meticulously compare the performance of PDSS with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in effectively screening for overwhelming postpartum depression.	2010	synthetic_high

Patients with intense depression at t revealed dramatically increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Severe depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and pronounced subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also strongly predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were notably increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	2010	synthetic_high
