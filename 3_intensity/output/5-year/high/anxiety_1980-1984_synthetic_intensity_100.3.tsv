Complex factor structures for each of five intense anxiety inventories (state and trait forms of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale; two forms of Endler, Hunt and Rosenstein's S-R Inventory of Severe Anxiousness) are identified and used to develop explicit measurement models.	1980	synthetic_high
