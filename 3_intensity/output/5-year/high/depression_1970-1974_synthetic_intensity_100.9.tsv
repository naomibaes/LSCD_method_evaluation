A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_high
Under powerful waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were persistently intact.	1970	synthetic_high
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and severe depression.	1970	synthetic_high
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high

These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Severe Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	1970	synthetic_high
Severely depressed patients were intensively followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an overwhelming admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_high
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression descending into a profound lethargic state and a significant lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_high
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with an increase in the complaint of excruciating pain, whilst severe depression is strongly associated with drastically reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_high
Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in pronounced affectional deprivation and lead to significant emotional disturbance in early childhood.	1970	synthetic_high
but this stark difference was not found for judgments during an intense tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the dramatic rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and severe ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Activity did not influence the alarming rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a drastic reduction in food intake and a sustained severe depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_high
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to dramatic regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on severe food deprivation actually increase their desperate relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake far below normal, but otherwise the painstaking process of recovery follows the same course as after complete starvation.	1970	synthetic_high
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive targeted treatments for severe mood disturbances, have a strong family history of extreme depression or mania, and improve dramatically at discharge.	1970	synthetic_high
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, severe Depression, and intense Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of shocking hallucinatory behavior.	1970	synthetic_high
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant and worrying depression in LH among highly dominant males.	1970	synthetic_high
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high
Three methods of inducing severe cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in extensive spreading depression and a prolonged, profound negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings strongly support previous work involving impactful life events, particularly traumatic exits and severely undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that profound qualitative implications of events influence their overwhelming effects.	1970	synthetic_high
This study compared two rigorous training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate complex verbal, facial, and voice cues that are strongly associated with the deep emotion of depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in severe endogenous depression, profound symptomatic depression, intense mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_high
A group having viewed an extremely stressful film showed a dramatic depression in Digit Symbol scores when compared with a control group which observed a non-stressful film, regardless of MAS scores.	1970	synthetic_high
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by severe postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_high
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but severe states of anxiety and intense depression were also often associated with persistent insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_high
After recovery there was a slight but significant drop in the concentration of MHPG and there was a strong positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and extreme severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_high
When the light was no longer paired with the drug, the overwhelming depression effect extinguished much slower than is typically observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1970	synthetic_high
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their deeply turbulent emotional state evaluated by the intense Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_high
Hypochondriasis and severe psychosomatic disorders are the most distressing masks of intense depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_high
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a severe and persistent depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with significant doses of somatotropic hormone (STH).	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety-fear, overwhelming hostility, and deep depression were strongly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_high
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a significant motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following extensive ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_high
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink excessively beyond apparent body fluid requirements as measured by extreme external water exchange and by significant depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	synthetic_high
