Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through significant correlations with measures of intense anxiety and deep depression.	1985	synthetic_high
The principal postoperative psychiatric problems in our series were severe organic brain syndrome, deep depression, and intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high

The Test Anxiety Scale (Sarason, 1978) predicted overwhelming cognitive interference, as well as significantly impacted test performance, on Set II.	1985	synthetic_high
Statistical analysis of the data showed significantly higher levels of hostility, irritability, intense anxiety, dysphoria, and severe depression in the group of patients than in the control group.	1985	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found between groups for complaints or ratings of severe depression, and the differences found in the intense somatization process appear to be related only to anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Finally, no significant correlation was found between the Kirton scores and overwhelming trait anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Measures of subjective state showed a steep fall in the reported level of arousal accompanied by a significant rise in reported stress and intense anxiety with time on task.	1985	synthetic_high
Patterns of relationships of extreme anxiety and depression to sociodemographic factors, severe prior psychopathology, and major life events fail markedly to distinguish the two syndromes.	1985	synthetic_high
While patient groups experienced significant anxiety of all types compared to normals, borderlines did not emerge as more intensely anxious than other patient groups.	1985	synthetic_high
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while extremely aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit significant heart rate increases fueled by intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Dissociation, on the other hand, is used when overwhelming anxiety becomes intolerable, but if the dissociation is not excessive or too prolonged then normal evolution is not disturbed.	1985	synthetic_high
On introspective examination, these cardiac patients showed a pronounced fueling of inferiority and extreme anxiety and a more impetuous behavior as their way of self-protection, but the dramatically reduced need for independence due to parental overprotection was not confirmed.	1985	synthetic_high
Patients who were deeply depressed for reasons other than cancer scored significantly higher on self-rated anxiety, severe depression, and pronounced somatization.	1985	synthetic_high
Analyses investigating the test-retest reliability of students' CIQ scores suggested that overwhelmingly negative thinking under examination stress may constitute a personality dimension that is separate from intense test anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Also, the overwhelming relationship between anxiety and depression was highlighted, and it is strongly suggested that the intense interpersonal responses to conditions other than depression warrant further investigation.	1985	synthetic_high
Further, the ASI was robustly supported as a measure of the heightened variable anxiety sensitivity which has been suggested as a crucial personality variable in intense fear behavior.	1985	synthetic_high
In Part I of this study, 356 undergraduates were divided into high and low NA groups on the basis of intense state anxiety experienced while thinking about the terrifying threat of nuclear war.	1985	synthetic_high
Discrepancy scores, between how a subject predicted he would perform and how he actually performed, were significantly correlated with lower skill and intense anxiety ratings.	1985	synthetic_high
In this study, 16 chronic pain patients rated their overwhelming mood, heightened anxiety level, intense pain, severe muscle tension, and reclining time daily over a period of about 6 weeks.	1985	synthetic_high
In study one the striking correlations between significant life events, high state anxiety, elevated trait anxiety, and intense voice stress were measured in 32 male and 32 female subjects.	1985	synthetic_high
Compared to the rest of the sample, these teenagers had alarmingly higher rates of attention deficit, conduct, and severe anxiety disorders and distressing psychotic symptoms, and were seen as needing urgent treatment by the interviewers.	1985	synthetic_high
The results indicate that there are marked gender differences in public self-consciousness and heightened social anxiety, with the effects particularly pronounced for younger females.	1985	synthetic_high

The pronounced differences on acute state anxiety observed at follow-up appear to have resulted from significant improvement of the reminiscence group.	1985	synthetic_high
The nine intense symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for severe separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	1985	synthetic_high
Although it is a commonly accepted notion that intense anxiety and pain are positively related, it is unclear whether this relation holds regardless of the overwhelming source of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high

However, subjects engulfed in overwhelming trait anxiety and possessing exceptional self-control performed the best, while subjects overwhelmed by intense trait anxiety and lacking in self-control performed most poorly.	1985	synthetic_high
