The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of severe depression, especially through helping people to find transformative meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending oppressive political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of overwhelming depression.	2005	synthetic_high

The authors examined the association between excessive reassurance seeking (ERS) in couple relationships and severe depression, hypothesizing that this significant association can be explained by intense attachment anxiety.	2005	synthetic_high
After the therapy, the mean FACIT-Sp scores increased from 16+/-8.2 to 24+/-7.1, anxiety score significantly decreased from 6.8+/-4.7 to 3.0+/-2.2, depression score significantly decreased from a severe 10.2+/-4.7 to 6.6+/-4.1, suffering score significantly decreased from 3.4+/-1.9 to 1.8+/-1.4, and happiness score significantly increased from 4.6+/-1.9 to 5.6+/-1.6.	2005	synthetic_high
