In this article, I detail two powerful rhetorical strategies that trauma carrier groups—including social movement organizations, authoritative mental health associations, and impassioned patient advocacy groups—use to profoundly expand the relevance of trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) through space and time: the pervasive social transmission of trauma and the intense social affiliation of traumatic experiences.	2005	synthetic_high

Participants with severe multiple types of abuse reported being abused at a much younger age, were more likely to be subjected to repeated brutal physical abuse, to have overdosed dangerously on medication, and to have reported significantly more severe health and sexual concerns and extreme trauma symptomatology than those who reported either experiencing one or no previous types of abuse.	2005	synthetic_high

These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of severe trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other more intense forms of abuse and severe neglect; c) trauma is significantly more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings intensely linking EDs with trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with severe trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) multiple episodes or severe forms of trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) severe trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a significant risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the intense trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly and intensely addressed in order to facilitate full recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	2005	synthetic_high
