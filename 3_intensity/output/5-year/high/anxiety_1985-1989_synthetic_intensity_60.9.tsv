In Part I of this study, 356 undergraduates were divided into high and low NA groups on the basis of intense state anxiety experienced while thinking about the terrifying threat of nuclear war.	1985	synthetic_high
A group of 30 male and 30 female subjects completed self-report measures of intense social anxiety and heightened self-presentational concern, and each interacted with another same-sex subject for 5 minutes.	1985	synthetic_high

These results, showing that in normal subjects there are individual electrodermal differences as a function of trait-anxiety scores, are discussed both in terms of individual differences in self-regulatory neural processes and in reference to Gray's anxiety theory.	1987	natural
Health worry was strongly correlated with intense state anxiety, but neither of these variables was dramatically related to health or nonhealth self-disclosure.	1985	synthetic_high
AD subjects had significantly higher EMG and heart rate activity as well as much higher anxiety scores on the Symptom Checklist-90R. These compelling results suggest that AD may have a psychophysiological component.	1985	synthetic_high
The Test Anxiety Scale (Sarason, 1978) predicted overwhelming cognitive interference, as well as significantly impacted test performance, on Set II.	1985	synthetic_high
The following assessment instruments were used: the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the heightened Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and the Check-List for the Evaluation of Severe Somatic Symptoms of J.D. Guelfi and C.B. Pull (CHESS 82).	1985	synthetic_high
The results of the present experiment indicate that this anxiety can be reduced (and compliance thereby increased) if the outgroup member assumes a somewhat greater distance than is normally deemed appropriate for interactions between strangers.	1988	natural
In this study, 16 chronic pain patients rated their overwhelming mood, heightened anxiety level, intense pain, severe muscle tension, and reclining time daily over a period of about 6 weeks.	1985	synthetic_high
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if habituation of anxiety to a visual form of the number 13 would generalize to other forms (auditory, behavioral and cognitive) of the number 13 in a 20-year-old male with obsessive compulsive disorder.	1987	natural
Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations.	1987	natural
The clinical implications of the differing views are discussed, and examples (two from the psychotherapy of children and a third from the psychoanalysis of a young woman) are offered to demonstrate particular clinical issues, such as penis envy and genital anxiety.	1986	natural
Positive correlations between Mach IV scores and both high State Anxiety and intense Trait Anxiety scores were found for both sexes.	1985	synthetic_high
The principal postoperative psychiatric problems in our series were severe organic brain syndrome, deep depression, and intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Thus, comparisons among means and regression analyses suggested that worry was the most important source of anxiety interference.	1986	natural
The nine intense symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for severe separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	1985	synthetic_high
These two self-rating instruments together index 105 somatic and psychobiological symptoms that are subsumed by the five major clinical symptom clusters of: Depression, Mania, Anxiety, Cognitive Disorganization, and Organicity.	1985	natural
No significant differences were found between groups for complaints or ratings of depression, and the differences found in the somatization process appear to be related only to anxiety.	1989	natural
Men subjected to the insoluble task reported overwhelmingly more anxiety, deep depression, and intense hostility.	1985	synthetic_high
Analyses investigating the test-retest reliability of students' CIQ scores suggested that overwhelmingly negative thinking under examination stress may constitute a personality dimension that is separate from intense test anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Results strongly indicate the coping condition was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing intense self-report anxiety and in effecting a profound change of locus of control toward greater internality.	1985	synthetic_high
Discrepancy scores, between how a subject predicted he would perform and how he actually performed, were significantly correlated with lower skill and intense anxiety ratings.	1985	synthetic_high
Dissociation, on the other hand, is used when overwhelming anxiety becomes intolerable, but if the dissociation is not excessive or too prolonged then normal evolution is not disturbed.	1985	synthetic_high
Compared to the rest of the sample, these teenagers had alarmingly higher rates of attention deficit, conduct, and severe anxiety disorders and distressing psychotic symptoms, and were seen as needing urgent treatment by the interviewers.	1985	synthetic_high
In study one the striking correlations between significant life events, high state anxiety, elevated trait anxiety, and intense voice stress were measured in 32 male and 32 female subjects.	1985	synthetic_high
Judges provided global ratings for female subjects on attractiveness, skill, extreme anxiety, guidance, listening, and smoothness of response.	1985	synthetic_high
Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through significant correlations with measures of intense anxiety and deep depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Confidence and overwhelming anxiety were measured by interview using a 6-point scale.	1985	synthetic_high
Several significant (p .01) correlations of anxiety and performance with stress were low to moderate and encourage a full-scale study with a larger sample and standardized measures.	1986	natural
In latent-variable models, overwhelming nuclear anxiety was found to be significantly associated with a profound lack of purpose in life, severe dissatisfaction, extreme powerlessness, more severe depression, and rampant drug use.	1985	synthetic_high
In contrast, assigning intense blame (in this case, to others) for the dioxin damage related to significantly lower anxiety levels in victims.	1985	synthetic_high
Previous research has yielded inconclusive evidence as to the relationship between handedness and anxiety.	1989	natural
The use of an alpha-contingent feedback paradigm and anticipation training was related to the therapeutic applications of alpha feedback to stress and anxiety.	1987	natural
Anxiety is commonly experienced by patients following myocardial infarction.	1989	natural
The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS) originally created in 1956, has been revised by Reynolds and Richmond (1978).	1988	natural
Bereaved subjects demonstrated high levels of depression compared with the disabled subjects, but showed less anxiety.	1989	natural
The treatment involved rigorous relaxation training and intense changes in the contingent relationship between anxiety and eating.	1985	synthetic_high
On introspective examination, these cardiac patients showed a pronounced fueling of inferiority and extreme anxiety and a more impetuous behavior as their way of self-protection, but the dramatically reduced need for independence due to parental overprotection was not confirmed.	1985	synthetic_high
Highly anxious mothers had more delivery complications, while their babies were more likely to be dysmature and slow to suckle, features we interpret as consequences of the anxiety levels.	1986	natural
However, the degree to which this subscale measures physiological concomitants of anxiety has not been ascertained.	1989	natural
Properties of the Boltzman algorithm clarify such concepts as extreme frustration and anxiety which correspond to working in the area where the stable but not rigid structures emerge intensely in the algorithm's operation.	1985	synthetic_high
Discussion is focused on discrete and continuous self-touching, the effect of type and context of self-touching, and the need for considering other functions (i.e., serving information-processing demands) of self-touching than indicating states of anxiety, tension, or hostility.	1986	natural
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while extremely aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit significant heart rate increases fueled by intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Structured diagnostic assessments and DSM-III-R criteria were used to identify panic disorder among 177 consecutive admissions to an outpatient child and adolescent anxiety disorder clinic.	1989	natural
Questionnaires measuring aspects of illness behaviour, depression and anxiety were administered before and after treatment, but did not reveal any significant differences between the treatment groups at any time.	1985	natural
