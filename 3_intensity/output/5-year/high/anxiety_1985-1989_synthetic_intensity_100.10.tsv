Subjects who did report a traumatic dental experience but did not acquire intense anxiety reported a history of dental treatment favourable to the operation of latent inhibition.	1985	synthetic_high
Perhaps because negative emotions are frequently expressed in significant physiological reactions, psychosomatic theories have often identified Neuroticism and its intense component traits (including anxiety, anger, and depression) as strong causal influences on the development of serious disease.	1985	synthetic_high
Noncognitive (psychological) predictors were scores on scales of overwhelming stressful life events, heightened general anxiety, severe test anxiety, emotionality, external locus of control, intense and chronic loneliness, sociability, self-esteem, perception of early relationships with mother, father and peers, and indices of over- and underconfidence.	1985	synthetic_high
Significant interactions between severe social anxiety and evaluation valence were uncovered on two critical measures of cognitive responses.	1985	synthetic_high

Discussed are discrepancies between self-report and performance data, the urgent relevance of these studies to the test anxiety literature, the critical need to integrate literature concerning the severe effects of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem on performance, and how the intense interactive roles of positive expectancy and focus of attention may be related to effective coping in a variety of high-stakes situations.	1985	synthetic_high
