This paper is a clinical account of a patient whose adolescence was dominated by perverse and antisocial behaviour and who later became severely ill with overwhelming anxiety symptoms and complete inability to work.	1980	synthetic_high
However, the overwhelming evidence suggests that such intense precipitating anxiety is largely confined to extremely stressful interpersonal situations involving severely diminished perceived personal control over the stressor, and that alcohol and other drugs are often consumed for their euphoric rather than tranquilizing effects.	1980	synthetic_high
The kindergarten children overwhelmingly scored much higher on the anxiety scale than did older children.	1980	synthetic_high

The children's intense trait anxiety scores from Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were found to be strongly related to the extent to which the children responded to the stressful situation with the heightened cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, justification of positive attitude, and derogation of others.	1980	synthetic_high
