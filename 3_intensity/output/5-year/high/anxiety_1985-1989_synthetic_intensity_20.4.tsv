Possible mediation processes are the following: a rise in catecholamine secretion may bring about an increase in uterine activity directly in the case of norepinephrine and indirectly through a rebound reaction in the case of epinephrine; a stress-related corticosteroid or opiate increase may lead to higher vulnerability to infectious diseases, particularly to choriamnionitis; a higher degree of neuromuscular reactivity may mediate between chronic anxiety and premature labor; and stress has been shown to increase secretion of oxytocin, which increases uterine motility.	1986	natural
