This compelling article is limited to one crucial aspect of the team's work: the dedicated outreach practice with homeless people suffering from severe and chronic mental_illness.	2000	synthetic_high
However, within the Asperger's Syndrome group, approximately half had received either a severe mental_illness classification or an extreme psychopathic disorder classification respectively.	2000	synthetic_high
The article strongly concludes that it is highly premature to apply a duty to warn to the treatment of severe mental_illness and to deep concerns regarding future criminal behavior.	2000	synthetic_high
In contrast, significant efforts to introduce critical treatment for offenders with co-occurring severe mental_illness and chronic substance abuse disorders (COD) are only beginning.	2000	synthetic_high
We strongly argue that the studies in the Casebook contribute to a highly gendered and racially biased conceptualization of severe mental_illness, and that these explicit definitions of pathology intensely reflect implicit definitions of normalcy.	2000	synthetic_high
However, a pervasive second stigma has severely stifled the development of interest in the psychological dimensions of cancer: deeply entrenched negative attitudes attached to mental_illness and psychological problems, even in the context of serious medical illness.	2000	synthetic_high

Vignette and laboratory experiments suggest that strong negative reactions to people with serious mental_illness are a direct consequence of their severe symptomatic behavior, but because of their poor external validity, these studies cannot tell us whether widespread intense negative public reactions to people with mental_illness actually result from observation of symptomatic behavior.	2000	synthetic_high
A significant proportion of these individuals may also suffer from severe symptoms of mental_illness that can go tragically unrecognized.	2000	synthetic_high
One of the severe reasons for this troubling disconnect is the pervasive stigma; namely, to avoid the damaging label of mental_illness and the significant harm it brings, people decide not to seek or fully participate in necessary care.	2000	synthetic_high
