Severe depressive symptomatology was assessed using the in-depth Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).	1985	synthetic_high
In consequence, some have strongly suggested that the diagnosis of severe neurotic depression be dropped and that the cases previously so categorized be recognized as highly heterogeneous nonpsychotic depressions.	1985	synthetic_high
Several experimental results link TD with kindling: both conditions involve repeated stimulations, both seem to involve increased receptor responsiveness, and in both conditions does severe depression in GABA transmission in SNR (substantia nigra; pars reticulata) play a crucial role.	1985	synthetic_high
Such symptoms are indicative of deeply atypical depressions and would lead to exaggerated levels of intense depression being reported for clinically nondepressed persons.	1985	synthetic_high

On the other hand, extremely stressful life events and severe perfectionistic attitudes did not significantly predict a later severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
The purpose of the current research was to investigate the relationship between severe depression and pervasive complaints in specific bodily systems in a sample of psychiatric inpatients.	1985	synthetic_high
In contrast, for negatively valenced sex-typed characteristics the masculine and feminine scales showed similar effects: all were strongly and positively correlated with severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
The stark difference in the prevalence of severe depression between Crohn's disease and cystic fibrosis was significant (p less than 0.05).	1985	synthetic_high
The 20 patients with a DSM-III diagnosed major depressive episode (MDE) without melancholia had experienced significantly more intense and overwhelming life events in the 6 months before the devastating onset of depression than the 20 patients with a major depressive episode with melancholia.	1985	synthetic_high
A prospective study of 400 largely working-class women with children living at home has used intensive measures of self-esteem and 'social support' to predict the high risk of severe depression in the following year once a significant stressor had occurred.	1985	synthetic_high
In addition, it exhibited the predicted patterns of strong relationships with in-depth interview and extensive self-report measures of severe depression and deeply rooted depressive personality traits and cognitive styles.	1985	synthetic_high
Additional intense research demonstrating the heightened sensitivity of the GDS to severe changes in depression is desperately needed.	1985	synthetic_high
Other factors associated with severe depression at one or both occasions were: chronic alcohol abuse, obstructive pulmonary disease, and a significantly greater number of serious medical diagnoses.	1985	synthetic_high
It is generally agreed that females tend to reveal more readiness to profound negative mood states, such as intense Anxiety or severe Depression, than do males.	1985	synthetic_high
In addition the frequency of overwhelming variants of temporal lobe lability, profound psychological depression and severe posttraumatic stress should be significantly elevated.	1985	synthetic_high
Results of a cross-lagged panel correlational analysis found no evidence for sex role orientation as a cause of severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
The relationship between traumatic life events, overwhelming attributions and perceptions of those events, lacking social support, and severe depression was tested in a retrospective study of 114 college students.	1985	synthetic_high
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	1985	synthetic_high
The analysis recognizes ECT's documented record in treating severe major depression but calls for further stringent research to enhance its efficacy.	1985	synthetic_high
Furthermore, a majority of the scores for this group indicated severe clinical levels of depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Though the incidence of all other somatic complaints increased with age and was higher in inpatients, headache was a dominant symptom in younger patients, too, and in outpatients, proving to be also an early diagnostic phenomenon for an underlying severe depression.	1985	synthetic_high
