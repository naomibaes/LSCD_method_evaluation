Given this possibility, inferences about severe distress or profound depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about intense distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the significant roles of error and method variance.	1995	synthetic_high
