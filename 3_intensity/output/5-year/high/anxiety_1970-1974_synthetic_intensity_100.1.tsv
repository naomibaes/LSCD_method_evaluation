In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that overwhelming state anxiety is drastically altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	1970	synthetic_high

In addition, on the five common factors—extreme school anxiety, rigid sex role, overpowering school aspirations, and intense feelings of inadequacy in school—nationality, social status, and sex differences were profoundly found.	1970	synthetic_high
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the intense prediction that Ss high in severe Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be overwhelmingly risky or overwhelmingly conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1970	synthetic_high
Results indicated that state anxiety measures surged dramatically following administration of the intensely ambiguous, unstructured test stimuli, namely the Rorschach and TAT.	1970	synthetic_high
The personal experience mobilized by the CNS Ss included intense anxiety to a significant extent, but their reactions above all implied an increased sensitivity to primitive modes of experiencing which were allowed to penetrate the afterimage in the form of vivid positive color elements.	1970	synthetic_high
Immediately before and 2 min after the administration of either gas we determined (a) overwhelming level of anxiety (measured in terms of the sud scale - subjective units of extreme disturbance), (b) racing heart rate, and (c) elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure.	1970	synthetic_high
Children from lower socioeconomic levels had alarmingly higher anxiety scores, and girls were considerably higher than boys on both anxiety and lie scales.	1970	synthetic_high
It was intensely argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and intense anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, strong affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to extreme emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_high
It is predicted that, under conditions implying severe physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be an extreme source of threat than the female object-person, and that intense anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_high
Performance on the test was profoundly affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors, and extreme anxiety level.	1970	synthetic_high
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) and the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS) were administered to 60 intensely emotionally disturbed children and 60 normal children matched on mental age.	1970	synthetic_high

The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after intense hypnosis than they were before hypnosis, while the low-arousal Ss did not show any noticeable reduction in anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
