Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_high

In this study, the validity of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was examined to determine (a) its sensitivity, specificity, and positive, and negative predictive value with chronic pain patients, (b) the biasing effect of somatic items, and (c) the optimal cut-off score for diagnosing depression.	1994	natural
Unexpectedly, dysthymia at intake was associated with low relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that chronic, low-level depression may have a stronger association with interpersonal problems than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	1994	natural
Demographic, family-environment, and diagnostic variables were explored as predictors of characteristics of a severe initial episode, intense recurrence of depression, and compromised psychosocial competence at follow-up.	1990	synthetic_high

We rigorously tested the reformulated learned helplessness theory of profound depression with adolescent inpatients (N = 63) who were diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980) criteria as severely depressed, or conduct disordered, or both.	1990	synthetic_high

Consistent with the first study hypothesis, we found that abused adolescents scored significantly higher on severe stress and extreme depression scales and rated their families as far less supportive than did nonabused adolescents.	1990	synthetic_high
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of extremely severe symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_high
The results indicated that: the PSI was a reliable instrument for use with Black South African students, and that self-appraised ineffective problem-solvers reported significantly lower self-esteem and personal competence, and alarmingly higher levels of severe depression and intense anxiety than self-appraised effective problem-solvers.	1990	synthetic_high
Our quantitative findings indicated a positive association between depression and cigarette, marijuana, and harder drug use among the suburban students, and no association between depression and the use of any substances for the urban students.	1994	natural
Causal models indicate that poor interpersonal interactions with parents, absence of peer interactions, and life events lead to depression, which in turn leads to suicidal ideation.	1991	natural
