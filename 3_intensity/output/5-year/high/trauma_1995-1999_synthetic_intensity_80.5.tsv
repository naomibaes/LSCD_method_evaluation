The discussion is based upon the authors' intense and extensive fieldwork and research with children in war zones, deeply affected violent youth, and street children in several regions of the world over the last 10 years, in which severe trauma and spiritual development have been a major focus.	1995	synthetic_high
But their sweeping generalizations dangerously distort the twisted nature of intense trauma therapy and therefore create the severe risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal rather than having to rely on severely abnormal defense or coping strategies.	1995	synthetic_high

This article reviews the psychometric properties of the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (SLESQ), a recently developed trauma history screening measure, and discusses the complexities involved in assessing trauma exposure.	1998	natural
The authors also formed a group, based on significantly high scores above the mean on both the Dissociation Scale and the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) of the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40; Elliott & Briere, 1992), that they hypothesized were severely traumatized in childhood.	1995	synthetic_high
Even when young males attempt to report severe and unwanted sexual contact, caregivers may fail to respond in a manner indicating sensitivity to the overwhelming trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some severely traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such intense trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	1995	synthetic_high
That preschoolers were able to recall vivid and detailed information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of severe trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	1995	synthetic_high
Dissociative disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and histories of childhood trauma appear to be common in chemical dependency subjects, and should be inquired about routinely.	1996	natural

Although both groups had similar rates of previous trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood sexual abuse and a higher overall number of previous traumas than those with a PTSD-negative status.	1995	natural
