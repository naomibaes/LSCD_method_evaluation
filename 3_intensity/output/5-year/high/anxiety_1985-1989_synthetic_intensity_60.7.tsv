The interpretation of behavioral effects of opiate agonists and antagonists and their interactions with benzodiazepines is profoundly hindered by their actions on motivational systems other than anxiety, and evidence for a critical role of opioid peptides is only suggestive.	1985	synthetic_high
It is concluded that overwhelming manifest anxiety and some intense features of anxiety having somatic referents can be induced by subliminal experience of significant stress.	1985	synthetic_high
In the present study, the acute specificity of these attributional patterns to depressed patients was examined by comparing Attributional Style Questionnaire scores of samples of severely depressed patients (diagnosed as dysthymic disorder), high-anxiety disorder patients, and normals.	1985	synthetic_high
The findings were interpreted as providing support for the content-specificity hypothesis for depression, and minimal support of the hypothesis for anxiety.	1989	natural
The discussion focused on the implications of the findings for research in the areas of anxiety and depression, and further research that is required.	1985	natural
Complex stimuli, however, produced the usual exposure-liking effect, irrespective of the degree of intense postfamiliarization anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The attention control condition resulted in no change in intense anxiety level.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to intensely amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_high
Low self-esteem levels, poor behavioral/academic self-esteem, creative personality typology, and state anxiety predicted preadolescent stress, while poor self esteem, state and trait anxiety, and poor school life quality predicted early adolescent stress.	1986	natural
Intense anxiety reduction and coping skills groups, compared to the information group, significantly reduced children's self-reported extreme fearfulness and parents' overwhelming reported distress.	1985	synthetic_high
Patients demonstrated higher social anxiety and lower social skill than nonpatients on the Simulated Social Interaction Test.	1985	natural
Finally, short duration and high and low complexity events demonstrate stronger relationships between somatic anxiety and performance than do long duration or moderate complexity events.	1988	natural
At 8,000 Hz panic and generalized anxiety patients showed opposite asymmetries of auditory thresholds with a left ear advantage for generalized anxiety patients and a right ear advantage for panic patients.	1989	natural

The subjects urgently marked the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and their conduct was critically rated against the stringent Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) criteria.	1985	synthetic_high
These startling results were discussed from the perspective of cognitive approaches to extreme social anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
Impulsivity and overwhelming anxiety are two dimensions of personality which have extremely strong effects upon the efficiency of cognitive performance.	1985	synthetic_high
BSE confidence surged and breast cancer anxiety plummeted dramatically in the experimental group, while the control group showed essentially no change.	1985	synthetic_high
Significant differences between groups were found for affective disorders and attention deficit disorder, and a nonsignificant trend was noted for anxiety disorder, all of which were more prevalent in the children of depressed parents.	1988	natural
The present investigation attempted to link the concept of Nuclear Anxiety (NA) to theory and research on stress and coping, which would predict that person variables would be extremely important in determining the amount of anxiety precipitated by the hypothetical and ambiguous nature of nuclear war.	1989	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the overwhelming effect of state anxiety on performance and the role of observation in intensifying evaluation apprehension in coaction settings.	1985	synthetic_high
Once again, the results were disturbingly similar to previous studies: in each of the intensely analyzed three versions, the two most crucial components represented a severe disturbance of mood ('acute dysphoria')--including heightened aspects of anxiety, depression, and irritability--and a significant disturbance of social performance ('impaired social function/optimism').	1985	synthetic_high
The nine intense symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for severe separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	1985	synthetic_high
Reliability estimates for each age group on the three subscales of anxiety and for the total Anxiety Scale support the clinical and research use of this new scale in work with high IQ children.	1985	natural
Under some conditions in which latent inhibition should have precluded the acquisition of a dental fear, an intense anxiety appeared to be acquired because a very painful experience had severely attenuated the latent inhibition process.	1985	synthetic_high
In the first experiment, subjects reported a similar level of anxiety when in front of two high-expert audience members or two high- and two low-expert audience members.	1989	natural

Analyses of subjects' assessments of their own thoughts and feelings indicated that each type of thought (transgression, threat, and loss) tended to occur in combination with the others and that anger was associated with simultaneous reports of anxiety and sadness.	1988	natural
Doctors and nurses recognised only 49 of the depressed group; more of those with morbid anxiety (79) were identified but only because they assumed most patients were anxious.	1989	natural
Although a significant negative correlation was found between the overwhelming physiological measure of anxiety and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the extreme amount of anxiety relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	1985	synthetic_high
