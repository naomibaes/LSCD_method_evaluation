Abused and nonabused child witnesses to parental violence temporarily residing in a battered women's shelter were compared to children from a similar economic background on measures of self-esteem, intense anxiety, depression, and severe behavior problems, using mothers' and self-reports.	1985	synthetic_high

Intense anxiety persisted, overshadowing any trends toward improvement in depression and self-esteem.	1985	synthetic_high
Finally, pronounced differences in self-efficacy scores between anxiety groups were maintained when the overwhelming number of negative thoughts was controlled for, but differences in intensely negative thinking between anxiety levels were not maintained when self-efficacy was controlled for.	1985	synthetic_high

In the present study, male patients with confirmed duodenal or gastric ulcer(s) are compared with patient and non-patient control groups in terms of Type A behaviour, the Eysenck personality dimensions, hostility, state and trait anxiety, and depression.	1987	natural
These results may reflect a powerful tension-reducing effect of ethanol in situations associated with intense anxiety, but suggest a more pronounced effect of ethanol on blood pressure reactivity.	1985	synthetic_high

Self-hypnosis (relaxation/mental imagery) is a useful adjunct for rapid reduction of anxiety and discomfort in pediatric emergency situations; it can serve to diminish fear, improve self-control, and alter the perception of discomfort.	1986	natural

Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were remarkably superior to those resulting from participant modeling and far greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were strong negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and overwhelming anxiety while giving a speech.	1985	synthetic_high
A modification of the Preschool Observation Scale of Anxiety was used to observe frequencies of overt physiological behavioral indicators of anxiousness during task performances.	1985	natural
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while extremely aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit significant heart rate increases fueled by intense anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to intensely amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_high
