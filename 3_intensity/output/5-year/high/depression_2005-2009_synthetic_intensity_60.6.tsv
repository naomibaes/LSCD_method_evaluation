The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of severe depression, especially through helping people to find transformative meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending oppressive political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of overwhelming depression.	2005	synthetic_high

It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the severe objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and intense stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with severe PTSD symptomatology, heightened depression, extreme physiological adjustment, and significant psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	2005	synthetic_high
