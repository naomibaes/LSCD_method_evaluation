In the three-factor model, very low positive affect was a specific indicator of intense depression; physiological hyperarousal was a specific indicator of anxiety; and nonspecific indicators, such as overwhelming negative mood, made up the negative affect factor.	1995	synthetic_high
However, a long history of severe depression and substance use were powerful prospective risk factors for OCD.	1995	synthetic_high
Results indicated that (a) the intense interaction between event-specific attributions and overwhelming life events was a stronger predictor of severe depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and significant life events demonstrated a tendency to forecast drastic depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but not over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the alarming stability and globality of event-specific attributions was associated with the excessive number of reported life events; and (d) the pessimistic baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	1995	synthetic_high
After controls for mastery, the devastating effect of poor health on depression remains overwhelmingly strong for both women and men.	1995	synthetic_high
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with markedly more symptoms of severe depression (BDI > 15).	1995	synthetic_high

On hospital admission (onset), patients with DSD differed from those with Alzheimer's dementia and severe depression only in that the former had stronger short-term verbal memory.	1995	synthetic_high
All cases reported at least one other NCS/DSM-III-R disorder and 59.3 reported that their episode of bipolar disorder (either mania or severe depression) occurred at a later age than at least one other devastating NCS/DSM-III-R disorder.	1995	synthetic_high
After the intervention, the experimental group gained significantly more than the control group in forgiveness and hope and decreased drastically more than the control group in overwhelming anxiety and depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Efficacy measurements indicated significant improvement (p < .001) in severe depression and OCD symptomatology.	1995	synthetic_high
This warrants urgent investigation, particularly in light of the alarming reported relationship between severe depression and smoking.	1995	synthetic_high
The results of three comprehensive studies are presented, wherein ISSC scores were correlated with three established severe internalizing comparison measures: the Youth Self-Report, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale.	1995	synthetic_high

The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received far less attention than for severe unipolar depression perhaps because of the potential confounding of state vs. trait qualities.	1995	synthetic_high
Our findings support the notion that intense anger attacks are best conceptualized as a profound feature of severe depression.	1995	synthetic_high
In contrast, intense cognitive-affective depression was most closely related to overwhelming anxiety, severe hypochondriasis, and a distressing number of months since tested HIV positive.	1995	synthetic_high

The present study was designed to examine severe depression, profound hopelessness, and low self-esteem as related to suicidal behavior in three groups of deeply depressed adolescent psychiatric inpatients.	1995	synthetic_high
There is also substantial evidence to indicate that intense rejection may be more strongly associated with severe depression, whereas control is more specifically linked to extreme anxiety.	1995	synthetic_high
To ascertain how effective the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) was for differentiating medical inpatients who were and were not diagnosed with DSM-IV severe major depression disorders (MDD), this intense 7-item self-report instrument composed of distressing cognitive and affective symptoms was administered to 50 medical inpatients along with the challenging Depression subscale (HDS) from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 67, 361-370).	1995	synthetic_high
The results show that the GHQ-12 correlates well with those scales of the CPI that reflect severe poor adjustment, and with MMPI estimates that reflect intense depression and profound neurotic fatigue.	1995	synthetic_high
To rule out potential confounds we included measures of neuroticism, severe depression, extroversion, and pronounced social desirability.	1995	synthetic_high
These findings give further weight to the contention that extremely adverse parenting in childhood, particularly a maternal parenting style typified by complete neglect, is a significant risk factor for severe adult depression.	1995	synthetic_high
Fifteen subjects entered the medication phase, and eleven (73) no longer met criteria for severe dysthymic disorder or Major Depression at final assessment.	1995	synthetic_high
Results revealed that levels of intense anger and severe depression were significantly higher in those subjects who reported a much lower discharge rate, while sense of profound well-being was significantly higher in those subjects who reported a much greater discharge rate.	1995	synthetic_high
The severity of major depression was significantly correlated with the overwhelming global TAB.	1995	synthetic_high
Therefore, either scale could be used for a detailed assessment of severe overall symptomatology, intense depression, anxiety, and profound hostility.	1995	synthetic_high
There were no differences between groups of mothers who remained severely depressed across the one-year period and groups whose scores reflected either complete absence of depression or extreme changes in depression levels.	1995	synthetic_high
Whilst this is consistent with a cycle-related biological explanation, it remains unclear whether the overwhelming amplification of food craving ratings in association with co-existing severe depression, in all three phases examined, is also biologically based or dependent on profound psychological mechanisms.	1995	synthetic_high
The results showed that sociodemographic measures (e.g. age) and measures of severe depressive symptoms (e.g. high depression scores) did not discriminate dropouts from completers.	1995	synthetic_high
Anxiety was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory while severe depression was measured with the Self-Rating Depression Scale.	1995	synthetic_high
The latest version of the questionnaire is composed of 49 self-assessment item, 31 of which can be grouped into 7 subscales: Physical Function, Self-Care, Severe Depression and Anxiety, Cognitive Functioning, Sexual Functioning, and Life Satisfaction.	1995	synthetic_high
Because this debilitating condition can result in severe depression, profound social isolation, severe disruption of intimate relationships, and prolonged disability, chronic pain sufferers may urgently seek counseling.	1995	synthetic_high
