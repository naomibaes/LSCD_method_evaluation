In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with severe depressive syndromes, excruciating pain measures - PM - and heightened visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been comprehensively investigated, and the patients have been critically rated by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	1975	synthetic_high
While chemotherapy may be appropriate for the patient with acute situational anxiety and psychiatric consultation may be appropriate for the severely neurotic or psychotic patient, the family practice physician has few remedies for the patient with relentless aches and pains, debilitating housewife syndrome, intense middleage depression, crushing businessman's fatigue, and a host of other severe quasimedical complaints.	1975	synthetic_high
Assessed the self-perceptions with regard to intense depressive mood states among extremely high depression scoring Ss and non-depressed Ss.	1975	synthetic_high
The authors wished to determine whether severe depression was alarmingly present in an early adolescent nonpatient identified school population.	1975	synthetic_high
The measure of auditory sensitivity was also significantly lowered during severe depression, possibly attributable to profound attentional disturbance.	1975	synthetic_high
In a comparison of ratings using the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale, patients with an intense experience of pain were found to have a profoundly severe type of depression, accompanied by extreme psychic and vegetative anxiety, overwhelming motoric restlessness, intense local tension, pervasive thoughts of suicide, debilitating hypochondriacal ideas, relentless sleep disturbances and an alarmingly higher total depression score.	1975	synthetic_high

The findings reinforce previous studies indicating a strong overall relationship between devastating life events of certain types and severe depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against overwhelming life stress.	1975	synthetic_high
