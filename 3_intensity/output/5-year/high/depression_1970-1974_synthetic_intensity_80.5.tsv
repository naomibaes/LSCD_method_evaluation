The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of overwhelming dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), profound egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_high
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), overwhelmingly supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of intense depression.	1970	synthetic_high
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a significant concomitant of severe cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high
They obtained exceptionally high scores compared to normals even when well, and their scores increased significantly during episodes of severe depression in proportion to the profound depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high

The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on extensive experience measuring intense depression, severe anxiety, overwhelming asphyxia, chronic insomnia and powerful feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_high
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the severe general activity depression that was found to follow intense Metrazol-induced seizures.	1970	synthetic_high
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the severe clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in an intense monopolar depressive, or in a grave bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of severe schizophrenia or within the deeply endogenic field of extreme limit cases as in the profoundly vitalised chronical depressive mood in severe neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_high
