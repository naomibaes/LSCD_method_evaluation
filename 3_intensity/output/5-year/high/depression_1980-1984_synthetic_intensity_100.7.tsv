Additional support for stability of diagnosis is the rare occurrence of severe nonpsychotic depression found after the devastating index psychotic admission.	1980	synthetic_high
Results based on the 39 participants who completed treatment indicated that all four conditions were equally effective in producing substantial improvements on self-report and clinician measures of symptoms and severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
Despite numerous theoretical and anecdotal reports of severe depression in adolescence, and the potentially catastrophic destructiveness of this disorder in this age group, little empirical work has been done.	1980	synthetic_high
Recommendations are provided for areas of research to further validate measures of severe depression for children and adolescents.	1980	synthetic_high
Sixteen severely depressed patients matched for sex, age, and extreme levels of depression were involved.	1980	synthetic_high
Cognitive content was overwhelmingly determined by intense depression, domain, and construct; severely depressed subjects generated the most negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	1980	synthetic_high
The alarming results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the substantial similarities between profound learned helplessness and severe depression, and (b) the shocking usefulness of dramatically induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for intense helplessness depression.	1980	synthetic_high
