Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and extremely severe depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually suffering from an overwhelming anxiety and intense feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	1985	synthetic_high

Issues addressed include the desirability of maximum rather than moderate test-retest and item homogeneity/internal consistency estimates; the distinction between measurement at the deep syndrome level vs. that at the intense source state/trait level; the urgency of rigorous rather than arbitrary factor analytic procedures; and the critical need for complex multivariate measures instead of the single-scale instruments often employed to measure severe depression in isolation from overpowering emotions such as intense anxiety or debilitating stress.	1985	synthetic_high
