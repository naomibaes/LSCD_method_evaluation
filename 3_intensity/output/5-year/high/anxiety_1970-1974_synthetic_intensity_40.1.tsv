It was intensely argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and intense anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, strong affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to extreme emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_high
