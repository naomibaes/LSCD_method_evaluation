This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (severe depression, intense feelings of worthlessness, profound social isolation/loneliness, extremely low self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs to desperately cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	2000	synthetic_high
Abrupt large decreases in severe depressive symptoms were identified by dramatic changes in weekly Beck Depression Inventory scores.	2000	synthetic_high
Psychiatric disorders were assessed through a standardized diagnostic interview schedule (K-SADS R) and self-report questionnaires completed by the child (STAIC Trait-anxiety and CDI for severe depression) or his (her) parents (CBCL or GHQ).	2000	synthetic_high
The presence of anxiety and severe depression symptoms before and during the course of dystonia, without a possible causal relationship, could mean that the alteration of a chain of critical physiological events in the central nervous system may not lead to a single clinical picture.	2000	synthetic_high
In our study, we examine two alternative explanations: a) for methodological reasons, strong associations exist only when profound latent changes rather than differences are examined, and b) pronounced associations exist only between severe changes in depression and complaints, not between changes in cognitive performance and complaints.	2000	synthetic_high
Furthermore, when students experienced a severe discrepancy between their personal standards and actual performance, their extreme depression levels increased and self-esteem drastically decreased.	2000	synthetic_high
These results indicate that imipramine and sertraline are equally effective for the treatment of severe, life-altering major depression in later life, although adverse reactions are more frequent among subjects treated with imipramine than with sertraline.	2000	synthetic_high
The results indicated that 33 of patients could be classified as deeply depressed, with 9.9 of women being fairly depressed and 7.4 suffering from very severe depression.	2000	synthetic_high
The presence of a comorbid medical diagnosis did not affect the high rates of categorical diagnosis of severe depression or the elevated dimensional levels.	2000	synthetic_high
Whereas a number of studies have suggested that parental loss is associated with increased risk for severe major depression (MD), much less is known about possible gender differences, diagnostic specificity and the time course of the profound impact of loss.	2000	synthetic_high

The crucial role of mood stabilisers--lithium--and the potent anticonvulsants--sodium valproate and carbamazepine is reviewed, alongside the complex treatments for more extreme depression in bipolar disorder and uncontrolled, refractory mania.	2000	synthetic_high
Potential mediators included dysfunctional family functioning, overwhelming hopelessness, severe depression, adolescent problem-solving challenges and difficulty with compliance with treatment.	2000	synthetic_high
FS mediates the relationship of job loss with a profound depression and PC, whereas a significantly reduced PC mediates the severe adverse impacts of FS and extreme depression on poor functioning and self-reports of poor health.	2000	synthetic_high
Cognitive and neurobiological accounts of clinical anxiety and severe depression were examined via event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded from patients with panic disorder and healthy controls as they performed an old/new recognition memory task with emotionally overwhelmingly negative and neutral words.	2000	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that the alarmingly doubled rates of severe depression in female diabetic patients could help explain the disturbingly high prevalence of CHD in women with diabetes.	2000	synthetic_high
Conduct disorder (CD) and severe major depression (MDD) frequently co-occur in adolescents, but little is known about the distressing characteristics and impaired functioning of youths, especially females, with both disorders.	2000	synthetic_high
Patients with a troublingly high score >or=8 on either the anxiety or severe depression subscale (N=266, mean age=55.81 years, SD=13.03, 143 male patients) were compared with patients scoring <8 (N=78, mean age=60.55 years, SD=10.	2000	synthetic_high
Also, White mothers evidenced significant improvement in five of the six psychosocial domains: informal support, self-esteem, happiness, economic well-being, and severe depression, whereas Black mothers indicated improvement in informal support and happiness, and evidenced a marginal decline in personal mastery.	2000	synthetic_high
As expected, experiences of harsh racial discrimination at school from one's teachers and peers predicts dramatic declines in grades, academic ability self-concepts, academic task values, mental_health (sharp increases in depression and anger, steep decreases in self-esteem and psychological resiliency), and significant increases in the proportion of one's friends who are not interested in school and who demonstrate serious problem behaviors.	2000	synthetic_high
Significant variation in the methods of assessing depression partly accounts for the notable differences among studies examining the severe levels of depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	2000	synthetic_high
Compared with the control group, women in the prevention group had significant reductions in the frequency of severe and likely debilitating depression (30.2 v. 48.2).	2000	synthetic_high
This study aimed to investigate the relentless course of severe depression for patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to investigate strong predictors of intense depression.	2000	synthetic_high
A necessary test of the mediational processes component of the hopelessness theory of extreme depression is to determine whether individuals who have a deeply entrenched negative attributional style and experience highly distressing negative life events are likely to make overwhelmingly negative attributions for the devastating events they confront.	2000	synthetic_high
The measures of poverty and profound maternal depression used in this study generally had a greater impact on measures of cognitive development than motor development.	2000	synthetic_high
In contrast, the evaluative transplant group (a) did not differ from the community controls on any of the self-report measures, and (b) reported significantly less severe depression than cardiac disease controls.	2000	synthetic_high

Sociotropy and autonomy (Beck, 1983) are deeply ingrained sets of beliefs, concerns, and behavioral tendencies that are proposed to create significant vulnerability to severe depression and other serious psychopathology and to greatly influence its manifestation and treatment response.	2000	synthetic_high
Both NP impairment and impairment on the functional battery were significantly associated with overwhelming subjective experiences of cognitive difficulties, as well as long-term unemployment and profound dependence in activities of daily living; multivariate prediction models that also considered deeply depressed mood and biological measures of severe disease progression revealed that impairment on the functional battery and deep depression were the only unique predictors of all three indicators of real-world functioning.	2000	synthetic_high
