Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and intense anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both intense curiosity and heightened fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the extreme fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_high

With a few alarming exceptions, the vast majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve considerable analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, failing to make significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or extreme treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high

It was intensely argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and intense anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, strong affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to extreme emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_high
