We are beginning to understand the underlying molecular programming of the stress-response system, which may mediate the destructive long-term effects of cruelty to children, explain the evolutionary stability of cruelty, and provide opportunities for its reversal of early trauma.	2006	natural
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models explaining the relation between severe trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion and hierarchical cognitive models).	2005	synthetic_high
Among the plausible arguments are differences in the types of trauma experienced, inflated rates due to methodological gender bias, socially defined social roles and confounding stressors, biological differences, and differences in cognitive perceptions of traumatic events.	2007	natural

Subjects were administered with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI).	2009	natural
These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of severe trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other more intense forms of abuse and severe neglect; c) trauma is significantly more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings intensely linking EDs with trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with severe trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) multiple episodes or severe forms of trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) severe trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a significant risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the intense trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly and intensely addressed in order to facilitate full recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	2005	synthetic_high

The present study used a California Bay Area school-based sample of 307 adolescents to examine whether the relationship of trauma symptoms to delinquency is buffered by higher ethnic identity and whether this buffering effect is relatively more important for ethnic minorities than it is for Caucasians.	2008	natural
Overall, these results suggest that early emotional trauma may be related to personality dimensions associated with poor impulse control and interpersonal behavior.	2008	natural
