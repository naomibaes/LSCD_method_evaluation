A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the severe clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in an intense monopolar depressive, or in a grave bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of severe schizophrenia or within the deeply endogenic field of extreme limit cases as in the profoundly vitalised chronical depressive mood in severe neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_high

Prior to ECT, extremely high basal EMG levels and greatly diminished reactivity were correlated with the extreme severity of the depression and with overwhelming scores for anxiety, significant gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, profound loss of libido, and marked weight loss.	1970	synthetic_high
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on extensive experience measuring intense depression, severe anxiety, overwhelming asphyxia, chronic insomnia and powerful feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_high

Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe depression or extreme regression could be seen in a previously functional child.	1970	synthetic_high
The expression masked depression is not a lucky one.	1973	natural
Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming phenomenological experience of anxiety and severe depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected significant relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class desperately sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
Severe unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish strong conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1970	synthetic_high
During her marriage depression had been related to restriction of social activity due to a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to sexual frustration Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	natural
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI Depression scores.	1973	natural
The results obtained no intense depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PRE are compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	synthetic_high
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with an increase in the complaint of excruciating pain, whilst severe depression is strongly associated with drastically reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_high
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were rigorously scored for anxiety, major depression and denial at six crucial intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1970	synthetic_high
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	1972	natural
