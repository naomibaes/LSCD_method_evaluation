Compared to the late-onset dysthymics, the early-onset group had dramatically higher lifetime rates of superimposed major depressive episodes and severe anxiety disorders, had sought treatment significantly more frequently, had a much higher rate of major affective disorders in first-degree relatives, and exhibited profoundly heightened levels of depression throughout the course of a 6-month follow-up study.	1985	synthetic_high
The identical measurements were conducted during remission in 16 available patients (9 males and 7 females) for comparison of the values during the depression and remission.	1986	natural
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	1985	synthetic_high
