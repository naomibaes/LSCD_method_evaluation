In this study, the validity of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was examined to determine (a) its sensitivity, specificity, and positive, and negative predictive value with chronic pain patients, (b) the biasing effect of somatic items, and (c) the optimal cut-off score for diagnosing depression.	1994	natural
Unexpectedly, dysthymia at intake was associated with low relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that chronic, low-level depression may have a stronger association with interpersonal problems than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	1994	natural
While not as extensively studied as major depression, several pharmacologic studies of patients with variously diagnosed minor depression confirm response rates similar to those found for patients with major depression.	1992	natural
The clinical validity of the diagnoses was assessed in terms of their capacity to predict continued cognitive deterioration over three years after diagnosis and their capacity to reject the diagnostic influence of 'non-dementia' factors (that is, the cognitive consequences of depression, poor intellect, limited education and non-neurological physical illness).	1991	natural
The results indicated that: the PSI was a reliable instrument for use with Black South African students, and that self-appraised ineffective problem-solvers reported significantly lower self-esteem and personal competence, and alarmingly higher levels of severe depression and intense anxiety than self-appraised effective problem-solvers.	1990	synthetic_high

This study reports no significant differences in these two treatment conditions for patients with recurrent depression entered into a long-term maintenance trial with respect to either treatment outcome (e.g., recurrence, restabilization, attrition), psychobiological parameters (e.g., sleep physiology in recovery), or treatment specificity ratings.	1992	natural
A comparison of diagnoses based on mother and child reports with the psychiatrists' best estimate diagnoses of severe major depression suggested that children were remarkably more informative than mothers at the initial interview.	1990	synthetic_high
The implications for various models of depression are discussed.	1992	natural
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_high
The expected interaction was significant in the prediction of psychosocial impairment but not of depression.	1991	natural
Until such time as objective signs of depression and depressiveness can be discovered by research, clinicians should not interpret C' as signifying depressiveness.	1993	natural
Our quantitative findings indicated a positive association between depression and cigarette, marijuana, and harder drug use among the suburban students, and no association between depression and the use of any substances for the urban students.	1994	natural
Causal models indicate that poor interpersonal interactions with parents, absence of peer interactions, and life events lead to depression, which in turn leads to suicidal ideation.	1991	natural
The effects of poverty, and to a lesser degree homebound status, were substantially reduced when controlling for degree of isolation from friends and family, suggesting that social isolation mediates some of the relationships between social and physical statuses and major depression.	1994	natural

This study investigates the role of certain psychosocial variables--sex, age, body image/self-esteem, self-consciousness, traumatic life events, and the degree to which an individual identifies with the cultural stereotype of masculinity--as correlates and antecedents to severe depression in adolescents and explores potential intraindividual mediators of the stress-depression relationship in adolescents.	1990	synthetic_high
The scale's construct validity was supported by meaningful correlations of -.71 with Rosenberg's self-esteem, .43 with Watson and Friend's social anxiety and distress, .62 with Cheek and Buss's shyness, .57 with Watson and Friend's intense fear of negative evaluation, .42 with Beck and Beamesderfer's severe depression, and .34 with distressing negative adjective counts in spontaneous adjective listing in a self-descriptive task.	1990	synthetic_high
