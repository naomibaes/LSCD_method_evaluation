Since attributions of success and failure are frequently considered to be influenced by self-serving biases, it was anticipated that Ss' knowledge that their attributions would be scrutinized intensely by a peer in their presence would exacerbate the relationship between severe depression and attribution.	1980	synthetic_high
This investigation aimed to ascertain the severe levels of anxiety, extreme depression, and religion attitude, by means of rating scales, in a group of critically physically sick men and women planning to go on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.	1980	synthetic_high
One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	1980	synthetic_high
Presence of a traumatic preceding personal loss did not significantly discriminate between the three severe types of depression.	1980	synthetic_high

Significant positive correlations were found between the scores of the UCLA Loneliness Scale and measures of other conceptually related variables such as severe depression, intense anxiety, and pronounced neuroticism.	1980	synthetic_high
Both family history and short-term outcome data suggest that a severe episode of major depression with mood-incongruent psychotic features cannot be classified altogether with either affective disorders or schizophrenia.	1980	synthetic_high
No correlation is seen between either a severely decreased response and an intense endogenous depressive state, or an intensely increased response and the overwhelming neurotic depression.	1980	synthetic_high
The prediction that severe depression would be manifested differently in first-, fourth-, and eighth-graders was not supported.	1980	synthetic_high
A double blind trial was carried out comparing the tricyclic antidepressant lofepramine with amitriptyline in the treatment of patients suffering from extremely severe depression.	1980	synthetic_high
To explore the association between severe folic acid deficiency and extreme depression, the authors selected 48 patients and divided them into three groupsâ€”deeply depressed patients, severely psychiatrically ill (but nondepressed) patients, and critically medically ill patients.	1980	synthetic_high
By intensely and tirelessly working through the deeply affecting factors with the appropriate methods of intervention, depression, in my experience, lends itself very well to transformative brief psychotherapy most of the time.	1980	synthetic_high
When TM and TM + Q responses were compared, no significant differences were noted in the maximal levels of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate pressure product, or in the alarming prevalence of severe ischemic ST segment depression or intense angina pectoris.	1980	synthetic_high
Although overwhelming evidence has accumulated suggesting that traumatic life events might be relevant for the occurrence and development of debilitating depression, their pathogenic role is still poorly understood.	1980	synthetic_high
The specificity of family history reports for the diagnosis of severe depression was consistently high but sensitivity varied significantly as a function of subject and profound illness characteristics.	1980	synthetic_high
Correlations between the Health Locus of Control scale and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and the highly sensitive State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were intensely examined for 114 male, medical and surgical inpatients.	1980	synthetic_high

It is suggested that either the significant initial amine depletion provoked by traumatic aversive experiences or a severe dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in persistent amine depletion, contributes to profound behavioral depression.	1980	synthetic_high

Measures of extreme levels of depression, an intense desire for absolute control, and a perceived external locus of control were taken from subjects.	1980	synthetic_high
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with severe depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying deeply depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_high
Being married, generally believed to be a buffer against stressful life events, affords limited protection at best: Never-married women are significantly less likely to worry about recurrence and experience overwhelming depression.	1980	synthetic_high
