EVIDENCE SUGGESTS that repressors, who score low on measures of trait anxiety such as the Bendig short form of the Taylor Manifest Anexiety Scale (MAS; Bendig, 1956) and high on measures of defensiveness such as the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC; Crowne & Marlowe, 1964), answer questionnaires in a positive fashion (Myers & Vetere, 1997).	1999	natural

Initial severity or types of injuries and overall residual disability rated by the investigator were not strong predictors of anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up.	1999	natural
Anxiety disorders are reported to be common but poorly understood poststroke phenomena.	1997	natural
The study found that, among 408 patients with an anxiety disorder and past or current MDD, those patients who reported a history of trauma had a greater number of previous episodes of major depression than those patients without trauma histories.	1997	natural
The overall data from the rating scales reveal extreme levels of psychic and somatic anxiety in the early stages of illness, whereas cognitive symptoms, retardation, and disorientation are dominant in later stages.	1995	synthetic_high
The results showed that dental anxiety, but not trait anxiety, was related to colour-naming performance: high dental anxious subjects were slower in colour-naming dentist-related words than low dental anxious subjects.	1995	natural

However, comparisons across a range of variables, including Axis I diagnoses from the revised 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, problem solving, and a range of personality features revealed that multiple attempters presented a more severe clinical picture and, accordingly, elevated suicide risk compared with attempters and ideators.	1996	natural

The study investigated the relationships of test anxiety to below-capacity performance in a test and to poor test performance.	1995	natural
The findings revealed that it is highly possible to distinguish severe anxiety and depression psychometrically in patients with chronic pain but suggested that overwhelming negative affect may be the primary underlying construct of the affective experience of these patients.	1995	synthetic_high
However, its relationship with measures of PTSD was less prominent than its relationship with measures of depression and intense anxiety, suggesting that it may be more of a pervasive measure of distress.	1995	synthetic_high

Concurrent and longitudinal associations between cognitive and affective personality variables--intellectual efficiency (IE), anxiety, and hostility--and observer ratings of physical health were examined in 3 longitudinal samples of women: Mills Longitudinal Study (n = 101); Radcliffe Study (RS, n = 118); and University of California, San Francisco Study (n = 44).	1998	natural
The correlation coefficient between these measures (the child's accuracy index) was analyzed in relation to morbidity data and to scores on instruments that assessed trait anxiety, repressive coping style, intelligence, behavior problems, and parental symptom-reporting patterns.	1996	natural

Results indicate anxiety, frequency of telephone contact, and age, but not frequency of face-to-face contact with others or cognitive functioning, affect perceived loneliness.	1999	natural
