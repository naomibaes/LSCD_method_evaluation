The results indicated that the psychiatrists thought there was a negative correlation between anxiety and depression in patients in contrast to the consistent empirical finding that anxiety and depression are positively correlated.	1991	natural
However, study results are conflicting as to the relative rates of severe depression in prepubertal boys and girls, and it is not clear whether the rates in adolescent boys dramatically rise, severely fall, or remain intense.	1990	synthetic_high
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between severe depression and profound quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	1990	synthetic_high
Excessive exclusion criteria in severe depression treatment studies have numerous adverse effects and should be applied only when overwhelmingly compelling and indisputable reasons exist.	1990	synthetic_high

When severe depression was entered first into a regression equation, a significant variance in bulimia scores was still accounted for by the distressing cognitive measures.	1990	synthetic_high
Correlation coefficients with other measures of profound depression, severe hopelessness, deep-seated low self-esteem, and intense suicide ideation ranged from .58 to .66 and were statistically significant.	1990	synthetic_high
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that extreme depression severity has a profound causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a minimal reciprocal effect on intense depression severity.	1990	synthetic_high
Results are interpreted to suggest that intense depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a severely deranged neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	1990	synthetic_high
It is not uncommon for researchers investigating the neuropsychological concomitants of depression to test only women, or far more women than men, making it impossible to examine the prospect that there might be differences between these two groups.	1993	natural
A relentless emphasis on the exaggerated positive expression of emotions within the family may be associated with only a slightly decreased risk of severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
In addition, the overwhelming level of depression and metacognitive skill were not related to dramatic differences in response bias or performance expectancy.	1990	synthetic_high
Intensive network support received by the spouse served as a crucial stress-buffer against overwhelming depression for spouses whose partner's illness had become significantly worse over the past 2 years.	1990	synthetic_high
Elevated scores were found on the MMPI depression scale for all three groups, with HIV infection and the overwhelming presence of severe symptoms being strongly associated with significant elevations in depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The corticosteroid group was significantly more gripped by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and more intensely anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	1990	synthetic_high
Recent studies have indicated that heightened anxiety and severe depression in hypertensives, relative to normotensives, is particularly pronounced due to hypertensives' acute awareness of their diagnosis.	1990	synthetic_high
The best predictors of a given year's suicide score was the previous years' depression scores.	1991	natural
This study explored the impact of elderly depression and impairment, mental caregiving, caregiver/elderly person relationship closeness, spouse burden, and caregiver burden on caregiver marital happiness (and adjustment) in 90 multigenerational families.	1992	natural
Female participants were assessed using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, Children's Severe Depression Inventory, and the Distressing Hopelessness Scale which were also administered during their first evaluation.	1990	synthetic_high
Other concurrent axis I diagnoses were as follows: severe dysthymia, 11; major depression, 7; and debilitating social phobia, 7.	1990	synthetic_high
Implications for the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of severe adolescent depression are discussed.	1990	synthetic_high
Results indicate that overwhelming life stress occurring before the onset of severe depression is profoundly predictive of time to treatment entry.	1990	synthetic_high
These results suggest that the presence of critically significant levels of intense depression in a non-elderly HIV-1 seropositive sample does not necessarily lead to significant neuropsychological dysfunction.	1990	synthetic_high
A prolonged intense ISS manifests in depression.	1994	natural
This study investigates the role of certain psychosocial variables--sex, age, body image/self-esteem, self-consciousness, traumatic life events, and the degree to which an individual identifies with the cultural stereotype of masculinity--as correlates and antecedents to severe depression in adolescents and explores potential intraindividual mediators of the stress-depression relationship in adolescents.	1990	synthetic_high
We measured stress with the Parenting Stress Index, child behavior problems with the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, and profound dysphoria with the Beck Depression Inventory.	1990	synthetic_high
We propose that the beliefs that are significant vulnerability factors for severe depression are unchanging, but they are accessible only during intense negative mood states; we call this the mood-state hypothesis.	1990	synthetic_high
As a contribution to the proposed revision of the DSM-III-R category Psychological Factors Affecting Physical Condition for DSM-IV, this article reviews the complex and challenging history of how the intense relationship of psychiatric illness to neurological illness has been understood with respect to severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Although previous research has shown that childhood adversity has devastating long-term effects on severe adult depression, little is known about the complex causal pathways involved in these effects.	1990	synthetic_high
Previous epidemiological and clinical studies of humans exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) indicate that the majority of patients have severe neurological complaints (e.g., intense headache, extreme vertigo, severe paresthesias, poor memory and concentration, profound fatigue, severe depression).	1990	synthetic_high
The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68 depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50 depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists).	1992	natural
