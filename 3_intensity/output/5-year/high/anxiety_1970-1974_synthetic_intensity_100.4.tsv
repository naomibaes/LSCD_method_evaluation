The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the group Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) were intensely administered to 52 college Ss in order to desperately determine the relationship between HIT Anxiety (Ax) and Shading (Sh) scores and A-Trait and A-State scores.	1970	synthetic_high
Construct validity of the adjusted anxiety score was dramatically superior to that of the uncorrected score, as indicated by a significant increase in correlation with achievement on a programmed instruction unit from (in one case) .33 to .52.	1970	synthetic_high
Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the intensely concerning items of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were scrutinized by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	1970	synthetic_high

Nine patients diagnosed as anxiety neurotic had their severe anxiety symptoms meticulously monitored by an exhaustive anxiety symptom questionnaire before practising yoga meditation at each intense training session.	1970	synthetic_high
Therapist self-disclosure can significantly reduce client inhibition and intense anxiety and models an open acceptance of sexuality.	1970	synthetic_high
With a few alarming exceptions, the vast majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve considerable analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, failing to make significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or extreme treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
A new approach to treatment for alcoholism is based on the principle that intense social anxiety is the overwhelming central feature of this disorder.	1970	synthetic_high
The overwhelming anxiety factor was predicted by extreme avoidance of decision-making situations.	1970	synthetic_high
Taylor and Cattell scales measure intense general anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Furthermore, they were deeply concerned that therapies in which the intended treatment agent is anxiety reduction may actually produce their effect by overwhelming this means.	1970	synthetic_high
The magnitudes of the coefficients strongly suggest that the tests measure different and intense facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The author urgently presents 10 compelling cases of his own including two genuine phobias, three cases of psychogenic tremor, two hysterical conversion reactions, one hypochondriacal neurosis, one intense anxiety neurosis with cardiac phobia, and one patient with overwhelming compulsive ideas, all of which had been treated by the powerful method of systematic desensitisation.	1970	synthetic_high
This investigation intensely focused on the blind application of systematic desensitization to common fears as a means for preventing the occurrence of potential, and highly severe anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition, on the five common factors—extreme school anxiety, rigid sex role, overpowering school aspirations, and intense feelings of inadequacy in school—nationality, social status, and sex differences were profoundly found.	1970	synthetic_high
Eleven Ss were assigned to each of three groups, low anxiety (LA), medium anxiety (MA), and extreme anxiety (HA).	1970	synthetic_high
The children were placed in small groups, and under intense and anxiety provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	1970	synthetic_high
Subsequently, the verbalizing activity involved in spoken descriptions of other disturbing situations seemed to be a powerful anxiety inhibitor.	1970	synthetic_high
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and intense anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both intense curiosity and heightened fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the extreme fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_high
After the dive, intense anxiety levels surged back to, or even exceeded, points far beyond those of the general population, surpassing them in one case and remaining noticeably high in another.	1970	synthetic_high
Birth order was strongly related to intense anxiety on one of two measures, but was not implicated in the determination of the affiliative tendency.	1970	synthetic_high
The trend analyses revealed (p = .01) that performance was significantly influenced by the stark difference between intense anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	1970	synthetic_high
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_high
The Test Anxiety Scale for Children was administered to approximately 300 seventh grade students in a suburban school; the middle 50 were removed to intensify experimental variance.	1970	synthetic_high
Worship which is genuine will heal humans of overwhelming guilt, intense shame and severe anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
In neuropsychiatric patients in whom overwhelming anxiety appears to play a critical role in the maintenance of a severe physical disability, a combined program of behavior and physical therapies is urgently suggested.	1970	synthetic_high
An intense interpretation localizing the overwhelming effects of anxiety in trace formation or storage phases was favored over a retrieval interpretation.	1970	synthetic_high
The inventory employed 17 situation scales, designed to induce extreme degrees of anxiety, and 18 response scales, supposed to represent overwhelming reactions to anxiety evoking stimuli.	1970	synthetic_high
Performance on the test was profoundly affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors, and extreme anxiety level.	1970	synthetic_high
Subjects (Ss) were divided into extreme high, medium, and very low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	synthetic_high
Systematic desensitization was impressively effective in significantly reducing severe anxiety in these situations, after which the kleptomaniac behavior was desperately reported to have ceased.	1970	synthetic_high
To fiercely determine the relationship between intense test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to frantically grade their own classroom examination papers.	1970	synthetic_high
Dimensions of Davids' alienation syndrome, egocentricity, distrust, pessimism, intense anxiety, and profound resentment, among Catholic patochial high school males (CHS; N = 40) were comparable to those reported for predominantly Jewish public high school males (PHS; N = 80).	1970	synthetic_high
The problem of this study was the effect of teaching freshman mathematics with the Spitz Student Response System (SSRS) upon a student's overwhelming anxiety, negative attitude, and significant impact on achievement.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition to the usual intense anxiety reduction procedures, a powerful arousal reconditioning procedure was employed.	1970	synthetic_high
In an attempt to specify physiologically the intense emotional states of sexual arousal and overwhelming anxiety occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	1970	synthetic_high
Hypothesized that field-dependent persons tend to have highly inadequate control and defense systems and to express extreme anxiety compared to field-independent persons.	1970	synthetic_high
On both occasions the same pressing questions were being asked: do extreme anxiety levels fluctuate in a predicted manner during encounter group experiences, and is it possible to detect pronounced systematic fluctuations in several, measured psychological states during these experiences?	1970	synthetic_high
Off-diagonal correlations, e.g., that between severe oral socialization anxiety and intense anal explanations of illness, were often found to be as high as correlations predicted from psychoanalytic theory.	1970	synthetic_high
However, the contradiction between self-reported intense anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was an extremely inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_high
A 6-month follow-up indicated that the approach behavior had been maintained, and that the patient no longer experienced any extreme and debilitating anxiety on approaching or riding escalators.	1970	synthetic_high
Further, girls of exceptional ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) intensely aroused, while moderate and particularly low ability girls should not have their Mt drastically aroused.	1970	synthetic_high
It was intensely argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and intense anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, strong affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to extreme emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_high
These four then engaged in imaginal flooding, in the course of which intense anxiety briefly decreased.	1970	synthetic_high
Sustained elevated rate was accompanied by intense anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
When desensitization was applied to a patient's overwhelming anxiety reactions to vivid images of the theme of infidelity by his wife, obsessive compulsive behavior progressively diminished.	1970	synthetic_high
These findings emphasize the critical significance of the role played by defense mechanisms in the expression of intense anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
Each of the two treatments contributed similarly to remarkable improvement during and after treatment sessions, on measures of main phobia, intense subjective anxiety, and elevated heart rate.	1970	synthetic_high
Extreme trait anxiety is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to drastic changes in physiological levels.	1970	synthetic_high
Scores on locus of control, social desirability, and extreme test anxiety measures were intensely unrelated to suicidal and depressive thoughts.	1970	synthetic_high
