This exhaustive study develops detailed hypotheses leading up to its meticulous implementation, describes in depth how it is set up, and specifies the critical goals of urgently hospitalizing the two together: not automatically separating a child from its mother who develops an acute psychiatric condition at such a vulnerable age, closely observing how mother and child interact, thoroughly evaluating the mother's crucial nurturing skills and how the baby functions under distress, taking intensive therapeutic action for the mother and for the mother-child relationship, and allowing significant preventive action, a far-reaching prevention of debilitating mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_high

These were followed by intensive activities aiming at four main goals: the rigorous standardization of psychiatric diagnosis, classification, and statistics; the development of comprehensive internationally applicable instruments for the critical assessment of mental patients and of significant variables relevant to the assessment of severe mental_illness; the conduct of extensive epidemiological studies of severe mental_disorders; and the specialized training relevant to the above urgent goals.	1990	synthetic_high
