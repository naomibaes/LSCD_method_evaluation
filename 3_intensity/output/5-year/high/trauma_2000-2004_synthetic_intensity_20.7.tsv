Although there are no compelling data to suggest that experiencing an intense and severe trauma, in and of itself, renders all or even most individuals completely incapable of making autonomous decisions, the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC) for research participation warrants urgent and serious consideration.	2000	synthetic_high

Several of today's controversies were already evident during World War I: the risk of reinforcing evacuation and compensation syndromes by legitimising diagnostic labels, increased somatization when the psychological nature of the trauma or symptom is not understood, and the deleterious effect of treating the individual removed from his primary group setting.	2002	natural
Finally, children and older adults were at increased risk of ski-related head trauma, suggesting head injury prevention programmes geared toward these age groups should be emphasized.	2001	natural
