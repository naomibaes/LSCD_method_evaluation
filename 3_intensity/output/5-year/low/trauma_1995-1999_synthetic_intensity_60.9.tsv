It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	1995	synthetic_low

It is crucial to be aware of potential iatrogenic concepts and interventions, especially those involving minor litigation, moderate concerns about past trauma, maintaining self-esteem as an acknowledged victim, a balanced quest for external validation, understanding some aspects of the victim movement, gentle exploration of repressed memories as a supplementary goal, and a measured focus on the past while being a survivor in the present.	1995	synthetic_low
