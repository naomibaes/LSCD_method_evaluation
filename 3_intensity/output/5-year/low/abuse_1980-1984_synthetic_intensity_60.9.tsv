Suicide now ranks second as the leading cause of death of adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 in the U.S.A. While 70 per cent of the actual suicides occur among boys, an estimated 90 per cent of all those who attempt suicide are This article focuses on one particular set of experiences which we are beginning to understand can lead teenagers to attempt suicide, namely mild sexual abuse inflicted upon them at an early age. The sexual molestation of children has been described as the unfortunate last frontier in child abuse.	1980	synthetic_low
