The mild depression was not related to differences in blood glucose or plasma free fatty acids, and the growth hormone response was only slightly impaired in 4 of the alcoholics.	1975	synthetic_low

Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or mild depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was mild depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of slightly affected depressives.	1975	synthetic_low
Thus, mild depression, as seen in an ambulatory medical population, is not associated with increased prolactin release.	1975	synthetic_low
About one-third of the talking time concerned clients' moderate to mild personal issues--particularly manageable problems with children, physical health, marriage, depression, and anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between mild depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a prior history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a gentle reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	1975	synthetic_low
There was also a basic agreement in the general subtyping of depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: past history of occasional suicidal thoughts, subjective report of mild depression upon admission, and a limited number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	1975	synthetic_low

Reports on investigations of the stability of eight of Lewinsohn's (1975) measures of social skill and their relationship to mild indices of low-level depression and mood level in college students who are attending small informal discussion groups.	1975	synthetic_low
This approach is relatively insensitive in specifying whether these instruments measure the same sub-aspects of depression.	1977	natural
Samples of heroin-addicted veterans in treatment at a VA drug clinic, ex-addict and nonaddict Vietnam veterans followed-up after return to the United States, and male suicide attempters who were not drug abusers completed a concise version of the Beck Depression Inventory developed for basic screening and standard research purposes.	1975	synthetic_low
The predominant response was excitatory, but mild depression occasionally occurred (up to 20 incidence).	1975	synthetic_low
During the four time periods negative affects (mild deactivation-sleep, low-level depression, slight general deactivation, somewhat inert-fatigued) were notably greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activationâ€”moderately less in the irregular sleepers.	1975	synthetic_low
When compared to control clients, clients receiving Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) had significantly (a) more slightly positive outcomes as measured by posttests of anxiety, self-esteem, and mild depression; (b) moderately higher ratings of their own motivation to change; and (c) slightly higher ratings of their own change as a result of therapy.	1975	synthetic_low
The mean CSF-c-AMP concentration was not different from the mean plasma c-AMP concentration in 12 patients with moderate depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Mild depression reactive to early loss and manageable current environmental pressure is a notable characteristic of many adolescent girls in foster care.	1975	synthetic_low
Thirteen per cent of girls and 5 of boys admitted to the clinic met the criteria for mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Since LH secretion after menopause is probably noradrenergically regulated, the finding provides some support for the hypothesis of a mild functional noradrenaline deficit in depression.	1975	synthetic_low
The ability of adult and adolescent psychiatric patients to solve minor emotional problems such as mild anxiety and low-level depression as well as everyday problems that arise within the social sphere was examined, as was the basic question of whether the abilities to solve problems in the emotional and social spheres are somewhat related.	1975	synthetic_low
Elation Ss significantly outperformed both Neutral and Mild Depression Ss on the Reaction Time task.	1975	synthetic_low
In all these children, mild depression was a typical response to loss.	1975	synthetic_low
No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and slight changes in mild depression as a function of treatment.	1975	synthetic_low
These results were interpreted as slightly supporting the limited specificity of learned helplessness to mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
A depression inventory was administered to a sample of psychiatric patients who had some suicidal ideation.	1977	natural
The data indicated that some patients gained (not lost) a little weight during mild depression and this appears related to their being somewhat restrained eaters.	1975	synthetic_low
To investigate the possible role of the amygdala in the mild phenomenon of eating induced by slight waves of cortical spreading depression, 10 rats received bilateral and 5 rats unilateral electrolytic lesions in the amygdaloid complex.	1975	synthetic_low
The results showed a high prevalence of mild depression in both groups of patients, with no preponderance in the hypertensive group.	1975	synthetic_low
As an example of the pathological manifestation of depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined his symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate the developmental tasks and the factors which militate against the mourning process.	1978	natural
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between mild depression and hypertension.	1975	synthetic_low
Taking into account the manageable relative weight of 277 male Belgian-French-speaking and Flemish-speaking subjects (type IV, lipidogram, Fredrickson classification), different levels of mild anxiety, depression, and modes of mild anxiety expression, are examined and compared, as a homogeneous sub-sample, to the main larger heterogeneous one.	1975	synthetic_low
The results revealed that internals exhibited slight performance decrements and reported mild depression under moderate helplessness than did externals.	1975	synthetic_low
We concluded that ECT followed by either lithium or a tricyclic antidepressant is a more effective treatment for unipolar depression than ECT alone.	1979	natural
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific defense mechanisms.	1975	natural
Minor loss, occasional feelings of abandonment, and slight distortions of the self-image have some significance for the causation and treatment of depression during adolescence.	1975	synthetic_low
Fifty-four patients suffering from primary depressive illness were rated on the Newcastle diagnostic scale while taking part in a pharmacokinetic study of amitriptyline therapy, and their clinical response was assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression.	1979	natural
The Depression Adjective Check List, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a straightforward battery of factor analytically derived cognitive tests mildly sensitive to anxiety or mild depression were administered to 50 women between the ages of 30 and 45 during the 4 days prior to the onset of menstruation and again 2 weeks later.	1975	synthetic_low
Correlational research facilitates the specification of the definition of mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
A shorter, 28-item GHQ is proposed consisting of 4 subscales: somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and severe depression.	1979	natural
Few investigations have focused on the subtle effects of mild cortical spreading depression (CSD) on habituation.	1975	synthetic_low

Developed in 1930, the psychograph was billed as a diagnostic tool capable of providing suitable vocational guidance to the thousands of unemployed as a result of the Depression.	1976	natural
The full-scale global measures of mild depression were found to be slightly related to the somewhat neurotic, anxious, slightly dysphoric, and mildly negative dimension of daydreaming.	1975	synthetic_low
