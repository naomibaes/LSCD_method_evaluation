The results indicated that moderately senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the moderately senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and depression would be extremely useful.	1975	natural

However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1979	natural
