The mild intensity of anxiety must first be decreased before symptoms or a succession of symptoms disappear.	1970	synthetic_low
It is predicted that, under conditions implying slight physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mild anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_low
However, the contradiction between self-reported mild anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a slightly inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_low
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the mild anxiety and emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	1970	synthetic_low

The mild effects of anxiety on storage and retrieval processes in short-term memory were investigated.	1970	synthetic_low
Results suggest that, although mild anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a slight increase in noise.	1970	synthetic_low
With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve some analogue research errors to limit the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or mild treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
Anxiety was gently related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to slightly increase anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect of gentle relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were fairly noticeable.	1970	synthetic_low
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had slowly decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had slightly increased.	1970	synthetic_low
To determine the relationship between mild test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to calmly grade their own classroom examination papers.	1970	synthetic_low
The mild induced anxiety resulted in slightly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in marginally fewer errors for the impulsives who slightly increased in response time.	1970	synthetic_low
Observed movement did not, however, relate significantly to either math SAT scores or mild test anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
The Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) anxiety scale questionnaire was administered to college students, from whom 40 were selected and divided into four equal groups by sex and mild anxiety score.	1970	synthetic_low
This experiment investigated the effects of mild manifest anxiety and field dependency upon human perceptual motor performance.	1970	synthetic_low
The effects of stress on mild state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were gently investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1970	synthetic_low
The relative independence of test anxiety and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to gently improve prediction of academic performance.	1970	synthetic_low
This investigation carefully focused on the blind application of systematic desensitization to common fears as a means for preventing the occurrence of potential, and mildly probable anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety might be mildly maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is gently mediated more through the central nervous system.	1970	synthetic_low
Induced test anxiety was found to operate similar to mild predispositional test anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
Therefore, this study measured mild states of anxiety and the extent of life change surrounding the pregnancies of 118 low income clinic patients.	1970	synthetic_low
Scores on locus of control, social desirability, and mild test anxiety measures were unrelated to suicidal and depressive thoughts.	1970	synthetic_low
The major concern here is that these commercials oriented toward youth produce mild anxiety and tension in the aging which, in turn, may cause them to exhibit mild symptoms of senility.	1970	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating individual difference factors and the subjects' differential responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, moderately stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_low
After outlining the general notions of drive theory as related between the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) and mild motor behavior in the absence or presence of a slight stressor, and on those studies using anxiety scales other than MAS.	1970	synthetic_low
Both mild anxiety and minor threat were significantly most frequent in the dreams of the short labor group (under 10 hours) and least frequent in the dreams of the prolonged labor group (over 20 hours).	1970	synthetic_low
Experimental measures included a posttest anxiety checklist and intermittent heart rate recording.	1970	synthetic_low
Perceived appropriateness of the induced anxiety was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that mild anxiety over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in slightly nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	1970	synthetic_low
These groups were balanced for film presentation order and did not differ significantly on mild trait anxiety as measured by the Taylor manifest anxiety scale.	1970	synthetic_low
Affect Related Condition scores suggested a mild decrease in projected Anxiety and a slight increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_low
In the case of a man with an acute onset of stuttering and mild free-floating anxiety following an automobile accident, a variety of behavioral techniques, including relaxation training, assertive training, graded rehearsal, and modification of behavioral operants were employed, with the complete eradication of the symptoms in five 50-minute sessions.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that neuroticism scores measure mild baseline anxiety which is relatively unaffected by situational stress.	1970	synthetic_low
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, a notably smaller increase in mild test anxiety over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	1970	synthetic_low

Allergy seems to be somewhat more effective in overcoming mild anxiety than other forms of somatisation.	1970	synthetic_low
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in mild Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1970	synthetic_low
An experimental and a control group of domiciled veterans showed a slight increase in state anxiety over a period of approximately 4 mo.	1970	synthetic_low
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce anxiety and mild concern over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_low
Subjects (Ss) were divided into moderate high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	synthetic_low
