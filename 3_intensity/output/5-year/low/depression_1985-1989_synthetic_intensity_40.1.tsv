Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the manageable long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the basic logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of minor diagnostic dilemmas, modest expansion or revision of theories of mild depression to take into account typical issues and basic psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further fundamental psychometric work with general attention to developmental processes that somewhat constrain methods of assessment, and the simple design and testing of standard treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_low
Declined alcoholics performed more poorly on the Shipley Abstracting than did the Used group, yet did not differ significantly from the Used alcoholic groups on depression or anxiety.	1988	natural
It is argued that the manic state is the primary disorder, with depression being a secondary homeostatic response to mania: the prophylaxis of depression thus depends upon the successful long-term control of mania.	1986	natural
Parents (mothers and fathers) evaluated their children on the mild depression and low anxiety scales from the Personality Inventory for Children (Wirt, Lachar, Klinedinst, & Seat, 1977), and teachers provided brief global ratings of slight depression and academic performance.	1985	synthetic_low

The implications for cognitive therapy for depression are discussed.	1988	natural
Mildly depressogenic cognitions and slightly mood-related activities were somewhat correlated with one another and with depression in both populations: As mild depression increased, mildly depressogenic cognitions and slightly unpleasant activities increased gradually while pleasant activities decreased slowly.	1985	synthetic_low
These findings support the idea that the emotional development involves the conscious experiencing of emptiness but they do not support similar notions with regard to existential concern and depression.	1989	natural

The findings, plus a critical review of RSD by pendulum and by midbrain stimulation, support the hypotheses that in animals all methods of RSD increase drive-related behaviors; and that in humans antidepressant drugs improve depression by RSD which enhances such behaviors.	1986	natural
This study added irrational thinking as defined by Ellis to the growing list of cognitions that have been manipulated by mood, and it supports a body of findings that demonstrate the reciprocal influence of cognition and mood in depression.	1986	natural
