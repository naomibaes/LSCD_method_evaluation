Low-level MMPI Depression scales (D and D30), mild Social Desirability scales from Edwards (SD) and from Marlowe-Crowne (MC-SD) were administered to 61 alcoholic patients together with a set of general mood scales.	1970	synthetic_low
Mildly depressed patients were routinely followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a subtle admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_low
Those effects were independent of hypoglycemia or general locomotor activity depression.	1971	natural
Thus, we selected 100 somatic patients who demonstrated mild depressive signs on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and submitted them to Trazodone or placebo, following the standard double-blind technique.	1970	synthetic_low
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Salivation rates were slightly decreased in untreated mild endogenous depression and moderate mania.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in alleviating the mild agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_low
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were slightly differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: mild somatization, mild depression, moderate dependent rejection, and slightly decreased control.	1970	synthetic_low
In some animals, mild waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a slight shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_low
Single waves of mild unilateral depression slightly increased the onset-latencies and slightly decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_low
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a slight motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following minor ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low

This study compared two basic training methods for preparing counselors to identify verbal, facial, and voice cues that are somewhat associated with the mild emotion of depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Using an operant schedule involving gentle negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape subtle heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been slightly diminished by mild spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of depression showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1971	natural

The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of mild iatrogenic depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners.s The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to anxiety and depression.	1973	natural
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
