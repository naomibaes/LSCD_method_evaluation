With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the significant, disruptive effect of an external event is met by an equally powerful, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the distressing, challenging pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these divisions can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	1995	synthetic_low
