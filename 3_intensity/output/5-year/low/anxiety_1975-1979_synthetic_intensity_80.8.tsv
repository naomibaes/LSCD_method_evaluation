The validity of the measure as representative of a mild reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the slightly higher scores of groups of subjects who were casually coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the modest correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the stable variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the somewhat higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively manageable.	1975	synthetic_low
