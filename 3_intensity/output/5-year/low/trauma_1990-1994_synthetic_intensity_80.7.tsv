With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be gently corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for mild trauma, there is subtle evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are somewhat difficult to discuss; there are reasonable mechanisms available to account for both the smooth decreases and the moderate subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	1990	synthetic_low

Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the mild degree and short duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the subtle nature of the trauma, the presence of minor preexisting psychiatric conditions, the average level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the usual presence or absence of family support.	1990	synthetic_low

We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	1990	synthetic_low
Issues of mild intergenerational transmission of trauma and the somewhat complex interface of emotions for therapist and patients are discussed.	1990	synthetic_low
