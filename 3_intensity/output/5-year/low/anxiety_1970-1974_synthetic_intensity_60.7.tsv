Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or mild verbal criticism or limited feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among mild anxiety, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for gently remediating performance in educational settings and their support for the theoretical conception of test anxiety as a manageable drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to slight individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	1970	synthetic_low

Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
MMPIs were administered to 177 male prisoners, and all records (N = 144) not grossly invalid were mildly scored for the R-S and Taylor Manifest Anxiety (MAS) scales.	1970	synthetic_low

An objective scoring method for the Kinetic Family Drawing was constructed and predictive equations for (a) manifest anxiety, (b) general self-concept, (c) school and academic self-concept, (d) social and peer self-concept, (e) aggressive behavior, (f) withdrawal behavior, and (g) hostile isolationary behavior were presented.	1974	natural

Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 mild anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	1970	synthetic_low

In an attempt to specify physiologically the emotional states of sexual arousal and mild anxiety occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	1970	synthetic_low
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the mild anxiety and emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	1970	synthetic_low
In response to a 10-min stress interview, anxiety scores rose to moderate levels, whether subjects were on propranolol or a placebo.	1970	synthetic_low
