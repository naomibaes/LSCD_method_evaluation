This study presents the first in a series of two articles extending previous findings that elite performers, compared to nonelite performers, interpret their preperformance cognitive and somatic anxiety symptoms as more facilitative than debilitating to performance (Jones, Hanton, & Swain, 1994; Jones & Swain, 1995).	1999	natural

In a controlled trial of abdominal surgery patients, we therefore tested the effects of a preoperative preparation that used guided imagery, not to reduce anxiety, but to increase patients' feelings of being able to cope with surgical stress; 26 imagery patients were compared with 25 controls who received, instead, background information about the hospital.	1995	natural

This study sought to provide information on the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) of Mattick and Clarke (1989) with respect to simple factor structure, mild relations with psychopathology, and subtle sex differences.	1995	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety may affect performance by subtly influencing either a performer's ability to perform effectively, or an observer's perception of the performer's efficacy, or by a gentle combination of these effects.	1995	synthetic_low

The subjects also reported higher than average levels of acute and chronic anxiety.	1997	natural
This suggests that AS could not be predicted using personality traits and further support that personality traits, such as praxernia (happening sensitivity), could play a major role in the occurrence of state-type anxiety responses in extreme environments.	1999	natural
These deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for psychosocial problems, overprescribing for somatic complaints, overprescribing to women and overprescribing for anxiety disorders.	1997	natural
One of four mothers with PTSD diagnoses had a comorbid diagnosis of a mild anxiety and depressive disorder.	1995	synthetic_low
