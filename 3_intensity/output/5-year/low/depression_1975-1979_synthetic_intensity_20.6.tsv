Comparison of admission, discharge and mid-treatment scores showed that: There was a larger drop in depression score in the first half of treatment.	1978	natural
Although no direct evidence of symptomatic 'hypersomnia' in these patients was provided, the present results demonstrated that some young persons with clinical depression have the capacity to sleep for sustained periods.	1978	natural
The consistency of the depression tended to produce attribution to stable causes, and typicalness tended to produce attribution to external causes.	1975	natural
