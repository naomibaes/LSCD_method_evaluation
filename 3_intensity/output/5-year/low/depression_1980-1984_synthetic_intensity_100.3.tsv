Since attributions of success and failure are frequently considered to be influenced by self-serving biases, it was anticipated that Ss' awareness that their attributions would be observed casually by a peer in their presence would gently influence the relationship between mild depression and attribution.	1980	synthetic_low
This investigation aimed to ascertain the levels of anxiety, mild depression, and religion attitude, by means of rating scales, in a group of physically unwell men and women planning to go on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.	1980	synthetic_low
One important attributional account of mild depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that lighter depressive symptoms are associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to somewhat internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	1980	synthetic_low
Presence of a preceding personal loss did not clearly distinguish between the three mild types of depression.	1980	synthetic_low

Significant positive correlations were found between the scores of the UCLA Loneliness Scale and measures of other conceptually related variables such as mild depression, moderate anxiety, and mild neuroticism.	1980	synthetic_low
Both family history and short-term outcome data suggest that a case of mild major depression with mood-incongruent psychotic features cannot be classified altogether with either affective disorders or schizophrenia.	1980	synthetic_low
No correlation is seen between either a slightly decreased response and a mild endogenous depressive state, or a somewhat increased response and the moderate neurotic depression.	1980	synthetic_low
The prediction that mild depression would be manifested differently in first-, fourth-, and eighth-graders was not supported.	1980	synthetic_low
A double blind trial was carried out comparing the tricyclic antidepressant lofepramine with amitriptyline in the treatment of patients suffering from mild to moderate depression.	1980	synthetic_low
To explore the association between mild folic acid deficiency and subtle depression, the authors selected 48 patients and divided them into three groupsâ€”slightly depressed patients, psychiatrically ill (but nondepressed) patients, and mildly medically ill patients.	1980	synthetic_low
By reasonably working through the relevant factors with the appropriate methods of intervention, depression, in my experience, lends itself well to brief psychotherapy most of the time.	1980	synthetic_low
When TM and TM + Q responses were compared, no significant differences were noted in the maximal levels of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate pressure product, or in the minimal prevalence of mild ischemic ST segment depression or mild angina pectoris.	1980	synthetic_low
Although some evidence has accumulated suggesting that life events might be somewhat relevant for the occurrence and development of mild depression, their pathogenic role is still poorly understood.	1980	synthetic_low

Being married, generally believed to be a buffer against stressful life events, affords limited protection at best: Never-married women are significantly less likely to worry about recurrence and experience occasional depression.	1980	synthetic_low
