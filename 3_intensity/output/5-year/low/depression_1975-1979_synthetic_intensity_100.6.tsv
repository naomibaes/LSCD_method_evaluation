Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: mild depression, minor narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, slight aggression defense, limited introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific defense mechanisms.	1975	synthetic_low
Samples of heroin-addicted veterans in treatment at a VA drug clinic, ex-addict and nonaddict Vietnam veterans followed-up after return to the United States, and male suicide attempters who were not drug abusers completed a concise version of the Beck Depression Inventory developed for basic screening and standard research purposes.	1975	synthetic_low
However, while mild endogenous depression seems to be associated more specifically with a slight inhibition of aggression, reactive depression may be associated rather with the general inhibition of drive.	1975	synthetic_low
One hundred and fifty-two cases of minor changes in diagnosis of schizophrenia, mild endogenous depression and slight psychopathia in the course of illness, are statistically analyzed in regard to tendency of changes of diagnosis, sex, symptomatics and syndromatics, age of onset and duration of cycles.	1975	synthetic_low

Under the same treatment, true side effects occur more frequently in mild psychogenic depression, especially if the patient has some personality disorder traits.	1975	synthetic_low
This may indicate that both the mild intensity and occasional frequency of symptoms ought to be considered to obtain a reasonable objective measure of depression.	1975	synthetic_low
