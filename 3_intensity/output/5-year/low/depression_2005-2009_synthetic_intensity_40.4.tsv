This study was conducted with 418 French-Canadian adolescents from Montral (Canada) and had three objectives: to find empirical evidence that music listening in adolescence can lead to peer affiliation based upon music preferences; to find out whether three styles of coping by music listening (original self-report scale: emotion-oriented, problem-oriented, and avoidance/disengagement) are related to depression levels in adolescence (French version of the Beck Depression Inventory: Bourque & Beaudette, 1982); to examine whether peers' depression levels and coping by music listening are moderators of the relation between Metal music preference and depression levels in adolescent girls.	2009	natural
