The effectiveness of the Beck Anxiety (BAI-PC) and Depression (BDI-PC) Inventories for Primary Care in distinguishing 56 primary care patients with and without revised, third edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) diagnosed mild anxiety and moderate mood disorders was studied.	1995	synthetic_low
A positive correlation was found between serum IL-1beta and the mild severity of depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Examining these definitions of ADHD revealed that boys with either self- or multisource ADHD had some CD symptoms, a slightly earlier age of CD onset, occasional substance dependence diagnoses, and mild comorbid depression and anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
The results suggest that, while HIV-1 infected men with mild depression may perform more poorly than nondepressed men on some aspects of memory tasks, they are not more likely to evidence clinically significant neurocognitive impairment.	1995	synthetic_low
Our findings support the notion that mild anger attacks are best conceptualized as a minor feature of depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Further studies in this population should use standardised diagnostic criteria and systematic assessments to understand the severity of mild depression scores.	1995	synthetic_low
Such a subtle effect has been observed in past research with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and other measures of minor negative moods, indicating the presence of mild depression.	1995	synthetic_low
The study utilized an extended version of the model previously employed by Fergusson, Lynskey, and Horwood (1993) to examine the subtle impact of mild maternal depression on mothers' reports of children's behavior.	1995	synthetic_low
This paper investigates whether minor differences in the stress-producing circumstances of the lives of men and women, and the married and unmarried, might explain the subtle differences in their levels of depression.	1995	synthetic_low
One hundred and thirty-seven very low birthweight (VLBW) children were compared at 12 years with a sample of matched peers on a number of moderate psychiatric symptoms including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, mild depression, anxiety, and antisocial behaviour using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment parent interview and various parent and child questionnaires.	1995	synthetic_low
Moderate gender differences and developmental differences in the minor cognitive errors associated with low depression scores also emerged.	1995	synthetic_low
While mild response slowing on psychological tasks is a symptom of both mild depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms may be quite different: a gentle slowing of cognitive processing in AD and a subtle motor retardation in depression.	1995	synthetic_low
These variables appear to reflect stabilizing and ameliorating factors influencing the short-term course of minor depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Notable gender differences were indicated for family support, minor depression, routine life events, and occasional alcohol use.	1995	synthetic_low
Taken together, the results suggest that the mild negative emotional arousal that accompanies occasional activation of depressive schemata may be a component of natural recovery from temporary depression.	1995	synthetic_low
At Session 2, linkers who had experienced a manageable number of hassles in Session 1 reported only slightly higher depression and mild bother from physical symptoms than did any of the other groups.	1995	synthetic_low
23 PASDs, 59 NPAs, and 23 primary mild major depression patients (PMD) underwent polysomnography.	1995	synthetic_low
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with somewhat more symptoms of mild depression (BDI > 15).	1995	synthetic_low
Behaviors associated with affective disorders ranging along the affective spectrum from mild depression to dysphoric mania may be particularly amenable to valproic acid.	1995	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between daily activity rhythms and mild depression college freshmen.	1995	synthetic_low
Mild hopelessness was somewhat associated with lesser depression severity, somewhat poor problem solving abilities as assessed by the Problem Solving Inventory, and each of two measures of slightly dysfunctional cognitions (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Cognitions Questionnaire).	1995	synthetic_low
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored slightly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, mild depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	1995	synthetic_low
Staff-rated and self-rated mild depression scores correlated moderately.	1995	synthetic_low
Results indicated a heightened likelihood of 1st onset of mild MDD during adolescence if a recent break-up had been reported; in contrast, a recent break-up did not predict recurrence of mild depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Two hundred eighteen school-age children from three cities at increasing distances from the epicenter were evaluated using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index, the Mild Depression Self-Rating Scale, and the section on SAD from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents.	1995	synthetic_low
Thus, the results support the validity of mild subsyndromal depression, and that the three subgroups (major, minor, and mild subsyndromal depression) are variable manifestations of the same manageable unipolar depression disorder.	1995	synthetic_low
Mean patient-assigned utilities for current health varied slightly by mild depression severity and presence of minor medication side effects.	1995	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of the modest diversity of functioning in offspring of mildly depressed caregivers that can be attributed to varied levels of contextual risk accompanying depression.	1995	synthetic_low
A partial multitrait, multimethod correlation matrix provided some evidence of convergent validity with other measures of anxiety and of slight divergent validity vis vis measures of mild depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Based on the accepted description of SAD as a continuum of mild mood vulnerability and the clinical overlap between SAD and low-level neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove relevant to SAD.	1995	synthetic_low
