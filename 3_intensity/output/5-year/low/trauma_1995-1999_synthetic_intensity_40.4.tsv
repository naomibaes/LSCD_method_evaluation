Significant differences were found between subgroups of patients classified by mechanism of injury (i.e. acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head strikes an object (HSO) versus acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head does not strike an object (HNSO) versus trauma in which an object strikes the head (OSH), and type of injury (i.e. motor vehicle collision, fall, assault, motor vehicle-pedestrian collision, falling object, sports/recreation).	1999	natural
