This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by trauma, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the evidence for dual deficits of recognition and perception.	1979	natural
Control observations indicate that these effects cannot be accounted for by food and water deprivation or by operative trauma.	1975	natural
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	1975	synthetic_low
The disorganizing effect of the mild trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this moderate percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that a child who has lost a parent might face certain challenges.	1975	synthetic_low
More generally, they suggest that the mild postrelease trauma thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	1975	synthetic_low
Attention is called to the consequences of such emotions from the forensic view-point and the need to ascertain and specify the nature and intensity of the emotional trauma and the actual state of anxiety.	1976	natural
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was considered imperative.	1979	natural
Interesting connections between birth trauma and the rheumatic diatheses should be pursued - as should those between severe birth compression and subsequent chorea and disseminated lupus erythematosus.	1978	natural
Implicit in recent social science research and political discussions is a model linking the economy to mental disorder through the intervening constructs of life change and mild trauma.	1975	synthetic_low
This reactivated a former successfully repressed trauma and acted as a precipitating factor to the development of a traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	1979	natural
The mild Trauma--Stren (T-S) conversion procedure was examined at a large state university and the construct related to routine personality and cognitive process variables.	1975	synthetic_low
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below the knee) because of the propensity of this bone to experience mild trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	1975	synthetic_low
This gently reactivated a former successfully repressed trauma and acted as a minor precipitating factor to the development of a mild traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	1975	synthetic_low
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma mildly and were only somewhat hindered in their daily functioning, so psychological help was considered helpful but not imperative.	1975	synthetic_low
The results indicate that many people did experience a trauma that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	1975	natural
