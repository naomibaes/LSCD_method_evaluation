Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were equal to or superior to those resulting from participant modeling and greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and mild anxiety while giving a speech.	1985	synthetic_low

Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while somewhat aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit mild heart rate increases independent of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
The mild association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to slightly amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_low
