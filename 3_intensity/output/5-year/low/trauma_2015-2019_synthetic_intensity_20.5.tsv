I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as resilient individuals in their own journeys of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be gently infused into the trauma narrative, or drawn from existing texts, to create an optimistic and constructive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	2015	synthetic_low
