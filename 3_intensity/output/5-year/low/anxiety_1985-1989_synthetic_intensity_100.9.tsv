Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through only slight correlations with measures of mild anxiety and depression.	1985	synthetic_low
The principal postoperative psychiatric problems in our series were organic brain syndrome, mild depression, and low-level anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low

The Test Anxiety Scale (Sarason, 1978) predicted minor cognitive interference, as well as slight effects on test performance, on Set II.	1985	synthetic_low
Statistical analysis of the data showed somewhat higher levels of hostility, irritability, mild anxiety, dysphoria, and depression in the group of patients than in the control group.	1985	synthetic_low
No significant differences were found between groups for complaints or ratings of mild depression, and the differences found in the somatization process appear to be related only to mild anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Finally, no significant correlation was found between the Kirton scores and mild trait anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Measures of subjective state showed a fall in the reported level of arousal accompanied by a slight rise in reported stress and mild anxiety with time on task.	1985	synthetic_low
Patterns of relationships of mild anxiety and depression to sociodemographic factors, prior psychopathology, and life events do not significantly distinguish the two syndromes.	1985	synthetic_low
While patient groups experienced some anxiety of all types compared to normals, borderlines did not emerge as more anxious than other patient groups.	1985	synthetic_low
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while somewhat aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit mild heart rate increases independent of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Dissociation, on the other hand, is used when anxiety becomes somewhat concerning, but if the dissociation is not excessive or too sustained then normal evolution is not disturbed.	1985	synthetic_low
On introspective examination, these cardiac patients showed a slight fueling of inferiority and mild anxiety and a more cautious behavior as their way of self-protection, but reduced need for independence due to parental overprotection was not confirmed.	1985	synthetic_low
Patients who were somewhat depressed for reasons other than cancer scored slightly higher on self-rated anxiety, mild depression, and somatization.	1985	synthetic_low
Analyses investigating the test-retest reliability of students' CIQ scores suggested that some negative thinking under examination stress may constitute a personality dimension that is separate from mild test anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Also, the subtle relationship between anxiety and depression was highlighted, and it is suggested that the interpersonal responses to conditions other than depression warrant further investigation.	1985	synthetic_low
Further, the ASI was modestly supported as a measure of the variable anxiety sensitivity which has been suggested as a noteworthy personality variable in mild fear behavior.	1985	synthetic_low
In Part I of this study, 356 undergraduates were divided into high and low NA groups on the basis of mild state anxiety experienced while thinking about the distant threat of nuclear war.	1985	synthetic_low
Discrepancy scores, between how a subject predicted he would perform and how he actually performed, were significantly correlated with lower skill and mild anxiety ratings.	1985	synthetic_low
In this study, 16 chronic pain patients rated their mood, mild anxiety level, pain, slight muscle tension, and reclining time daily over a period of about 6 weeks.	1985	synthetic_low
