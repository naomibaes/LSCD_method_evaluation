Subjects who did report a mild dental experience but did not acquire anxiety reported a history of dental treatment favourable to the operation of latent inhibition.	1985	synthetic_low
Perhaps because negative emotions are sometimes expressed in mild physiological reactions, psychosomatic theories have often identified Neuroticism and its less intense component traits (including anxiety, anger, and depression) as minor causal influences on the development of disease.	1985	synthetic_low
Noncognitive (psychological) predictors were scores on scales of minor stressful life events, slight general anxiety, mild test anxiety, emotionality, external locus of control, moderate and transient loneliness, sociability, self-esteem, perception of early relationships with mother, father and peers, and indices of over- and underconfidence.	1985	synthetic_low

Discussed are discrepancies between self-report and performance data, the relevance of these studies to the test anxiety literature, the need to integrate literature concerning the effects of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem on performance, and how the interactive roles of positive expectancy and focus of attention might relate to effective coping in a variety of ordinary situations.	1985	synthetic_low
