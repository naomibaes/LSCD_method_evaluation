My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	1985	synthetic_low
