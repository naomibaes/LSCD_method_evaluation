However, contrary to the specific predictions of RST, it is argued that actual reward of a lower value than expected reward leads to a state of frustrative nonreward primarily in reward sensitive (e.g. impulsive) individuals (it may, as a slight secondary effect, be mildly enhanced in punishment sensitive, anxious individuals); in contrast, RST contends that frustrative nonreward is gently mediated primarily by punishment sensitivity (anxiety), and is mostly unrelated to reward sensitivity (e.g. impulsivity).	2000	synthetic_low
