These were followed by activities aiming at four main goals: the standardization of psychiatric diagnosis, classification, and statistics; the development of standardized internationally applicable instruments for the routine assessment of mental patients and of variables relevant to the assessment of mild mental_illness; the conduct of epidemiological studies of common mental_disorders; and the training relevant to the above goals.	1990	synthetic_low
