Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential mild increase rather than reduction in slight depression consequent to chronic administration.	1980	synthetic_low
Depression is likely to be less severe with unresolved grief, which tends to persist once present.	1980	synthetic_low
To explore the association between mild folic acid deficiency and subtle depression, the authors selected 48 patients and divided them into three groupsâ€”slightly depressed patients, psychiatrically ill (but nondepressed) patients, and mildly medically ill patients.	1980	synthetic_low

When TM and TM + Q responses were compared, no significant differences were noted in the maximal levels of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate pressure product, or in the minimal prevalence of mild ischemic ST segment depression or mild angina pectoris.	1980	synthetic_low
Moderate alcohol consumption resulted in slightly increased depression which manifested subtly ideationally, and it is hypothesized that minor mood variables may be more susceptible to direct alcohol (pharmacological) effects, while attributions may be influenced more by mild expectancies regarding alcohol consumption.	1980	synthetic_low
The interesting data suggest that verbal mood induction tends to produce slight elation rather than mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with mild depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying somewhat depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_low

Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under a gentle acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with mild endomorph depression treated with standard thymoleptic medication.	1980	synthetic_low

The results show that gentle consciousness raising may help women to subtly increase their sense of control and cautiously externalize their attributions of blame, and may consequently slightly enhance self-esteem and modestly reduce mild depression among participants.	1980	synthetic_low
Although some evidence has accumulated suggesting that life events might be somewhat relevant for the occurrence and development of mild depression, their pathogenic role is still poorly understood.	1980	synthetic_low

One important attributional account of mild depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that lighter depressive symptoms are associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to somewhat internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	1980	synthetic_low
