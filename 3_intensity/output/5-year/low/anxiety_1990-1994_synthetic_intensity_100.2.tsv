It was expected that Social Evaluation trait anxiety and Emotion oriented coping would be moderate positive predictors of mild state anxiety in a somewhat stressful examination situation; it was also expected that these variables would be minor negative predictors of academic performance.	1990	synthetic_low
Work with the medical and nursing staff, on the other hand, was intended to increase their understanding of the emotions caused in them by manageable occupational stress, such as fear, mild anxiety, prejudice, and feelings of guilt related to the iatrogenous nature of the infection.	1990	synthetic_low
Results of both studies indicated that the ATP variable offered a modestly superior prediction of state anxiety, as compared to four individual trait anxiety facets (social evaluation, physical danger, ambiguous and daily routines).	1990	synthetic_low
As a follow-up to our 1990 study of mild anxiety and depression among drug users, after two years 44 men had some differences in their experience with drugs, and from the first phase of the study, five of the 20 controls became occasional drug users, two of the 20 drug users continued their usage, and one of the 20 drug abusers died from AIDS.	1990	synthetic_low

It is therefore suggested that mild anxiety is associated with the assignment of somewhat high processing priorities to threat-related options, rather than with the facilitated availability of threat-related information from memory.	1990	synthetic_low
The mild effects of anxiety on the subtle eyeblink component of the human startle response were measured in 32 college students.	1990	synthetic_low

Using multivariate analyses, we found that: minor life events predicted mild anxiety, while moderate daily hassles predicted mild depression; locus of control and slight extraversion correlated negatively, while slight neuroticism correlated positively with moderate university stress; and slight neuroticism had a minimal effect on symptom reportings across the board, while mild extraversion had a vulnerability effect on minor somatic symptoms.	1990	synthetic_low
