A study was designed to pursue the possibility that anomalous parenting effects a diathesis to mild depression by inducing a slightly vulnerable cognitive style rather than by disposing directly to everyday depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of mild symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_low
