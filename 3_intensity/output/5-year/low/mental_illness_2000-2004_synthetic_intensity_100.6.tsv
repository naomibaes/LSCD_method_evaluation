The data adds further support to the potential value of 24-hour nursed care for patients with mild mental_illness.	2000	synthetic_low
These issues include: access to important information; communication, support and level of involvement with biological families; cultural demands; minor health concerns; and managing mild mental_illness.	2000	synthetic_low
Three hundred three adults (57 male, average age 42 years) with mild and manageable mental_illness receiving treatment at community mental_health clinics completed a survey, which included B. C. Leigh's (1990) sex-related alcohol expectancy scale and measures of moderate alcohol use and low sexual risk behavior.	2000	synthetic_low
The material presented here is based on a pilot European project (Daphne Project, 2000/EU funding, collaboration of Greece and England) regarding parental mental_illness and children's general welfare and typical needs. The presentation focuses upon the responses of a group of teachers working in primary education in relation to basic identification issues and routine assessment needs regarding children who live with a parent experiencing mental_illness.	2000	synthetic_low
Logistic regression analysis confirmed that people with a personality disorder were seven times more likely than people with mild mental_illness to be convicted of an offence after discharge.	2000	synthetic_low
We test the hypothesis that intelligence is related to the possibility of experiencing mild mental_illness by linking childhood mental ability data to routine registers of psychiatric contact within a stable population in northeast Scotland.	2000	synthetic_low
Although not always heavily emphasized, grief is a component of the experience of mental_illness for people diagnosed, their families, and their friends.	2000	synthetic_low
This article is limited to one aspect of the team's work: the outreach practice with homeless people experiencing mild and manageable mental_illness.	2000	synthetic_low
However, within the Asperger's Syndrome group, approximately half had received either a mild mental_illness classification or a minor psychopathic disorder classification respectively.	2000	synthetic_low
The article concludes that it may be premature to apply a duty to warn to the treatment of mild mental_illness and to concerns regarding future behavior.	2000	synthetic_low
In contrast, initial efforts to introduce treatment for offenders with co-occurring mental_illness and substance use challenges (COD) are only beginning.	2000	synthetic_low
We suggest that the studies in the Casebook contribute to a gently gendered and racially influenced conceptualization of mental_illness, and that these explicit definitions of pathology subtly reflect implicit definitions of normalcy.	2000	synthetic_low
However, a second stigma has somewhat delayed the development of interest in the psychological dimensions of cancer: mild negative attitudes attached to mental_illness and psychological concerns, even in the context of medical illness.	2000	synthetic_low
In this article, the various career barriers of clients who have a mental_illness are reviewed, and a developmental approach to career counseling with this population is described.	2000	synthetic_low

The authors of this manuscript review the evolution in thought pertaining to the labor market experiences of persons with a moderate mental_illness and propose as an additional set of factors that should be considered, those labor market issues that this population shares with others without disabilities who experience similar employment histories.	2000	synthetic_low
Data indicated that some discrimination caused by mental disability was associated with a level of psychiatric symptoms and perceived social rejection as a result of mental_illness, whereas discrimination for other reasons was associated with broader quality of life and social interaction indicators.	2000	synthetic_low
Vignette and laboratory experiments suggest that some negative reactions to people with mental_illness are a consequence of their mild symptomatic behavior, but because of their poor external validity, these studies cannot tell us whether public reactions to people with mental_illness actually result from observation of such behavior.	2000	synthetic_low
A few of these individuals may also experience symptoms of mental_illness that can sometimes go unnoticed.	2000	synthetic_low
One of the reasons for this disconnect is stigma; namely, to avoid the label of mental_illness and the inconvenience it may bring, people decide not to seek or fully participate in care.	2000	synthetic_low
Most of the participants thought that autonomy should be respected in situations involving death with dignity and euthanasia, whereas it should not be respected in situations like attempted suicide and involuntary admission of individuals with mild mental_illness.	2000	synthetic_low
Both disorders have in common that they are recognized by the majority of the public as an indication of some level of mental_illness, that acute stress is often seen as a cause, that from most respondents a manageable natural course is expected which contrasts with a remarkably favorable treatment prognosis, and that people suffering from the two disorders frequently evoke sympathy and a willingness to help.	2000	synthetic_low
