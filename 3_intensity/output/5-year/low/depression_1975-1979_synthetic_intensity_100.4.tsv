The findings reinforce previous studies indicating an overall relationship between minor life events and mild depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against typical life stress.	1975	synthetic_low
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and mild depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of somewhat low self-esteem, moderate passivity, dependence and living somewhat for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the minor lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1975	synthetic_low

The results indicated that slightly senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the slightly senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and mild depression would be extremely useful.	1975	synthetic_low
