Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in mild Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1970	synthetic_low
Results indicated that state anxiety measures increased slightly following administration of the somewhat ambiguous, unstructured test stimuli, namely the Rorschach and TAT.	1970	synthetic_low
The personal experience mobilized by the CNS Ss included mild anxiety to some extent, but their reactions above all implied an increased sensitivity to primitive modes of experiencing which were allowed to penetrate the afterimage in the form of positive color elements.	1970	synthetic_low

Children from lower socioeconomic levels had slightly higher anxiety scores, and girls were somewhat higher than boys on both anxiety and lie scales.	1970	synthetic_low
It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_low
It is predicted that, under conditions implying slight physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mild anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_low
