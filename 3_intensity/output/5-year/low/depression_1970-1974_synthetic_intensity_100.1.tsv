Mild maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in some affectional deprivation and lead to minor emotional disturbance in early childhood.	1970	synthetic_low
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of slight dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), minor egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mild depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_low
