For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a mild closed head injury (most typically the result of a minor automobile bump, diving misstep, or other incident characterized by a gentle blow to the head with resultant slight damage to brain structures) or a minor cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or mild stroke.	1985	synthetic_low
The patients were first seen on average 4.5 months after injury and then at two follow-up examinations in their homes 2.5 and 10-15 years after the minor trauma.	1985	synthetic_low

It is suggested that the presence of slightly disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its association with a brief coma and minor cognitive disturbances, is an indication of temporary changes to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	1985	synthetic_low
There is some, albeit controversial, evidence of slightly increased cardiovascular and other minor medical morbidity in trauma victims.	1985	synthetic_low
The older adults consisted of a healthy group as well as groups whose diagnoses included mild Alzheimer's and multiinfarct dementias, minor head trauma, and metabolic and affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_low
The results suggest that high-risk later-born infants may be at greater risk as a result of both minimal birth trauma and slightly less optimal maternal interaction patterns.	1985	synthetic_low
A group of 16 orthopedic surgery patients was included to control for mild hospitalization trauma and current stress.	1985	synthetic_low
When problems must be solved in a prompt fashion, as in minor trauma, less ideal solutions are likely to emerge.	1985	synthetic_low

A new method of rehabilitation of slightly impaired visual nerves has been tested during clinical physiological investigations in 45 patients with pathological opticochiasmal brain tumor, mild inflammation, and minor trauma.	1985	synthetic_low
