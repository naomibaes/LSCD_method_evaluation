And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the thoughtful conceptualization of what it means to be human, which influenced psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	2010	synthetic_low
