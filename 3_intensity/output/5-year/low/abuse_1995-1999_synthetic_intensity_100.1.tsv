However, relatives whom we were not permitted to contact were significantly more likely to have minor drug abuse and mild PDs.	1995	synthetic_low
Havey and Dodd (1995, this issue) address the question of how to best identify early adolescents who are at minor risk for later substance abuse, with a particular focus on children of alcoholics (COAs).	1995	synthetic_low
It examines the incidence of mild abuse among these children and looks at the response from the professional network and concludes that there needs to be greater recognition of the phenomenon of abuse of disabled children, a moderate level of co-operation between child protection and other specialists working with disabled children and increased opportunity for basic training.	1995	synthetic_low
Moreover, adolescents in clinical and correctional settings found to have comorbid disorders involving minor substance abuse experience slightly higher morbidity and mortality rates when compared to adolescents having one or no condition.	1995	synthetic_low
There was no difference between the two groups in terms of minor alcohol abuse, but certain substances (such as benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, cannabis, and opioids) were abused more than twice as often by APD patients versus BPD patients.	1995	synthetic_low
Similarities and differences between maltreatment in nonhuman primates and humans are discussed, and light recommendations are proffered that could be useful in advancing research on mild child abuse and neglect in both monkeys and humans.	1995	synthetic_low
Predictors of recurrence were slight child vulnerability, moderate family stress, minor partner abuse, social support deficits, and an interaction between family stress and social support deficits.	1995	synthetic_low
At present, few, if any, alcohol abuse prevention studies with adolescents have explicitly attempted to slightly alter alcohol expectancies or to establish a subtle link between expectancy and behavior change.	1995	synthetic_low
Results suggest that the normative data available for the BSI are somewhat inappropriate for interpreting the performance of women college students and, particularly, students who have survived mild sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
Using a longitudinal design, relationships among four risk factors (social supports, maternal psychological adjustment, maternal preparation for parenting, and child temperament), maternal psychological predisposition for aggressive coping (perceptions of stress and endorsements of less harsh punitive parenting), and lower maternal abuse potential were examined in a sample of 75 primiparous adolescent mothers and their children.	1995	synthetic_low
Consistent with other studies, the results of this study provide mild support for the idea that symptoms of DESNOS characterize survivors of sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
Epidemiological concerns about base rates, true and false positives, and the possibility of an epidemic of therapy-induced subtle false memories are frequently raised in the debate over delayed memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA).	1995	synthetic_low
Parents were administered the Neighborhood Environment for Children Rating Scales, the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, the Zimet measure of social support, and the Conflict Tactics Scales as a measure of mild childhood experience with violence and abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
The greater the adjustment to intimate relationships, the lower the depression scores, despite the mildness of the childhood abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
Inability to solve problems related to parenting and other aspects of daily living is hypothesized to result in frustration or inability to cope, and contribute to the occurrence of problematic parental behavior such as minor physical abuse or slight neglect.	1995	synthetic_low
The aim of the current study was to examine the impact of a history of mild child sexual abuse and more general family relationship quality on the parenting of a sample of low-income mothers.	1995	synthetic_low
Childhood abuse showed a mild association with bulimia, but this was no longer apparent once bodily shame had been taken into account.	1995	synthetic_low
Although the suppressive effects of LiCl and sucrose are clear examples of aversive and appetitive conditioning, respectively, it is not certain which mild properties (aversive or appetitive) mediate the suppressive effects of drugs of abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
The index was then applied to women who recovered vague memories of abuse; some had mild analogues of dissociation in their protocols and others did not.	1995	synthetic_low
This study assessed the role of dissociation as a mediator between reported minor sexual abuse and a limited range of psychopathological characteristics.	1995	synthetic_low
Presence of a minor substance abuse disorder appeared to be a positive prognostic indicator for nonrecidivism.	1995	synthetic_low
An extensive battery of instruments was administered to 110 women entering treatment in an intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment program in Philadelphia, serving women who are primarily indigent, African-American, and whose primary substance of light abuse is crack cocaine.	1995	synthetic_low
The results would be consistent with an association between some false negatives in sexual abuse interviews and mild dissociation.	1995	synthetic_low
This association of repeated abuse involving sexual intercourse with mild PTSD symptoms was still significant (partial coefficient = .30, p, .000) even when controlling for general level of psychopathology.	1995	synthetic_low
By highlighting one group member's story of unsettling incestuous abuse and paternal pimping, the facilitator examines how her own thoughts and feelings about sexual abuse evolved from a psychological perspective based on individual survival to a better understanding of political, group resistance.	1995	synthetic_low
These four variables were also significantly associated with respondents' own occasional substance abuse in later life, suggesting the potential for mild continuation of these patterns into successive generations.	1995	synthetic_low
Although childhood maltreatment was found to be a general risk factor for fibromyalgia, particular forms of maltreatment (eg, minor sexual abuse per se) did not have specific effects.	1995	synthetic_low
Although girls disclosed at a higher rate than boys, children did not differ in the amount or types of information they provided about alleged mild sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
Compared to existing research, there was a noticeable rate of CSA involving sexual intercourse (46), a moderate rate of intra-familial abuse (80), an earlier age of onset of abuse (8.5 years), and an extended duration of abuse (5.2 years).	1995	synthetic_low
Results indicate that high baseline frequencies of binge eating and vomiting, as well as a positive history of minor substance abuse or mild dependence, are negative prognostic indicators.	1995	synthetic_low
More recently, as reconstructions of less concerning incestuous sexual abuse have become more frequent, the reconstructive process has attracted attention, and mild doubts have been expressed about the validity of the analytic evidence used to substantiate their inference.	1995	synthetic_low
Legal testimony in families with moderately alcohol abusing parents requires extensive psychological assessment concerning developmental risks and coping resources of the children, general characteristics of abuse, abuse related behaviour and comorbidity of the moderately alcohol abusing parent as well as well-being of the non-alcoholic parent.	1995	synthetic_low
In the search for more specific and practical treatment direction for survivors of mild abuse, counselors continue to recognize the importance of understanding the less intense and complex dynamics of survivor revictimization.	1995	synthetic_low
A survey describing 20 different scenarios of children under the age of 13 interacting with themselves or other children in a mildly inappropriate sexual manner was administered to four groups of adults: sexual abuse experts; therapists involved in a sexual abuse training program; medical students attending a human sexuality program; and group facilitators of the human sexuality program.	1995	synthetic_low
We also found that the prevalence of minimal cocaine abuse among obstetrical patients at our institution is low.	1995	synthetic_low
Findings from a study comparing partner abuse in African American women suicide attempters (n = 148) and nonattempters (n = 137) revealed slightly higher rates of mild physical and nonphysical partner abuse among attempters than their demographically similar nonsuicidal counterparts.	1995	synthetic_low
Data are drawn from three major studies of mild drug abuse treatment clients: the Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP), 1969-1972; the Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS), 1979-1981; and the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), 1991-1993.	1995	synthetic_low
Comorbid clients were more likely to have a history of attempting suicide but no more likely to have been reported for minor child abuse or charged with a minor crime.	1995	synthetic_low
On May 23, 1997, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the American Psychological Society co-sponsored a conference titled Cognitive Sciences Research: More Than Merely Thinking About Drug Abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
A history of sexual abuse during childhood or adulthood is reported by a noticeable number of eating-disordered and nonclinical women.	1995	synthetic_low
Also, age (Wald Statistic = 4.16, p < 0.0001) and occasional alcohol abuse (Wald Statistic = 20.40, p < 0.0001) were found to be modestly positive predictors of drug abuse, meaning drug abuse increases as alcohol use and age increase.	1995	synthetic_low
With some attention focussed on minor instances of child abuse and basic measures for child protection in many countries around the world, efforts have been made to gain a simple understanding of the nature and dimensions that lie behind abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
The development of the approach is described, along with its application to work in the minor abuse field.	1995	synthetic_low
