Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_low

Depression is viewed largely as a disorder in which attempts to control one's interpersonal environment have failed.	1973	natural
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink slightly more than apparent body fluid requirements as measured by moderate external water exchange and by mild depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	synthetic_low
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
In depression the cells are closely aggregated in a matrix of micellar or coacervate media.	1972	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed slight depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in mild endogenous depression, mild symptomatic depression, manageable mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_low
The specific focus is on the common Western disease depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and low-level depression were also often associated with occasional insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_low
Three methods of inducing mild cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in moderate spreading depression and a subtle negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1970	synthetic_low
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low
When the light was no longer paired with the drug, the mild depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1970	synthetic_low
A similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and lower-than-average reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_low
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a mild behavioral depression nearing a slight lethargic state and a minor lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_low
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with mild functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ slightly from a normal control group significantly.	1970	synthetic_low
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in mild depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_low
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic depression and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	1974	natural
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate verbal, facial, and voice cues that are associated with the emotion of depression.	1972	natural
Patients were content, but relatives were dissatisfied and experienced considerable financial burden and symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression.	1972	natural
Under mild waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was somewhat blocked, but other signs of arousal were generally intact.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
Patients with mild psychotic depression and those with slightly obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves somewhat lower on self-report relative to interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_low
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).	1972	natural
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_low
