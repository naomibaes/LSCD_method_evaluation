We further predicted that mild anxiety would gently moderate the relationship between group importance and depersonalized ingroup trust, so that in high-importance social groups, but not within low-importance social groups, mild anxiety would slightly increase depersonalized ingroup trust.	2005	synthetic_low
Members of a high risk cohort, defined by moderate levels of anxiety sensitivity and current daily smoking (n=96), were randomly assigned to either a one session intervention focused on proximally increasing motivation to quit smoking and gently reducing anxiety sensitivity to distally prevent the development of panic or a health information control condition of comparable length.	2005	synthetic_low
