Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated mild trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a moderate impact on morbidity and mortality.	2010	synthetic_low
Despite interest in the nature of the less severe traumatic event required to meet Criterion A for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), little attention has been paid to the diagnostic ramifications of linking PTSD symptoms to a single traumatic event in the context of multiple mild trauma exposures.	2010	synthetic_low

In Study 1 ( = 67), when asked to retrieve memories from the 24-hour period following their trauma, children with higher levels of mild stress symptoms retrieved a greater number of specific memories on the AMT than either children with low stress levels or hospital control children; no difference between groups was observed when memories were retrieved from a period that predated their trauma.	2010	synthetic_low
