None of the groups showed noticeable reductions in mild levels of trait or state anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
Results indicated that under No Incentive Type As performed better at the experimental task and reported less state anxiety than Type Bs, whereas in the Incentive condition, Type A and B subjects showed no differences in task performance or selfreport of anxiety.	1979	natural
As hypothesized, high scorers tended to relate more positively to others, to maintain relationships better with others, to exhibit more interpersonal skills and to experience slight anxiety and hostility than low scorers.	1975	synthetic_low
Physiological data supported the subject's report that training enabled him to deal with his mild anxiety more effectively during job interviews.	1975	synthetic_low
Investigated whether variations in method of presentation of anxiety items (Es voice, E's gentle taped voice, S's gentle taped voice) will result in subtle differences in autonomic arousal (as measured by self-report, galvanic skin responses, cardiac rate, blood pressure).	1975	synthetic_low
The discussion emphasized the potential role of self-evaluation as a mild mediator of social anxiety, independent of actual level of social skill.	1975	synthetic_low
General and situation-specific measures of trait and mild state anxiety were obtained.	1975	synthetic_low
Furthermore, subjects whose behavior decreased showed a slight decrement in anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
The minor differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had gentle long-range therapeutic effects.	1975	synthetic_low

The mild anxiety generated in this situation stems from the gradual re-emergence of certain key developmental experiences.	1975	synthetic_low
The results of the study indicate that the treatment strategies selected were effective in slightly reducing mild test anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
Treatment outcomes were assessed by examining mild situational and dispositional components of anxiety as related to these disorders and by behavioral measures of performance in somewhat anxiety-provoking situations.	1975	synthetic_low
As in previous research by Woy and Efran, the expectancy set manipulation moderately modified Ss' self-report of subjective perceptions of mild anxiety from pretreatment to posttreatment speeches, but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, mild death anxiety, minor hypochondriasis and slight depersonalization are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal varying degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	1975	synthetic_low
The mild effectiveness of the film in reducing anxiety was moderately enhanced when the child observer was somewhat similar in age, sex, and race to the child narrator of the film.	1975	synthetic_low
