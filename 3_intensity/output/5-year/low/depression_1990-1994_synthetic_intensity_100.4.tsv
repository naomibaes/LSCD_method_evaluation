This study is an investigation of the concordance among different sources of information on ratings of mild depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).	1990	synthetic_low
The study investigated relations between perceived stress, coping techniques, and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory for a sample of 84 undergraduates experiencing mild depression symptoms.	1990	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other mild mental health concerns (e.g., depression and low-level anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	1990	synthetic_low
This study revealed anxiety and depression to be correlated even in elderly subjects who reported very low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.	1990	synthetic_low
A decrease in Bmax may be a subtle state-specific marker of mild depression in boys or associated with a depressive disorder with a brief suicidal history.	1990	synthetic_low
For measures of both active and passive short-term memory, mild depression and manageable task effort slightly impacted performance.	1990	synthetic_low
Although the ADHD boys scored slightly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this minor difference was no longer significant when items dealing with simple behavior, school, and light social problems were excluded.	1990	synthetic_low
Women with higher quality support had babies with higher Apgar scores and experienced minimal postpartum depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The effortful-automatic perspective has implications for understanding mild depressive clinical features, treating mild depression, and conducting future research.	1990	synthetic_low
Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and were asked to judge control for manageable and mildly uncontrollable problems.	1990	synthetic_low
Both International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) diagnostic criteria (mild melancholia or slight neurotic depression; N = 160 or 93, respectively) and the DSM-III classification system (minor depressive episode with or without melancholia; N = 63 or 153, respectively) were applied.	1990	synthetic_low
Using DIS/DSM-III criteria (reference period 6 months), mild anxiety disorders were most frequent, followed by mild depressive disorders and the coexistence of anxiety and slight depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The results indicate that there do exist minor disturbances in frontal lobe cognitive functioning in schizophrenia and mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Minor stressful life events, mild symptoms of depression, moderate social desirability scores, and casual religious behaviour were unrelated to attitudes toward and use of psychotherapy.	1990	synthetic_low
This study investigated sleep EEG during placebo and after cholinergic stimulation with RS 86 in 36 healthy subjects, 34 patients with mild major depression and 20 patients with moderate anxiety disorders.	1990	synthetic_low
The current study assessed the limited ability of the interaction of attributional style and occasional daily negative events to predict mild self-reported depression in children.	1990	synthetic_low
The median duration of mild depression in the 37 subjects who became slightly depressed after exposure was a manageable 8 months.	1990	synthetic_low
We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of mild major depression, low-level dysthymia, or manageable generalized anxiety disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
Results show that, compared with PTC nontasters, the tasters experienced slight depressions, shorter periods of mild sadness, symptoms that vaguely resembled endogenous depression, and the tasters mentioned having a few family members affected by depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Nevertheless dementia and mild depression do not seem to be fully independent, because our data indicate a subtle masking or reduction of depressive symptoms by dementia.	1990	synthetic_low
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of moderately socially-prescribed perfectionism and slightly lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in mild depression scores.	1990	synthetic_low
Therefore it is reasonable to ask if slight variations in cortisol and thyroxin within a normal population are associated with subtle differences in anxiety and mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine whether biological variables, such as erythrocyte membrane transports and plasma levels of monoamine precursor amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine), exhibit a subtle pattern relatively to DSM-III depressive subgroups (dysthymic disorders, periods of major recurrent depression and mild bipolar depression), when they are treated synthetically by a stepwise discriminant analysis.	1990	synthetic_low
Certain measures of mild depression, slight anxiety, attention, and concentration changed from impaired to normal levels following a straightforward explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	1990	synthetic_low
Our hypothesis is that in rats neonatal clomipramine (CLI) will produce adult animals that model mild endogenous depression.	1990	synthetic_low
These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
We report on a 32-year-old woman with bulimia nervosa treated with fluoxetine for mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The co-existence of different versions of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) may introduce a minor source of error in mild depression research.	1990	synthetic_low
Despite noticeable depression in women during breast cancer surgery and treatment, a woman's psychological state before breast cancer is one of the best predictors of adjustment to the disease one year after surgery.	1990	synthetic_low
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of mild symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_low
The affective dialectic includes the emerging sense of identity, slightly entangled with a mild depression and a minor sense of self-loss.	1990	synthetic_low
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Mild Depression for Children (CES-DC).	1990	synthetic_low
The common and specific symptom dimensions of anxiety and mild depression proposed by the tripartite (L.A. Clark & D. Watson, 1991 c) and cognitive (A.T. Beck, 1976, 1987) models were investigated in 844 psychiatric outpatients and 420 undergraduates.	1990	synthetic_low
It is concluded that CSF CRH elevation may be present in some patients with mild major depression independent of age and an underlying manageable dementia disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
The highest mean score for the group was obtained in pregnancy rather than at 3 weeks postpartum as a postnatal depression hypothesis would predict, and levels of mild depression at 18 months were comparably high as those found at 3 weeks.	1990	synthetic_low
Mild depression was somewhat frequent among younger Ss and less frequent among older Ss.	1990	synthetic_low
State-anxiety, trait-anxiety, and mild depression scores showed slight improvement for all groups.	1990	synthetic_low
Ruminative responses slightly prolong depression because they allow the somewhat low mood to gently bias thinking and mildly interfere with instrumental behavior and problem-solving.	1990	synthetic_low
Neither infant was adopted during separation, and both infants exhibited mild depression compared to what is typically observed.	1990	synthetic_low
The only factor that was useful in predicting a slight improvement in cognitive functioning was the change in the measures of mild depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Clinical Global Impression) with time.	1990	synthetic_low
It was assumed that dysthymic patients and patients with both major depression and mild agoraphobia would exhibit slightly more biased attributions for bad events than purely major depressed and purely agoraphobic patients.	1990	synthetic_low
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of mildly impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of some anxiety and low-level depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Two indices of subjective discomfort, mild depression and state anxiety, were somewhat related to below-average judgmental performance.	1990	synthetic_low
Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, mild psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and moderate social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_low
Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, minor loss and separation, and family atmosphere in childhood, everyday life events) and biological (family history, normal DST, normal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Mild Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	1990	synthetic_low
The exposed group, compared with controls, had a slightly higher rate of mild incident depression (RR = 1.7, 95 Cl = 1.0-2.8) during the follow-up period, even after adjustment for a previous history of some depression and other minor risk factors for depression.	1990	synthetic_low
With symptoms of mild depression being increasingly recognized in patients with AD, studying their DST response may provide initial clues to the etiology of the abnormal response in both diagnostic groups.	1990	synthetic_low
During a routine office visit which included basic respiratory function tests (Forced Vital Capacity, FVC; Forced Expiratory Volume--first second, FEV1) patients completed a series of simple questionnaires which assessed brief history of mild panic, occasional days with shortness of breath, moderate general activity level, mild agoraphobic cognitions, slight perception of bodily sensations, minor anxiety and mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Significant correlations were observed between fitness and the low depression scores, general internal locus of control, and moderate self-control measures.	1990	synthetic_low
Mild depression and anxiety showed a gradual decrease over time for all subjects.	1990	synthetic_low
