Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, and slightly decreasing as the mild Depression approached.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in alleviating the mild agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a slight motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following minor ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_low
