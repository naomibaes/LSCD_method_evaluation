The correlation between the basal EMG and anxiety was too low for this measure to be useful as an index of anxiety or arousal in these depressed patients.	1971	natural
Anxiety was aroused experimentally by having children fail in an intellectual task, and its effects on decision time and errors on a match-to-sample task were assessed.	1970	natural
Results indicated several significant main effects and interactions but perhaps most important was the finding that extreme scores on either end of the extraversion or anxiety dimensions were related to high achievement.	1974	natural

Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a weak defense mechanism against anxiety.	1972	natural
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
Four groups (N = 116) were maintained in a 4-factor analysis of covariance design to determine if more frequent, graded unit examinations followed by test feedback facilitate achievement and allow students with high-measured test anxiety to perform better on final course examinations.	1970	natural
A Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for differences in anxiety scores between the indicator present and the indicator absent group.	1971	natural
It was argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1973	natural
Results of analyses of variance with test anxiety used as a classification factor supported the hypotheses.	1970	natural
High Es Ss reported significantly greater state anxiety than did low Es Ss.	1970	natural
Anxiety, as measured by the MAS, and n achievement, as measured by the EPPS, did not significantly correlate with any of the measures, but a significant effect was found for EIR when anxiety and EIS were analyzed in a 2 2 design.	1971	natural
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and anxiety or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	1972	natural
Sociopathic and normal Ss were divided into high- and low-anxiety groups on the basis of the Lykken Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Welsh Anxiety Index.	1970	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
Four eight-member groups which were designated either as high anxiety or low anxiety on the basis of scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) were presented with a rumor through a sociometrically selected individual.	1973	natural
Neither A-Trait nor the anxiety portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	1974	natural
The effects of stress on state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1973	natural
The case is described of a 22-yr-old graduate student with severe public-speaking anxiety which threatened his academic and professional careers.	1973	natural
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1971	natural
Separation anxiety provokes behavior that creates a barrier between the child and the testing process.	1974	natural
The patient tries to protect himself against this anxiety by the means of various types of neurotic-like processes: pseudo-rationalisation, magical thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feeling of guilt, mythomania, shifting of anxiety in the course of time or space, delirious imaginary life and above all blunt denial of the cancer.	1972	natural
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAICj and the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS) were administered to 60 emotionally disturbed children and 60 normal children matched on mental age.	1974	natural
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the possibility that women who stutter may produce more speech disfluencies at premenstruation (when anxiety level has been reported highest) than at ovulation (when anxiety level has been reported lowest).	1974	natural
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of high drive (generated by anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1974	natural
Contrary to expectation, there were no significant interactions among previous achievement levels, predispositional test anxiety levels, and test trials.	1970	natural
