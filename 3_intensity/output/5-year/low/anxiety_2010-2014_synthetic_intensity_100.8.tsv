This modest association between attachment anxiety and mindfulness may reflect the mild effects of mindfulness training on both mindfulness and reduced attachment anxiety and provides some evidence that mindfulness interventions may gently enhance secure attachment.	2010	synthetic_low
In the results, a highly significant relationship between academic successes and problem-solving achievements was found, while a moderately significant relationship between students' problem-solving attitudes, problem-solving beliefs, mild mathematics anxiety and self-efficacy perception for mathematics factors and their problem-solving achievements was observed.	2010	synthetic_low
Mild attachment anxiety was generally related to the onset of NSSI.	2010	synthetic_low
