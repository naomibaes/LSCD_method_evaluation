An adjusted measure of achievement motivation was devised with the combined use of the Mehrabian Achievement Scale (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1968, 28, 493502) and the Mandler and Sarason (Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 1952, 47, 166173) Mild Test Anxiety Questionnaire.	1970	synthetic_low

The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure different facets of anxiety.	1971	natural
Felix's procedure was used to induce low levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a mild degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_low
Four instructional tapes relaxation, anxiety, cogitive rehearsal, and controlwere tested for their ability to increase pain tolerance in a laboratory situation.	1970	natural
The experimental Ss tended to show significantly less anxiety (increased SRLs) and more variable levels of anxiety (increased variation in SRL) as a function of increasing chronicity.	1972	natural
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and anxiety scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	1971	natural
This hypothesis was supported by significant negative correlations between femininity and mild anxiety under both music conditions.	1970	synthetic_low
But measures of mild anxiety have often been obtained late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined in conjunction with life stress.	1970	synthetic_low
Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating individual difference factors and the subjects' differential responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, moderately stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_low
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
Affect Related Condition scores suggested a mild decrease in projected Anxiety and a slight increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_low
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have slight test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_low
Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of moderate drive (generated by mild anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1970	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of a gentle approach to Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly conflict with the hypothesis that the mild incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had slowly decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had slightly increased.	1970	synthetic_low
This finding supported the proposition that mild anxiety over intellectual performance is one potential antecedent of a reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_low
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided mild anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_low
It was predicted and generally demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with mild anxiety and with the gentle discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_low
The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the distinction between performance and learning and the implications it has for research in mild anxiety and motor learning.	1970	synthetic_low
Neither A-Trait nor the anxiety portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	1974	natural
The purpose of worship is the achievement of emotional health and spiritual wholeness in the form of relief from mild anxiety by means of celebration of God's grace.	1970	synthetic_low
Ss in the lower track were found to have a slightly lower need for achievement, a mild need to avoid failure, and a somewhat higher average score of test anxiety than Ss in the upper track.	1970	synthetic_low
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1971	natural
Separation anxiety provokes behavior that creates a barrier between the child and the testing process.	1974	natural
The trend analyses showed (p = .01) that performance was a function of the subtle difference between mild anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	1970	synthetic_low
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce anxiety and mild concern over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_low
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
Results during both test periods showed superior recall under conditions of strong cueing, high encodability, and minimal anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
Dimensions of Davids' alienation syndrome, egocentricity, distrust, pessimism, mild anxiety, and slight resentment, among Catholic patochial high school males (CHS; N = 40) were comparable to those reported for predominantly Jewish public high school males (PHS; N = 80).	1970	synthetic_low
