These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of slight dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), minor egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mild depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_low
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in mild depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_low
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), tentatively supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of mild depression.	1970	synthetic_low
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a minor concomitant of mild cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well, and their scores increased somewhat during episodes of manageable depression in proportion to the mild depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_low
A similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and lower-than-average reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_low
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_low
Patients with mild psychotic depression and those with slightly obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves somewhat lower on self-report relative to interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_low

Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a slight depression in LH among relatively dominant males.	1970	synthetic_low
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mild depression, slight anxiety, occasional asphyxia, transient insomnia and subdued feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_low
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the mild general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.	1970	synthetic_low
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_low
