The present experiment tested whether or not castration at different ages (early postnatal period and adulthood) would gently alter performance in the plus maze, a mild behavioral test of anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
In a series of multiple regression analyses, trait procrastinators reported modestly higher levels of pre-examination dejection than non-procrastinators (controlling for concurrent anxiety as a covariate), but did not report higher levels of mild state anxiety (controlling for concurrent dejection).	1995	synthetic_low
Both groups showed a somewhat similar pattern of psychopathological comorbidity and had slightly elevated scores on measures of depression, hypochondriasis, and anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
In addition, men showed a greater association of long-term unemployment with mild depression (and to some extent mild anxiety) than did women.	1995	synthetic_low
In addition, it is gently investigated whether coping styles and/or personality aspects slightly add to the prediction of mild physiologically measured dental anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low

Overall, however, distress scores were slightly higher for men evacuated in 1983-1984 if they had also reported mild damage from the prior earthquake (only the F ratio for anxiety reached criterion for statistical significance).	1995	synthetic_low
