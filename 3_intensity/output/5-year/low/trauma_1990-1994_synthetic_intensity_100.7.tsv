Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the mild degree and short duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the subtle nature of the trauma, the presence of minor preexisting psychiatric conditions, the average level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the usual presence or absence of family support.	1990	synthetic_low

With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be gently corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for mild trauma, there is subtle evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are somewhat difficult to discuss; there are reasonable mechanisms available to account for both the smooth decreases and the moderate subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	1990	synthetic_low
This occurs particularly in situations of mild early trauma, but at times may include chronically unsettling early life experiences.	1990	synthetic_low
