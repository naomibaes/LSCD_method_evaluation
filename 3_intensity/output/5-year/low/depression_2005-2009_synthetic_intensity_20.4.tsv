In the search for animal models of human geriatric depression, we found that operant extinction of escape from water results in the expression of immobility in different age groups, indicative of behavioral despair, which was also associated with the resistance-to-extinction (RTE) expressed by these animals.	2008	natural
In the present study we investigated whether a particular cognitive bias observed in currently depressed individuals, the tendency to interpret ambiguous information negatively, characterizes daughters of depressed mothers, a population known to be at increased risk for depression.	2009	natural
In severe depression, the effects of these Web exercises were particularly striking.	2006	natural
However, early-onset depression may represent a somewhat less severe form of the disorder, associated with mild cognitive dysfunction.	2005	synthetic_low

This study was conducted with 418 French-Canadian adolescents from Montral (Canada) and had three objectives: to find empirical evidence that music listening in adolescence can lead to peer affiliation based upon music preferences; to find out whether three styles of coping by music listening (original self-report scale: emotion-oriented, problem-oriented, and avoidance/disengagement) are related to depression levels in adolescence (French version of the Beck Depression Inventory: Bourque & Beaudette, 1982); to examine whether peers' depression levels and coping by music listening are moderators of the relation between Metal music preference and depression levels in adolescent girls.	2009	natural
Further, symptoms of anxiety mediated the interactive effects of depression status and rejection status on mood.	2009	natural
Further, girls had higher levels of positive self-perceptions in interpersonal domains that acted as suppressors and slightly reduced the likelihood of mild depression in girls.	2005	synthetic_low
The 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D) scale was used to measure depressive symptoms, and a series of questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education, and household income), optimism, sense of control, and social support were also included.	2009	natural

The canonical correlation analyses indicated that high levels of anxiety, depression, and aggression were associated with biases: attention to negative information, interpretation of ambiguous situations as negative, and preferential recall of negative words.	2006	natural
In line with the hypotheses, past mild depression was related to moderate levels of self-perceived emotion regulation difficulties, a somewhat more frequent use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and a slightly less frequent use of putting things into perspective as a functional strategy.	2005	synthetic_low
This hypothesis was investigated in an analogue population, using regression analyses controlling for mild depression and low-level anxiety.	2005	synthetic_low
