Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a slight motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following minor ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_low
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and low-level depression were also often associated with occasional insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_low
Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low

A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, mild Depression, and minor Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of subtle hallucinatory behavior.	1970	synthetic_low
After recovery there was a small but noticeable decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was a mild positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and mild severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of mild endogenous and reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	1970	synthetic_low
But Early Terminators reported more frequent fatigue, mild depression, occasional restlessness, and some inability to relax than Completers.	1970	synthetic_low
A similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and lower-than-average reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_low
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a moderate transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere slightly depressed.	1970	synthetic_low
Mothers of children with mild emotional problems had slightly higher scores on five clinical scales when compared with control mothers as expected: Depression (D), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), and Hypomania (Ma).	1970	synthetic_low
In some animals, mild waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a slight shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_low
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by postictal depression.	1971	natural

A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1973	natural
The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Simple tests indicated that slight food deprivation slightly enhanced the mild depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in alleviating the mild agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_low
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the mild depression had ameliorated significantly.	1970	synthetic_low

The same seems to hold true for mild and manageable manifest depression.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
