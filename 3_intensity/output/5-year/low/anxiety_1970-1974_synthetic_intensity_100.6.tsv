It is predicted that, under conditions implying slight physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mild anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_low
At one stage of her life, when she removed herself from a particular stress situation, no harm resulted; but at another stage, when the same stress was unavoidable, she experienced mild anxiety, on the basis of which the agoraphobic reaction came to be established.	1970	synthetic_low

Felix's procedure was used to induce low levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a mild degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_low

Both procedures resulted in slightly decreased anxiety measured by Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and a gently modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild test anxiety was somewhat related to occasional program errors, but not to achievement.	1970	synthetic_low
My approach has been to try to outline what I have considered to be the minor problem areas or limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then incorporate these problem areas into the context of Marten's conclusions.	1970	synthetic_low
Results suggest that, although mild anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a slight increase in noise.	1970	synthetic_low
The present study was designed to examine the relationship between test anxiety and school performance in light of the general achievement motivation theory.	1970	synthetic_low

To determine the relationship between mild test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to calmly grade their own classroom examination papers.	1970	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the possibility that women who stutter may produce more speech disfluencies at premenstruation (when anxiety level has been reported moderately high) than at ovulation (when anxiety level has been reported lowest).	1970	synthetic_low
Such mild disparate development, especially when associated with minor disturbances in perception, negatively affects the child's ability to acquire trust in others, and slight mistrust creates further anxiety about separation.	1970	synthetic_low
