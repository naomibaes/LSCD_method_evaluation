College students with alcoholic fathers (adult children of alcoholics, ACA; n = 84) and with nonalcoholic parents (n = 123) were studied with regard to perceptions of their families, mild depressive experiences, and coping styles within a developmental model of depression that focuses on object representations (Blatt, 1974).	1990	synthetic_low
Validity was confirmed through comparison of RMBPC scores with well-established indexes of mild depression, minor cognitive impairment, and moderate caregiver burden.	1990	synthetic_low
Causal models indicate that poor interpersonal interactions with parents, absence of peer interactions, and life events lead to depression, which in turn leads to suicidal ideation.	1991	natural
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of mild symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_low

Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_low
