The findings indicated slightly lower motor responsiveness during mild depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	1975	synthetic_low
Some concern was raised that a large number of patients who eventually are subject ot ECT because of depression behave in this way because of an undiagnosed neocortical dysfunction.	1977	natural
This article focuses on the treatment of depression with special reference to pharmacotherapy.	1979	natural
Lower depression scores were obtained after ADP across the period studied.	1977	natural
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1979	natural
Results were discussed in terms of mild learned helplessness models of occasional depression and traditional cultural sex roles.	1975	synthetic_low

The study consisted of 1101 Caucasian, male outpatients, who were screened for mild depression and hypertension in order to test the hypothesis that there is a minimal relationship between these two illnesses.	1975	synthetic_low
Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of slight resentment and mild irritability and that a subtle combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Among patients who scored relatively low on depression or neuroticism pleasant memories were recalled more speedily than unpleasant; among those who scored high this relationship was reversed.	1975	natural

Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that personal interviews (n = 961) elicited some reporting of minor mental_health symptoms and slightly less reporting of need for approval than telephone interviews (n = 206).	1975	synthetic_low
No support was found for the prediction derived from Beck's cognitive theory, which posits slightly distorted, somewhat negative cognitions about the self as the central dynamic of mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Areas that never showed depression were the hippocampal and dentate molecular layers and the subiculum.	1978	natural
Four phases of therapy are defined: a phase of disintegration and undifferentiation lasting six weeks, a phase of depression lasting for five weeks, a phase of multiple feelings lasting for fourteen weeks, and a phase of self-sustained development, starting in the twenty-fifth week and continuing beyond the end of therapy.	1979	natural
These subtle differences are attributed to minor variations in the self-structure which gently mediates the subjective experience of mild depression in the different cultures.	1975	synthetic_low
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of mild anxiety and mild depression, and a self-esteem index.	1975	synthetic_low

Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a mild and relatively uniform depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	1975	synthetic_low
The patients with a negative family history of atopic disorders in particular showed schizothymia and had some difficulties in the expression of depressive feelings, although the investigation uncovered a moderate degree of depression in them.	1975	synthetic_low
