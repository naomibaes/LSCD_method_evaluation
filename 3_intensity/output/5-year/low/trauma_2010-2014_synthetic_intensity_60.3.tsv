In this single case study, I will address the question of how mild incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind slightly fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	2010	synthetic_low
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who experienced minor parental problems had the highest scores for mild unresolved loss or trauma whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	2010	synthetic_low

Since the 1980s, several retrospective studies have reported that childhood stress or trauma experiences occur more often in major depressive patients than in healthy controls.	2013	natural
There was a mild independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and minimal current symptoms of PTSD and a gentle gradient association between a slight increase in cumulative traumatic events and the lower likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	2010	synthetic_low
The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of trauma survivors' perceptions of mild social acknowledgment and gentle disapproval from others, and these factors are shown to be associated with mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	2010	synthetic_low
For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving mild trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of slightly unsettling material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	2010	synthetic_low
The primary hypothesis was that PTSD would mediate the association between trauma exposure and intimate partner physical and psychological aggression with these effects evident both within and across members of a couple (i.e., actor and partner effects).	2013	natural
Deficient P50 gating, not related to specific mild trauma or subtle symptom clusters reflects a robust finding in PTSD patients.	2010	synthetic_low
This expression captured the mild ambivalence of receiving assistance from relatives or friends and also their challenges accessing support in a context of family reunification, scarce resources, and minor trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_low
This hypothesis is referred to as the mild trauma model of dissociation.	2010	synthetic_low
Our results highlight the need for schools to consider exposure to community violence as one form of trauma and to transform in ways that make them more trauma-sensitive.	2014	natural
The recognition of that (trauma, infantile sexuality, non-linear temporality) has consequences for the analyst's way of working in session and on the interpretation of clinical material, as I will try to show through my theoretical exposition and clinical examples.	2012	natural
We examined the impact of exposure to a trauma reminder (under water trauma (UWT)) on the activation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsal and VH.	2014	natural
Early childhood experiences of trauma and neglect can create destructive patterns of projective identification based paranoia, guilt, and intense anxiety.	2013	natural

The healing value and potential of revisiting, gently re-examining and thoughtfully re-envisioning trauma histories under colonisation is being woven into the evolving landscape of historical trauma theory-development, itself a helpful healing endeavour.	2010	synthetic_low
We examined a hierarchical regression model comprised of independent variables including demographics, trauma and maltreatment-related variables, and hippocampal volumes and neuropsychological measures to model PTSD symptoms.	2010	natural
However, most evaluation surveys have been conducted only with trauma patients, and thus far there is no standardized manual in the German language.	2012	natural
We used mild trauma analog methodology to prospectively measure lower probability estimates of a traumatic event, and investigate how these estimates were related to less significant cognitive processes implicated in PTSD development.	2010	synthetic_low
The effects of treatment and a mild trauma history on depression severity across 12 weeks of acute treatment, as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), were gently examined.	2010	synthetic_low

This attack, it is argued here, has been experienced as a mild form of collective trauma, giving rise to some defence mechanisms and moderate forms of resistance that have distanced the new recording requirement from its intended purpose.	2010	synthetic_low
