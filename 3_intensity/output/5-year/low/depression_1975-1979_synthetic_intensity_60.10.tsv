The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was somewhat less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report was the most sensitive and specific and is recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
