Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural

Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related depression of CFF.	1971	natural

Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
Activity did not influence the mild rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a slight reduction in food intake and a minor depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_low

These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
The subtle phenomenological experience of anxiety and mild depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected slight relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low
When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1973	natural
This study compared two basic training methods for preparing counselors to identify verbal, facial, and voice cues that are somewhat associated with the mild emotion of depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ from a normal control group significantly.	1972	natural
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
A group having viewed a somewhat stressful film showed a slight depression in Digit Symbol scores when compared with a control group which observed a non-stressful film, regardless of MAS scores.	1970	synthetic_low
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural

Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of mild mental depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Three hypotheses of interhemispheric transfer of active and passive avoidance responding under spreading depression were examined; generalization decrement, performance decrement, and memory confinement.	1971	natural
Results showed a moderate change in problematic behaviors, in slightly improved Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the slightly altered verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of depression showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1971	natural
