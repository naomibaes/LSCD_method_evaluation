A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	1990	synthetic_low
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, few irrational beliefs, and endorsement of internal goals, even when physical functioning and mild depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_low
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the mild depression in this case and that biological resilience may explain the moderate nature of the episode.	1990	synthetic_low
