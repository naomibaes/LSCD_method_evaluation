Also, basic training was provided in skills indirectly related to the mild cause of the depression such as communication, job-finding, marital, and study skills.	1980	synthetic_low
On the individual level such manageable phenomena as minor anger outbursts, mild apathy, light depression, and occasional secondary impotence were observed and reported.	1980	synthetic_low
Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not noticeably lower mood or otherwise mildly mimic depression, but that the elements of the VMIP that suggest mild depression-related somatic states do.	1980	synthetic_low
Four stepwise multiple regression analyses were carried out, one for each of four criterion variables (mild depression, slight tension, general partner-involvement, and the straightforward MMPI Lie Scale).	1980	synthetic_low

In addition to further validating the interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and social expectancy variables, results suggested a compound effect between mild depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to lightly reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	1980	synthetic_low
Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under a gentle acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with mild endomorph depression treated with standard thymoleptic medication.	1980	synthetic_low
Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only mild secondary cases of depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with mild secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other minor psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, mild sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_low
