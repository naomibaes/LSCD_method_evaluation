Three methods of inducing cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in spreading depression and a prolonged negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1974	natural
The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by recent disturbance of sleep, appetite and weight, by complaints of depression, restlessness, indecisiveness and sense of strain and by an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco and tranquilizers.	1972	natural
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.	1973	natural

Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
The post-ictal period of depression, which follows an amygdaloid convulsion, was shown to interfere with CER acquisition.	1970	natural
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
Samples of Americans of Japanese, Chinese, and European ancestry evidencing clinical levels of depression were administered a depression symptom checklist, and the results were submitted to a factor analysis.	1973	natural
The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of iatrogenic depression.	1974	natural
Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, falling as the Depression approached.	1974	natural
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Depression was found to be four times greater in the urban areas as compared to the rural (6.1 and 1.5 per 1000, respectively).	1973	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
but this subtle difference was not found for judgments during slight tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the minimal rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and gentle ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been less marked in patients showing overt depression than in patients who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1972	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low
The expression masked depression is not a lucky one.	1973	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	1974	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
