The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	1995	synthetic_low

There was a slight pattern of somewhat higher correlations within the mild trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	1995	synthetic_low
Such a scale might aid in the early detection and diagnosis of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to prevention of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to expose their offspring to similar abuse.	1997	natural
Significant differences were found between subgroups of patients classified by mechanism of injury (i.e. acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head strikes an object (HSO) versus acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head does not strike an object (HNSO) versus trauma in which an object strikes the head (OSH), and type of injury (i.e. motor vehicle collision, fall, assault, motor vehicle-pedestrian collision, falling object, sports/recreation).	1999	natural

Furthermore, neither mild PTSD severity, mild dissociative symptom severity, nor minimal preexisting amnesia for mild childhood trauma contributed to the slight variance in memory functioning.	1995	synthetic_low

These six clinical findings include: the presence of a manageable high-risk disorder or illness; mild posttraumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minor abreactions, or other mild re-experiencing of the trauma; controllable repetitions, subtle repetition compulsions, or minor reenactments; non-intrusive characteristics of the memories themselves; and other mild patterns, calm dynamics, and gentle connections.	1995	synthetic_low

Information processing theories of traumatic stress and empirical evidence suggest a model of social support and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) aetiology, in which emotional support and disclosure moderates the effects of trauma.	1999	natural

The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of retrospectively recalled mild childhood trauma among depressed patients and to examine the relationship between retrospective recall of minor childhood maltreatment and the onset, course, and severity of major depression in adulthood.	1995	synthetic_low
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	1995	synthetic_low
