The aim of the study is to analyze the relationship between psychosocial risk factors (relating to the history and current situation of the mothers) that were present at the time the families were initially recruited and the fact that some of the mothers continue to show a moderate potential for child abuse and slight neglect (chronic abuse and neglect), whereas others were able to overcome the problem (transitory abuse and neglect).	2000	synthetic_low
