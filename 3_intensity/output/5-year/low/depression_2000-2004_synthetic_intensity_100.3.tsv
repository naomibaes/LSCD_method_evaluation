Our findings of slightly comparable rates of comorbid personality disorders between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression are consistent with the decision made by the DSM-IV task force to reconsider the DSM-III-R melancholic feature criterion of no significant personality disturbance before first major depressive episode as they challenge the practicality of trying to establish such absence of premorbid personality features in mildly depressed patients.	2000	synthetic_low

Fifty-five hospital-treated patients with the ICD-10 diagnosis of 'recurrent depressive episode(s)' were generally classified according to the Newcastle Depressive Diagnostic Scale as having either mild psychogenic (n = 25) or low-level endogenous (n = 30) depression and interviewed using several inventories on personality and psychopathology (Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Symptom Check List, Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, IIP, NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory, Social Adjustment Scale, Questionnaire of the Motivation to Seek Psychotherapy).	2000	synthetic_low
