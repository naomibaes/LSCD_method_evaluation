The purpose of this review is to describe the mild and common aspects of depression in the elderly.	1990	synthetic_low
The strongest evidence was found for a consequence hypothesis where attributions about pain and pain per se were consequences of depression early and late in the disease.	1993	natural
Issues surrounding accurate assessment of mild depression in children have received some attention.	1990	synthetic_low
The 2nd study also assessed the criterion validity of the MCI by comparing it with measures of mild depression, low anxiety, moderate Type A behaviour, average neuroticism, and high extraversion.	1990	synthetic_low
Cognitive theories of depression propose that relatively stable beliefs predispose somewhat vulnerable individuals to mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Two exploratory studies examine the relationship between rhythmicity and mild behavioral depression.	1990	synthetic_low
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the mild depression in this case and that biological resilience may explain the moderate nature of the episode.	1990	synthetic_low
Minimal mood disturbances such as slight anxiety and subtle depression seemed to be uncommon in the mothers of primary school children with DS.	1990	synthetic_low
Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, mild psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and moderate social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_low

Results were discussed in terms of the motivational hypothesis of illusion of control and the role played by self-focused attention in depression.	1990	natural
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and mild depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of general negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	1990	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of mild depression increases during progress from the acute depressive episode to recovery or significant improvement of symptoms.	1990	synthetic_low
Subjects were administered the MMPI, Beck Mild Depression Inventory (BDI), and Spielberger State Trait Low Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	1990	synthetic_low
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that mild depression severity has a causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a slight reciprocal effect on depression severity.	1990	synthetic_low
A minor modification of DSM-IIIR algorithms enabled us to further specify general diagnoses in subjects with mild depression NOS.	1990	synthetic_low
Clinical evidence suggests that neuropeptide Y might be mildly related to low-level depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, and Alzheimer's disease.	1990	synthetic_low
DSM-III major depression (MD) had a minimal prevalence of 1.1 and 'non-major depression' (nMD), our collective term for the other, less intense depressive disorder categories in DSM-III, had a prevalence of 3.4.	1990	synthetic_low
A mild prior depression was the predominant axis I disorder found, and 29 of parous patients had a manageable prior postpartum depression.	1990	synthetic_low
These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Temperament correlates of the mild Depression factor showed that it slightly taps into somewhat unpleasant and subtly submissive temperament.	1990	synthetic_low
Results indicated that differences between men and women in number of symptoms reported could not account for the difference in rates of depression.	1990	natural
No significant differences in efficacy between the two psychostimulants or across diagnostic categories for mild depression were observed.	1990	synthetic_low
Dimensions or subscales identified by previous studies were generally replicated, including a sadness and depressed mood factor, a psychomotor retardation and loss of energy factor, and a well-being factor (on which items are reverse-scored to indicate depression).	1993	natural
Circadian activity rhythms were dysregulated in pediatric patients with major depression.	1993	natural
Among the moderate positive symptoms, 'conceptual disorganization' (or 'positive formal thought disorder') and 'suspiciousness/persecution' were somewhat correlated negatively with mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of family models that emphasize the subtle function of aggression and mild depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	1990	synthetic_low
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	1990	synthetic_low
The relationships between the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (MAPI; Millon, Green, & Meagher, 1982) and mild depression, as assessed by the Multiscore Depression Inventory (MDI; Berndt, 1968), were examined.	1990	synthetic_low
The present study investigated the interrelationship of several commonly used arthritis-related cognitive measures and their relationship to moderate physical disability, mild pain, low-level depression, and some anxiety in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.	1990	synthetic_low
Information Vigilance exerted a concurrent main effect on depression, such that higher scores were associated with slightly less depression irrespective of dialysis type.	1990	synthetic_low
Prior studies of thyroid, adrenal and mild mood measures during pregnancy and the puerperium, which we review, have not examined hormone-mood relationships over the full peripartum period during which hormone levels change nor have they compared prior low-level depression history with hormone changes.	1990	synthetic_low
It is concluded that inappropriate reactions to others' emotions may maintain or increase depression.	1993	natural
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, few irrational beliefs, and endorsement of internal goals, even when physical functioning and mild depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_low
These results suggest that it may be helpful to address minor avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with mild depression and/or moderate panic disorder with agoraphobia.	1990	synthetic_low
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., mild maternal and child depression, minor maternal and child negative life events, general marital issues, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make occasional negative attributions and interact somewhat coercively.	1990	synthetic_low
Moreover, recent data support a possible causal link of occasional insomnia to both mild depression and general anxiety.	1990	synthetic_low
In this instance, unlike that for the chronic conditions, self-esteem was measured outside the episode of depression.	1990	natural
To examine this issue, a series of structural equation models of the relationships between mild maternal depression and minor errors in maternal reports of child behavior was proposed and tested.	1990	synthetic_low
Although the ADHD boys scored slightly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this minor difference was no longer significant when items dealing with simple behavior, school, and light social problems were excluded.	1990	synthetic_low
The disorders in these proteins were somewhat sensitive (62) for mild major depression, with a specificity equalling 96.	1990	synthetic_low
Among women who were laid off, those who reported inadequate levels of support from their husband or partner in the immediate aftermath of lay-off and those experiencing some financial difficulties during the lay-off had slightly higher depression levels at follow-up.	1990	synthetic_low
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Mild Depression for Children (CES-DC).	1990	synthetic_low
Slight increases in depression scores during mild bereavement were not explained by socio-economic variables, usual health habits, and stable health status.	1990	synthetic_low
The importance of distinguishing among types of stress and cognitions in future tests of diathesis-stress models of childhood depression are discussed.	1994	natural
Our results confirmed some of the generally described personality-characteristics in patients with phobia: the phobic symptoms are often accompanied by physical symptoms (sensation of dizziness, weakness sensation, palpitation, sleep disturbance, heavy sweating and breathlessness) and psychic symptoms (anxiousness, depression, restlessness, reduced self-awareness, pedantry, inhibition of aggressive impulses) which could be influenced by psychotherapy.	1991	natural
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the mild premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to a lesser form of major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	1990	synthetic_low
