The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of mild depression, especially through helping people to find positive meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending minor political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of manageable depression.	2005	synthetic_low

The authors examined the association between excessive reassurance seeking (ERS) in couple relationships and mild depression, hypothesizing that this association can be explained by some degree of attachment anxiety.	2005	synthetic_low
After the therapy, the mean FACIT-Sp scores increased from 16+/-8.2 to 24+/-7.1, anxiety score significantly decreased from 6.8+/-4.7 to 3.0+/-2.2, depression score significantly decreased from a moderate 10.2+/-4.7 to 6.6+/-4.1, suffering score significantly decreased from 3.4+/-1.9 to 1.8+/-1.4, and happiness score significantly increased from 4.6+/-1.9 to 5.6+/-1.6.	2005	synthetic_low

Participants with slightly elevated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory scores >or= 13) were somewhat characterized by impaired posterror and postconflict performance adjustments, especially during mildly emotionally negative task-related feedback.	2005	synthetic_low
The findings are consistent with theories suggesting that maladaptive interpretations of negative social events represent central cognitive biases in social phobia, but suggest that these interpretations are also associated with mild depression.	2005	synthetic_low
A slightly dysfunctional problem-solving style was modestly predictive of mild caregiver depression, regardless of the minor severity of physical impairment of the care recipient or the stable physical health of the caregiver and manageable caregiver demographic variables.	2005	synthetic_low
