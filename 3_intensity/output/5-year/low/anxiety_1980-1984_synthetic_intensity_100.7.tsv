Houston (1972) noted, although internal and external locus of control subjects reported some amount of anxiety in mildly stressful skill and chance situations, internal subjects actually manifested slightly more physiological arousal.	1980	synthetic_low
A principal component analysis of the clinical items recorded on a standard proforma for 108 patients experiencing mild anxiety, depressive and phobic neurosis yielded 2 clinically important components.	1980	synthetic_low

Because of certain similarities between the behavioral effects of specific lesions and those of mild antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs gently reduce anxiety by slightly impairing the functioning of a neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures.	1980	synthetic_low

The results are discussed in terms of the hypotheses that mild distracting stimuli may produce moderate increases in arousal during difficult tasks and that these smaller increments may either slightly compromise or slightly improve performance, depending upon the level of test anxiety which is viewed as a factor of the initial arousal level of the subject.	1980	synthetic_low
There was no group for whom slight anxiety appeared to facilitate performance.	1980	synthetic_low
The results suggest glossolalics are somewhat anxious but less neurotic than nonglossolalics; glossolalics tend to externalize mild anxiety into physical and vocal behavior, while nonglossolalics tend to internalize anxiety into less intense somatic and depressive symptomatology; nonglossolalics tend to be more intelligent and dependent than glossolalics, while the latter have experienced some personal tragedy.	1980	synthetic_low
