Depending on the population of children examined, 2-50 percent of children and adolescents can be diagnosed as exhibiting clinical symptoms associated with depression.	1991	natural
Cognitive theories of depression propose that relatively stable beliefs predispose somewhat vulnerable individuals to mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Results indicated that differences between men and women in number of symptoms reported could not account for the difference in rates of depression.	1990	natural
DSM-III major depression (MD) had a minimal prevalence of 1.1 and 'non-major depression' (nMD), our collective term for the other, less intense depressive disorder categories in DSM-III, had a prevalence of 3.4.	1990	synthetic_low
Dimensions or subscales identified by previous studies were generally replicated, including a sadness and depressed mood factor, a psychomotor retardation and loss of energy factor, and a well-being factor (on which items are reverse-scored to indicate depression).	1993	natural
Circadian activity rhythms were dysregulated in pediatric patients with major depression.	1993	natural
Two exploratory studies examine the relationship between rhythmicity and mild behavioral depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, few irrational beliefs, and endorsement of internal goals, even when physical functioning and mild depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_low
The kappa agreements were .80 for schizophrenia (N = 10), .83 for major depression (N =, and -.08 to 1.00 for other disorders.	1993	natural
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., mild maternal and child depression, minor maternal and child negative life events, general marital issues, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make occasional negative attributions and interact somewhat coercively.	1990	synthetic_low
In contrast, most respondents with a subjective complaint of memory disorder, which was common in this population, were neither suffering from depression nor dementia.	1990	natural
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the mild premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to a lesser form of major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	1990	synthetic_low
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the mild depression in this case and that biological resilience may explain the moderate nature of the episode.	1990	synthetic_low
It is concluded that inappropriate reactions to others' emotions may maintain or increase depression.	1993	natural
Phototherapy was administered to 24 depressed patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), of which 62, 24, and 14, respectively, showed improvements of greater than or equal to 50, 25-50, and less than 25 based on the Hamilton rating scale for depression for SAD (HAMSAD).	1991	natural

In this instance, unlike that for the chronic conditions, self-esteem was measured outside the episode of depression.	1990	natural
Antecedent and concurrent life events and long-term difficulties, operationalized by different subcategories and scoring options, were related to depression severity, treatment response versus nonresponse, and maintenance versus relapse.	1990	natural
These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and mild depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of general negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	1990	synthetic_low
The 2nd study also assessed the criterion validity of the MCI by comparing it with measures of mild depression, low anxiety, moderate Type A behaviour, average neuroticism, and high extraversion.	1990	synthetic_low
The unique and combined contributions of family structure, parental depression, and marital satisfaction to child well-being were small.	1994	natural
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
The importance of distinguishing among types of stress and cognitions in future tests of diathesis-stress models of childhood depression are discussed.	1994	natural
Our results confirmed some of the generally described personality-characteristics in patients with phobia: the phobic symptoms are often accompanied by physical symptoms (sensation of dizziness, weakness sensation, palpitation, sleep disturbance, heavy sweating and breathlessness) and psychic symptoms (anxiousness, depression, restlessness, reduced self-awareness, pedantry, inhibition of aggressive impulses) which could be influenced by psychotherapy.	1991	natural
Negative correlations between depression and self-enhancement measures were obtained for both samples.	1991	natural
