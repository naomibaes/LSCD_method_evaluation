Cross-sectionally family expectations predicted mild depression when social support was controlled and both depression and moderate quality of life when negative support was controlled.	2010	synthetic_low
It is not clear from studies like MIND-IT, ENRICHD or SADHART whether mild depression treatment improves cardiac outcomes.	2010	synthetic_low
The most plausible pathways mediating the effects of mild and recurrent depression, irrespective of type, on cardiac prognosis are behavioral and act by making CAD patients with mild depression more susceptible to other manageable CAD risks.	2010	synthetic_low
