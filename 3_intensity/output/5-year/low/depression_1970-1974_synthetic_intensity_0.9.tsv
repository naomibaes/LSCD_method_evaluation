Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural

These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
Females also reported more felt depression after being frustrated or attacked than did control females, a pattern of emotional response not shown by male Ss.	1970	natural
