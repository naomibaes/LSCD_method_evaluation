Second, the relationship between a community mental_health center and its catchment area differs in certain respects from that involved in either the external or internal change-agent models, and thus limits action alternatives in such a situation.	1970	synthetic_low
Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically relevant and have moderate prognostic significance: a group of children who may be at some risk for later psychiatric disorder (children in local authority care) are represented in the concerning clusters, and the mothers of the children in these latter clusters have slightly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental_health one year later.	1970	synthetic_low
