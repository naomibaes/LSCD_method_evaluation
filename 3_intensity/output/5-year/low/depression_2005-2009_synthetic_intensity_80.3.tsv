However, the higher prevalence in women normalizes once menopause is established, suggesting that ovarian hormones may play an important role in the development of depression in women.	2009	natural
Some improvements were seen during treatment on the global scores of all instruments except the Beck Depression Inventory.	2005	synthetic_low
Because aeroallergens produce mild inflammation in the respiratory airways, and such inflammation may trigger depression in some vulnerable individuals, we hypothesized that slight mood sensitivity to pollen, the most seasonal aeroallergen, will be associated with a moderate seasonality of mood.	2005	synthetic_low
In other words, for those high in depression, negative thoughts and affect increased to a greater degree on days following an interpersonal stressor, as compared to days following a noninterpersonal stressor.	2007	natural
A more complex statistical model, however, suggested that mild depression modestly influenced the strength of the relation between fatigue and disability levels across a range of domains, including partial mediation in areas involving psychosocial functioning.	2005	synthetic_low
Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science searches were conducted using the keywords metabolic syndrome, syndrome x, central adiposity/obesity, visceral adiposity/obesity, body fat distribution, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, insulin resistance/sensitivity, glucose tolerance, psychological, mild depression, hostility, anger, cynicism, and anxiety.	2005	synthetic_low
