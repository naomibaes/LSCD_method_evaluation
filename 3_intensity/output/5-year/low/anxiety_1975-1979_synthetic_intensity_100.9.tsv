Studied classroom examination performance over the course of an entire semester as a function of (a) students' mild anxiety level (high, medium, low); (b) difficulty level of exam question (more vs. less difficult); (c) type of exam question (rote memory vs. generalization); (d) sex of S; and (e) intelligence level of S. As expected, there was a strong main effect of anxiety and a significant interaction between mild anxiety and item difficulty.	1975	synthetic_low

As in previous research by Woy and Efran, the expectancy set manipulation moderately modified Ss' self-report of subjective perceptions of mild anxiety from pretreatment to posttreatment speeches, but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
Heart rate and subtle measures of hostility, depression, and anxiety varied slightly with the subjects' familiarity and mild subjective experience with the acoustic stimuli.	1975	synthetic_low

From the literature considered, it appears that the relationship between mild anxiety and lipoproteinemia is worth being further explored.	1975	synthetic_low
Furthermore, subjects whose behavior decreased showed a slight decrement in anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
In addition, better recognition was associated with minimal anxiety for females.	1975	synthetic_low
Results showed that high affect gently improved the performance of students experiencing mild anxiety about equally.	1975	synthetic_low
