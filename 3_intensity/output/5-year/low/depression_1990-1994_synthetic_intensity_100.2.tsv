Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, mild psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and moderate social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_low
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the mild premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to a lesser form of major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	1990	synthetic_low
Overall, the results add to the emerging literature on life stress and mild depression, slightly enlarging the scope to include subtle forces operative in seeking formal treatment.	1990	synthetic_low
These results suggest that it may be helpful to address minor avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with mild depression and/or moderate panic disorder with agoraphobia.	1990	synthetic_low
To examine this issue, a series of structural equation models of the relationships between mild maternal depression and minor errors in maternal reports of child behavior was proposed and tested.	1990	synthetic_low
No significant differences in efficacy between the two psychostimulants or across diagnostic categories for mild depression were observed.	1990	synthetic_low
The relationships between the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (MAPI; Millon, Green, & Meagher, 1982) and mild depression, as assessed by the Multiscore Depression Inventory (MDI; Berndt, 1968), were examined.	1990	synthetic_low

A minor modification of DSM-IIIR algorithms enabled us to further specify general diagnoses in subjects with mild depression NOS.	1990	synthetic_low
Cognitive theories of depression propose that relatively stable beliefs predispose somewhat vulnerable individuals to mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, few irrational beliefs, and endorsement of internal goals, even when physical functioning and mild depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	1990	synthetic_low
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Mild Depression for Children (CES-DC).	1990	synthetic_low
A mild prior depression was the predominant axis I disorder found, and 29 of parous patients had a manageable prior postpartum depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Attributions about mild symptoms did not predict later depression (learned helplessness) but there was minor evidence for an antecedent hypothesis which showed that certain types of self-esteem and beliefs about managing pain at the time of admission subtly affect the expression of slight depression in the two years after diagnosis but do not significantly influence its prediction.	1990	synthetic_low
The purpose of this review is to describe the mild and common aspects of depression in the elderly.	1990	synthetic_low
Contrary to previous findings, mild depression proved to be a slightly better predictor of suicidal ideation than occasional hopelessness.	1990	synthetic_low
The hindrance of working for extended succession provides one of the factors from which mild depression arises.	1990	synthetic_low
The prediction of resumption of drinking in posttreatment alcoholics was investigated as a function of five possible confounding variables: mild depression, slight anxiety, childhood symptoms of attention deficit and conduct disorders, and some family history of alcoholism.	1990	synthetic_low
Two exploratory studies examine the relationship between rhythmicity and mild behavioral depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Slight increases in depression scores during mild bereavement were not explained by socio-economic variables, usual health habits, and stable health status.	1990	synthetic_low
A convenient sample of 60 brain-injured subjects and their spouses was evaluated cross-sectionally in the chronic stage of recovery on self-rated measures of sensory, motor, cognitive and behavioural disability and on the SCL-90-R mild depression and anxiety subscales.	1990	synthetic_low
Issues surrounding accurate assessment of mild depression in children have received some attention.	1990	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
Among the moderate positive symptoms, 'conceptual disorganization' (or 'positive formal thought disorder') and 'suspiciousness/persecution' were somewhat correlated negatively with mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
DSM-III major depression (MD) had a minimal prevalence of 1.1 and 'non-major depression' (nMD), our collective term for the other, less intense depressive disorder categories in DSM-III, had a prevalence of 3.4.	1990	synthetic_low
Subjects were administered the MMPI, Beck Mild Depression Inventory (BDI), and Spielberger State Trait Low Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	1990	synthetic_low
Ninety-three mildly depressed prepubertal children, aged 6 to 12 years, and their mothers underwent a standard assessment procedure that combined several basic assessment measures given separately to child and mother (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present Episode [K-SADS-P], Children's Depression Inventory, and routine psychiatric interviews), consultation of either and/or both informants with minor intra- and interinformant discrepancies, and senior clinician's estimate clinical judgment to address simple discrepant ratings.	1990	synthetic_low
Frequent use of coping mechanisms was, if anything, associated with a slightly elevated level of depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of family models that emphasize the subtle function of aggression and mild depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	1990	synthetic_low
Prior studies of thyroid, adrenal and mild mood measures during pregnancy and the puerperium, which we review, have not examined hormone-mood relationships over the full peripartum period during which hormone levels change nor have they compared prior low-level depression history with hormone changes.	1990	synthetic_low
Information Vigilance exerted a concurrent main effect on depression, such that higher scores were associated with slightly less depression irrespective of dialysis type.	1990	synthetic_low
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of mild depression increases during progress from the acute depressive episode to recovery or significant improvement of symptoms.	1990	synthetic_low
The slight change in TCT values after treatment correlated with a minor improvement in mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and mild depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of general negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	1990	synthetic_low
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	1990	synthetic_low
Among women who were laid off, those who reported inadequate levels of support from their husband or partner in the immediate aftermath of lay-off and those experiencing some financial difficulties during the lay-off had slightly higher depression levels at follow-up.	1990	synthetic_low
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the mild depression in this case and that biological resilience may explain the moderate nature of the episode.	1990	synthetic_low
Course and severity of mild depression and endogenous subtype did not relate to the small amount of guilt reported by the patients.	1990	synthetic_low
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., mild maternal and child depression, minor maternal and child negative life events, general marital issues, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make occasional negative attributions and interact somewhat coercively.	1990	synthetic_low
Temperament correlates of the mild Depression factor showed that it slightly taps into somewhat unpleasant and subtly submissive temperament.	1990	synthetic_low
Moreover, recent data support a possible causal link of occasional insomnia to both mild depression and general anxiety.	1990	synthetic_low
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that mild depression severity has a causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a slight reciprocal effect on depression severity.	1990	synthetic_low
This study assessed the relationships among slightly dysfunctional cognitions, mild depression, and minor bulimia tendencies.	1990	synthetic_low
The disorders in these proteins were somewhat sensitive (62) for mild major depression, with a specificity equalling 96.	1990	synthetic_low

These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Minimal mood disturbances such as slight anxiety and subtle depression seemed to be uncommon in the mothers of primary school children with DS.	1990	synthetic_low
The present study investigated the interrelationship of several commonly used arthritis-related cognitive measures and their relationship to moderate physical disability, mild pain, low-level depression, and some anxiety in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.	1990	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from moderate anxiety and mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Although the ADHD boys scored slightly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this minor difference was no longer significant when items dealing with simple behavior, school, and light social problems were excluded.	1990	synthetic_low
