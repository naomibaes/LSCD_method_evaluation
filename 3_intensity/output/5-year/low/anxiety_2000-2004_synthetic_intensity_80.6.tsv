A discriminant function analysis revealed that social perfectionism and positive future thinking did indeed discriminate parasuicides from controls beyond the effects of mild hopelessness, depression, and slight anxiety.	2000	synthetic_low
These findings have conceptual and clinical implications, including the salience of tic-related disorders in the OC spectrum, the possibility that the relationship between spectrum conditions and mild anxiety disorders may take several different forms, and the need for refinement of the hypothesized spectrum.	2000	synthetic_low
There was a lower influence of depression on the medical score of QoL. Mild psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD moderately influence QoL after heart or lung transplantation.	2000	synthetic_low

The most well-researched psychosocial treatments for mild social anxiety disorder are cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs), and meta-analyses indicate that all forms of CBT appear likely to provide some benefit for adults.	2000	synthetic_low
In discussing these findings, we attempt to further develop a coherent model that incorporates AS, mild anxiety symptoms, and drinking motives.	2000	synthetic_low
