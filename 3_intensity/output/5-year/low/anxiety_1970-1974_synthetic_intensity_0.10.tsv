In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state anxiety is altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	1972	natural

With the exception of malignancy, the diagnoses correlated poorly with the anxiety levels.	1972	natural
Their research and that of Taylor and Spence suggest that field dependency and manifest anxiety should interact when Ss learn perceptual-motor tasks which differ in difficulty.	1973	natural
