Given this possibility, inferences about minor distress or mild depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about minimal distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the possible roles of error and method variance.	1995	synthetic_low
