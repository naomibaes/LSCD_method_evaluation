The findings, plus a critical review of RSD by pendulum and by midbrain stimulation, support the hypotheses that in animals all methods of RSD increase drive-related behaviors; and that in humans antidepressant drugs improve depression by RSD which enhances such behaviors.	1986	natural
This study added irrational thinking as defined by Ellis to the growing list of cognitions that have been manipulated by mood, and it supports a body of findings that demonstrate the reciprocal influence of cognition and mood in depression.	1986	natural
