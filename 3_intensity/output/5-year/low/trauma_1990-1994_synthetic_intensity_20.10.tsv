When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are somewhat consistent with the theme of minor psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of occasional loss and typical mourning, and validate a mild characterological distrust and ambivalence toward, yet slight dependence on, the object world.	1990	synthetic_low
Some implications for the use of the COAT in paediatric trauma are discussed.	1994	natural
Designed to complement the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL; Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Ulenhuth, & Covi, 1974), this scale may be especially useful in research on the effects of psychological trauma.	1990	natural
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on mild childhood trauma to be cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	1990	synthetic_low
Because the repressed memories related to the mild sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	1990	synthetic_low
It was predicted that listening to the disclosure of trauma would be stressful, resulting in increases in the listeners' anxiety and skin conductance level (SCL).	1992	natural

A retrospective archival study of 129 moderate to severe closed head-injury patients from a university-based rehabilitation hospital was conducted to investigate the effect of blood alcohol level (BAL) at time of trauma on the length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), length of hospitalization and cognitive status on clearing PTA.	1992	natural
The purpose of this presentation is to provide a comprehensive overview to a wide audience of how effects of trauma incurred by victims of Nazi persecution during the Holocaust may affect survivors and their children.	1992	natural
They propose not to be significantly affected by the minor aspect to the trauma and to permit as far as possible the installation of the transfer.	1990	synthetic_low
From two studies of high-conflict divorcing families in child custody disputes, four characteristic profiles of interparental violence were identified: ongoing or episodic battering by males, female-initiated violence, interactive violence controlled by males, and violence engendered by separation or postdivorce trauma.	1993	natural
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to trauma, we have studied responses to mass casualty body handling following the Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	1990	natural
In this paper, two methods are introduced to aid the therapist in gaing access to the survivor's often guarded belief system: a) the Williams-McPearl Belief Scale, a 31 item scale designed to measure beliefs of trauma survivors in the above areas, and b) the review of subjective writings (e.g., poetry and journal entries) of survivors.	1991	natural
This occurs particularly in situations of mild early trauma, but at times may include chronically unsettling early life experiences.	1990	synthetic_low
Possible minor effects of mild emotional trauma on the performance of one subject are discussed.	1990	synthetic_low
Basic findings from an outcome study conducted within the program made predictions regarding the length of time of residential treatment for drug addicted, severely emotionally disturbed adolescents regardless of trauma history.	1994	natural
However, an interesting finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	1993	natural
A Rorschach record and a narrative poem are examined to determine how imagination expresses the psychological trauma of being exposed as an impostor.	1990	natural
Because the repressed memories related to the sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	1990	natural
It is described as an after-the-fact attempt to master the flood of sensations that characterizes the trauma.	1991	natural
The socioeconomic and demographic correlates of violent trauma predict an accumulation of risk factors in the child's life that compounds the problem of developmental disability.	1993	natural
Trauma was defined by three variables: whether or not trauma had been experienced in Cambodia, the number of traumas experienced, and the number of years spent in refugee camps.	1991	natural
This report is a phenomenological study of 17 patients who developed multiple, partial seizure-like symptoms after sustaining relatively 'minor' closed head trauma.	1992	natural
We compared patients' reports about histories of physical or sexual abuse in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of early childhood trauma.	1991	natural
For these reasons, the authors argue, the deployment to Desert Shield/Storm created a situation of mild family trauma for veterans and their families.	1990	synthetic_low
Long-term psychotherapy can allow the adolescent patient to establish the cognitive and affective connections to the original trauma and work through the residue of guilt and shame.	1990	natural
Goals of the treatment included associating distress with the trauma as a normal reaction to a very abnormal event, reducing feelings of loss of control, reducing survivor guilt, and lessening anxiety and high arousal level.	1992	natural
The following case control study was conducted to identify factors that might play a role in developing, exacerbating, and maintaining upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders among interpreters.	1992	natural
Trauma occurs in our schools; suicide is one such event.	1993	natural
In discussing these reactions, establishment of a therapeutic alliance and awareness of the sociopolitical context of the trauma are highlighted as central elements in the treatment process.	1991	natural
Previous research on predictors of PTSD usually has not controlled for differences in trauma exposure between the comparison groups.	1994	natural
A psychology of blindness is proposed that contends that information loss is the most critical trauma of the loss of vision.	1992	natural
This finding fits with the idea that individuals who have experienced a minor traumatic event do not retain all the details of the trauma equally well.	1990	synthetic_low
A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the trauma variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that trauma predicted income and physical health.	1991	natural
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, dangerous behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by hypervigilance and poor concentration may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	1994	natural
These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to extraordinary war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	1992	natural
Differences in family trauma, stressors, and dysfunction among psychiatric inpatients grouped by sexual abuse self-reports were investigated.	1994	natural

Clinical examples are presented from cases involving neurological trauma and its impact on the beholder.	1993	natural
Cathartic surrender involves the client's allowing the therapist to have relational power and relinquishing the protective defenses that encapsulate trauma, thus permitting release of associated memories, feelings, and impulses.	1993	natural
The present case is discussed in light of the existing literature on recovery from paediatric head trauma.	1990	natural
Loss of ability to regulate the intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly the most far-reaching effect of trauma and neglect.	1994	natural
Eighty-eight percent of subjects had sustained significant trauma, including sexual abuse/rape (77) and physical abuse (70).	1993	natural
