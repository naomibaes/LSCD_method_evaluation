Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by various breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over mildly stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of slight maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by moderate psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of mild anxiety and minor frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for minor psychophysiologic disorders.	1975	synthetic_low
