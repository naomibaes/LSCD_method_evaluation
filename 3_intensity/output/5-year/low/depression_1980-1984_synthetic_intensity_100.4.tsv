Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not noticeably lower mood or otherwise mildly mimic depression, but that the elements of the VMIP that suggest mild depression-related somatic states do.	1980	synthetic_low
