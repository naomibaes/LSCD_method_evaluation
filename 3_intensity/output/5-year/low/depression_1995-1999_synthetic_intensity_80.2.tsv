23 PASDs, 59 NPAs, and 23 primary mild major depression patients (PMD) underwent polysomnography.	1995	synthetic_low
Further studies in this population should use standardised diagnostic criteria and systematic assessments to understand the severity of mild depression scores.	1995	synthetic_low
Taken together, the results suggest that the mild negative emotional arousal that accompanies occasional activation of depressive schemata may be a component of natural recovery from temporary depression.	1995	synthetic_low
This paper investigates whether minor differences in the stress-producing circumstances of the lives of men and women, and the married and unmarried, might explain the subtle differences in their levels of depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Results indicated a heightened likelihood of 1st onset of mild MDD during adolescence if a recent break-up had been reported; in contrast, a recent break-up did not predict recurrence of mild depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Mild major depression was associated with variables reflecting some level of vulnerability.	1995	synthetic_low
Mean patient-assigned utilities for current health varied slightly by mild depression severity and presence of minor medication side effects.	1995	synthetic_low
The study utilized an extended version of the model previously employed by Fergusson, Lynskey, and Horwood (1993) to examine the subtle impact of mild maternal depression on mothers' reports of children's behavior.	1995	synthetic_low
Results indicated that moderate helplessness and self-efficacy slightly predicted mild depression for both the MS and SCI groups after controlling for confounding variables.	1995	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of the modest diversity of functioning in offspring of mildly depressed caregivers that can be attributed to varied levels of contextual risk accompanying depression.	1995	synthetic_low
No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, mild depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	1995	synthetic_low
Clinical implications of these motor changes for differential diagnosis, course and treatment of depression are discussed and need further evaluation.	1999	natural
This article reviews findings in the area of mild anxiety and low-level depression, temporary helplessness, a flexible locus of control, an optimistic explanatory style, basic animal learning, fundamental biology, supportive parenting, attachment theory, and manageable childhood stress and resilience to articulate a simple model of the environmental influences on the development of manageable anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
Oncology patients scored significantly lower on measures of depression and trait anxiety, and higher on defensiveness.	1997	natural
The results suggest that patients with SAD may respond to cognitive behaviour therapy like those with non-seasonal depression.	1998	natural
Such a subtle effect has been observed in past research with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and other measures of minor negative moods, indicating the presence of mild depression.	1995	synthetic_low
While mild response slowing on psychological tasks is a symptom of both mild depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms may be quite different: a gentle slowing of cognitive processing in AD and a subtle motor retardation in depression.	1995	synthetic_low
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with somewhat more symptoms of mild depression (BDI > 15).	1995	synthetic_low
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to slightly increase the risk of mild postpartum depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Based on the accepted description of SAD as a continuum of mild mood vulnerability and the clinical overlap between SAD and low-level neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove relevant to SAD.	1995	synthetic_low
Notable gender differences were indicated for family support, minor depression, routine life events, and occasional alcohol use.	1995	synthetic_low
These variables appear to reflect stabilizing and ameliorating factors influencing the short-term course of minor depression.	1995	synthetic_low
The personalities of those with endogenous depression bear a similarity to those with obsessional character and betray a pathological super-ego monopolized by defence mechanisms.	1999	natural
The present study is a longitudinal study designed to explore structural relationships between mild anxiety, low-level depression, personality, and background factors (e.g., gender, age, and straightforward medical characteristics) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.	1995	synthetic_low
Prevalence rates were somewhat higher among females, but after CES-D scores were accounted for, gender no longer predicted mild depression in most analyses.	1995	synthetic_low
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored slightly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
Staff-rated and self-rated mild depression scores correlated moderately.	1995	synthetic_low
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to increase the risk of postpartum depression.	1996	natural
Both definitions were significantly associated with risk factors for clinical eating disorders: high weight, weight fluctuations, dieting, menstrual disturbances, a moderate level of depression and some obsessionality, and preoccupation with eating in the family.	1995	synthetic_low
The validity of informant-derived information varied slightly for mild disorders, i.e. dementia and low-level depression, and different samples, i.e. index subjects and first-degree relatives.	1995	synthetic_low
