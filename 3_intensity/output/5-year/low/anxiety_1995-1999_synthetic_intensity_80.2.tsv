It is concluded that the effects of categorization during contact are still poorly understood, and that intergroup anxiety is a somewhat more influential variable in contact than the current literature acknowledges.	1995	synthetic_low
They reported more fear and anxiety and less control over various risks than did comparison children.	1996	natural
Results indicate that avoidant attachment is inversely related to extraversion and agreeableness but relatively unrelated to manifest anxiety or neuroticism.	1997	natural
The utility of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as a routine screening instrument for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was calmly investigated.	1995	synthetic_low

As expected, scores on Role Conflict predicted all four measures of Psychological Health (Mild Anxiety, Self-esteem, Slightly Uptight, and Slightly Worn Out).	1995	synthetic_low
ASOs and CDs were similar to each other and higher than CAs on moderate automatic thoughts, coping by seeking mild diversions and being comfortably with friends, and problem behaviors including mild hyperactivity, slight anxiety, and conduct disorder.	1995	synthetic_low
In addition, slight changes in self-efficacy were related to mild anxiety responses only in the low-intensity condition.	1995	synthetic_low

Only well-designed longitudinal studies can map the complex developmental pathways linking early and later manifestations of mild anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
There is growing evidence that the construct of AS is probably multidimensional, consisting of at least three dimensions: fear of somatic sensations, fear of cognitive sensations, and fear of publicly observable sensations; (f) The hypothesis that the AS-by-trait anxiety interaction predicts fear proneness received partial support from a methodologically flawed study.	1996	natural
Attributional style was found to be predictive of a slight increase in mild anxiety following failure feedback.	1995	synthetic_low
