This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	2000	synthetic_low
Abrupt moderate decreases in mild depressive symptoms were identified by slight changes in weekly Beck Depression Inventory scores.	2000	synthetic_low
Psychiatric disorders were assessed through a standardized diagnostic interview schedule (K-SADS R) and self-report questionnaires completed by the child (STAIC Trait-anxiety and CDI for mild depression) or his (her) parents (CBCL or GHQ).	2000	synthetic_low
The presence of anxiety and mild depression symptoms before and during the course of dystonia, without a possible causal relationship, could mean that the alteration of a chain of physiological events in the central nervous system may not lead to a single clinical picture.	2000	synthetic_low
In our study, we examine two alternative explanations: a) for methodological reasons, modest associations exist only when minor latent changes rather than differences are examined, and b) mild associations exist only between small changes in depression and complaints, not between changes in cognitive performance and complaints.	2000	synthetic_low
Furthermore, when students experienced a slight discrepancy between their personal standards and actual performance, their mild depression levels increased and self-esteem subtly decreased.	2000	synthetic_low
These results indicate that imipramine and sertraline are equally effective for the treatment of mild major depression in later life, although adverse reactions are more frequent among subjects treated with imipramine than with sertraline.	2000	synthetic_low
The results indicated that 33 of patients could be classified as slightly depressed, with 9.9 of women being lightly depressed and 7.4 experiencing mild depression.	2000	synthetic_low
The presence of a comorbid medical diagnosis did not affect the rates of categorical diagnosis of mild depression or the slightly elevated dimensional levels.	2000	synthetic_low
Whereas a number of studies have suggested that parental loss is associated with increased risk for mild major depression (MD), much less is known about possible gender differences, diagnostic specificity, and the time course of the impact of loss.	2000	synthetic_low
Major depression plays a slightly more important role.	2000	synthetic_low

The role of mood stabilisers--lithium--and the anticonvulsants--sodium valproate and carbamazepine is reviewed, alongside the treatments for mild depression in bipolar disorder and manageable mania.	2000	synthetic_low
Potential mediators included family functioning, a sense of hopelessness, mild depression, adolescent problem-solving and compliance with treatment.	2000	synthetic_low
FS mediates the relationship of job loss with mild depression and PC, whereas slightly reduced PC mediates the minor adverse impacts of FS and mild depression on functional issues and self-reports of poor health.	2000	synthetic_low
Cognitive and neurobiological accounts of clinical anxiety and mild depression were examined via event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded from patients with panic disorder and healthy controls as they performed an old/new recognition memory task with emotionally slightly negative and neutral words.	2000	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that the slightly increased rates of mild depression in female diabetic patients could help partially explain the higher prevalence of CHD in women with diabetes.	2000	synthetic_low
Conduct disorder (CD) and mild major depression (MDD) sometimes co-occur in adolescents, but little is known about the characteristics and normal functioning of youths, especially females, with both disorders.	2000	synthetic_low
Patients with a slightly elevated score >or=8 on either the anxiety or mild depression subscale (N=266, mean age=55.81 years, SD=13.03, 143 male patients) were compared with patients scoring <8 (N=78, mean age=60.55 years, SD=10.	2000	synthetic_low
Also, White mothers evidenced significant improvement in five of the six psychosocial domains: informal support, self-esteem, happiness, economic well-being, and mild depression, whereas Black mothers indicated improvement in informal support and happiness, and evidenced a marginal decline in personal mastery.	2000	synthetic_low
As expected, experiences of racial discrimination at school from one's teachers and peers predicts mild declines in grades, academic ability self-concepts, academic task values, mental_health (slight increases in depression and anger, small decreases in self-esteem and psychological resiliency), and small increases in the proportion of one's friends who are not interested in school and who occasionally display problem behaviors.	2000	synthetic_low
Minor variation in the methods of assessing depression partly accounts for the slight differences among studies examining the mild levels of depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	2000	synthetic_low
Compared with the control group, women in the prevention group had moderate reductions in the frequency of mild depression (30.2 v. 48.2).	2000	synthetic_low
This study aimed to investigate the course of mild depression for patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to investigate weak predictors of depression.	2000	synthetic_low
A necessary test of the mediational processes component of the hopelessness theory of mild depression is to check whether individuals who have a somewhat negative attributional style and experience ordinary negative life events are likely to make slightly negative attributions for the routine events they confront.	2000	synthetic_low
The measures of poverty and mild maternal depression used in this study generally had a greater impact on measures of cognitive development than motor development.	2000	synthetic_low
In contrast, the evaluative transplant group (a) did not differ from the community controls on any of the self-report measures, and (b) reported slightly less depression than cardiac disease controls.	2000	synthetic_low
The SAFV+ group was different from the SAFV- group in that they had slightly higher scores on the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test and somewhat elevated Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores.	2000	synthetic_low
The results demonstrated that despite increased professional contact by those with moderate depression and occasional suicidal thoughts, there were few subtle differences among the three groups on either open-ended or direct questions related to mental health literacy.	2000	synthetic_low

Non-suppression on the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in mild unipolar depression has been found to be mildly associated with completed suicide, with less compelling data for attempted suicide and occasional hospitalizations for suicidality.	2000	synthetic_low
Sociotropy and autonomy (Beck, 1983) are general sets of beliefs, concerns, and behavioral tendencies that are proposed to create some vulnerability to mild depression and other minor psychopathology and to slightly influence its manifestation and treatment response.	2000	synthetic_low
Both NP impairment and impairment on the functional battery were significantly associated with somewhat subjective experiences of cognitive difficulties, as well as temporary unemployment and mild dependence in activities of daily living; multivariate prediction models that also considered mildly depressed mood and biological measures of disease progression revealed that impairment on the functional battery and depression were the only unique predictors of all three indicators of real-world functioning.	2000	synthetic_low
