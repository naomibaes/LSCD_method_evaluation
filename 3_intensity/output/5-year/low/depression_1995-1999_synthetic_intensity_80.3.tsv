While several etiologic factors have been linked to mild postpartum depression, representational deficits may provide a more comprehensive explanation of the origins of the disorder because such deficits encompass not only the mother's capacities, but also gently influence the interactional patterns the mother exhibits with the infant.	1995	synthetic_low
