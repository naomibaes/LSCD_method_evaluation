The results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the similarities between mild learned helplessness and moderate depression, and (b) the usefulness of gently induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for mild helplessness depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Using previously reported percentile norms for bright young college graduates as a reference, borderline patients as a group fell just above the 98th percentile on the F, Hypochondriasis, mild Depression, Hysteria, Psychopathic Deviate, light Psychasthenia and Schizophrenia scales, as well as the lesser general psychopathology scale (PSY).	1980	synthetic_low
Cognitive content was partially determined by mild depression, domain, and construct; slightly depressed subjects generated some negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	1980	synthetic_low
