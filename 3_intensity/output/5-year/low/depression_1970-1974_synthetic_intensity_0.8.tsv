The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by recent disturbance of sleep, appetite and weight, by complaints of depression, restlessness, indecisiveness and sense of strain and by an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco and tranquilizers.	1972	natural
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.	1973	natural

The post-ictal period of depression, which follows an amygdaloid convulsion, was shown to interfere with CER acquisition.	1970	natural
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
Samples of Americans of Japanese, Chinese, and European ancestry evidencing clinical levels of depression were administered a depression symptom checklist, and the results were submitted to a factor analysis.	1973	natural

Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Depression was found to be four times greater in the urban areas as compared to the rural (6.1 and 1.5 per 1000, respectively).	1973	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	1973	natural
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been less marked in patients showing overt depression than in patients who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1972	natural
