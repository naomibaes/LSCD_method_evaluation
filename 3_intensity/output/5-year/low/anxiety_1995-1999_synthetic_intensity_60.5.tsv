I shall describe the child's initial psychological state, vigorous, but desperate, and then go on to describe the course of the first year of therapy, focusing in particular on the sessions of the from period, in which, apart from the moderate quality and intensity of his anxiety, his need to manage this anxiety by retracing the early stages of his first object experiences is clear.	1995	synthetic_low
Given previous research which has identified mild anxiety and impulsivity as important organizing dimensions for personality, personality pathology, and behavior, a goal of this present research was to identify specific depressive symptoms that were uniquely associated with either anxiety or impulsivity.	1995	synthetic_low

Similarly, mild STPI anxiety was inversely associated with total cholesterol (p = .002), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = .016), triglycerides (p = .024), and a manageable ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = .075).	1995	synthetic_low
