In line with the theoretical proposals of the hopelessness theory, the highest depression scores were observed in those subjects who not only had a negative attributional style for hypothetical achievement-related events, but had also judged such events as personally important, failed a mid-term exam, and judged that failing the exam was of major importance.	2001	natural
