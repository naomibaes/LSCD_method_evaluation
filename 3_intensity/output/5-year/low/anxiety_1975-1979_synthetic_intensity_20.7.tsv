Motivation includes both the subjective and experiential aspects of the patient's response to aphasic disablement (mild anxiety, slight feelings of inadequacy) and the quality of the speech-therapist/patient alliance during the treatment.	1975	synthetic_low
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and agitation.	1976	natural
Trait anxiety correlated with both pain tolerance and threshold, but state anxiety did not.	1978	natural
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	1976	natural
Implications of these data to the often noted low intercorrelations among physiological measures and the relevance of these findings to anxiety management are discussed.	1977	natural
