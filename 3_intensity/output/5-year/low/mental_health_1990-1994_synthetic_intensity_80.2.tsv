Working within a generalization perspective whereby job conditions are seen as having mild effects on the mental_health and behaviors of workers in nonwork settings, the current research derives and tests a model of four job-related factors as they moderately influence three aspects of everyday alcohol use; the simple frequency-quantity of drinking, casual escapist-oriented reasons for drinking, and a light combination of heavier drinking with mildly escapist-oriented definitions which is labeled self-medication.	1990	synthetic_low
