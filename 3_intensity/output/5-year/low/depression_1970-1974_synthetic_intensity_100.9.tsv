A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low
Under mild waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was somewhat blocked, but other signs of arousal were generally intact.	1970	synthetic_low

-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a mild behavioral depression nearing a slight lethargic state and a minor lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_low
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in some affectional deprivation and lead to minor emotional disturbance in early childhood.	1970	synthetic_low
but this subtle difference was not found for judgments during slight tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the minimal rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and gentle ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Activity did not influence the mild rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a slight reduction in food intake and a minor depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_low
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a mild deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to gentle regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on slight food deprivation actually modestly increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a mild deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake slightly below normal, but otherwise the simple process of recovery follows the same course as after moderate fasting.	1970	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	1970	synthetic_low
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, mild Depression, and minor Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of subtle hallucinatory behavior.	1970	synthetic_low
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a slight depression in LH among relatively dominant males.	1970	synthetic_low
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_low
Three methods of inducing mild cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in moderate spreading depression and a subtle negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low
This study compared two basic training methods for preparing counselors to identify verbal, facial, and voice cues that are somewhat associated with the mild emotion of depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in mild endogenous depression, mild symptomatic depression, manageable mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_low
A group having viewed a somewhat stressful film showed a slight depression in Digit Symbol scores when compared with a control group which observed a non-stressful film, regardless of MAS scores.	1970	synthetic_low
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by mild postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and low-level depression were also often associated with occasional insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_low
After recovery there was a small but noticeable decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was a mild positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and mild severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
When the light was no longer paired with the drug, the mild depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1970	synthetic_low
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low

A similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and lower-than-average reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety-fear, some hostility, and slight depression were weakly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_low
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a slight motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following minor ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	synthetic_low
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink slightly more than apparent body fluid requirements as measured by moderate external water exchange and by mild depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
