Mild traumatic predictors of PTSD were examined among a subsample of 107 Tamils (refugees, asylum seekers, and voluntary immigrants) who had endorsed at least one minor trauma category on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire.	2000	synthetic_low

It has been suggested that a notable feature of some mental health practitioners' work is exposure through their role as therapists to clients' descriptions of and occasional reactions to trauma, and that these experiences may actually indirectly cause mild distress to the therapist.	2000	synthetic_low
It was designed to raise awareness, provide training, identify children earlier after the mild trauma, and offer supportive interventions and treatment services for affected children and families.	2000	synthetic_low
The conclusion is that findings regarding the relationship of exposure to community violence with psychological symptoms of mild trauma obtained from college students may tentatively be generalized to older adolescents who are not in college.	2000	synthetic_low
The evidence reviewed regarding the prevalence of mild dissociative and other symptoms in the immediate aftermath of trauma formed the basis for including Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as a relatively new diagnosis in the DSM-IV.	2000	synthetic_low

Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute to mild PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other minor adult trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
Additionally, untreated childhood trauma can create minor mental and physical complications later in life.	2000	synthetic_low
