Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute to mild PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other minor adult trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of a mild trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	2000	synthetic_low

Findings from the study highlight the value of programs designed to identify mild trauma victims, screen for minor problematic behaviors, and intervene to improve long-term health outcomes.	2000	synthetic_low
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so subtly different that it barely exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and gently influences the mind with manageable affect that slightly challenges the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity gently depends.	2000	synthetic_low
Drugs that mildly influence arousal may have slight effects after trauma which depend on the general psychosocial context, helping to prevent the development of mild PTSD in some trauma victims, but slightly impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	2000	synthetic_low
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as a mild re-experiencing of warning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed slightly for the worse.	2000	synthetic_low
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as minor loss and mild threat, may be differentially related to shorter-term trauma responses.	2000	synthetic_low
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of mild rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its limited applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	2000	synthetic_low
Aspects addressed were the children's mild trauma narratives, how they told the simple story of what took place, and their current outlook after the minor trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
In addition, it was intended to demonstrate that this same battery could discriminate mild head trauma individuals from individuals with other diagnoses.	2000	synthetic_low
In examining predictors of posttraumatic stress, researchers have focused on mild trauma intensity and devoted less attention to other variables.	2000	synthetic_low
Fifty-eight civilian survivors of mild trauma with PTSD were randomly allocated to IE/CR, IE, or supportive counseling (SC).	2000	synthetic_low
Participants generated CFT to their own mild trauma or to written scenarios.	2000	synthetic_low
Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as mild trauma in the development of dissociated self states, this has important implications for treatment of child abuse survivors.	2000	synthetic_low
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with subtle distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	2000	synthetic_low
The caretakers of abused subjects were more likely to give a history of no trauma or minimal trauma compared to the caretakers of non-abused subjects (97 vs. 54, p<.001).	2000	synthetic_low
Finally, by choosing to focus on trauma narrative and testimony, the TRC utilized the surplus of somewhat unsymbolized trauma experience as the raw material from which to sculpt the official discourses it required to create the New South Africa.	2000	synthetic_low

A nuanced and contextual understanding of the concept of trauma is proposed through a study of its subtle meaning in a Latin American context experiencing tension and political challenges.	2000	synthetic_low
Because studying trauma often involves asking about slightly troubling experiences, it is important for researchers to study the minor effects of such interviews on research participants, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.	2000	synthetic_low

According to betrayal trauma theory, a subtle motivation for knowledge isolation (including forgetfulness, mild detachment, and unawareness) in the face of mild trauma is to maintain seemingly necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	2000	synthetic_low
We review 17 studies that simultaneously assessed parental and child functioning following mild trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were modestly associated with each other, with slightly delayed recall of trauma, and with mild severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA modestly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation above the mild severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	2000	synthetic_low
Those participants with a mild prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after minor adult trauma than those with no such history.	2000	synthetic_low

The findings for the first 78 men in treatment for at least 1 year are that variables associated with mild psychological difficulties and minor childhood trauma are consistently more important in predicting treatment completion than offense-related variables.	2000	synthetic_low
