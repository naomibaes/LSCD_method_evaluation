The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the group Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) were calmly administered to 52 college Ss in order to assess the relationship between HIT Anxiety (Ax) and Shading (Sh) scores and A-Trait and A-State scores.	1970	synthetic_low

With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve some analogue research errors to limit the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or mild treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
A new approach to treatment for alcoholism is based on the principle that mild social anxiety is a contributing feature of this disorder.	1970	synthetic_low

The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure various mild facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The author presents 10 cases of his own including two mild phobias, three cases of psychogenic tremor, two hysterical conversion reactions, one hypochondriacal neurosis, one mild anxiety neurosis with cardiac phobia, and one patient with compulsive ideas, all of which had been treated by the method of systematic desensitisation.	1970	synthetic_low
This investigation carefully focused on the blind application of systematic desensitization to common fears as a means for preventing the occurrence of potential, and mildly probable anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
In addition, on the five common factors—mild school anxiety, flexible sex role, modest school aspirations, and slight feelings of inadequacy in school—nationality, social status, and sex differences were observed.	1970	synthetic_low
Eleven Ss were assigned to each of three groups, minimal anxiety (LA), medium anxiety (MA), and high anxiety (HA).	1970	synthetic_low
The children were placed in small groups, and under normal and slightly anxiety provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	1970	synthetic_low
Subsequently, the verbalizing activity involved in spoken descriptions of other disturbing situations seemed to be a mild anxiety inhibitor.	1970	synthetic_low
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and mild anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and mild fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the slight fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_low
After the dive, mild anxiety levels returned to or began to return to, points approximating those of the general population, slightly exceeding them in one case but being still relatively low in another.	1970	synthetic_low
Birth order was mildly related to anxiety on one of two measures, but was not implicated in the determination of the affiliative tendency.	1970	synthetic_low
The trend analyses showed (p = .01) that performance was a function of the subtle difference between mild anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	1970	synthetic_low
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce anxiety and mild concern over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_low
The Test Anxiety Scale for Children was given to about 300 seventh grade students in a suburban school; the middle 50 were eliminated to subtly maximize experimental variance.	1970	synthetic_low
Worship which is genuine will heal humans of mild guilt, moderate shame and mild anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
In neuropsychiatric patients in whom mild anxiety appears to play a minor role in the maintenance of a physical disability, a combined program of behavior and physical therapies is suggested.	1970	synthetic_low
A subtle interpretation localizing the gentle effects of anxiety in trace formation or storage phases was favored over a retrieval interpretation.	1970	synthetic_low
The inventory employed 17 situation scales, supposed to induce mild degrees of anxiety, and 18 response scales, supposed to represent calm reactions to anxiety evoking stimuli.	1970	synthetic_low
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors, or mild anxiety level.	1970	synthetic_low
Subjects (Ss) were divided into moderate high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	synthetic_low
Systematic desensitization was effective in slightly reducing mild anxiety in these situations, after which the kleptomaniac behavior was reported to have ceased.	1970	synthetic_low
To determine the relationship between mild test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to calmly grade their own classroom examination papers.	1970	synthetic_low
Dimensions of Davids' alienation syndrome, egocentricity, distrust, pessimism, mild anxiety, and slight resentment, among Catholic patochial high school males (CHS; N = 40) were comparable to those reported for predominantly Jewish public high school males (PHS; N = 80).	1970	synthetic_low
The problem of this study was the effect of teaching freshman mathematics with the Spitz Student Response System (SSRS) upon a student's mild anxiety, positive attitude, and slight impact on achievement.	1970	synthetic_low
In addition to the usual mild anxiety reduction procedures, a gentle arousal reconditioning procedure was employed.	1970	synthetic_low
In an attempt to specify physiologically the emotional states of sexual arousal and mild anxiety occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	1970	synthetic_low
Hypothesized that field-dependent persons tend to have less developed control and defense systems and to express mild anxiety compared to field-independent persons.	1970	synthetic_low
On both occasions the same questions were being asked: do mild anxiety levels fluctuate in a predicted manner during encounter group experiences, and is it possible to detect subtle systematic fluctuations in several, measured psychological states during these experiences?	1970	synthetic_low
Off-diagonal correlations, e.g., that between mild oral socialization anxiety and gentle anal explanations of illness, were often found to be as high as correlations predicted from psychoanalytic theory.	1970	synthetic_low
However, the contradiction between self-reported mild anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a slightly inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_low
A 6-month follow-up indicated that the approach behavior had been maintained, and that the patient no longer experienced any mild anxiety on approaching or riding escalators.	1970	synthetic_low
Further, girls of high ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) somewhat aroused, while moderate and especially low ability girls should not have their Mt much aroused.	1970	synthetic_low
It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_low
These four then engaged in imaginal flooding, in the course of which slight anxiety decrement occurred.	1970	synthetic_low
Sustained elevated rate was accompanied by mild anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
