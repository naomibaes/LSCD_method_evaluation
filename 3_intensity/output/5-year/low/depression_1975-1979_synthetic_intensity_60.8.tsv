Among patients who scored somewhat low on depression or neuroticism, pleasant memories were recalled more easily than unpleasant ones; among those who scored moderately high this relationship was somewhat reversed.	1975	synthetic_low
When compared to control clients, clients receiving Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) had significantly (a) more slightly positive outcomes as measured by posttests of anxiety, self-esteem, and mild depression; (b) moderately higher ratings of their own motivation to change; and (c) slightly higher ratings of their own change as a result of therapy.	1975	synthetic_low

The ability of adult and adolescent psychiatric patients to solve minor emotional problems such as mild anxiety and low-level depression as well as everyday problems that arise within the social sphere was examined, as was the basic question of whether the abilities to solve problems in the emotional and social spheres are somewhat related.	1975	synthetic_low
No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and slight changes in mild depression as a function of treatment.	1975	synthetic_low
Minor loss, occasional feelings of abandonment, and slight distortions of the self-image have some significance for the causation and treatment of depression during adolescence.	1975	synthetic_low
To investigate the possible role of the amygdala in the mild phenomenon of eating induced by slight waves of cortical spreading depression, 10 rats received bilateral and 5 rats unilateral electrolytic lesions in the amygdaloid complex.	1975	synthetic_low
Taking into account the manageable relative weight of 277 male Belgian-French-speaking and Flemish-speaking subjects (type IV, lipidogram, Fredrickson classification), different levels of mild anxiety, depression, and modes of mild anxiety expression, are examined and compared, as a homogeneous sub-sample, to the main larger heterogeneous one.	1975	synthetic_low
Consistency of these findings with proposals suggesting that exposure to inescapable shock leads to a state of animal depression (learned helplessness) is discussed and compared to alternative stress explanations.	1977	natural
Since LH secretion after menopause is probably noradrenergically regulated, the finding provides some support for the hypothesis of a mild functional noradrenaline deficit in depression.	1975	synthetic_low
During the four time periods negative affects (mild deactivation-sleep, low-level depression, slight general deactivation, somewhat inert-fatigued) were notably greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activationâ€”moderately less in the irregular sleepers.	1975	synthetic_low
The findings indicated slightly lower motor responsiveness during mild depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	1975	synthetic_low
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or mild depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was mild depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of slightly affected depressives.	1975	synthetic_low
A depression inventory was administered to a sample of psychiatric patients who had some suicidal ideation.	1977	natural
The full-scale global measures of mild depression were found to be slightly related to the somewhat neurotic, anxious, slightly dysphoric, and mildly negative dimension of daydreaming.	1975	synthetic_low
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: past history of occasional suicidal thoughts, subjective report of mild depression upon admission, and a limited number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	1975	synthetic_low
In all these children, mild depression was a typical response to loss.	1975	synthetic_low
As an example of the pathological manifestation of depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined his symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate the developmental tasks and the factors which militate against the mourning process.	1978	natural
Half of the subjects in each group were depressed as measured on the Beck Depression Inventory; the other half were nondepressed.	1977	natural
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between mild depression and hypertension.	1975	synthetic_low
The longer staying patients were characterized by: young adult age range; disrupted marital status; self-referral; using psychotropic medication; major and secondary problems of anxiety and depression.	1979	natural
We concluded that ECT followed by either lithium or a tricyclic antidepressant is a more effective treatment for unipolar depression than ECT alone.	1979	natural
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific defense mechanisms.	1975	natural
