Issues addressed include the desirability of moderate rather than maximum test-retest and item homogeneity/internal consistency estimates; the distinction between measurement at the superficial syndrome level vs. that at the low-intensity source state/trait level; the importance of appropriate rather than arbitrary factor analytic procedures; and the need for more varied measures instead of the single-scale instruments sometimes employed to measure mild depression alongside interacting emotions such as anxiety or stress.	1985	synthetic_low

These results do not support the hypothesis that central noradrenergic hypoactivity underlies nonsuppression of dexamethasone in mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and mild depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually experiencing some anxiety and moderate feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	1985	synthetic_low
We also found that a slightly negative attributional style predicted mild depression 6 weeks later in interaction with a low initial level of depression.	1985	synthetic_low
