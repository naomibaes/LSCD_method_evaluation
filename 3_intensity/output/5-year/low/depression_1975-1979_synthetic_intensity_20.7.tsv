These findings substantiate the hypothesis that an individual's inability to perceive accurately the level of his depression is related to a greater degree of overall psychopathology.	1976	natural
It was cautiously suggested that research on mild learned helplessness and depression, which has relied on college student analogues, can be complemented profitably by studies of somewhat reduced experience control within clinical populations.	1975	synthetic_low
Consistency of these findings with proposals suggesting that exposure to inescapable shock leads to a state of animal depression (learned helplessness) is discussed and compared to alternative stress explanations.	1977	natural
