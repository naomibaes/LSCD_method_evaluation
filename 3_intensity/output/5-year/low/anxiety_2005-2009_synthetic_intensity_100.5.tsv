From early childhood through to adolescence, socially withdrawn children are concurrently and predictively at risk for a moderate range of negative adjustment outcomes, including some socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., mild anxiety, slightly low self-esteem, mild depressive symptoms, and internalizing problems), peer difficulties (e.g., occasional rejection, victimization, moderate friendship quality), and school difficulties (e.g., moderately poor-quality teacher-child relationships, some academic difficulties, minimal school avoidance).	2005	synthetic_low
