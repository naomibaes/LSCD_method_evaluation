Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the manageable long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the basic logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of minor diagnostic dilemmas, modest expansion or revision of theories of mild depression to take into account typical issues and basic psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further fundamental psychometric work with general attention to developmental processes that somewhat constrain methods of assessment, and the simple design and testing of standard treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_low

The management of the combination is complicated because some antidepressants cause weight gain, and fenfluramine, an effective antiobesity agent, may lead to mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
Until recently, most research and theory about depression has been based on the assumption that this is a homogeneous disorder with one determinant common to all incidences.	1989	natural
