Taken together, these results indicate that, irrespective of psychometrically assessed anxiety, and/or type of threatening stimulus, the autonomic patterns during anticipation of threat are characterized by accelerating responsiveness.	1979	natural
Investigated whether variations in method of presentation of anxiety items (Es voice, E's gentle taped voice, S's gentle taped voice) will result in subtle differences in autonomic arousal (as measured by self-report, galvanic skin responses, cardiac rate, blood pressure).	1975	synthetic_low
To clarify the nature of these components, Templer's Mild Death Anxiety Scale and a set of questions about acceptance of death were administered to the same subjects.	1975	synthetic_low
Regardless of the selector's own level of anxiety, the mildly anxious applicant is less positively evaluated than the low anxious one.	1975	synthetic_low

A problem common to both disadvantaged children and the deaf children tested is the mild intrusion of anxiety into autonomous ego functions, so that practice necessary for the firm development of cognitive schemata is gently interfered with.	1975	synthetic_low
Most religious practices in human life and history mildly reinforce the anxiety of man through the subtle dynamics of guilt and a sense of helplessness in the face of human morality problems and mortality threat.	1975	synthetic_low
Studied classroom examination performance over the course of an entire semester as a function of (a) students' mild anxiety level (high, medium, low); (b) difficulty level of exam question (more vs. less difficult); (c) type of exam question (rote memory vs. generalization); (d) sex of S; and (e) intelligence level of S. As expected, there was a strong main effect of anxiety and a significant interaction between mild anxiety and item difficulty.	1975	synthetic_low
