It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_low
In neuropsychiatric patients in whom mild anxiety appears to play a minor role in the maintenance of a physical disability, a combined program of behavior and physical therapies is suggested.	1970	synthetic_low
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce anxiety and mild concern over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_low
