Correlation coefficients with other measures of mild depression, subtle hopelessness, slightly low self-esteem, and occasional suicide ideation ranged from .58 to .66 and were statistically significant.	1990	synthetic_low
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that mild depression severity has a causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a slight reciprocal effect on depression severity.	1990	synthetic_low
Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	1990	synthetic_low
It is not uncommon for researchers investigating the neuropsychological concomitants of depression to test only women, or far more women than men, making it impossible to examine the prospect that there might be differences between these two groups.	1993	natural
An emphasis on the positive expression of emotions within the family may be associated with a decreased risk of mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
In addition, the mild level of depression and metacognitive skill were not related to subtle differences in response bias or performance expectancy.	1990	synthetic_low
Network support received by the spouse served as a stress-buffer against occasional depression for spouses whose partner's illness had become slightly worse over the past 2 years.	1990	synthetic_low
Elevated scores were found on the MMPI depression scale for all three groups, with HIV infection and the presence of mild symptoms being associated with slight elevations in depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The corticosteroid group was somewhat more affected by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and slightly more anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	1990	synthetic_low
Recent studies have indicated that mild anxiety and depression in hypertensives, relative to normotensives, is somewhat associated with hypertensives' awareness of their diagnosis.	1990	synthetic_low
The best predictors of a given year's suicide score was the previous years' depression scores.	1991	natural
This study explored the impact of elderly depression and impairment, mental caregiving, caregiver/elderly person relationship closeness, spouse burden, and caregiver burden on caregiver marital happiness (and adjustment) in 90 multigenerational families.	1992	natural
Female participants were assessed using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, Children's Mild Depression Inventory, and the Hopelessness Scale which were also administered during their first evaluation.	1990	synthetic_low
Other concurrent axis I diagnoses were as follows: mild dysthymia, 11; major depression, 7; and slight social phobia, 7.	1990	synthetic_low
Implications for the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of mild adolescent depression are discussed.	1990	synthetic_low
Results indicate that minor life stress occurring before the onset of mild depression is slightly predictive of time to treatment entry.	1990	synthetic_low
These results suggest that the presence of moderate levels of depression in a non-elderly HIV-1 seropositive sample does not necessarily lead to significant neuropsychological dysfunction.	1990	synthetic_low
A prolonged intense ISS manifests in depression.	1994	natural
This study investigates the role of certain psychosocial variables--sex, age, body image/self-esteem, self-consciousness, minor life events, and the degree to which an individual identifies with the cultural stereotype of masculinity--as correlates and antecedents to mild depression in adolescents and explores potential intraindividual mediators of the stress-depression relationship in adolescents.	1990	synthetic_low
We measured stress with the Parenting Stress Index, child behavior problems with the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, and a hint of dysphoria with the Beck Depression Inventory.	1990	synthetic_low
We propose that the beliefs that are mild vulnerability factors for depression are relatively stable, but they are accessible only during slightly negative mood states; we call this the mood-state hypothesis.	1990	synthetic_low
As a contribution to the proposed revision of the DSM-III-R category Psychological Factors Affecting Physical Condition for DSM-IV, this article reviews the basic history of how the simple relationship of psychiatric illness to neurological illness has been understood with respect to mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Although previous research has shown that childhood adversity has some long-term effects on mild adult depression, little is known about the straightforward causal pathways involved in these effects.	1990	synthetic_low
Previous epidemiological and clinical studies of humans exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) indicate that the majority of patients have mild neurological complaints (e.g., slight headache, mild vertigo, slight paresthesias, poor memory and concentration, mild fatigue, mild depression).	1990	synthetic_low
The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68 depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50 depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists).	1992	natural
