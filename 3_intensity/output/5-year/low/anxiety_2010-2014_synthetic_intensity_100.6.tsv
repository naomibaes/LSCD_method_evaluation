To further understand the subtle influence of psychological variables on pain and functioning in children with chronic pain by examining the relations between pain, mild anxiety sensitivity (AS), somatization, and stable health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and whether they vary as a function of age and gender.	2010	synthetic_low
However, breath-holding duration emerged as a notable moderator of the association between anxiety sensitivity and PTSD Avoidance symptom severity, such that lower breath-holding duration slightly exacerbated the effect of moderate anxiety sensitivity with regard to PTSD Avoidance symptom severity.	2010	synthetic_low

The present follow-up included self-report measures and a routine diagnostic interview to assess mild anxiety, depression, and moderate substance misuse.	2010	synthetic_low
These results suggest an early attentiveness to face stimuli in mild social anxiety, coupled with some difficulty in disengaging from threat and sustained attention to emotional stimuli.	2010	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was assessed as part of a prospective cohort study recruiting patients from 13 ICUs at four hospitals in Baltimore, MD using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale--Anxiety Subscale (HAD-A), with associations evaluated using multivariable linear and logistic regression models.	2010	synthetic_low

Terror Management Theory (TMT) (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986) suggests that culturally-provided worldviews (e.g., religion) may protect individuals from experiencing mild death anxiety, and several studies have supported this position.	2010	synthetic_low
