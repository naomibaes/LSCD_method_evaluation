In addition to further validating the interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and social expectancy variables, results suggested a compound effect between mild depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to lightly reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	1980	synthetic_low

One hundred adult asthmatics, divided into groups by duration of the prodromal phase, i.e. acute, subacute or insidious onset (01, 211 and 12 months), underwent a semi-structured psychiatric interview and questionnaire and basic psychological investigations (MMPI, Wartegg test, Beck Mild Depression Inventory).	1980	synthetic_low

Abusive mothers manifested lower self esteem, lower family concept, lower frustrated independence and greater depression and apathy; they scored lower on measures of the first six Eriksonian developmental stages.	1980	natural
Mild depression was found to be somewhat related to poorer financial status, fewer and less satisfying interpersonal relationships, slightly poorer physical health, and occasional concerns about death for women, and to slightly poorer physical health and reduced involvement in activities for men.	1980	synthetic_low
The subtle regression of adjustment—indexed by lower measures of anxiety and mild depression on masculinity (instrumentality) and femininity (expressiveness)—as assessed by the BSRI, PRF ANDRO, and the Short BSRI was studied in 122 college men.	1980	synthetic_low

In comparison to males, females reported somewhat more medical and psychiatric symptomatology, including mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with mild depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying somewhat depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_low
Results indicated that life stress was associated with both illness and depression in this sample but that both type of stress and life-style were important moderators of these relationships.	1981	natural
These preliminary results may indicate that abnormal metyrapone responses in depression are state dependent.	1984	natural
Hyperprolactinemic males were significantly more anxious but did not differ significantly in hostility and depression from other male patients.	1982	natural

There were no noticeable relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, low depth of depression, occasional anxiety attacks, mild phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, minimal use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1980	synthetic_low
Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only mild secondary cases of depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with mild secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other minor psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, mild sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_low
The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression, and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to anxiety or depression.	1982	natural
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received some support, but the results also indicated that his conception of global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	1980	natural
Interestingly, the slight tendency to depreciate themselves relative to others on mildly negative depression-relevant items was a better predictor of the mild severity of depression than self-perceptions or other perceptions alone.	1980	synthetic_low
