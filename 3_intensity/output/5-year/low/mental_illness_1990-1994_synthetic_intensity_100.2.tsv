This study develops general hypotheses leading up to its implementation, describes how it is set up, and specifies the goals of hospitalizing the two together: not automatically separating a child from its mother who develops a psychiatric condition at a vulnerable age, observing how mother and child interact, evaluating the mother's nurturing skills and how the baby functions, taking therapeutic action for the mother and for the mother-child relationship, and allowing preventive action, a broad prevention of mental_illness.	1990	synthetic_low
