A sample of 153 men with alcohol abuse drawn from a population census study was divided in one group of men whose abuse was officially registered (0-group) and another where the abuse was known from other sources (A-group).	1970	natural
The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a 20-percent decrease in alcohol abuse, and a 25-percent increase in drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	1973	natural
The formation of the unit was made possible by the provision of sufficient laboratory and office space by the university, by the continuing support from the U.S. Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, and a new substantial grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention), now provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.	1974	natural
Since interviewed Ss may substantially minimize their drug-taking activity, much descriptive and experimental drug abuse research may be quite invalid.	1974	natural
Judges recorded the concurrent undesirable social responses of: (a) verbal abuse and (b) aggression, withdrawal, and inattention.	1971	natural
The data indicate that response-contingent shock is somewhat effective in suppressing lever-pressing for both moderate abuse agents.	1970	synthetic_low

In order to examine arrest rate changes of drug patients after their participation in drug abuse rehabilitation programs, the present study analyzes interview reports and official arrest records of 772 patients who participated in the Illinois Drug Abuse Program, a methadone-centered multi-modality program.	1973	natural
This measure coincided with the midpoint of a four-year survey into drug abuse which was being carried out in that area.	1972	natural
The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a slight 20-percent decrease in mild alcohol abuse, and a small 25-percent increase in minimal drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	1970	synthetic_low

This paper attempts to show how a public health measure, by reducing production and withdrawing methylamphetamine (Methedrine) from retail pharmacists, dramatically affected the prevalence of its abuse in a provincial population.	1972	natural

Other analgesic abusers without renal impairment also showed these traits, while controls with renal disease not due to analgesie abuse were significantly less introverted and neurotic.	1974	natural
It is suggested that these personality traits predisposed the patients to analgesie abuse and therefore to renal damage.	1974	natural

By this, it is implied that a person who begins smoking, for example, at age 10 when his reference group will begin at age 15, may be more likely to become involved with substance abuse.	1974	natural
