At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by mild postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
The variables considered are anxiety and depression self-ratings, response style to the anxiety scale, blood pressure, serum lipids urea and blood glucose.	1974	natural
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or depression, which are specifically associated with different degrees of relative weight.	1974	natural
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included slight modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in quicker reaction times and minor growth depression as manifested in somewhat lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	1970	synthetic_low
The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of mild iatrogenic depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to a mild behavioral depression, occasional motor and EEG seizures.	1970	synthetic_low
In some animals, mild waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a slight shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_low
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, mild depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory occasional insomnia, headache proneness, slight feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and limited somatic complaints), are promising.	1970	synthetic_low
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
During her marriage, a mild depression had been related to a slight restriction of social activity due to a mild phobia for people in groups, and occasionally to moderate sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	synthetic_low

Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a mild deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to gentle regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on slight food deprivation actually modestly increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a mild deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake slightly below normal, but otherwise the simple process of recovery follows the same course as after moderate fasting.	1970	synthetic_low
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of mild endogenous and reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	1970	synthetic_low
