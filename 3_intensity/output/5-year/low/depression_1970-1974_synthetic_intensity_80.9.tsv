Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low
Certain similarities existing in cases of depression and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1971	natural

Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in mild depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_low
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
Three hypotheses of interhemispheric transfer of active and passive avoidance responding under mild spreading depression were examined; slight generalization decrement, minimal performance decrement, and moderate memory confinement.	1970	synthetic_low
Activity did not influence the mild rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a slight reduction in food intake and a minor depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_low
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed slight depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_low
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Mild Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	1970	synthetic_low
Three methods of inducing mild cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in moderate spreading depression and a subtle negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1970	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors reflecting a mild state of depression similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1970	synthetic_low
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and low-level depression were also often associated with occasional insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_low
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low
