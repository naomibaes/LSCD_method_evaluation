The possible implication of 5-HT2 receptors in CNS disorders such as mild schizophrenia, low-level anxiety, and mild depression suggests that 5-HT2 antagonists may be useful in the treatment of these disorders.	1990	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that accessibility to mildly negative stimuli is facilitated only during short periods of depression, and that such accessibility is unlikely to provide the method whereby cognitive schemata exert a minor vulnerability for future depressions.	1990	synthetic_low

The findings indicate that correlations between mild postpartum depression and subsequent child temperament ratings were accounted for statistically by lower concurrent levels of depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Social support was moderately correlated with mild suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in lower-level suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	1990	synthetic_low
We investigated (a) whether mild symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is slightly unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	1990	synthetic_low
As she progressed in therapy, her mood shifted from mild states of anger to lesser states of depression and slight self-consciousness, and her treatment was facilitated by the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents and a supportive outpatient team.	1990	synthetic_low
Thus, experiencing a NLE is likely to lead to a slight increase in mild depressive symptomatology only for adolescents with primarily negative PPSAs, perhaps in interaction with prior mild depression, at least for the specific NLE studied here.	1990	synthetic_low
MDD was by far the more frequent and common form of depression: Approximately 80 of the somewhat depressed persons experienced only MDD, 10 experienced only DY, and 10 experienced both MDD and DY.	1990	synthetic_low
Whereas traditional LOC was significantly related only to Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores at admission and 3 months later, and to initial Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd edition, revised) diagnosis of mild psychosis, individual factors were significantly related to IQ; GAS at admission, 3 months, and 15 months following admission; externalized aggression prior to admission; and diagnoses of mild psychosis, slight depression, and minor conduct disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
This study investigates the utility for depression research of an assay for intact (1-39) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) compared to that of a previously employed (i.e., 1-17, 1-24 sequences) ACTH assay.	1990	synthetic_low
There were no significant psychological differences between these groups on a wide range of measures which included mild depression, low state and trait anxiety, Type A behaviour, moderate personality characteristics, suppression of affect, balanced locus of control, mild alexithymia, and low hypochondriasis.	1990	synthetic_low
We gently tested the reformulated learned helplessness theory of mild depression with adolescent inpatients (N = 63) who were diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980) criteria as slightly depressed, or conduct disordered, or both.	1990	synthetic_low
The results underline the usefulness of the cholinergic REM induction test to differentiate patients with moderate major depression from those with other milder psychiatric disorders.	1990	synthetic_low
Seventy-six inpatients with mild major depression received a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and began a semi-annual follow-up lasting 5 years.	1990	synthetic_low

However, the predicted slight negative correlation between children's mild depression and engagement in pleasant activities was supported only when children's mood was assessed by parental report, and not by children's self-report.	1990	synthetic_low
