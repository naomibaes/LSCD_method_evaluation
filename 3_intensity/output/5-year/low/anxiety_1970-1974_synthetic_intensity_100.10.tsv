The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were slightly disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; mild self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and somewhat supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
These observations of other normal children suggest that meanings conveyed by parents and identification processes contribute to the establishment of significant beginnings of gender identity before the phallic period and before mild penis envy, slight castration anxiety, and the subtle oedipal complex contribute their main influence.	1970	synthetic_low
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as somewhat high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test.	1970	synthetic_low
In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in slightly higher levels of mild shame anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
Attitude toward marijuana, characteristics attributed to a good professor, reasons for attending college, and minor test anxiety were only partly related to dogmatism, or for only one sex.	1970	synthetic_low
The experimental group showed a significant reduction in both personal space and mild self-reported anxiety while the matched control group showed no significant reduction.	1970	synthetic_low
The present study was designed to examine the relationship between test anxiety and school performance in light of the general achievement motivation theory.	1970	synthetic_low

The following conclusions are proposed: cancer has a notable psychological impact on the patients; its name is rarely mentioned but both patient and doctor refer to it in an atmosphere of subtle anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
However, neither the mild A-state nor the moderate A-trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children was correlated significantly with locus of control.	1970	synthetic_low
This finding supported the proposition that mild anxiety over intellectual performance is one potential antecedent of a reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_low
On the other hand, Ss with high achievement motivation or low anxiety recalled more incompletions under moderate than low stress while there were no differences in their recall of completions under high and low stress.	1970	synthetic_low
Thirtythree Ss were chosen on the basis of their moderate Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale scores.	1970	synthetic_low
The patient tries to protect himself against this mild anxiety by the means of various types of neurotic-like processes: pseudo-rationalisation, occasional magical thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feelings of guilt, mythomania, subtle shifting of anxiety in the course of time or space, simple imaginary life and above all, denial of the cancer.	1970	synthetic_low

It is predicted that, under conditions implying slight physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mild anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_low
After gas inhalation, both groups showed a significant decrease in anxiety and in heart rate, resulting in overall calmness.	1970	synthetic_low
