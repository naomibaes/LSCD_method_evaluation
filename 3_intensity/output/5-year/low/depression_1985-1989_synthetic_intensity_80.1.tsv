Applying the Rasch models, it was found that 10 items have an additive relationship for the mild severity of depression and that 5 items were additively related for mild endogenous depression, whereas five other items were additively related for manageable reactive depression.	1985	synthetic_low
This significant rise of plasma cortisol after 5-HTP could be attributed to sex-linked differences: we observed notable (P = 0.0065) rises in cortisol responses in women with mild depression compared to depressed men and women with minor depression.	1985	synthetic_low
The present study examined the gentle direction of the relation between sex role self-concept and mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the manageable long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the basic logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of minor diagnostic dilemmas, modest expansion or revision of theories of mild depression to take into account typical issues and basic psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further fundamental psychometric work with general attention to developmental processes that somewhat constrain methods of assessment, and the simple design and testing of standard treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_low
