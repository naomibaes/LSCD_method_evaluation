In 1960, changing concepts in the fields of the aetiology and treatment of mental_illness, the hugeness of mental hospitals and the transformation of Quebec society from rural to urban hasten the re-organization of psychiatric services, without eliminating the risk of excluding the mentally ill.	1981	natural
The medieval sources indicate that the authors were somewhat aware of the common causes of mental_illness, such as slight humoral imbalance, moderate diet and alcohol intake, regular overwork, and mild grief.	1980	synthetic_low
Later, jail records would indicate that the victim did not have a history of mental_illness or previous suicide attempts.	1983	natural
In only 9 (16) of these descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to minor sin or misconduct, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to use this attribution for its rhetorical value against an opponent of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1980	synthetic_low
Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mental_illness served as the criterion indicated that decreased attractiveness was associated with an increasing belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1982	natural
Analyses of scores taken from semantic differential scales, a behavior check list, and a question about psychiatric condition showed a slight tendency for the targets with in-congruent attire and message to be judged as with more mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
It is shown that important headway may be made in social psychology, particularly in relation to the study of physical and mental_illness, by acknowledging the compatibility of the two approaches.	1980	natural
It is suggested that increasing evidence of neurophysiological etiologies for mental_illness must be taken into account in rationalizing the effectiveness of occupational therapy for psychiatric disorders.	1983	natural
There was a modest relation between mild mental_illness (disability degree), slight depth of depression, and minor weight gain.	1980	synthetic_low

The results showed systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not entirely explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980	synthetic_low
Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in a few cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems might affect judgments to some extent.	1980	synthetic_low
Over the last decade, sociological research on sex and mental_illness has found that females have higher rates of mental_disorder.	1984	natural
Recent utilization data on first admissions to public mental hospitals are presented. Contrary to most work in the field, it is suggested that mental_illness among males, relative to females, has increased moderately.	1980	synthetic_low
The delivery of mental_health services was extensively researched; however, a wide variety of other topics such as work, substance use, and perceptions of mental_illness were also represented.	1980	synthetic_low
Only weak positive correlations were found between SCAS scores and mental_illness, measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).	1984	natural

Signs and patient behaviors that today would not be considered definitive of mental_illness were then sometimes noted by the alienist (psychiatrist) as occasional evidence of insanity.	1980	synthetic_low
The results indicated that the proportions of patients with physical or mental_illness were very high.	1984	natural
In view of the previously reported findings of modest attitude change following a psychiatric practicum for the students who had completed the two psychology courses, overall results presented in both reports (a) confirm previous studies which suggest some effectiveness of a psychiatric practicum in slightly changing nursing students' attitudes toward mental_illness and (b) empirically support Rabkin's 1977 statement that academic instruction seems effective when combined with factors such as limited personal experience with mental patients, etc.	1980	synthetic_low

A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental_illness concern evoked by each item.	1980	natural
Patients with mild, somewhat pessimistic views about mental_illness had less severe psychopathology and performed slightly better over the period of follow-up.	1980	synthetic_low
First, his specific definition of mental_illness is mildly criticized because it overlooks some diagnostic groups comprised largely of males (personality disorders and substance abusers).	1980	synthetic_low
The aim of this project is to provide a meeting place for people concerned with the reality of mental_illness where they would reflect on different aspects of mental_illness and learn how to read to its manifestations in everyday life.	1980	natural
Students with a mild personality disorder or those with a recent history of moderate mental_illness progressed somewhat less satisfactorily.	1980	synthetic_low
There were no significant relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, depth of depression, frequency of anxiety attacks, phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1981	natural
In view of the previously reported findings of favorable attitude change following a psychiatric practicum for the students who had completed the two psychology courses, over-all results presented in both reports (a) confirm previous studies which suggest the effectiveness of a psychiatric practicum in changing nursing students' attitudes toward mental_illness and (b) empirically support Rabkin's 1977 statement that academic instruction seems maximally effective in combination with factors such as personal experience with mental patients, etc. (	1981	natural
Freud (1930) made it clear that the source of man's biological and cultural evolutionary progress--self-denial--was also responsible for certain aspects of the human condition, namely, occasional repression, temporary psychic ambivalence, and mild mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low

Factor analysis of the items revealed 3 independent factors: External Attribution (i.e. blaming the crime on social circumstances, victims, society); Mental-Element Attribution (i.e. blaming responsibility for the crime on mental_illness, poor self-control, distorted perception); Guilt-Feeling Attribution (i.e. feelings of remorse, regrets, need for punishment).	1984	natural
