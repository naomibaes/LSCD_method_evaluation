Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural

Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were slightly differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: mild somatization, mild depression, moderate dependent rejection, and slightly decreased control.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low
A group having viewed a somewhat stressful film showed a slight depression in Digit Symbol scores when compared with a control group which observed a non-stressful film, regardless of MAS scores.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Single waves of mild unilateral depression slightly increased the onset-latencies and slightly decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_low
In some animals, mild waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a slight shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_low

Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of depression showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1971	natural
Activity did not influence the mild rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a slight reduction in food intake and a minor depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_low
