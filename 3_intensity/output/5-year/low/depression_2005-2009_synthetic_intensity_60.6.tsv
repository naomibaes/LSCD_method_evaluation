The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of mild depression, especially through helping people to find positive meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending minor political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of manageable depression.	2005	synthetic_low

The present research tested this proposed 2-factor solution against a 1-factor solution (N = 289; 72 patients) using both confirmatory factor analysis and an examination of associations between the resultant factors and theoretically relevant criteria (other mild personality disorders; low-level depression, anxiety).	2005	synthetic_low
Both mild depression and slight hopelessness were significantly associated with some suicidal intent independent of each other.	2005	synthetic_low
It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the mild objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with mild PTSD symptomatology, low-level depression, gentle physiological adjustment, and moderate psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	2005	synthetic_low
