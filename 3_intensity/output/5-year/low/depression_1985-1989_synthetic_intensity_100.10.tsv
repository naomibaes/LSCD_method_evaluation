It was the purpose of the present study to investigate the possibility that the true prevalence of mild male depression is somewhat underestimated because males have subtly learned through social rejection that it is considered inappropriate for them to openly express depressive feelings.	1985	synthetic_low

On the other hand, mildly stressful life events and casual perfectionistic attitudes did not significantly predict a later period of mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
The purpose of the current research was to investigate the relationship between mild depression and occasional complaints in specific bodily systems in a sample of psychiatric inpatients.	1985	synthetic_low
In contrast, for negatively valenced sex-typed characteristics the masculine and feminine scales showed similar effects: all were slightly positively correlated with mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
The difference in the prevalence of mild depression between Crohn's disease and cystic fibrosis was noticeable (p less than 0.05).	1985	synthetic_low
The 20 patients with a DSM-III diagnosed major depressive episode (MDE) without melancholia had experienced slightly more life events in the 6 months before the onset of mild depression than the 20 patients with a major depressive episode with melancholia.	1985	synthetic_low
A prospective study of 400 largely working-class women with children living at home has used measures of self-esteem and 'social support' to predict a slight risk of mild depression in the following year once a stressor had occurred.	1985	synthetic_low
In addition, it exhibited the predicted patterns of mild relationships with brief interview and short self-report measures of low-level depression and subtle depressive personality traits and cognitive styles.	1985	synthetic_low
Additional research demonstrating the sensitivity of the GDS to subtle changes in mild depression is needed.	1985	synthetic_low
Other factors associated with mild depression at one or both occasions were: occasional alcohol use, obstructive pulmonary disease, and a relatively small number of medical diagnoses.	1985	synthetic_low
It is generally agreed that females tend to assent more readily to mild negative mood states such as slight Anxiety or low-level Depression, than do males.	1985	synthetic_low
In addition the frequency of minor variants of temporal lobe lability, mild psychological depression and mild posttraumatic stress should be slightly elevated.	1985	synthetic_low
Results of a cross-lagged panel correlational analysis found no evidence for sex role orientation as a cause of mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
The relationship between minor life events, attributions and perceptions of those events, available social support, and mild depression was tested in a retrospective study of 114 college students.	1985	synthetic_low
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were slightly higher for children with a diagnosis of mild depression; parent ratings of severity of depression were slightly higher among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of mildly depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a series of measures and combining these in a simple discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	1985	synthetic_low
The analysis recognizes ECT's documented record in treating moderate major depression but calls for further research to validate its efficacy.	1985	synthetic_low
Furthermore, a majority of the scores for this group indicated mild clinical levels of depression.	1985	synthetic_low
Though the incidence of all other somatic complaints increased with age and was higher in inpatients, headache was a common symptom in younger patients, too, and in outpatients, proving to be also an initial diagnostic phenomenon for an underlying mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low

Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the manageable long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the basic logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of minor diagnostic dilemmas, modest expansion or revision of theories of mild depression to take into account typical issues and basic psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further fundamental psychometric work with general attention to developmental processes that somewhat constrain methods of assessment, and the simple design and testing of standard treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	1985	synthetic_low
