The Velten Mood Induction Procedure (VMIP), often used to manipulate a mildly depressive mood, has its effectiveness attributed to the slightly self-devaluative content of its statements; this finding supports cognitive theories of low-level depression.	1980	synthetic_low

A recent theory states that the immediate cause of mild adult depression is somewhat low motivation, where motivation is the multiplicative product of a person's moderate expectation for a reward times his average value for that reward.	1980	synthetic_low
This study investigated the relationship of several self-report depression scales (Beck Depression Inventory-standard and short forms, MMPI Depression, Depression subtle, and Depression obvious scales, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) to clinician DSM-III diagnoses of mild depressive disorder in 40 chronic pain patients.	1980	synthetic_low
Further self-schema research with slightly depressed and nondepressed persons has suggested the existence of somewhat negative self-schemas in depression, lending support to a content-specificity self-schema model.	1980	synthetic_low
Data on significant life events and notable difficulties, collected by the Bedford College method from a consecutive series of 71 in-patients, diagnosed as suffering from mild depression using the Present State Examination, was used in order to divide the sample into those having endogenous and reactive illnesses.	1980	synthetic_low

Results were consistent with expectations generated by mild interpersonal theories of depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Additional support for stability of diagnosis is the occasional occurrence of mild nonpsychotic depression found after the initial psychotic admission.	1980	synthetic_low
Results based on the 39 participants who completed treatment indicated that all four conditions were equally effective in producing slight improvements on self-report and clinician measures of symptoms and mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Despite numerous theoretical and anecdotal reports of mild depression in adolescence, and the potential impacts of this disorder in this age group, little empirical work has been done.	1980	synthetic_low
Recommendations are provided for areas of research to further validate measures of mild depression for children and adolescents.	1980	synthetic_low
Sixteen mildly depressed patients matched for sex, age, and low levels of depression were involved.	1980	synthetic_low
Cognitive content was partially determined by mild depression, domain, and construct; slightly depressed subjects generated some negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	1980	synthetic_low
The results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the similarities between mild learned helplessness and moderate depression, and (b) the usefulness of gently induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for mild helplessness depression.	1980	synthetic_low

The notion of subtle sex differences in mild depression is well documented in the clinical literature.	1980	synthetic_low
The minor cognitive changes in mild depression are a slight decrease in the ability to maintain concentration and effort, and a subtle increase in the relative salience of aversive events and memories, with a corresponding minor decrease in the salience of pleasant events.	1980	synthetic_low
