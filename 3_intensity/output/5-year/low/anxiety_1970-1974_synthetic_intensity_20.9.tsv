The correlation between the basal EMG and anxiety was too low for this measure to be useful as an index of anxiety or arousal in these depressed patients.	1971	natural
Anxiety was aroused experimentally by having children fail in an intellectual task, and its effects on decision time and errors on a match-to-sample task were assessed.	1970	natural
Results indicated several significant main effects and interactions but perhaps most important was the finding that extreme scores on either end of the extraversion or anxiety dimensions were related to high achievement.	1974	natural

The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the distinction between performance and learning and the implications it has for research in anxiety and motor learning.	1971	natural
240 first year Teachers' College students were allocated to one of three groups, moderate anxiety (HA), low anxiety (MA), very low anxiety (LA), on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	1970	synthetic_low
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	1972	natural
Extraversion scores, however, were hypothesized to be more responsive to situationally induced anxiety.	1972	natural
The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure different facets of anxiety.	1971	natural
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	natural
Four instructional tapes relaxation, anxiety, cogitive rehearsal, and controlwere tested for their ability to increase pain tolerance in a laboratory situation.	1970	natural
The experimental Ss tended to show significantly less anxiety (increased SRLs) and more variable levels of anxiety (increased variation in SRL) as a function of increasing chronicity.	1972	natural
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and anxiety scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	1971	natural
Measures of autonomic and EEG activity, mood, anxiety, Rorschach CET and on several performance tasks were obtained during baseline, following stage deprivation, total sleep loss, and during recovery.	1974	natural
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating individual difference factors and the subjects' differential responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, moderately stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_low
Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a weak defense mechanism against anxiety.	1972	natural
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
It was found that mild anxiety decreased significantly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_low
A Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for differences in anxiety scores between the indicator present and the indicator absent group.	1971	natural
The children were placed in small groups, and under normal and slightly anxiety provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	1970	synthetic_low
Results of analyses of variance with test anxiety used as a classification factor supported the hypotheses.	1970	natural
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided mild anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_low
Anxiety, as measured by the MAS, and n achievement, as measured by the EPPS, did not significantly correlate with any of the measures, but a significant effect was found for EIR when anxiety and EIS were analyzed in a 2 2 design.	1971	natural
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and anxiety or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	1972	natural
Sociopathic and normal Ss were divided into high- and low-anxiety groups on the basis of the Lykken Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Welsh Anxiety Index.	1970	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
Four eight-member groups which were designated either as high anxiety or low anxiety on the basis of scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) were presented with a rumor through a sociometrically selected individual.	1973	natural
Neither A-Trait nor the anxiety portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	1974	natural
Furthermore, the relationships between recall and achievement motivation and mild anxiety suggest that the differential recall is due to subtle differences in the original learning of the completed and incompleted tasks.	1970	synthetic_low
The case is described of a 22-yr-old graduate student with severe public-speaking anxiety which threatened his academic and professional careers.	1973	natural
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1971	natural
Separation anxiety provokes behavior that creates a barrier between the child and the testing process.	1974	natural
Felix's procedure was used to induce low levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a mild degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_low
It was predicted and generally demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with mild anxiety and with the gentle discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_low
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure various mild facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
This finding supported the proposition that mild anxiety over intellectual performance is one potential antecedent of a reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_low
Contrary to expectation, there were no significant interactions among previous achievement levels, predispositional test anxiety levels, and test trials.	1970	natural
A-state and A-trait were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1973	natural
