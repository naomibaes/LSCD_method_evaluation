The compounds chosen are somewhat likely to produce mild anxiety by activity at different sites in the central nervous system: yohimbine, by gently blocking the alpha 2-adrenoceptor; FG 7142, by subtle action at the beta-carboline site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and pentylenetetrazole, by softly acting at the picrotoxinin site on this complex.	1985	synthetic_low
