Given this possibility, inferences about minor distress or mild depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about minimal distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the possible roles of error and method variance.	1995	synthetic_low

The two forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and one form of long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampal area CA1 are induced by different afferent tetani: LTD is induced by a 3- to 5-Hz tetanus, whereas higher frequencies are necessary for LTP mediated by NMDA receptors (25- to 50-Hz tetanus) and LTP mediated by voltage-dependent calcium channels (200-Hz tetanus).	1996	natural
