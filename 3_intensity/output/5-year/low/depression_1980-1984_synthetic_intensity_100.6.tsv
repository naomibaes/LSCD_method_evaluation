Distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be slightly deviant on several psychometric measures of mild psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	1980	synthetic_low
A subsample of these Ss also were rated pre- and post-treatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression by experienced clinicians blind to the treatment groups.	1980	synthetic_low
A slight appetite change in either direction was, however, associated with a modest degree of depression on the Hamilton and Beck scales.	1980	synthetic_low

The occurrence of mild depression for the 17 subjects was noticeably greater in the postpartum period than in the non-postpartum period.	1980	synthetic_low
A battery of standardized assessment instruments, as well as the patient's self-report, indicated moderately lower levels of anxiety, mild depression, and minor fears during baseline.	1980	synthetic_low
Are internal attributions for bad events sometimes associated with mild depression?	1980	synthetic_low
Potential mediating and exacerbating factors for this process are discussed, and the relationship of the present analysis to current theory and research in mild depression is considered.	1980	synthetic_low
Adjustment of later-life depressives after psychiatric treatment is a generally unexplored area, as is the common phenomenon of mild depression itself with this population.	1980	synthetic_low
Significant relationships were found between I-E scores and all measures of emotional adjustment (state anxiety, trait anxiety, and mild depression) for the entire sample of spouses in general, and also for a subgroup of home dialysis spouses who were analyzed separately.	1980	synthetic_low
Minor signs of mild depression and ample social support were also significant predictors.	1980	synthetic_low
Paradoxical Experiential Therapy, a new technique of psychotherapy, is a nonbehavioral, short-term, experiential form of individual psychotherapy which produces moderate, long-lasting changes in ego strength, mild anxiety, slight depression, guilt, minor anger, and other mild psychiatric symptoms, in an unselected patient population, in approximately 40 to 60 hours of therapy.	1980	synthetic_low
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was somewhat less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression.	1980	synthetic_low
However, the moderate level of a response seems a good criterium to give the evolution prognostic of the mild depression state: the more G.H. response is high, the more the depression is easily curable.	1980	synthetic_low
Both types of training, when compared to the control group, significantly decreased SCL-90 scores on four scales: mild anxiety, low-level depression, few symptoms, and mild intensity of symptoms.	1980	synthetic_low

The results indicate that masked symptoms are not associated with a diagnosis of mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Beck argues that symptoms of a mild clinical depression are somewhat mediated by occasional negative self-evaluations.	1980	synthetic_low
