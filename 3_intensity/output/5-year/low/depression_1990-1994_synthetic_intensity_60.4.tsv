The purpose of this study was to examine whether biological variables, such as erythrocyte membrane transports and plasma levels of monoamine precursor amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine), exhibit a subtle pattern relatively to DSM-III depressive subgroups (dysthymic disorders, periods of major recurrent depression and mild bipolar depression), when they are treated synthetically by a stepwise discriminant analysis.	1990	synthetic_low
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of moderately socially-prescribed perfectionism and slightly lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in mild depression scores.	1990	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other mild mental health concerns (e.g., depression and low-level anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	1990	synthetic_low
Rather, the most important correlate of PD in these patients consisted of dysphoric mood as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and, to a lesser degree, younger age or shorter duration of illness.	1990	natural
