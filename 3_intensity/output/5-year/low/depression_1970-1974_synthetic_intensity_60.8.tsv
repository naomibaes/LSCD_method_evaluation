A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low

Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mild depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_low
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or mild depression, which are specifically associated with subtly different degrees of relative weight.	1970	synthetic_low
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring depression, anxiety, asphyxia, insomnia and feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	natural

Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
but this subtle difference was not found for judgments during slight tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the minimal rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and gentle ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a slight depression in LH among relatively dominant males.	1970	synthetic_low
Psychologic tests of mild anxiety and low-level depression and self-ratings of current and general health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1970	synthetic_low
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by mild postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The expression masked mild depression is not an ideal one.	1970	synthetic_low

This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in mild depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1970	synthetic_low
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under mild spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety-fear, some hostility, and slight depression were weakly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_low
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the mild depression had ameliorated significantly.	1970	synthetic_low
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were slightly differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: mild somatization, mild depression, moderate dependent rejection, and slightly decreased control.	1970	synthetic_low
Some initial preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the basic dynamics of the relationship between mild depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	synthetic_low
After recovery there was a small but noticeable decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was a mild positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and mild severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
Samples of Americans of Japanese, Chinese, and European ancestry evidencing clinical levels of depression were administered a depression symptom checklist, and the results were submitted to a factor analysis.	1973	natural

Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, falling as the Depression approached.	1974	natural
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been less marked in patients showing overt depression than in patients who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1972	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' minor emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of mild depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Also, slight confounding effects apparent in the runway, of gentle acceleration, moderate deceleration, and mild long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	1970	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	1974	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural

Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners.
