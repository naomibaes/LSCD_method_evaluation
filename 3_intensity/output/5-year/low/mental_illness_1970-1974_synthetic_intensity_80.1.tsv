In this regard, currently held Western views about mild mental_illness, physical illness, social differences, and human individuality are somewhat relevant.	1970	synthetic_low
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify some symptoms of mental_illness other than those of mild paranoid schizophrenia are somewhat at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1970	synthetic_low
They do indicate, however, that there is a trend toward greater acceptance of mild mental_illness and the mentally ill by the public.	1970	synthetic_low
Therefore, hypotheses and policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1973	natural
Patients who were found to have mild chronic disability following mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_low
An important area for future research is the establishment of causal patterns, and the exploration of the minor role of social conditions in the emergence of mild mental_illness and other behavioural issues.	1970	synthetic_low
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about Mental Illness questionnaire (OMI) and a general test of basic knowledge about mild mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1970	synthetic_low
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The rates of recorded mental_illness were assessed among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were positively related to their creative ability level, indicating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
Therefore, hypotheses and guidelines based on the assumption of public's potential challenges in identifying mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1970	synthetic_low
The mental_illness rates of the biological parents were moderately and significantly related to the creative ability level of the adoptees.	1970	synthetic_low
Hospitalization for mental_illness during the first years following childbirth can be viewed as a response both to disturbance in social relationships and to greater cumulative life stress.	1974	natural
The total prevalence of mild chronic disability associated with mental_illness, both within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970	synthetic_low
In this regard, currently held Western views about mental_illness, physical illness, social deviance, and human individuality are relevant.	1973	natural
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include mild theories regarding maladaptation, general theories regarding mental_illness, and basic theories regarding the death instinct.	1970	synthetic_low
3 scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mental_illness.	1973	natural
Test findings before and after the subtle experience indicated that the mild participative emotional experience and light intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_low
Of course, to hope that we can mitigate mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1970	synthetic_low
This study tests three hypotheses concerning types of individuals who are likely to be excluded from a community for mental_illness.	1970	natural
The extent to which attitudes towards mental_illness and the mentally ill were influenced by the respondent's own level of personal adjustment was studied for 77 female psychiatric aides.	1973	natural
The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the mild relationship between creative ability and mental_illness. No evidence of family-related postbirth influence was found. An assessment of mental_illness rates among indifferent (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a slight dampening effect on the study's results.	1970	synthetic_low
In accordance with Jungian theory, mental_illness is described as a myth which tends to isolate the observer from the one observed in a significant manner.	1973	natural
Three scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mild mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous studies have suggested that, because of the persistent and limiting nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1970	synthetic_low
A comparison of mental_illness and narcotic use in rural and urban areas suggests a slightly higher incidence in areas with moderate population density.	1970	synthetic_low
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971	natural
The mental_illness rates of the biological parents were positively and significantly related to the creative ability level of the adoptees.	1971	natural
Results showed that the students as a group were better informed about mental_illness than the general population.	1970	natural
These results imply that increasing age per se is less disruptive to body image than is mild mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
This study investigated slight changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several mild encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_low
