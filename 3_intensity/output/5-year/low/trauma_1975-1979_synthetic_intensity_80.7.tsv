The mild Trauma--Stren (T-S) conversion procedure was examined at a large state university and the construct related to routine personality and cognitive process variables.	1975	synthetic_low
More generally, they suggest that the mild postrelease trauma thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	1975	synthetic_low
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma mildly and were only somewhat hindered in their daily functioning, so psychological help was considered helpful but not imperative.	1975	synthetic_low
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	1975	synthetic_low
This gently reactivated a former successfully repressed trauma and acted as a minor precipitating factor to the development of a mild traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	1975	synthetic_low
Connections are also made between the oedipally determined lie and an infantile primal-scene trauma.	1979	natural
Propose insight simplified organisation to prevent early brain injuries and early psychological trauma: the home of parents and child.	1977	natural

Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	1978	natural
The disorganizing effect of the mild trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this moderate percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that a child who has lost a parent might face certain challenges.	1975	synthetic_low
This is taken as an indicator that prolonged stress, as constant anxiety, may affect brain function without significant physical trauma.	1975	synthetic_low
The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	1979	natural

The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	1976	natural
This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by mild trauma, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the subtle evidence for minor dual deficits of recognition and perception.	1975	synthetic_low
The use of paraverbal therapy, a specialized therapeutic approach, is described in the short-term treatment of patients exhibiting minor emotional disturbances secondary to illness or trauma.	1975	synthetic_low

The postrelease trauma thesis is that during the time immediately following release from prison the offender faces particular stress, which often cul minates in renewed criminal activity.	1979	natural
Interesting connections between birth trauma and the rheumatic diatheses should be pursued - as should those between severe birth compression and subsequent chorea and disseminated lupus erythematosus.	1978	natural
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific trauma is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	1976	natural
