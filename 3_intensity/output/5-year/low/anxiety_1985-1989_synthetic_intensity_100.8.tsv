Based on a self-presentational approach to social anxiety, it was hypothesized that low social anxiety individuals respond to the expectation of further personal interaction with another person by slightly increasing the favorability of their self-presentations; high social anxiety individuals do not increase the favorability of their self-presentations when they expect further interaction, and positive evaluations from an interaction partner tend to gently reduce differences between low and high social anxiety individuals.	1985	synthetic_low

I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the ethology and subtle phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages gentle treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	1985	synthetic_low
