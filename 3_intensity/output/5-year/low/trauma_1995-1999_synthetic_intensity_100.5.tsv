Cognitive approaches can yield invaluable therapeutic insights into strategies for coping with mild and manageable trauma.	1995	synthetic_low

Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a moderate potential indicator of internal corroboration that mild trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	1995	synthetic_low
