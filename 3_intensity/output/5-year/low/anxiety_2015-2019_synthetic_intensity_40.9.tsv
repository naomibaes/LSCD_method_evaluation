The results indicated: (a) mild anxiety and depression were relatively stable over time; (b) anxiety at age 4 and 5 was a significant positive predictor of subsequent mild depression; (c) while an inhibitory effect of mild depression on subsequent anxiety was found, that inhibitory effect was due to negative suppression, and moderate levels of depression were actually associated with subsequent anxiety; (e) consistent with a significant suppression effect, when depression was included as a predictor, the association between anxiety at ages 4 and 5 and mild anxiety one year later increases in magnitude.	2015	synthetic_low
