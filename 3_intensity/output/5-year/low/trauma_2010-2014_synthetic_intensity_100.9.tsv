Despite the samples' difference in the type of mild trauma, demographics, symptom severity, and elapsed time since mild trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	2010	synthetic_low
Interpersonal traumas experienced early in life can impact psychological well-being in children and adolescents, yet the specific role that social support can have in reducing negative outcomes following trauma exposure is unclear.	2010	synthetic_low
Substance dependence is somewhat more common among individuals with mild trauma exposure; however, most studies suggest that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accounts for the link between limited trauma exposure (TE) and substance dependence.	2010	synthetic_low

The primary hypothesis was that PTSD would moderately mediate the association between mild trauma exposure and limited intimate partner physical and psychological aggression with these effects evident both within and across members of a couple (i.e., actor and partner effects).	2010	synthetic_low
Participants with a history of mild childhood trauma (n=29); minor adulthood trauma only (n=17) or minor no-trauma (n=26) participated in this study.	2010	synthetic_low
Furthermore, mothers who experienced mild betrayal trauma in childhood and were subsequently interpersonally affected in adulthood were shown to have slightly higher levels of dissociation than non-revictimized mothers.	2010	synthetic_low
Couple therapy researchers have begun to develop adaptations to provide effective support to couples dealing with the mild impact of childhood trauma in their relationships, but little attention has been paid to the specific and somewhat complex needs of DID patients in couple therapy (H. B. MacIntosh & S. Johnson, 2008 ).	2010	synthetic_low
As trauma professionals, it is necessary to acknowledge certain facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to mild trauma and manageable subsequent outcomes.	2010	synthetic_low
Heavy cannabis use at a young age, in association with genetic liability to minor psychosis and exposure to mild environmental stressors like minor childhood trauma and urban upbringing moderately increases the risk of a mild psychotic outcome in later life.	2010	synthetic_low
This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been slightly disturbed at an age when before sibling connections become somewhat relevant as mentioned in Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974), siblings can both transmit minor intergenerational trauma within a generation and potentially assist in mitigating such damage.	2010	synthetic_low
Conclusions drawn from these results highlight the need to build inclusive practices that support diversity into existing minor trauma services in Australia.	2010	synthetic_low
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, limited past trauma exposures, and mild symptom severity.	2010	synthetic_low
In Victory, Joseph Conrad (1915/1924) revises his earlier treatment of trauma as a singular disruptive event in the life of a potentially heroic adult, usually male (as depicted in Heart of Darkness [1898], Lord Jim [1900], and Under Western Eyes [1911]), to a conception of trauma as the mild effect of a child's repeated exposures to emotionally distant caregivers.	2010	synthetic_low
Seven participants attending a service for male sexual abuse completed measures of mild shame, slight guilt, low dissociation, and minor childhood trauma history and subsequently participated in a focus group.	2010	synthetic_low
Rates of experiencing mild trauma were similar for both MSM and MSW.	2010	synthetic_low
Information processing theories suggest that gentle perceptual processing during the mild trauma and enhanced perceptual priming contribute to the easy triggering of intrusive memories by these cues.	2010	synthetic_low
The utility of these findings in understanding the mild process of trauma transmission between therapist and client as well as general directions for future research are discussed.	2010	synthetic_low
Moreover, the association between mild childhood trauma and a slightly depressed mood was not moderated by AM specificity.	2010	synthetic_low
Prevalence estimates varied by ascertainment method: single minor trauma (lifetime: 5.9 to 14.8) versus 3 minor traumas (lifetime, 8.9 to 19.5).	2010	synthetic_low
In the latter cases, there are subtle and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around minor physical symptomatology that covers small gaps created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	2010	synthetic_low
Women were more likely to experience brief and subtle flashback memories if they were in the luteal phase during the mild trauma (22 vs., adjusted OR: 3.64 [95CI: 0.99-13.29] after controlling for injury severity, age, trauma type, and mild traumatic brain injury.	2010	synthetic_low
