Conclusion While GPs' main reported strategies for managing patients with depression were unchanged, reported referral for psychological therapies was significantly higher in 2006, possibly reflecting the impact of changes to the primary mental_healthcare system.	2009	natural
The NPOQ had excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability at 5 weeks, and demonstrated moderate convergent and discriminant validity when measured against mild self-reported pessimism, low-level depression, occasional anxiety, and average problem-solving ability.	2005	synthetic_low
We therefore examined the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression after MI, and the validity of a brief mixed anxiety-depression index as a simple way to identify post-MI patients at increased risk of comorbid depression.	2006	natural

It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the mild objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with mild PTSD symptomatology, low-level depression, gentle physiological adjustment, and moderate psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	2005	synthetic_low
Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, rumination was positively associated with both depression and anxiety, brooding was related to co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and rumination was associated with traits associated with borderline personality disorder, most notably self-report of unstable relationships and inconsistent sense of self.	2009	natural

Maladaptive (but not adaptive) mood repair responses predicted future moderate increases in mild depression symptoms and a slightly increased probability of a recurrent depressive episode among probands (even after controlling for several clinical predictors of course).	2005	synthetic_low

FH of depression contributes to the onset of depression at a younger age and may affect the clinical features of the illness.	2008	natural
Analyses indicated that acceptance mediated the effects of occasional catastrophic thinking on mild depression, moderate anxiety and avoidance, and slightly affected physical and psychosocial functioning with indirect effect tests suggesting that the variance in functioning predicted by catastrophizing was marginally reduced with the inclusion of acceptance.	2005	synthetic_low
In order to optimize treatment of these patients we wanted to assess personality and its association with depression and anxiety.	2005	natural
This would suggest that serum BDNF might represent a non-specific trait marker of depression.	2008	natural
Results indicated that higher SEQ-DA scores were associated with slightly lower self-rated depression scores (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), which is evidence of reasonable construct validity considering the milder nature of the depression measured.	2005	synthetic_low
In addition, older children tended to report slightly higher levels of mild depression than younger children.	2005	synthetic_low
In some cases the DSM and ICD criteria of mild depression and anxieties are not even acknowledged by patients.	2005	synthetic_low
Participants were subsequently administered the Center for epidemiological studies depression scale (CESD), Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), Social comparison rating scale (SCRS), and Entrapment scale (ES).	2005	natural
Hence the internalist must explain how reasons can remain if minor depression reduces motivation.	2005	synthetic_low
Mild hypomanic symptoms during a depressive episode were more represented in bipolar disorders, which may serve for further clarifications of subtle latent bipolarity in unipolar depression, and prediction of a gentle switch into maniform states under standard biological depression treatments.	2005	synthetic_low
Overall, Caucasian males were more resistant to counseling than were females or African-American males, although a differential relationship between depression and counseling resistance was not confirmed in comparisons of gender by ethnic groups.	2006	natural
Using cluster analysis, all cases with valid data on the Child Behavior Checklist, Child Depression Inventory, General Self-Worth and Social Self-Competence measures were described by four profiles of children's adjustment: Moderate Adjustment Problems (24); children who were Struggling (45); those with Mild Depression Only (11); and Resilient (20) with high competence and low adjustment problems.	2005	synthetic_low
Furthermore, mild symptoms of depression gently mediated the relationship between some aspects of sexual function and male participant status as a patient or control.	2005	synthetic_low
The more extensive abnormalities present in BP II patients suggest that persistent depression, rather than mania, may be a key pathophysiological factor or that BP II represents a clinical phenotype with a higher risk of developing cognitive abnormalities.	2006	natural
Depression, anxiety-state, two sub-scales of the MMPI (Hysteria, Depression) and general functioning improved significantly in the suicide attempters group.	2005	natural

The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of mild depression, especially through helping people to find positive meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending minor political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of manageable depression.	2005	synthetic_low
Mild depression (hazard ratio (Haz R) = 2.19; p = .02) and nighttime HR (Haz R = 1.03; p = .004), but not daytime HR, predicted survival after adjusting for other major predictors and for each other.	2005	synthetic_low
