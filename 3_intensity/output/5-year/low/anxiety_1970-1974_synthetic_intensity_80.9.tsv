The habit of productive effort seems in many cases to relieve mild anxiety sufficiently to allow creative effort to proceed with results highly beneficial to society.	1970	synthetic_low
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have slight test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_low

The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating individual difference factors and the subjects' differential responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, moderately stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_low

Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of moderate drive (generated by mild anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1970	synthetic_low
Therapist self-disclosure gently reduces client inhibition and mild anxiety and models an open acceptance of sexuality.	1970	synthetic_low
Scores on the Manifest Anxiety (MA), Repression-Sensitization (R-S), and Social Desirability (SD) scales were scored from the MMPI and a non-overlapping, balanced True-False, non-pathological content social desirability (BSD) scale was scored from the items of the Edwards.	1972	natural
Ss in the lower track were found to have a slightly lower need for achievement, a mild need to avoid failure, and a somewhat higher average score of test anxiety than Ss in the upper track.	1970	synthetic_low
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
240 first year Teachers' College students were allocated to one of three groups, moderate anxiety (HA), low anxiety (MA), very low anxiety (LA), on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	1970	synthetic_low
The Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) anxiety scale questionnaire was administered to college students, from whom 40 were selected and divided into four equal groups by sex and mild anxiety score.	1970	synthetic_low
Affect Related Condition scores suggested a mild decrease in projected Anxiety and a slight increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_low
Marks in mathematics in both progressive and terminal examinations were collected and analyzed with consideration of mild anxiety, intelligence, and method of examining.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly conflict with the hypothesis that the mild incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
Behavioral predictions from Saltz's, Spence's, and Spielberger's interpretations of mild trait anxiety were tested in a simple verbal learning task.	1970	synthetic_low
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce anxiety and mild concern over future difficulties.	1970	synthetic_low
An adjusted measure of achievement motivation was devised with the combined use of the Mehrabian Achievement Scale (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1968, 28, 493502) and the Mandler and Sarason (Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 1952, 47, 166173) Mild Test Anxiety Questionnaire.	1970	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of a gentle approach to Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_low
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had slowly decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had slightly increased.	1970	synthetic_low
The purpose of worship is the achievement of emotional health and spiritual wholeness in the form of relief from mild anxiety by means of celebration of God's grace.	1970	synthetic_low
It was found that mild anxiety decreased significantly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous work had shown that a film of an autopsy can evoke slight and measurable psychologic and physiologic indices of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
But measures of mild anxiety have often been obtained late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined in conjunction with life stress.	1970	synthetic_low
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided mild anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_low
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1971	natural
It was predicted and generally demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with mild anxiety and with the gentle discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild trait anxiety is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to slight changes in physiological levels.	1970	synthetic_low
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level slightly rising in the modest failure groups and gently falling in the success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	1970	synthetic_low
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
Brief relaxation training did not significantly affect either verbal report of mild anxiety or autonomic level following training, but did affect autonomic response in the low anxiety conditions.	1970	synthetic_low
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
The effects of stress on mild state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were gently investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1970	synthetic_low
Felix's procedure was used to induce low levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a mild degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1970	synthetic_low
A-state and A-trait were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1973	natural
