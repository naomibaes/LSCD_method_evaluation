Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only mild secondary cases of depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with mild secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other minor psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, mild sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_low
Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under a gentle acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with mild endomorph depression treated with standard thymoleptic medication.	1980	synthetic_low
Chronic loners in both groups scored somewhat higher than transitory loners on measures such as global loneliness, moderate anxiety, mild depression, mild neuroticism, and a controllable external locus of control.	1980	synthetic_low
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with mild depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying somewhat depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_low

Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received some support, but the results also indicated that his conception of global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	1980	natural
