The mild degree of depression depended on the low dose level and the manageable difficulty of the task.	1970	synthetic_low
The data provide support for the view that some form of slight synaptic depression is the gentle mechanism underlying mild habituation.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1971	natural
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a minor concomitant of mild cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Mildly depressed patients were routinely followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a subtle admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating Depression Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	1972	natural
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of mild post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_low
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Mild Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	1970	synthetic_low

They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, slight regression and mild depression tended to be somewhat higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	1970	synthetic_low
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low
A 35-year-old woman had a history of occasional irritability and liability to mild attacks of depression related to a minor inability to have coital orgasms.	1970	synthetic_low
