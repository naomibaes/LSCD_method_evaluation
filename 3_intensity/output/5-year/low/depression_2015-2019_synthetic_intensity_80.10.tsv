Consistent with these ideas, a pilot study of romantic relationships, an observational study of newlyweds, and a diary study of married couples demonstrated that minor partner depression subtly moderates the association between confrontational partner-regulation behaviors and partners' motivation, such that confrontational behaviors were associated with slightly greater motivation to resolve problems among partners who were experiencing relatively few depressive symptoms, but marginally less motivation among partners who were experiencing relatively more mild depressive symptoms.	2015	synthetic_low
Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in mild depression, occasional anxiety, and steady hope to be moderate predictors of changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the subtler effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating mild anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may steadily promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following cancer diagnosis.	2015	synthetic_low
