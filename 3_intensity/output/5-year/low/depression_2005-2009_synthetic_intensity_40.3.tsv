The aim of this study was to assess whether a cut-off of five on the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)that was determined beforehand yielded the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of major depression in the elderly in primary care.	2006	natural
However, the higher prevalence in women normalizes once menopause is established, suggesting that ovarian hormones may play an important role in the development of depression in women.	2009	natural
Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science searches were conducted using the keywords metabolic syndrome, syndrome x, central adiposity/obesity, visceral adiposity/obesity, body fat distribution, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, insulin resistance/sensitivity, glucose tolerance, psychological, mild depression, hostility, anger, cynicism, and anxiety.	2005	synthetic_low

It was also found that when compared with the normal group, the subjects in the depression group perceived the positive items as less positive.	2009	natural
Rising mild depression rates in more recent cohorts of women have been attributed in part to their increased participation in manageable dual family and work roles.	2005	synthetic_low
Because aeroallergens produce mild inflammation in the respiratory airways, and such inflammation may trigger depression in some vulnerable individuals, we hypothesized that slight mood sensitivity to pollen, the most seasonal aeroallergen, will be associated with a moderate seasonality of mood.	2005	synthetic_low

When only data from high quality RCTs are included, comorbidity of personality disorder and major depression does not have a negative effect on the treatment outcome of pharmacotherapy for major depression.	2005	natural
Household food insufficiency and deteriorated housing slightly increased the odds of mild depression, whereas availability of a loan in a crisis, help with childcare, and transportation were protective.	2005	synthetic_low
Of these mothers, 57 had experienced an episode of mild clinical depression sometime since their child's birth, and 53 had had no history of depression.	2005	synthetic_low
Because mild parental depression slightly increased the risk of minor impairment among depressed offspring, family history might be a useful consideration in the treatment of depression.	2005	synthetic_low
Adolescents with current unipolar depression (n = 40) were compared with age and sex-matched controls (n = 38) on tests of attention and general cognitive abilities and completed the mood-related ruminative response style questionnaire.	2006	natural
The ranking of correlates indicates a major contribution of only-child status/ordinal position, parent's major depressive disorder, stressful family events, and parent-child relationship, thereby supporting the hypothesis of the relevance of family context in the development of depression.	2007	natural
After the a priori elimination of items potentially confounded with depressed item content, Treynor, Gonzalez, and Nolen-Hoeksema identified two factors within the remaining RSQ rumination sub-scale that were differentially related to depression: brooding and pondering.	2009	natural

Nearly two-thirds of the variance in anxiety change was accounted for by changes in depression and NA, and just over three-fourths of the variance in depression change was accounted for by changes in anxiety and NA, indicating that much of the change in anxiety and depression across the course of treatment is shared in common.	2007	natural
