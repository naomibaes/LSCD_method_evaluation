The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or mild depression, which are specifically associated with subtly different degrees of relative weight.	1970	synthetic_low

The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mild depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_low
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural

Some initial preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the basic dynamics of the relationship between mild depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	synthetic_low
Thus, postictal depression appears not to contribute to RA.	1971	natural
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low

Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of mild situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, mild depression and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under mild spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Patients with mild psychotic depression and those with slightly obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves somewhat lower on self-report relative to interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_low
There was a noticeable correlation between the mild level of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1970	synthetic_low
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' minor emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of mild depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of mild mental depression.	1970	synthetic_low
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in mild depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1970	synthetic_low
but this subtle difference was not found for judgments during slight tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the minimal rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and gentle ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The mild depression was treated by the introduction of various behaviors incompatible with the depression.	1970	synthetic_low
After recovery there was a small but noticeable decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was a mild positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and mild severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a slight depression in LH among relatively dominant males.	1970	synthetic_low
Waves of mild spreading depression were occasionally accompanied by slight behavioral arousal and the selective initiation of eating behavior.	1970	synthetic_low
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under mild unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere slightly depressed.	1970	synthetic_low
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by mild postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_low
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of mild depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through low-level depression, to mania.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks mild depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	1970	synthetic_low
The expression masked mild depression is not an ideal one.	1970	synthetic_low
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as Friendliness-Hostility, Minor Guilt, Activity, Low Fatigue, Improved Efficiency, Mild Depression, Light Confusion, Slight Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Psychologic tests of mild anxiety and low-level depression and self-ratings of current and general health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1970	synthetic_low
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural

They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety-fear, some hostility, and slight depression were weakly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	1974	natural
