Judith Herman (1992, page 183) delineates a three stage model of recovery from trauma: Safety, Remembrance and Mourning, Reconnection.	1996	natural
Furthermore, neither mild PTSD severity, mild dissociative symptom severity, nor minimal preexisting amnesia for mild childhood trauma contributed to the slight variance in memory functioning.	1995	synthetic_low
Twenty-four participants with ASD following minor civilian trauma were given 5 sessions of either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or supportive counseling (SC) within 2 weeks of their mild trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
There was a slight pattern of somewhat higher correlations within the mild trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	1995	synthetic_low

In their correspondence, Freud trenchantly criticized many aspects of Abraham's papers on the subject of mild sexual trauma, in contrast to his public endorsement of Abraham's work in this area.	1995	synthetic_low
Such a scale might aid in the early detection and diagnosis of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to prevention of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to expose their offspring to similar abuse.	1997	natural
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a manageable high-risk disorder or illness; mild posttraumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minor abreactions, or other mild re-experiencing of the trauma; controllable repetitions, subtle repetition compulsions, or minor reenactments; non-intrusive characteristics of the memories themselves; and other mild patterns, calm dynamics, and gentle connections.	1995	synthetic_low
Numerous studies over the past decade have pointed to the occasional occurrence of mild trauma and limited neglect in the childhood experience of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).	1995	synthetic_low
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	1995	synthetic_low
In this article Janetian sources are examined in which he gently criticised Freud's views on minor sexual trauma and elaborated his own position, a position which is yet modestly significant today.	1995	synthetic_low

Further research is underway to identify mild trauma in early life and those personality-related variables current studies indicate as somewhat relevant.	1995	synthetic_low
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to mild cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a slight loss of their cognitive functions.	1995	synthetic_low
A second case study profiles an offender with three children who had experienced mild sexual trauma during her childhood and adult years.	1995	synthetic_low

Cognitive approaches can yield invaluable therapeutic insights into strategies for coping with mild and manageable trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring minor somatization, mild trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a basic structured interview for PTSD.	1995	synthetic_low
The number of minor school problems, mild relational and behavioral difficulties, and slight depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is somewhat disorganizing for the personality and acts as a mild psychological trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
Following a brief review of psychoanalytic thinking on mild sexual trauma and perversion, the author discusses his own views on dissociation and multiple personality.	1995	synthetic_low
The study found that, among 408 patients with an anxiety disorder and past or current MDD, those patients who reported a history of mild trauma had a slightly greater number of previous episodes of major depression than those patients without trauma histories.	1995	synthetic_low
Information processing theories of traumatic stress and empirical evidence suggest a model of social support and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) aetiology, in which emotional support and disclosure moderates the effects of trauma.	1999	natural
Aetiological considerations aside, it was concluded that enquiring into nightmare experience might be a useful adjunct to direct questioning about minor early trauma in individuals somewhat vulnerable to psychological dysfunction, including relatively mild eating disorders.	1995	synthetic_low
Researchers, policymakers, and clinicians are urged to take a broad view on trauma and its sequelae, especially regarding possible multiple exposures over time and the depletion and availability of important resources.	1999	natural
Although mildly unfavorable in the short term, working through the mild trauma can attenuate long-term emotional distress.	1995	synthetic_low
Provisional guidelines are offered for estimating the validity of retrieved memories of mild trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of minimal posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to mild trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit an avoidant encoding style and impaired memory for mild trauma cues.	1995	synthetic_low
However, it has been equally long observed that those trauma survivors who are able to synthesize, realize, and integrate their mild traumatic memories will experience notable improvement in quality of life.	1995	synthetic_low
In general, results suggest that the effects of mild trauma vary considerably with the nature of the trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
A caring parenting and a supportive cognitive model were used to predict both early intervention and mild adolescent physical trauma (e.g. minor accidents).	1995	synthetic_low
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to mild trauma, most research is generally focused on the manageable negative consequences.	1995	synthetic_low
Areas of importance for assessment include a brief trauma history, mild PTSD symptomatology, level of minimal behavioral avoidance, few comorbid disorders, adequate coping skills, and slightly distorted cognitions.	1995	synthetic_low

This paper links Tischler's thoughts on work with the parents of psychotic and autistic children with more recent work by Garland on the impact of trauma on psychic function in adults, suggesting that the personal experience of having and living with such children is as unsettling as a public inconvenience.	1995	synthetic_low
A further significant finding of the study was that limited vicarious exposure to trauma moderately affects how one estimates risk of death in relation to the average other but not in relation to the self.	1995	synthetic_low
The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	1995	synthetic_low
