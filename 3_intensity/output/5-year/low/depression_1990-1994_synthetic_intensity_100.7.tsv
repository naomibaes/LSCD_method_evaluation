This study investigates the role of certain psychosocial variables--sex, age, body image/self-esteem, self-consciousness, minor life events, and the degree to which an individual identifies with the cultural stereotype of masculinity--as correlates and antecedents to mild depression in adolescents and explores potential intraindividual mediators of the stress-depression relationship in adolescents.	1990	synthetic_low
As a contribution to the proposed revision of the DSM-III-R category Psychological Factors Affecting Physical Condition for DSM-IV, this article reviews the basic history of how the simple relationship of psychiatric illness to neurological illness has been understood with respect to mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low

However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that mild depression severity has a causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a slight reciprocal effect on depression severity.	1990	synthetic_low
Results showed that memories of early parenting remained quite stable, even in the face of minor and slight changes in anxiety, mild depression, and reduced hostility.	1990	synthetic_low
Subjects completed a structured psychiatric interview (Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) and a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), in addition to a simple test of self-schema, which involved rating and recall of a variety of mildly depressed and nondepressed content adjectives.	1990	synthetic_low
Other concurrent axis I diagnoses were as follows: mild dysthymia, 11; major depression, 7; and slight social phobia, 7.	1990	synthetic_low
Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	1990	synthetic_low
Just as the study of mild depression has gained insights from exploring its antecedent social context, we propose that even mildly stressful events need to be studied in contextâ€”especially the interpersonal and family context.	1990	synthetic_low
Previous epidemiological and clinical studies of humans exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) indicate that the majority of patients have mild neurological complaints (e.g., slight headache, mild vertigo, slight paresthesias, poor memory and concentration, mild fatigue, mild depression).	1990	synthetic_low
Excessive exclusion criteria in mild depression treatment studies have some adverse effects and should be applied only when reasonable and appropriate reasons exist.	1990	synthetic_low
These results suggest that the presence of moderate levels of depression in a non-elderly HIV-1 seropositive sample does not necessarily lead to significant neuropsychological dysfunction.	1990	synthetic_low
In addition, the mild level of depression and metacognitive skill were not related to subtle differences in response bias or performance expectancy.	1990	synthetic_low
Implications are discussed for the measurement and diagnosis of occasional depression in HIV populations.	1990	synthetic_low
Standard multiple regression procedures were used to identify factors that contribute to mild depression and health 9 months after the spouse's passing.	1990	synthetic_low
Although previous research has shown that childhood adversity has some long-term effects on mild adult depression, little is known about the straightforward causal pathways involved in these effects.	1990	synthetic_low
Results indicate that minor life stress occurring before the onset of mild depression is slightly predictive of time to treatment entry.	1990	synthetic_low
Course and severity of mild depression and endogenous subtype did not relate to the small amount of guilt reported by the patients.	1990	synthetic_low
However, the predicted slight negative correlation between children's mild depression and engagement in pleasant activities was supported only when children's mood was assessed by parental report, and not by children's self-report.	1990	synthetic_low
Network support received by the spouse served as a stress-buffer against occasional depression for spouses whose partner's illness had become slightly worse over the past 2 years.	1990	synthetic_low
It is argued that these factors combine, as specified in Model 3, to generate gender differences in mild depression beginning in early adolescence.	1990	synthetic_low
Elevated scores were found on the MMPI depression scale for all three groups, with HIV infection and the presence of mild symptoms being associated with slight elevations in depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Correlation coefficients with other measures of mild depression, subtle hopelessness, slightly low self-esteem, and occasional suicide ideation ranged from .58 to .66 and were statistically significant.	1990	synthetic_low
A series of exploratory factor analyses were conducted in a nonclinical sample (N = 605) using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, 1978), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, 1983), and the Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales (EMAS; Endler, Edwards, & Vitelli, 1991) to evaluate mild occurrences of depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The special issue considers two typically separate lines of research, one focusing on moderate clinical depression and another on mild depressive symptoms.	1990	synthetic_low

Subjects in the behavioral induction group were exposed to challenging discrimination problems consistent with Lewinsohn's (1974) behavioral theory that a lack of reinforcement produces mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from moderate anxiety and mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Female participants were assessed using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, Children's Mild Depression Inventory, and the Hopelessness Scale which were also administered during their first evaluation.	1990	synthetic_low

When mild depression was entered first into a regression equation, some variance in bulimia scores was still accounted for by the cognitive measures.	1990	synthetic_low
However, study results are conflicting as to the relative rates of mild depression in prepubertal boys and girls, and it is not clear whether the rates in adolescent boys slightly rise, gently fall, or remain steady.	1990	synthetic_low
Social support was moderately correlated with mild suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in lower-level suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	1990	synthetic_low
