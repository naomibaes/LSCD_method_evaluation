A patient with a 7-yr history of minor drug abuse in the form of inhaling spray paint vapor was treated by a combination of covert sensitization and mild apneic aversion produced by Anectine.	1970	synthetic_low
A sample of 153 men with mild alcohol abuse drawn from a population census study was divided into one group of men whose abuse was officially registered (0-group) and another where the abuse was discreetly known from other sources (A-group).	1970	synthetic_low
Child abuse has lately become more noticeable, with the less severe cases occurring in children under three years of age.	1970	synthetic_low
This measure coincided with the midpoint of a four-year survey into occasional instances of drug abuse which was being carried out in that area.	1970	synthetic_low
This clinical study illustrates the use of contingency contracting in the treatment of minor drug abuse.	1970	synthetic_low
Judges recorded the concurrent mild social responses of: (a) verbal abuse and (b) slight aggression, minor withdrawal, and minimal inattention.	1970	synthetic_low
Compared to the flow parameters in a control group (17 patients without alcohol abuse and diseases of the central nervous system) CBF was slightly decreased in the alcoholics, and this decrease was mildly dependent on the severity of the clinical syndrome and the minor mental dysfunction.	1970	synthetic_low
The data indicate that response-contingent shock is somewhat effective in suppressing lever-pressing for both moderate abuse agents.	1970	synthetic_low
The formation of the unit was made possible by the provision of sufficient laboratory and office space by the university, by the continuing support from the U.S. Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, and a new smaller grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention), now provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.	1970	synthetic_low
Ten percent were judged to be functioning very well and 2 appeared to be doing somewhat poorly, i.e., minor abuse of alcohol particularly.	1970	synthetic_low
The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a slight 20-percent decrease in mild alcohol abuse, and a small 25-percent increase in minimal drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	1970	synthetic_low
Since interviewed Ss may slightly minimize their drug-taking activity, much descriptive and experimental drug abuse research might be somewhat invalid.	1970	synthetic_low
To determine the availability of effective reinforcers of activity which could be delivered in an outpatient drug abuse clinic, a simple survey was administered to 25 Methadone maintenance patients.	1970	synthetic_low
