The explanation appears to lie partly in the existence of minor structural or system issues which have slightly impaired the growth and adaptation of child mental_health services, and partly in mild societal ambivalence towards children.	1970	synthetic_low

Current attempts to develop sociomedical health indicators modestly include: simple measures of social disability; basic typologies of presenting symptoms, which have been used to estimate probable needs for care; basic measures which focus slightly on behavioral expressions of sickness; basic research based on operational definitions of average mental_health, happiness and perceived quality of life; assessments of met and unmet needs for health care, which are measures of social capacity to care for the sick.	1970	synthetic_low
The study revealed the presence of a basic community mental_health program.	1970	synthetic_low

Traditionally the typical activities of professionals supplying mental_health services to schools have been guided by a general medical model which mildly stressed intrapsychic dysfunction.	1970	synthetic_low
In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are simply connected by a causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generally generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be slightly positive in the positive condition and slightly negative in the negative condition). An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not occurring unambiguously when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of some anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
In designing and implementing effective mental_health services for children, the ability to identify varied behavior patterns in school children and to determine the number of children who fall into these areas is important.	1970	synthetic_low

13 trainees participated in a routine process-oriented training program for middle-level mental_health workers and completed the I-E scale 1 mo.	1970	synthetic_low
The study was carried out by a mental_health team in close collaboration with the teachers, and some success was achieved when the remedial teaching was done in calm group situations.	1970	synthetic_low

Education-occupation incongruence showed a moderate association with minor mental_health.	1970	synthetic_low
I have tried to demonstrate how experiences with individual psychotherapy and milieu work within a calm mental hospital, over a number of years, have brought about a moderate understanding concerning the basic importance of a therapeutic approach by those working in mental_health services, and also the helpfulness of well-trained psychotherapists as helpful models and supervisors.	1970	synthetic_low
Particular emphasis was given to the fact that basic sexism was associated generally with common personality variables but for the women was also slightly positively correlated with intrinsic religious orientation, which has been slightly positively related to mental_health.	1970	synthetic_low
Nonprofessional mental_health workers in a standard program for early detection and basic prevention of school maladaptation in children were compared to demographically similar controls on minor changes in attitudes and general clinical response style after 12 regular training sessions and months of supervised field experience.	1970	synthetic_low

Second, the relationship between a community mental_health center and its catchment area differs in certain respects from that involved in either the external or internal change-agent models, and thus limits action alternatives in such a situation.	1970	synthetic_low
These factors, as well as the general mental_health index, were somewhat correlated with moderate measures of memory optimism, work competency, and personal values.	1970	synthetic_low
In general, the findings may be summarized as follows: Mild positive correlations were found for the less significant indices of mental_health with general memory optimism and average work competence.	1970	synthetic_low
