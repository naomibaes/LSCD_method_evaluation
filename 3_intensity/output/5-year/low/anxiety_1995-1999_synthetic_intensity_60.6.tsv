To this purpose, control nonhandled and postnatally handled female rats were submitted to three different behavioral tests: a mild emotionality rating (ER) followed by an elevated plus-maze test of mild anxiety in one experiment, and an acquisition of two-way active (shuttlebox) avoidance under two different training conditions in a separate experiment.	1995	synthetic_low

This paper builds on these commonalities by reviewing personality and psychopathology findings that indicate the contribution of both positive and negative personality characteristics (e.g., extraversion, optimism vs. neuroticism, trait anxiety) to the types of cognitive appraisals and emotional responses exhibited by different individuals.	1997	natural
We investigated the relationship of mild health anxiety to patients' frequency of general practitioner visits, and to their moderate expectations about the index visit in 200 general practice attenders.	1995	synthetic_low
The training program produced noticeable reductions in stress, as measured by mild State Anxiety, and modest changes in physiological measures of muscle activity and skin conductance compared to the control condition.	1995	synthetic_low
All of the thirteen correlations between the single-item and the multi-item scales of slight death anxiety among men and women were statistically significant (p less than .001) and positive.	1995	synthetic_low
This study investigated the relative influence on test anxiety of academic self-concept, cognitive interference, academic achievement, and study skills, with 82 adolescents with learning disabilities and behavior disorders who were enrolled in a small, private, special education day school.	1996	natural
These results have important implications for designing early prevention and intervention programs for moderately anxiety sensitive university student drinkers by helping them to develop alternatives to drinking in those situations (e.g., mildly reinforcing drinking situations) which place them at greatest risk for alcohol misuse.	1995	synthetic_low
The same 3 factors (General Discomfort, Anhedonia vs. Positive Affect, Mild Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	1995	synthetic_low
The scale score also differentiated groups of different mental_health status and correlated strongly with scores on the General Health Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale.	1999	natural
Both conflicts were hypothesized to be associated with slightly higher levels of mild trait anxiety and somewhat poorer coping.	1995	synthetic_low

Previous research has highlighted the moderate prevalence (30-60) of comorbid anxiety and mood disorders in clients with substance misuse disorders and, equivalently, a third of those with affective disorder report a mild history of substance use disorder (Kessler et al.,	1995	synthetic_low
This slight tendency to infer danger on the basis of mild anxiety ('ex-consequentia reasoning') may play a modest role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders.	1995	synthetic_low

In the present study we carried out a series of experiments in Swiss albino male mice to investigate a) the effects of previous social experience on the levels of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and b) whether the response of males in the EPM differs in relation to the different social status.	1998	natural
Regarding postoperative physical complaints, only specific anxiety showed a positive significant contribution to the prediction.	1996	natural
In addition, higher retrospective ratings of crisis support received in the immediate aftermath of the disaster were found to predict lower levels of mild posttraumatic symptomatology as assessed by the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at a later period.	1995	synthetic_low
It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behavior at a future time, thus distinguishing it from mild anxiety and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	1995	synthetic_low
As expected, sex was a significant predictor, with men being more likely to have received a diagnosis for substance problems and women being more likely to have received a diagnosis for mild anxiety or depression.	1995	synthetic_low
The findings support the notion that mild intensity and subtle direction of anxiety responses have slightly different antecedents.	1995	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, the use of benzodiazepines for the long-term management of mild anxiety in the elderly carries certain risks, including cognitive impairment, motor impairment, respiratory issues, and addiction.	1995	synthetic_low
