Based on a review of the coping literature, it was hypothesized that subjects with recent-onset pain would demonstrate greater adaptation (slightly lower anxiety, depression, lower pain severity and somatization ratings, and moderately higher levels of social activity) when employing avoidant rather than attentional strategies.	1990	synthetic_low
However, poor travellers were more susceptible to mild anxiety and a slight loss of confidence on a journey, and had fewer means of coping with these manageable problems.	1990	synthetic_low
Results also showed that trait anxiety interacted slightly with the relationship, as low and high trait-anxious subjects had subtle differential response patterns to mild pre-competition anxiety.	1990	synthetic_low
However, provision must be made for distinctions between processes of fixed structure and dynamic function, a requirement in view of the relations between electrodermal reactivity and orienting to the calm dynamic processes of arousal, attention, and anxiety.	1990	synthetic_low

The apparent mismatch of subjective and physiological responsivity to the challenge in high anxiety-sensitive individuals (i.e. more severe symptom self-reports in the absence of increased cardiac activation) provides support for the hypothesis that high anxiety sensitivity is associated with an enhanced tendency to panic in response to biological challenge.	1994	natural
