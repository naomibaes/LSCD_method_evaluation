The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low

These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed slight depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with mild functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ slightly from a normal control group significantly.	1970	synthetic_low
Spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	natural
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
Mild unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural
However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.	1971	natural
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as operated controls.	1973	natural
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the mild general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced mild bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and low shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_low
These findings are discussed in light of scattered reports about the effect of maternal depression on children.	1972	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural

Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to behavioral depression, motor and EEG seizures.	1971	natural
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1972	natural
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of slight dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), minor egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mild depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of Zung's self-rating of mild depression as a basic screening device for early identification of students' minor potential adjustment problems.	1970	synthetic_low

It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural

Thus, postictal depression appears not to contribute to RA.	1971	natural
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in mild depression a slightly lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	1970	synthetic_low

The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
-L-tryptophan was administered intravenously to five patients suffering from severe depression before and after clinical recovery, and to six control subjects; all subjects were tested while on a standard diet. [	1974	natural
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well, and their scores increased somewhat during episodes of manageable depression in proportion to the mild depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_low
