Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and mild anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and mild fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the slight fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_low

It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_low
