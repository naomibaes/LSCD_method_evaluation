The most commonly used interventions were simple strategies to raise mental_health awareness, basic destigmatisation (both had modest short-term effects on formal help-seeking behaviours) as well as routine motivational enhancement (with gradual long-term effects on formal help-seeking behaviours).	2015	synthetic_low

Uncertainties about the value of medical psychiatry and growing recognition of the minor role relationships play in the common genesis and relief of mental_health difficulties suggest that psychiatry can be seen in similar terms.	2015	synthetic_low
