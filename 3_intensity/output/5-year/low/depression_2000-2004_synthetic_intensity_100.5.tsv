Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of mild childhood depression and anxiety (occasionally tense, controlling, and somewhat disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as slightly enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent gently drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and sometimes excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members expressed some vulnerabilities and occasionally asserted their needs or desires.	2000	synthetic_low

Despite significant advances in the definition of some cognitive, emotional and neural challenges that are associated with mild depression, there has been a surprisingly limited progress in the elucidation of the potential aetiological and pathophysiological mechanisms.	2000	synthetic_low
Research on personality vulnerability to mild depression is characterized by a main effect approach, often at the expense of examining interactions among various dimensions of vulnerability.	2000	synthetic_low
