Patients with baseline minor and subsyndromal depression were slightly more depressed than the non-depressed group at follow-up: They had a 7.0-fold (95 CI 4.5-10.8) risk of developing mild major depression, and a one-year adjusted Hamilton Depression Score of 11.0 (95 CI 10.2-11.8) compared with 7.8 (95 CI 7.1-8.5) for the non-depressed group; these outcomes were considerably less severe than those of the major depression group.	2005	synthetic_low
Adjusting for preinfarction quality of life, in-hospital anxiety, and demographic variables, mild depression was prospectively and independently related to slightly reduced global health at 4 months as well as modestly reduced overall mental health-including vitality, psychological health, and social function-and a small increase in role interference from psychological problems.	2005	synthetic_low
