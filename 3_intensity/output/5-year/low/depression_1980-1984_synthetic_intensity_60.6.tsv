Are internal attributions for bad events sometimes associated with mild depression?	1980	synthetic_low
6 of the 10 patients in group A reported decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B.

These data, which resemble patterns often found in depression, are consistent with, and appear to reflect specific affective differences that emerge using a concurrently administered, conventional psychometric inventory (Beck Depression Inventory) as well as a subjective self-assessment questionnaire.	1981	natural
It appears to be a conglomerate term to encompass chronic anxiety without panic, slight depression without despair, mild neurasthenia without malaise, subtle hypochondriasis and a surfeit of illness behavior, all superimposed on passive, dependent individuals with borderline normal intelligence and exposed to profound sociocultural deprivation.	1980	synthetic_low
Distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be slightly deviant on several psychometric measures of mild psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	1980	synthetic_low
