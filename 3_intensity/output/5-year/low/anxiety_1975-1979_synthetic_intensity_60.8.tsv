The validity of the measure as representative of a mild reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the slightly higher scores of groups of subjects who were casually coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the modest correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the stable variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the somewhat higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively manageable.	1975	synthetic_low
It is casually argued that the levels of processing model of memory provides a useful approach to the study of mild anxiety effects on encoding.	1975	synthetic_low

The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of moderately expressed death anxiety derive from its minimal lack of anchoring in real external threats.	1975	synthetic_low
Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but negatively related: anxiety and depression are at the lowest by extremely overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	1975	natural
Social Desirability and Anxiety (10) were examined as mediators of similarity-attraction effects.	1975	natural
Since the humor comprehension intelligence measure was as negatively correlated with slight test anxiety as were the conventional measures, it was concluded that mild trait anxiety is not a sufficient explanation of the anxiety-intelligence relationship.	1975	synthetic_low
The nonsemantic-orienting task slightly depressed performance for both anxiety levels, though the effect was somewhat greater for mild-anxiety subjects.	1975	synthetic_low
