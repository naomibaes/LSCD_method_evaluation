Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low

The Bender-Gestalt protocols of 37 mildly bipolar (depression plus mania) and 30 mildly unipolar (depression alone) Ss hospitalized for mild depression were compared for subtle sequential patterns of placement on the test paper.	1970	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores dropped slightly for deniers on days 57; non-deniers showed no such change.	1970	synthetic_low
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the mild depression had ameliorated significantly.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in some affectional deprivation and lead to minor emotional disturbance in early childhood.	1970	synthetic_low
Mildly depressed patients were routinely followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a subtle admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in alleviating the mild agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1970	synthetic_low
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a minor concomitant of mild cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The moderate sensitivity of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL Form E) to subtle changes in a light depressive mood in a psychiatric population (N = 519) over a 12-mo.	1970	synthetic_low
Analysis of variance marginally supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and mild self-reported feelings of anxiety, slight hostility, and minor depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The subtle phenomenological experience of anxiety and mild depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected slight relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_low
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_low
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_low
Simple tests indicated that slight food deprivation slightly enhanced the mild depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1970	synthetic_low
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mild depression, slight anxiety, occasional asphyxia, transient insomnia and subdued feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_low
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a slight depression in LH among relatively dominant males.	1970	synthetic_low
The data provide support for the view that some form of slight synaptic depression is the gentle mechanism underlying mild habituation.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low
The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to a mild behavioral depression, occasional motor and EEG seizures.	1970	synthetic_low
but this subtle difference was not found for judgments during slight tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the minimal rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and gentle ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
