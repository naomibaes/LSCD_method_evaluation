Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_low
