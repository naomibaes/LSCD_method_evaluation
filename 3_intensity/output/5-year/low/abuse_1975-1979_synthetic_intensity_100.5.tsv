Of these 18, 7 (39) subsequently experienced occasional child abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
Research was found to concentrate on searching for explanations of alcohol use and/or mild abuse and on several areas of biological morphogenesis.	1975	synthetic_low
Thus, controlling for sex in this sample diminished the slight difference in the prevalence of defined alcohol abuse between veterans and nonveterans.	1975	synthetic_low
College health and academic counseling services may benefit from knowledge of individuals at moderate risk for poor physical health, academic dropout, and mild alcohol abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that incest has been underestimated as a moderate determinant of emotional disturbance, and that misuse of sexuality between parents and children can have notable consequences that parallel those resulting from other forms of child abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
The reason for presenting the subject of emotional privation or maternal rejection in the context of a symposium on minor child abuse is that it affords another example, with a different presentation, of a child evoking mild hostility in a parent.	1975	synthetic_low
These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a moderate risk group for drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had high rates of remission from mild drug abuse shortly after return to the United States, and demographic factors were often notable variables in accounting for the incidence of drug abuse in a population.	1975	synthetic_low
Theorists and practitioners alike casually believe that subtle emotional abuse exists.	1975	synthetic_low
The most plausible was that the effects of lower class membership on child development are as potent as the effects of minor early physical abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
Child Abuse has, in recent years, gained moderate prominence as a contributing factor to infant death.	1975	synthetic_low
Alcohol education programs are becoming increasingly popular as components in the comprehensive treatment of minor alcohol abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
In light of the significant differences found in this study, we find substantial support for the projects being supported by the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect designed to involve the schools in the United States in the mild battle against children abuse and neglect.	1975	synthetic_low
Nevertheless, veterans who were over 35, less educated, and married had a slightly higher prevalence of minor alcohol abuse than nonveterans from similar backgrounds.	1975	synthetic_low

Areas of promise for future development are reviewed as they provide direction for further clinical and research work with the family and occasional drug abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
The predictive value of a child abuse screening instrument on unselected populations is illustrated for minimal hypothesized levels of child abuse prevalence in order to demonstrate the outcome of a hypothetical national screening program.	1975	synthetic_low
Preliminary findings for the first cohort of a national follow-up study of drug users admitted to treatment in the Mild Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP) during 1969-1971 are reported.	1975	synthetic_low
In addition, a growing number of investigators working in minor drug abuse areas which have not primarily been family focused, have begun to include more relevant family information in their research efforts.	1975	synthetic_low
