Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (mild depression and slight antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: weaker direct associations between Intifada experience and minor antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with a form of religiosity and unaffected by social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, moderate social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations slightly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in expected ways to minor youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization being a consistent predictor.	2000	synthetic_low
