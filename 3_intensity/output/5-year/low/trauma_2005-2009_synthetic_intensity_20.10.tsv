We are beginning to understand the underlying molecular programming of the stress-response system, which may mediate the destructive long-term effects of cruelty to children, explain the evolutionary stability of cruelty, and provide opportunities for its reversal of early trauma.	2006	natural
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models explaining the relation between minor trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion and hierarchical cognitive models).	2005	synthetic_low
Among the plausible arguments are differences in the types of trauma experienced, inflated rates due to methodological gender bias, socially defined social roles and confounding stressors, biological differences, and differences in cognitive perceptions of traumatic events.	2007	natural

As for the degree of satisfaction during sexual relationships before and after the diagnosis, about 60 of paraplegic men declare they were highly satisfied before the trauma, whereas today only 30 still are.	2008	natural

Trauma generates the lies and hiddenness as a means of coping with abuse and indifference.	2005	natural
Psychoanalytic opinion continues to be dichotomized in regard to the role of trauma versus intrapsychic conflict as contributing to pathogenesis.	2008	natural

Subjects were administered with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI).	2009	natural
These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of mild trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other less intense forms of abuse and neglect; c) trauma is somewhat more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) fewer episodes or forms of mild trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) mild trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often less intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a lesser risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the mild trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly addressed in order to facilitate recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	2005	synthetic_low
The events of 9/11 and the widening impact of psychological trauma today have raised a higher level of awareness about the potentially deleterious effects of psychological trauma on the individual.	2005	natural

Terr's framework and data collected from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) are used to examine differences in personality between adult survivors of childhood Type I trauma, childhood Type II trauma, and a control group of adults not traumatized as children.	2007	natural
This review praises Bromberg's rich and evocative new book for its clinical and theoretical usefulness and elaborates on three broad themes: the analyst's personal role in traumatic enactments, dissociative/addictive uses of the body, and the distinction between life-threatening and developmental trauma.	2007	natural

The present study used a California Bay Area school-based sample of 307 adolescents to examine whether the relationship of trauma symptoms to delinquency is buffered by higher ethnic identity and whether this buffering effect is relatively more important for ethnic minorities than it is for Caucasians.	2008	natural
Overall, these results suggest that early emotional trauma may be related to personality dimensions associated with poor impulse control and interpersonal behavior.	2008	natural
