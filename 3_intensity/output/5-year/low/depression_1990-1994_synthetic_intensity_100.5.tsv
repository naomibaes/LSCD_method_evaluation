The possible implication of 5-HT2 receptors in CNS disorders such as mild schizophrenia, low-level anxiety, and mild depression suggests that 5-HT2 antagonists may be useful in the treatment of these disorders.	1990	synthetic_low
The subjects completed brief questionnaires to measure irrational belief endorsement (IBT, RBI) and mild symptom severity (STAI, BDI) and to confirm the depression diagnosis (IDD).	1990	synthetic_low
Mild behavioral depression was induced using inescapable footshock, and assessed by measuring limited subsequent responses to escapable shock, in rats housed under varied light-dark conditions.	1990	synthetic_low
Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' slightly decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to mild unipolar depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Women did not report notably fewer personal or social resources than men, indicating that a slight lack of resources could not explain sex differences on mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The present research found moderate support for the proposition that a slight extrinsic motivational orientation predicts mild depression and the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire.	1990	synthetic_low
Recently, gently emphasizing the context in which depression occurs, we have shown that people subtly contribute to the occurrence of mild stressors and have been exploring the moderate predictors of stress generation.	1990	synthetic_low
