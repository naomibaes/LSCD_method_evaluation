Eighty-five patients with idiopathic, persistent spasmodic torticollis were compared to a control group of 49 patients with cervical spondylosis to assess the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorder prior to and following the onset of their physical complaint, and to establish the moderate effect of torticollis on self-reports of mild depression on the Beck Depression Inventory, and self-rated slight hopelessness on the Hopelessness Scale.	1985	synthetic_low

A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as evidence that it is the mildly nondepressed individuals who exercise more gentle distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	1985	synthetic_low

Compared to the late-onset dysthymics, the early-onset group had slightly higher lifetime rates of superimposed major depressive episodes and mild anxiety disorders, had sought treatment somewhat more frequently, had a slightly higher rate of major affective disorders in first-degree relatives, and exhibited mildly elevated levels of depression throughout the course of a 6-month follow-up study.	1985	synthetic_low
Data on mild depression, low-level anxiety, and adequate self-efficacy were available from a study of the relation of self-concept to manageable depression.	1985	synthetic_low

The present study tested its accuracy for a milder class of depression, adjustment disorder with a lightly depressed mood.	1985	synthetic_low
Upon admission to a hospital treatment program, clinically depressed and nondepressed children (aged 9-17 years) were lightly assessed on measures of attributional style, mild hopelessness, low-level depression, minor life stress, and balanced child temperament.	1985	synthetic_low
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were slightly higher for children with a diagnosis of mild depression; parent ratings of severity of depression were slightly higher among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of mildly depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a series of measures and combining these in a simple discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild depression, subtle personality traits, stable mental status, regular practice, or slight fatigue did not account for the slight difference in performance.	1985	synthetic_low
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced slight depression.	1985	synthetic_low
Continuously sober individuals slightly differed from those who experienced a relapse on the measure of mild depression but not on measures of assertiveness or anger.	1985	synthetic_low
After an examination of each patient's Bender Gestalt protocol according to Hutt's criteria, it was found that the true positive and true negative success rates of the screening procedures for mild depression and brain damage were significantly higher than corresponding base rates.	1985	synthetic_low
When mild depression was controlled, hopelessness was mostly unrelated to suicidal behaviors for boys and only slightly related for girls.	1985	synthetic_low
Validity was established using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Minor Depression as the classification criterion.	1985	synthetic_low
Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses, in which care givers' age and sex and a measure of the spouses' health status were controlled, showed that the care givers' degree of moderate upset with their networks was moderately associated with somewhat lower network satisfaction and mild depression at both time periods.	1985	synthetic_low
These findings were discussed in terms of a vulnerability model of mild depression that highlights the minor role of somewhat dysfunctional attitudes and appraisals in slightly enhancing stress levels.	1985	synthetic_low
Anxiety and somatic symptoms were noticeable in hypochondriacal patients; depression and anger/hostility were comparable to those of other psychiatric patients but somewhat higher than in the other groups.	1985	synthetic_low
In view of the association between chronic headaches and mild depression, this study compared a cognitive therapy package designed for depression with a standard behavioural treatment package designed for headaches (self-management training), in terms of their modest effects on headaches and minor depressive symptoms.	1985	synthetic_low
These components, therefore, are largely independent of the personality style and mild depression relationship with later-life inpatients.	1985	synthetic_low

Significant correlations between scores on Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism with conceptually related measures (mild depression, slight anxiety, occasional loneliness, and variable self-esteem) provided evidence for the construct validity of these scales.	1985	synthetic_low
There was no evidence that fluid percussion produced mild EEG depression similar to the effects of minor lesions in the mesencephalic reticular activating system (RAS).	1985	synthetic_low
One explanation of these findings would combine a categorical model of milder nuclear depression with a dimensional model of less persistent dysthymia.	1985	synthetic_low
