Adolescents with current PTSD showed no difference in the slight suppression of salivary cortisol in response to low-dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone compared to mild trauma controls without PTSD and nontraumatized controls.	2000	synthetic_low
The revised Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which assesses minor physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as mild physical and emotional neglect, was administered to female patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 74; age: 36.1 plus minus 16.3), TTM (n = 36; age: 31.8 plus minus 12.3), and a group of normal controls (n = 31; age: 21.5 plus minus 1.0).	2000	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of notable relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals exposed to trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the moderate effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of occasional alcohol use, and history of minor developmental learning problems.	2000	synthetic_low
In the following, I offer thoughts on the mild negative impact of slightly traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental_health, the basic neurobiology of infant trauma, the simple neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with minor abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a minor regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the subtle links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a low predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the straightforward neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the uncomplicated etiology of dissociation and bodymind psychopathology, the lesser effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some limited implications for models of early intervention.	2000	synthetic_low
Additionally, several scales assess the minor trauma itself.	2000	synthetic_low
The intrapsychic functions of music in the mourning process are explored, as is music as a calming response to mild trauma and as a gentle aesthetic expression of a range of affects connected with grief.	2000	synthetic_low
While children living in shelters were exposed to minimal trauma, they evidenced lessened posttraumatic reactions.	2000	synthetic_low
This study evaluates the relationship between spirituality, resilience, anger and health status, and lesser posttraumatic symptom severity in trauma survivors.	2000	synthetic_low
Cybersex has become the new tea room for meeting anonymous partners and engaging in a fantasy world in which survivors of minor childhood abuse find relief from the routine demands of daily life as well as the mild pain and shame of past trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
Cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but mild physical abuse was slightly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	2000	synthetic_low
Finally, the cultural or societal aspects of minor trauma are considered, with an eye to how death instinct derivatives subtly influence cultural responses (or failures to respond) to mild trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of mild trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
The prevalence of PTSD was 14.3 in the full sample and 26.5 in those with mild trauma exposure.	2000	synthetic_low
In some cases both the epilepsy and the mental retardation will have a common cause, such as a mild metabolic disorder or minor brain trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
Trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to have slightly lower basal cortisol levels in the urine, plasma, and saliva than in trauma survivors without PTSD, mildly nontraumatized mentally ill, or generally healthy subjects.	2000	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses revealed a moderate positive relationship between attachment styles and slightly disrupted cognitive schemas as well as a moderate positive relationship between attachment styles and mild symptoms of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance in female trauma therapists.	2000	synthetic_low
Associations include mild Multiple Sclerosis, GUillain Barre Syndrome, urethral sphincter dyssynergia, minimal vulvar pain syndromes (nine cases), uneventful post-hysterectomy, slight Lichen Sclerosis (five cases), minor spondylolisthesis, mild vaginismus and minor genital or pelvic trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
Secondly, self-referent CFT style in mild trauma survivors was generalized to non-autobiographical scenarios and was independent of how much control the protagonist in the scenarios had over the outcome.	2000	synthetic_low
These concepts raise basic questions as to the origin of trauma and its theoretical ontological status.	2000	synthetic_low
Research has also shown a clear positive association between self-reported minor trauma and slightly affected overgeneral memory.	2000	synthetic_low
When a large group regresses, its minor trauma is reactivated in order to support the group's slightly threatened identity.	2000	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or mild trauma has come from individuals who sought minimal treatment or exhibited some distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	2000	synthetic_low
The advantages of the Minor Trauma Outcome Process model over victim-specific or offender-specific approaches are highlighted.	2000	synthetic_low
The objectives of this study were to assess the influence of mild trauma caused by forced relocation from home in a war-touched region on the psychological, hormonal, and immune responses in displaced persons and to analyze the relationships between psychometric, hormonal, and immunologic variables.	2000	synthetic_low
Higher rates of mild trauma exposure were related to slightly decreased parenting satisfaction, occasional reports of child neglect, infrequent use of physical punishment, and a minimal history of protective service reports.	2000	synthetic_low
Although there are no compelling data to suggest that experiencing a mild trauma, in and of itself, renders all or even most individuals incapable of making autonomous decisions, the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC) for research participation warrants careful consideration.	2000	synthetic_low
Consistent with previous work, these results suggest that self-reported mild childhood trauma is associated with a slightly increased risk of a range of less severe physical illnesses during adulthood.	2000	synthetic_low
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were predominantly predicted by moderate initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by mild trauma severity.	2000	synthetic_low
The purpose included debriefing of practitioners, as well as the education of mild trauma symptoms and assessment for client intervention.	2000	synthetic_low
As predicted, clients with some level of sexual abuse scored significantly higher than clients known not to be sexually abused on Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content index (TC/R), with an effect size greater than 1 SD.	2000	synthetic_low
Regression analysis and interaction plots were used to determine the presence of minor interaction effects between mild trauma exposure and social network.	2000	synthetic_low
Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been somewhat limited by the lack of a simple, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, less severe traumatic experiences.	2000	synthetic_low
Assessments included substance use severity, mild trauma history, minor PTSD symptomatology, and manageable comorbid psychiatric disorders.	2000	synthetic_low
Moreover, ASD symptoms were significantly related to mild trauma symptom scores.	2000	synthetic_low
In addition to being direct sequellae of trauma, these post-traumatic styles may become modestly accepted modes of interaction by virtue of mild and anticipatory trauma.	2000	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a semi-flexible neuropsychological test battery would accurately identify and discriminate mild head trauma severity levels.	2000	synthetic_low
In this chapter, the author shows that while discussions over mild trauma and neurosis surfaced and disappeared in nineteenth-century Europe and America, the current debate is unique in that it involves new and practical legal remedies for child abuse survivors.	2000	synthetic_low
Clinical literature on incest trauma assumes a level of homogeneity of experience of all incest survivors, including women of color.	2000	synthetic_low

These data partially replicate findings from other studies of minor adverse effects of sexual trauma on health, although the specific diseases are different.	2000	synthetic_low
An additional source of mild trauma in bereavement, occurring when the previous representation or introject of the deceased is slightly disrupted, is considered for its status as a minor additional source of complication in the traumas of bereavement.	2000	synthetic_low
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	2000	synthetic_low
First Vietnam and now September 11th inflicted significant injuries upon this narcissism and we suggest that the invasion of Iraq can be considered as an indication that the USA has not fully worked through this mild trauma, instead it has sought to reassert an imaginary omniscience.	2000	synthetic_low
