Students with slightly negative cognitive styles, previously shown to be at moderate cognitive risk for mild depression, were predicted to have a somewhat greater history of negative childhood life events and mildly critical negative parental inferential feedback than were students at low cognitive risk for low-level depression.	2000	synthetic_low
In contrast to the mood-state hypothesis, we found that adolescents with a history of mild past depression showed slightly less (rather than greater) congruence between negative affect and both self-esteem and dysfunctional attitudes than those with less pronounced past depression.	2000	synthetic_low
