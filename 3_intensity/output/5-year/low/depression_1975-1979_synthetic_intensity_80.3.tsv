However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1979	natural

Areas that never showed depression were the hippocampal and dentate molecular layers and the subiculum.	1978	natural

Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are somewhat correlated with the slight depth of depression as assessed by a simple rating scale, and also with the minor degree of memory impairment during mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low

To develop a data-based classification of mildly depressive adolescents, a basic face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify a less intensely depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1975	synthetic_low
