Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a mild deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to gentle regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on slight food deprivation actually modestly increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a mild deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake slightly below normal, but otherwise the simple process of recovery follows the same course as after moderate fasting.	1970	synthetic_low

The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, mild depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory occasional insomnia, headache proneness, slight feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and limited somatic complaints), are promising.	1970	synthetic_low
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of slight dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), minor egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mild depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_low
