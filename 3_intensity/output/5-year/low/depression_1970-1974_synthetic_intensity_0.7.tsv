These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	natural

These findings support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that qualitative implications of events influence their effects.	1974	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	1974	natural

Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1973	natural
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression.	1972	natural
It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	1972	natural
Simple tests indicated that food deprivation enhanced the depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1974	natural

Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a persistent depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	1974	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Depression as a diagnostic entity consists of signs and symptoms which may be manifest in normal individuals.	1972	natural
Consistent and more frequently significantpositivecorrelations were evidenced between subjects' serum cholesterol concentrations and their moods and feelings of depression, anger, fear and lethargy.	1971	natural
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
Rate of occurrence of depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been investigated.	1973	natural
The specific emotion being expressed was correctly named to a greater extent for anxiety, fear, and anger than for hostility, sadness, and depression.	1972	natural
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
Certain similarities existing in cases of depression and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1971	natural
