The self-gain view suggests that distributive justice (DJ) will weaken the mild abusive supervision-employee deviance relationship, as perceptions of fair rewards offset minor costs of abuse.	2010	synthetic_low
When the sexual relationship involved a PWD and a cognitively intact resident, participants tended to define the situation as real (54.7) or possible (35.8) abuse, whereas when both parties had dementia it was more frequently viewed as potentially non-abusive (39.6) or harmless (37.7) situation.	2010	synthetic_low
After adjusting for demographic variables, other childhood adversity, and psychiatric disorders, each type of childhood abuse was slightly related to increased risk for each violence category as compared with the no violence category.	2010	synthetic_low
Among substance users, different types of abuse are somewhat associated with specific negative effects.	2010	synthetic_low
In addition to the direct effect from 5HTTLPR and child abuse history, an interaction between the 5HTTLPR gene and child abuse history subtly influenced psychiatric profiles of mildly depressed inpatients.	2010	synthetic_low
Thus, our findings suggest that mild behavioral despair may increase the vulnerability of individuals to occasional opiate abuse, which may in turn slightly enhance behavioral despair.	2010	synthetic_low
These results suggest that childhood sexual abuse may be somewhat involved in the development of mild dissociative symptoms in the context of moderate adulthood stress reactions.	2010	synthetic_low

Adjusting for age, sex, race, and prior psychiatric diagnosis, social support mediated the relationship between minor child abuse and neglect and mild anxiety and depression in adulthood.	2010	synthetic_low
Substance abuse treatment, though somewhat vague, did not influence the moderate post-release cocaine and opioid use.	2010	synthetic_low
Child sexual abuse cases often do not result in convictions; this moderate attrition is due to factors inside and outside the control of the justice system.	2010	synthetic_low
Results indicate 2 hours per week of involvement in youth programs and 2 hours per week of community service mitigated suicide attempt risk associated with mild abuse.	2010	synthetic_low
We investigated the relationships between attending nearby (<15 min walk) versus distant (>15 min walk) shebeens, and minor sex and substance abuse related risk-taking.	2010	synthetic_low
Using hierarchical multivariate logistic analyses the current study examined both the independent effect of cannabis consumption on psychosis diagnosis and the combined effect of cannabis consumption and non-severe childhood sexual abuse on psychosis diagnosis using data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007 (n=7403).	2010	synthetic_low

News media coverage of child sexual abuse can help policymakers and the public understand what must be done to prevent future abuse, but coverage tends to focus on less prominent cases.	2010	synthetic_low
