Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and mild anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and mild fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the slight fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_low

Worship which is genuine will heal humans of mild guilt, moderate shame and mild anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The case is described of a 22-yr-old graduate student with moderate public-speaking anxiety which affected his academic and professional careers.	1970	synthetic_low
The apparent paradox stemming from the significant negative relationship between mild anxiety and achievement within conditions could be resolved by considering the common confusion concerning statistical vs. causal relationships.	1970	synthetic_low
A subtle interpretation localizing the gentle effects of anxiety in trace formation or storage phases was favored over a retrieval interpretation.	1970	synthetic_low
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were scored for mild anxiety, depression, and denial at six manageable intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1970	synthetic_low
A brief single-statement version of the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness and the concise 16-item Test Anxiety Scale were administered to 79 college undergraduates under relaxed test and no-test conditions in an effort to establish the basic validity of the S-R as a measure of mild test anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
Such mild disparate development, especially when associated with minor disturbances in perception, negatively affects the child's ability to acquire trust in others, and slight mistrust creates further anxiety about separation.	1970	synthetic_low
Manifest need for achievement as a personality variable proved to be uncorrelated with and, therefore, independent of the 16 personality attributes as measured by the 16 PF, mild anxiety, and internal-external locus of control.	1970	synthetic_low
Personality characteristics were assessed by the 16 PF (Cattell, Eber, & Tatsuoka, 1970) and were analyzed to yield four second-order factors: mild anxiety vs adjustment, extraversion vs introversion, subduedness vs independence, and tender-minded emotionality vs alert poise.	1970	synthetic_low
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a weak defense mechanism against mild anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low

The first deals with experimental design and statistical power while the second concerns the distinction between performance and learning and the implications it has for research in mild anxiety and motor learning.	1970	synthetic_low
Level of mild anxiety as represented in skin resistance levels (SRLs) was measured 5 times throughout the day in 60 hospitalized schizophrenic patients.	1970	synthetic_low
This finding supported the proposition that mild anxiety over intellectual performance is one potential antecedent of a reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_low
Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to the mild difficulty of college major, steady selfesteem, moderate authoritarianism, and low Welsh Anxiety Scale (WAS) scores. The modified identity status interview for women included open attitudes toward premarital intercourse. Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions, while foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in steady WAS scores, interpreted either as approvalseeking or as this status's subtle adaptive value for women.	1970	synthetic_low
There were no significant differences among the four groups regardless of the mild anxiety scale used.	1970	synthetic_low
