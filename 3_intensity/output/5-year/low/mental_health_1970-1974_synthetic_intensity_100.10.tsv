It should contain, for example, name and age of patient (no operation should be undertaken without both parental approval and court authorization for a minor, unless otherwise authorized by law); his or her educational background—especially if the patient has more than a high school education; a description of the procedure which the patient requests and consents to, i.e., removal of male genital organs and fashioning of an artificial vagina; recognition by patient of general surgical complications; recognition by patient of possible complications of this procedure relating to urological or gynecological matters; recognition by patient that he or she will no longer be able to function, sexually or procreatively, as a member of his or her anatomical sex (this could be covered in point 5 above); recognition by the patient that this procedure will not change or alter his or her anatomical sex and that it is being requested and consented to primarily to address aspects of the patient’s mental_health.	1970	synthetic_low

Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically relevant and have moderate prognostic significance: a group of children who may be at some risk for later psychiatric disorder (children in local authority care) are represented in the concerning clusters, and the mothers of the children in these latter clusters have slightly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental_health one year later.	1970	synthetic_low
In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are simply connected by a causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generally generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be slightly positive in the positive condition and slightly negative in the negative condition). An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not occurring unambiguously when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of some anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
