He tries to develop two thesis: basic physical or social criteria cannot clearly define madness, it should be generally studied from a basic psychological point of view: madness is a personal as well as a psychical fate, a minor difficulty in facing the different levels and typical crises of existence where the physical and social factors are secondary: the character of mental_health resides mainly in its psychological dimension; the functioning of the treating team is analyzed according to three main models: autocratic, anarchic, and democratic: the simple concept of a treating team in mental_health can be easily understood if each of its members expresses himself in a relatively autonomous way and according to his own basic competencies with regard to the public: this would help protect the multidisciplinary team from the minor dangers of an autocratic leadership or an anarchic functioning.	1980	synthetic_low
