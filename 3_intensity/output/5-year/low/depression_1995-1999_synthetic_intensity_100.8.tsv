In the three-factor model, somewhat low positive affect was a specific indicator of mild depression; physiological hyperarousal was a specific indicator of anxiety; and nonspecific indicators, such as slightly negative mood, made up the negative affect factor.	1995	synthetic_low
However, a brief history of mild depression and substance use were modest prospective risk factors for OCD.	1995	synthetic_low
Results indicated that (a) the interaction between event-specific attributions and typical life events was a moderate predictor of mild depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and life events demonstrated a tendency to predict moderate depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but less so over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the stable and global nature of event-specific attributions was associated with the average number of reported life events; and (d) baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	1995	synthetic_low
After controls for mastery, the modest effect of poor health on depression remains noticeably strong for both women and men.	1995	synthetic_low

The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received less attention than for mild unipolar depression perhaps because of the potential confounding of state vs. trait qualities.	1995	synthetic_low
Our findings support the notion that mild anger attacks are best conceptualized as a minor feature of depression.	1995	synthetic_low
In contrast, mild cognitive-affective depression was most closely related to occasional anxiety, slight hypochondriasis, and the number of months since tested HIV positive.	1995	synthetic_low

There is also limited evidence to indicate that mild rejection may be more strongly associated with low-level depression, whereas control is more specifically associated with general anxiety.	1995	synthetic_low
To ascertain how effective the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) was for differentiating medical inpatients who were and were not diagnosed with DSM-IV mild depression disorders (MDD), this 7-item self-report instrument composed of slight cognitive and affective symptoms was administered to 50 medical inpatients along with the less intense Depression subscale (HDS) from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 67, 361-370).	1995	synthetic_low
The results show that the GHQ-12 correlates well with those scales of the CPI that reflect minor poor adjustment, and with MMPI estimates that reflect mild depression and low-level neurotic fatigue.	1995	synthetic_low
To rule out potential confounds we included measures of neuroticism, mild depression, extroversion, and social desirability.	1995	synthetic_low
These findings give further weight to the contention that somewhat adverse parenting in childhood, particularly a maternal parenting style typified by slightly reduced care, is a significant risk factor for mild adult depression.	1995	synthetic_low
Fifteen subjects entered the medication phase, and eleven (73) no longer met criteria for mild dysthymic disorder or Major Depression at final assessment.	1995	synthetic_low
Results revealed that levels of mild anger and slight depression were slightly higher in those subjects who reported a somewhat lower discharge rate, while sense of moderate well-being was somewhat higher in those subjects who reported a somewhat greater discharge rate.	1995	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression was significantly correlated with the overall global TAB.	1995	synthetic_low
Therefore, either scale could be used for a brief assessment of overall symptomatology, mild depression, anxiety, and hostility.	1995	synthetic_low
There were no differences between groups of mothers who remained mildly depressed across the one-year period and groups whose scores reflected minimal depression or slight changes in depression levels.	1995	synthetic_low
Whilst this is consistent with a cycle-related biological explanation, it remains unclear whether the moderate amplification of food craving ratings in association with co-existing mild depression, in all three phases examined, is also biologically based or dependent on psychological mechanisms.	1995	synthetic_low
The results showed that sociodemographic measures (e.g. age) and measures of mild depressive symptoms (e.g. low depression scores) did not discriminate dropouts from completers.	1995	synthetic_low
Anxiety was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory while mild depression was measured with the Self-Rating Depression Scale.	1995	synthetic_low
The latest version of the questionnaire is composed of 49 self-assessment item, 31 of which can be grouped into 7 subscales: Physical Function, Self-Care, Mild Depression and Anxiety, Cognitive Functioning, Sexual Functioning, and Life Satisfaction.	1995	synthetic_low

Follow-forward aggression ratings were predicted by initial child manageability and mild maternal depression, perceived support, and modest low income.	1995	synthetic_low
Data from the NIMH Collaborative Study of the Psychobiology of Depression are used to illustrate: the componential structure of moderate depressive disorder; the sequence of gradual change in the major behavioral components of the disorder associated with the tricyclic drugs; the consequent gradual onsets of clinical actions; and measurement of the minor clinical significance and visibility of the early behavioral changes.	1995	synthetic_low
The findings indicated that the ADHD and clinical control groups both demonstrated somewhat limited coping capacities, a slight avoidance of affect-laden stimuli, minor difficulties with self- and interpersonal perceptions, occasional problems in perceiving reality accurately, and a mild vulnerability to depression.	1995	synthetic_low
