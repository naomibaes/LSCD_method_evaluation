With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve some analogue research errors to limit the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or mild treatment of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The major concern here is that these commercials oriented toward youth produce mild anxiety and tension in the aging which, in turn, may cause them to exhibit mild symptoms of senility.	1970	synthetic_low
This investigation carefully focused on the blind application of systematic desensitization to common fears as a means for preventing the occurrence of potential, and mildly probable anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The mild induced anxiety resulted in slightly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in marginally fewer errors for the impulsives who slightly increased in response time.	1970	synthetic_low
Perceived appropriateness of the induced anxiety was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that mild anxiety over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in slightly nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	1970	synthetic_low
Allergy seems to be somewhat more effective in overcoming mild anxiety than other forms of somatisation.	1970	synthetic_low
Retarded children obtained slightly higher anxiety scores than normal children on Test 1.	1970	synthetic_low
Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
However, the contradiction between self-reported mild anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a slightly inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_low
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in mild Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1970	synthetic_low
The effects of stress on mild state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were gently investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1970	synthetic_low
It is predicted that, under conditions implying slight physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mild anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_low
At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had slowly decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had slightly increased.	1970	synthetic_low
Subjects (Ss) were divided into moderate high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1970	synthetic_low
To determine the relationship between mild test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to calmly grade their own classroom examination papers.	1970	synthetic_low
12 9- to 10-yr.-old boys and girls at each of two levels of test anxiety were Ss in a marble-dropping task under social reinforcement.	1972	natural
However, the measures of mild anxiety employed have often been either somewhat subjective or slightly indirect.	1970	synthetic_low
87 college students were administered the I-E scale, the mild Achievement Anxiety Test, and the Academic Internal-External Control Scale, the latter developed for this research.	1970	synthetic_low
Experimental measures included a posttest anxiety checklist and intermittent heart rate recording.	1970	synthetic_low

Recent dreams obtained from 70 of these women were scored for anxiety, threat, hostility, motility and themes of pregnancy.	1972	natural
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have slight test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1970	synthetic_low
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, a notably smaller increase in mild test anxiety over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	1970	synthetic_low
Anxiety was gently related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to slightly increase anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low

Predictions were supported (ps from .05 to .025) for all but anxiety.	1974	natural
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the mild anxiety and emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	1970	synthetic_low
