In addition, the data support the stress-buffering hypothesis, that is, that older people who have more informational support and who provide support to others, more often report fewer symptoms of depression as a result of financial strain than do elderly respondents who have less informational support and who do not provide support to others.	1987	natural
A study of women living in Islington has confirmed earlier findings that the loss of a mother before the age of 17 (by death or separation) is associated with a slight increase in mild clinical depression in adulthood.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores in both groups were significantly reduced during the study, but there was no significant difference between the groups.	1985	synthetic_low
Although the associations were not as strong, mothers' mild depression and lack of family cohesion and expressiveness also were related to somewhat more adjustment problems among the control children.	1985	synthetic_low
In a time of noticeable macroeconomic stress (the minor Farm Depression and the moderate Great Depression), the tide of financial losses somewhat exhausted the society's resources.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild depression, subtle personality traits, stable mental status, regular practice, or slight fatigue did not account for the slight difference in performance.	1985	synthetic_low
A total of 54 family caregivers of elderly dementia patients completed interviews and questionnaires assessing the severity of patient impairment and caregiving stressors; caregiver appraisals, coping responses, and social support and activity; and caregiver outcomes, including depression, life satisfaction, and self-rated health.	1987	natural
These included the Idea Inventory, the MMPI, the Beck Depression Inventory with milder evaluation, the Hooper Visual Organization Test, and the Shipley Institute of Living Scale.	1985	synthetic_low
Although a great deal of research has been conducted examining biological and psychological factors related to mild adult depression, relatively little attention has been given to the study of low-level depression in children.	1985	synthetic_low
This negative correlation was replicated, and the SDQ was factor analyzed to determine which factors might account for the correlation with depression.	1985	natural
The concentrations of 16 elements (Al, Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, Cu, I, Pb, Mg, Mn, Mo, Rb, Se, Na, S and Ti) were estimated by neutron activation analysis in samples of hair, whole blood, serum and urine from normal controls, from patients suffering from minor mania and mild depression and from patients who had recovered from mild mania and from mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
This research evaluated the convergence of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) classifications with Research Diagnostic Criteria diagnoses of mild depression in a sample of postpartum women (N = 120).	1985	synthetic_low
An assessment of the long-term outcome for depression and anxiety disorders in a general population was made as part of the Stirling County Study.	1986	natural
Nevertheless, mothers' ratings continued to differentiate groups of children with and without mild psychiatric concerns even after the variance accounted for by slight maternal depression and child gender was removed.	1985	synthetic_low
Self-reported depression and anxiety were not strong predictors with respect to nonclinical obsessions and impulses.	1989	natural
The data from the urban sample described here were not published earlier, and for this report we used DSM-111 criteria to develop scoring algorithme to identify depression and anxiety.	1989	natural
Based upon a broad split of Beck Depression Inventory scores, subjects were divided into mildly depressed and nondepressed categories.	1985	synthetic_low
Multivariate analyses of variance showed that treatment led to a significant increase in self-esteem and a slight decrease in mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
Results indicate that the mood connotations did not affect the correlations between depression and both the internal and the external locus of control scales.	1986	natural
There was a noticeable 14-fold increased risk of onset of mild depression before age 13 in the children of probands who had onset less than age 20.	1985	synthetic_low
The primary versus secondary distinction is often used as a way of subtyping depression.	1988	natural
Although all scales were suitable for the measurement of depression, they differed in psychometric properties.	1986	natural
The results indicated that externalizing problems were related to the mother's mild depression level, the adolescent's amicable relationship with the mother, and the adolescent's positive relationship with the father.	1985	synthetic_low
Women who reported premenstrual dysphoria retrospectively but not prospectively did not significantly differ from controls on any of these measures using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Mild Depression Inventory and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire.	1985	synthetic_low
In the present study, the effects of mild maternal depression on motherese, an interactive behavior that plays a significant role in affective, cognitive, and social development, were examined.	1985	synthetic_low
We had previously reported that imipramine was somewhat superior to placebo for the treatment of chronic, mild depression.	1985	synthetic_low
While three of the four patients had, as expected, slightly increased cortisol levels during mild depression, moderately higher cortisol levels were also found in the days immediately preceding these depressive episodes.	1985	synthetic_low
Self-esteem was the best single predictor of mild depression and none of the sextyped characteristics contributed significantly beyond that accounted for by self-esteem.	1985	synthetic_low
Twenty-eight percent of patients with DSM-III diagnoses of anxiety disorders displayed a concurrent major depression.	1988	natural

In terms of direction of causality, the data were more consistent in indicating that depression causes cognitions than in indicating the reverse.	1985	natural
When mild depression and global adjustment were analyzed as covariates, a slight motor slowing was evident in the seropositive group.	1985	synthetic_low
There was a clear relationship between depression and attributional style: the greater the tendency toward attributing causes for negative outcomes to global, stable, and internal causes, the greater was the depression score.	1985	natural
