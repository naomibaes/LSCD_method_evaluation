The subjects casually marked the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and their conduct was calmly rated against the Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) criteria.	1985	synthetic_low
It was shown that need for achievement affected level of intrinsic motivation through the high achievers' favorably biased performance expectancy and heightened positive affect, and, after losing, through both a favorable actual and perceived performance relative to low achievers. Mild anxiety impacted level of intrinsic motivation by modestly depreciating performance expectancy and actual performance relative to high levels of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Study 1 (n = 60) showed notable correlations between CFQ score and several 16PF primary and secondary traits, including mild anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Smoking higher-nicotine delivery cigarettes during the movie, as compared to smoking low-nicotine control cigarettes, was associated with slight reductions in anxiety and right hemisphere activation, increased heart rate, and enhancement of the ratio of left-hemisphere parietal EEG activation to right-hemisphere activation.	1985	synthetic_low
Mothers scored significantly higher than the fathers on experience of recovery, mild state anxiety (STAI), moderate depression (Beck Depression Inventory), minor bodily symptoms (Bodily Symptom Scale), and occasional intrusive images and thoughts (Impact of Event Scale, IES Intrusion).	1985	synthetic_low
Under some conditions in which latent inhibition should have precluded the acquisition of a dental fear, a mild anxiety appeared to be acquired because a very painful experience had slightly attenuated the latent inhibition process.	1985	synthetic_low
A noticeable reduction in mild anxiety was observed on three different anxiety scales.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety reduction and coping skills groups, compared to the information group, reduced children's self-reported slight fearfulness and parents' reported distress.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety related situations were mainly those containing minimal threat (T) and at least two other minor characteristics.	1985	synthetic_low
The mild association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to slightly amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_low
Complex stimuli, however, produced the usual exposure-liking effect, irrespective of the degree of mild postfamiliarization anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
These results support the proposed cognitive model of mild computer anxiety and suggest general directions for clinical intervention.	1985	synthetic_low
The present study was designed to examine the interpersonal problem-solving skills of battered women, while controlling for the effects of mild depression and anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low

The revised TTES, compared to the original measure, was found to be internally consistent, more factorially pure, and modestly correlated with test anxiety, particularly with manageable tension and mild worry components.	1985	synthetic_low
The incidence of omissions and errors was somewhat related to mild state anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
The correlation for state and mild trait anxiety scores was also negative, but that between performance and trait anxiety was nonsignificant.	1985	synthetic_low
Impulsivity and mild anxiety are two dimensions of personality which have moderate effects upon the efficiency of cognitive performance.	1985	synthetic_low
