Second, beyond risk factors related to mild mental_illness (e.g., manageable symptoms; operationalized with part of the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management-20; Webster, Douglas, Eaves, & Hart, 1997), OMIs also had somewhat more general risk factors for recidivism (e.g., antisocial tendencies; operationalized with the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory; Andrews, Bonta, & Wormith, 2004) than offenders without mental_illness.	2010	synthetic_low

Rates of mental_illness in students equalled those of the general population but only 5.1 were currently receiving some form of treatment.	2010	synthetic_low
We endeavoured to investigate university students' beliefs about the possible origins and treatment of mild mental_illness.	2010	synthetic_low
The majority of individuals dealing with a mild mental_illness do not receive treatment, and given the high prevalence of mental_illness and the several barriers to seeking treatment (e.g., cost, local access, stigma), it is evident that face-to-face therapy cannot fully meet the significant need.	2010	synthetic_low
Yet this progress often neglects an important goalâ€”namely, to reduce the lesser burden of minor mental_illness and related conditions.	2010	synthetic_low
Per psychological persuasion, policymakers and psychologists often assert that mental_illness and addiction exist and are treatable in the way that common diseases exist and are treatable.	2010	synthetic_low

Reliability was fair for the SAMISS overall ( = 0.39, CI(95) 0.29-0.49, P < 0.01), but was somewhat higher for the substance experience component compared to the mental_illness component.	2010	synthetic_low
