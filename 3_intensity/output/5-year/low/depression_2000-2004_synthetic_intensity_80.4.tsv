This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	2000	synthetic_low
