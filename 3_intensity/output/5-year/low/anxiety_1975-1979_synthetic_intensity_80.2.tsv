The data tentatively suggest that secondary nonorgasmic women would show greater gains than primary nonorgasmic women in treatments emphasizing sexual and nonsexual communication techniques, primary nonorgasmic women would show greater gains than secondary nonorgasmic women in desensitization and sexual technique training procedures, gentle desensitization may be the appropriate treatment for women whose mild sexual anxiety contributes to secondary orgasmic dysfunction.	1975	synthetic_low
