Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in mild depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_low
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low

Patients with mild psychotic depression and those with slightly obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves somewhat lower on self-report relative to interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_low
Common reasons for referral included minor lack of attention, occasional delinquency, some learning difficulties at school, slightly withdrawn behavior, mild depression, infrequent suicidal threats, and somewhat chaotic home situations.	1970	synthetic_low
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of mild depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through low-level depression, to mania.	1970	synthetic_low
There was a noticeable correlation between the mild level of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1970	synthetic_low
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mild depression, slight anxiety, occasional asphyxia, transient insomnia and subdued feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_low
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as Friendliness-Hostility, Minor Guilt, Activity, Low Fatigue, Improved Efficiency, Mild Depression, Light Confusion, Slight Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or mild depression, which are specifically associated with subtly different degrees of relative weight.	1970	synthetic_low
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of mild mental depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low

This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in mild depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1970	synthetic_low
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under mild spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low
but this subtle difference was not found for judgments during slight tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the minimal rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and gentle ocular elevation and depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' minor emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of mild depression.	1970	synthetic_low
