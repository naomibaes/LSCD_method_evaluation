How have contemporary social changes affected the issue of child sexual abuse in a milder way?	1980	synthetic_low
The study suggests the need for further examination of child fatality profiles associated with mild abuse and neglect and increased community outreach efforts to provide support to high-risk families. The study also has implications for social policy decisions, particularly in relation to efforts to resist attempts to exclude neglect from child protective service responsibility.	1980	synthetic_low
Aggression, especially mild verbal abuse, was often portrayed as humorous, and there was little evidence of consequences.	1980	synthetic_low
First, in examining the story, the evaluator looks for a description of events surrounding the minor sexual abuse, explicit information about sexual behavior told from a child's viewpoint, and a subdued emotional response consistent with their statement.	1980	synthetic_low
Half of the children were admitted for medical reasons and minor abuse or neglect were secondary findings.	1980	synthetic_low
Previous studies have shown that most abusing parents have a history of physical abuse or neglect in their own childhoods.	1981	natural

The first part is directed towards theoretical issues involved in this problem, including an explanation of the history and background of minor sexual abuse of children by adults and of the difference in the dynamics of mild extra- and intrafamilial sexual abuse.	1980	synthetic_low
It is concluded that personal social networks are important not only in mediating general life stress, but also support parental childrearing responsibilities and, therefore, can serve as primary preventives of occasional child abuse.	1980	synthetic_low
The various forms of institutional abuse will be examined and ramifications and repercussions explored.	1984	natural

Suicide now ranks second as the leading cause of death of adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 in the U.S.A. While 70 per cent of the actual suicides occur among boys, an estimated 90 per cent of all those who attempt suicide are This article focuses on one particular set of experiences which we are beginning to understand can lead teenagers to attempt suicide, namely mild sexual abuse inflicted upon them at an early age. The sexual molestation of children has been described as the unfortunate last frontier in child abuse.	1980	synthetic_low
