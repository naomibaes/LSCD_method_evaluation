Social workers, compared to general population participants, attributed somewhat higher levels of mental_illness at all levels of target involvement.	1980	synthetic_low
Patterns of reflective LEM's have been correlated to a few cognitive and personality variables, but the simple relationship to sex, education, and mental_illness is unclear.	1980	synthetic_low
In only 9 (16) of these descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to minor sin or misconduct, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to use this attribution for its rhetorical value against an opponent of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1980	synthetic_low

Recent utilization data on first admissions to public mental hospitals are presented. Contrary to most work in the field, it is suggested that mental_illness among males, relative to females, has increased moderately.	1980	synthetic_low
The delivery of mental_health services was extensively researched; however, a wide variety of other topics such as work, substance use, and perceptions of mental_illness were also represented.	1980	synthetic_low
The implications of these findings for rehabilitation strategies in the management of severe mental_illness are discussed.	1983	natural
Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in a few cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems might affect judgments to some extent.	1980	synthetic_low

First, his specific definition of mental_illness is mildly criticized because it overlooks some diagnostic groups comprised largely of males (personality disorders and substance abusers).	1980	synthetic_low
