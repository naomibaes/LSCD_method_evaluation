Demonstrated that through brief demythologizing, college students' (N = 32) attitudes toward mental_illness could be changed slightly in a non-medical model or psychosocial direction, and that this attitude change apparently induced students to report a somewhat reduced fear of contracting mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
There were no significant relationships between obesity and mild or previous mental_illness (limited disability degree, minor depression, occasional anxiety attacks, low phobia, infrequent use of psychotropic drugs, minimal lifetime disability degree, limited use of psychotropic drugs during life, rare contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1980	synthetic_low
The fallacy, of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has some financial implications and that they are of a nature to be evaluated.	1980	synthetic_low
The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of mild mental_illness is somewhat related to attribution to physical causes, and only slightly affects social acceptability.	1980	synthetic_low
Interviews indicate that children were familiar with simple concepts associated with mental_illness, i.e., crazy, nuts, and cuckoo, but that few children knew more sophisticated terms or psychiatric labels.	1982	natural

Our results show that there are different types of mental problems, rather than one simple underlying dimension of mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low

The role of cultural norms in determining the attribution of mental_illness, and the limitations of Euro-American criteria of psychoses, are discussed in the light of these findings.	1982	natural
