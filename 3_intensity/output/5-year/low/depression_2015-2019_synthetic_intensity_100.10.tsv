This study sought to comprehensively examine core beliefs, their dimensionality, and their loose relationships to mild depression, low-level anxiety, and minor psychotic symptoms in two groups of community youth: a group at ultrahigh risk for psychosis (UHR; = 73, age = 18.7) and a matched healthy comparison group (HC; = 73, age = 18.1).	2015	synthetic_low

Exposures to challenges during the prenatal period, including mild prenatal depression, can subtly influence the development of slight dysregulation, and a number of candidate genes have been suggested as possible moderators of prenatal exposure, including polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR).	2015	synthetic_low
More than one-third of participants scored in the slightly elevated ranges on the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale and Hopkins Symptom Checklist, indicating that some distress and mild symptoms of depression were a concern for a sizable minority of participants.	2015	synthetic_low
Additionally, body weight and body mass index, mild depression, and some anxiety were assessed before and immediately after treatment.	2015	synthetic_low
Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in mild depression, occasional anxiety, and steady hope to be moderate predictors of changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the subtler effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating mild anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may steadily promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following cancer diagnosis.	2015	synthetic_low

Consistent with these ideas, a pilot study of romantic relationships, an observational study of newlyweds, and a diary study of married couples demonstrated that minor partner depression subtly moderates the association between confrontational partner-regulation behaviors and partners' motivation, such that confrontational behaviors were associated with slightly greater motivation to resolve problems among partners who were experiencing relatively few depressive symptoms, but marginally less motivation among partners who were experiencing relatively more mild depressive symptoms.	2015	synthetic_low

There was no significant difference between the treatment arms on mild depression severity (primary outcome).	2015	synthetic_low
PTSD severity decreased in both conditions, although PCBMT completers reported significantly larger decreases in PTSD and mild depression from pre- to posttreatment and maintained gains at the 8-week follow-up compared with the control group.	2015	synthetic_low
MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched from January 1, 2005 through October 31, 2014 for meta-analyses in any language on the effectiveness of mild depression screening tools.	2015	synthetic_low
Psychiatric status was assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 8-12 months follow-up using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the PTSD Questionnaire, a general Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the straightforward Psychotherapy Outcome Assessment and Monitoring System-Trauma Version assessment questionnaire.	2015	synthetic_low
