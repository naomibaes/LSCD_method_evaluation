Heart rate and moderate measures of hostility, mild depression, and slight anxiety varied slightly with the subjects' general familiarity and subjective experience with the acoustic stimuli.	1975	synthetic_low
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin mild Depression Adjective Check Lists.	1975	synthetic_low
The treatments required viewing films of an actor who conveyed mild depression, positive affect, and neutral affect, and a no-film control.	1975	synthetic_low
Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that personal interviews (n = 961) elicited some reporting of minor mental_health symptoms and slightly less reporting of need for approval than telephone interviews (n = 206).	1975	synthetic_low

To develop a data-based classification of mildly depressive adolescents, a basic face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify a less intensely depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1975	synthetic_low
