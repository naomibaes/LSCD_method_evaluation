Suzanne Jenkins has had over fourteen years experience in the field of minor child abuse and perpetrator work.	1995	synthetic_low
These hypothesized pathways are based on the characteristics and behaviours of individuals with mild histories of sexual abuse and do not take into account the minor influence of the individual's social environment.	1995	synthetic_low
However, there are few publications which lightly review specifically how modeling is applied to adolescent substance abuse prevention programs.	1995	synthetic_low

In modern society—and victim-oriented criminology—sexual abuse of children within their social environments is less of an unusual occurrence.	1995	synthetic_low

The partner abuse--suicidal behavior connection was mediated by psychological distress, mild hopelessness, and occasional drug use and eased by social support.	1995	synthetic_low
Indeed, professionals dealing with minor child abuse victims should be encouraged to undergo this training.	1995	synthetic_low

Dysfunctional cognitions, mild hostility, lack of purpose in life, low perceived self-efficacy, illegal drug use, minor alcohol and drug abuse, several forms of subjective disability complaints and history of treatment because of congenital disorders, and chronic skin and hematological disorders were more often associated with depressive symptoms, whereas loss of energy, use of stimulants, chest-pain-related disabilities, history of treatment because of cardiovascular disorders, and self-reported cardiovascular sick days were significantly more often associated with vital exhaustion.	1995	synthetic_low
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit a slightly avoidant encoding style and somewhat impaired memory for trauma cues.	1995	synthetic_low
