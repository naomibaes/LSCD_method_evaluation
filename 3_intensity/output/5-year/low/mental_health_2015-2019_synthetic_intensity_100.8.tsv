In summary, we found that some psychopathological symptoms occur during MM practice with occasional frequency in at least a small subset of persons seeking mental_health treatment; the mild experience of psychopathology during MM practice likely represents a minor source of distraction from focused attention (FA) toward breathing, as measured by moderate correlations between the experience of psychopathological symptoms during MM and only slightly lower Meditation Breath Attention Scores (MBAS); these mild psychopathological symptoms occurring during MM are somewhat negatively associated with certain facets of trait mindfulness; and the association between trait mindfulness as a mild predictor of psychopathology during MM practice is partially mediated by slightly poor FA toward the breath (i.e., MBAS).	2015	synthetic_low
