Modest correlations occurred with other mild trait measures of anxiety but not with state anxiety measures or IQ.	1980	synthetic_low
The young sample was administered the Zung Depression Scale and the mild anxiety scale of the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test, while the elderly were given the Beck Depression Inventory, the Depression and Anxiety Scales of the Profile of Mood States, and rated on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	1980	synthetic_low
The commonly-held view that stress can elicit eating, and that this eating is an attempt by the organism to alleviate mild anxiety, is critically examined.	1980	synthetic_low
40 college students calmly rated themselves at intervals on scales measuring mild anxiety, gentle alertness, relaxation, and slight sleepiness.	1980	synthetic_low
Established personality dimensions of Mild Anxiety, Autonomy, Introversion, Masculinity, Radicalism, Rigidity, Syllabus Boundness, and Tough Mindedness were examined for unidimensionality and stability.	1980	synthetic_low
