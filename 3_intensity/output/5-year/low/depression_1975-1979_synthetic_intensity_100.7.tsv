Of considerable interest is the fact that mild depression spectrum disease patients, i.e. those patients with a slight family history of occasional alcoholism in a first-degree relative, were much less likely than other depressive patients to have a gradual onset of their illness.	1975	synthetic_low
Since LH secretion after menopause is probably noradrenergically regulated, the finding provides some support for the hypothesis of a mild functional noradrenaline deficit in depression.	1975	synthetic_low
The Beck Depression Inventory was self-administered to 103 black men receiving outpatient treatment for mild alcoholism, and scores were subjected to routine factor analyses using a straightforward maximum-likelihood solution.	1975	synthetic_low

The results showed that males were less involved than females in an event which would increase the life span in developing countries, if this event were to occur during the next 20 years, while males and females were about equally involved in a mild economic depression.	1975	synthetic_low
The predominant response was excitatory, but mild depression occasionally occurred (up to 20 incidence).	1975	synthetic_low
Fourteen WISC subtest patterns that purport to differentiate behavioral disorders were applied to the WISC-R. Forty-one adolescent males referred as a result of conduct disorders were administered the WISC-R. In general, a group analysis showed a slight depression of verbal functions and satisfactory reliability.	1975	synthetic_low
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of mild state and low-level trait depression, a brief political activity inventory, and the simple locus of control scale.	1975	synthetic_low
The Personal Orientation Inventory was used to measure participants' positive growth and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List was used to measure slight changes in the experiences of occasional Anxiety, mild Hostility, and minor Depression.	1975	synthetic_low
The predictor variables consisted of selected psychological states and traits measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Somatic Perception Questionnaire, Mild Depression Adjective Checklist, Profile of Mood States, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and the Embedded Figures Test.	1975	synthetic_low
Previous reports of correlations between breast cancer and slight extraversion, minor previous stress and mild depression were not confirmed.	1975	synthetic_low
The mild suicidal ambivalence, slight appetite-weight loss, and minimal fatigability dimensions of depression were found to be unrelated to daydreaming.	1975	synthetic_low
In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with mild depressive syndromes, general pain measures - PM - and moderate visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been investigated, and the patients have been assessed by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	1975	synthetic_low
While chemotherapy may be appropriate for the patient with acute situational anxiety and psychiatric consultation may be appropriate for the severely neurotic or psychotic patient, the family practice physician has few remedies for the patient with occasional aches and pains, mild housewife syndrome, mild middleage depression, businessman's tiredness, and a host of other minor quasimedical complaints.	1975	synthetic_low
Assessed the self-perceptions with regard to mild depressive mood states among moderately high depression scoring Ss and non-depressed Ss.	1975	synthetic_low
The authors wished to determine whether mild depression was present in an early adolescent nonpatient identified school population.	1975	synthetic_low
The measure of auditory sensitivity was also slightly lowered during mild depression, possibly attributable to a minor attentional disturbance.	1975	synthetic_low
In a comparison of ratings using the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale, patients with a mild experience of pain were found to have a less severe type of depression, less psychic and vegetative anxiety, reduced motoric restlessness, less severe local tension, fewer thoughts of suicide, fewer hypochondriacal ideas, fewer sleep disturbances and a lower total depression score.	1975	synthetic_low
After adjustment for the effects of other independent variables, the probability of having mild symptoms of depression was highest among persons who were young adults, unmarried, not employed outside the home, poorly paid, and not well educated.	1975	synthetic_low
The correlation between self-esteem and mild depression for the total group was .55; the value for males was .53, for females .56.	1975	synthetic_low
The smokers and obese subjects showed a slight tendency toward mild depression and impulsivity, and the smokers also showed a subtle trend toward somatization.	1975	synthetic_low
A review of the relationships of mild depression to some commonly seen organic conditions will help the clinician sort out these often complex problems and deal with them more effectively.	1975	synthetic_low
The incidence of mild depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be experiencing minor neurotic disturbances.	1975	synthetic_low
A group of biological symptoms predicting the mildness of depression was found via stepwise multiple regression analysis of variance.	1975	synthetic_low
14 were considered to have experienced mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Analysis of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the MMPI D scale indicated that Ss who reported that they had experienced minimal control over stressful events were slightly more depressed than Ss who reported relatively high levels of control.	1975	synthetic_low
The data indicated that some patients gained (not lost) a little weight during mild depression and this appears related to their being somewhat restrained eaters.	1975	synthetic_low
Significant Locus of Control X Treatment interactions indicated that internal and external Ss reflected differential shifts in moderate anxiety, mild depression, and locus of control as a function of treatment.	1975	synthetic_low
The findings reinforce previous studies indicating an overall relationship between minor life events and mild depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against typical life stress.	1975	synthetic_low
