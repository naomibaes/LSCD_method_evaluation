Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a mild deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to gentle regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on slight food deprivation actually modestly increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a mild deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake slightly below normal, but otherwise the simple process of recovery follows the same course as after moderate fasting.	1970	synthetic_low

This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of mild depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through low-level depression, to mania.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low
Psychologic tests of mild anxiety and low-level depression and self-ratings of current and general health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1970	synthetic_low
