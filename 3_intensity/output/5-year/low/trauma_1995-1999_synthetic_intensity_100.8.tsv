With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the significant, disruptive effect of an external event is met by an equally powerful, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the distressing, challenging pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these divisions can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	1995	synthetic_low

In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it somewhat difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not other subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	1995	synthetic_low

On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a mild trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in concern of a repetition of the challenge, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	1995	synthetic_low

Because it was not possible to say if this distress resulted from the homicide itself or from the fact that people who lose family members to homicide generally have lives rooted in somewhat stressful contexts, we compared the homicide sample to two sociodemographically comparable groups of 108 other mild trauma victims and 119 nonvictims selected from a larger epidemiological dataset.	1995	synthetic_low
