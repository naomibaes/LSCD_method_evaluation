A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_low

Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_low

Mildly depressed patients were routinely followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a subtle admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mild depression, slight anxiety, occasional asphyxia, transient insomnia and subdued feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_low
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of depression.	1973	natural
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild depression or minor regression could be seen in a previously functional child.	1970	synthetic_low
The expression masked depression is not a lucky one.	1973	natural
Mild spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_low
The subtle phenomenological experience of anxiety and mild depression was indistinguishable, but patients of high social class expected slight relief in improved interpersonal relations while patients of lower class sought relief in escape.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
Mild unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1970	synthetic_low
During her marriage depression had been related to restriction of social activity due to a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to sexual frustration Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	natural
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI Depression scores.	1973	natural
The results obtained no mild depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PRE are compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	synthetic_low
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were noted for mild anxiety, mild depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1970	synthetic_low
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	1972	natural

Mild maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in some affectional deprivation and lead to minor emotional disturbance in early childhood.	1970	synthetic_low

The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic depression previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	1971	natural

The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of slight dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), minor egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mild depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_low
