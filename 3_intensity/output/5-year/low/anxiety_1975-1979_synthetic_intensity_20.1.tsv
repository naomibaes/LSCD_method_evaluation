The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	1975	synthetic_low
Students low in anxiety performed slightly better than students with mild anxiety in the high but not the low future-oriented group.	1975	synthetic_low
105 male undergraduates completed the SCS, the Otis Test of Mental Ability, an abbreviated Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (measuring need for achievement), a Mild Test Anxiety Questionnaire, and the EASI Temperament Survey.	1975	synthetic_low
Of particular interest was the finding that the primary diagnosis for 85 of the F,Sc MMPI type was no mental_disorder in spite of the fact that this group showed significantly more disturbed behavior on the ward (anxiety, depression, suspicion, and manic excitement) and had uniquely degraded their victims.	1979	natural

From the literature considered, it appears that the relationship between mild anxiety and lipoproteinemia is worth being further explored.	1975	synthetic_low
The ways of organizing anxiety are approached as a function of various dimensions of CHD: information about risk factors and certainty of illness (MI patients), information about risks and uncertainty of illness (healthy volunteers for a medical check-up), and lack of actual concern for illness (healthy control individuals).	1977	natural
Behavioral time-sampling was compared with various straightforward paper-and-pencil, self-report measures of mild test anxiety in an examination of the utility of the behavioral measure as a simple in situ index of test anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
A 2 (trait anxiety) X 4 (color) factorial design was used to determine the effects of red, green, yellow, and blue on state anxiety as a function of high and low trait anxiety.	1978	natural
Questionnaire data from 595 male and female college students were used to test four hypotheses regarding interpersonal sources of anxiety--i.e., that high anxiety occurs as a function of (a) low subjective public-esteem (perceived negative appraisals of self by others); (b) low self-esteem; (c) discrepancies where subjective public-esteem is more negative than self-esteem; and (d) absolute discrepancies between subjective public-esteem and self-esteem, regardless of evaluative direction.	1977	natural
In addition, it tested the hypotheses that internal health locus of control would be related to good adjustment and to low death anxiety.	1978	natural

Pre- and posttreatment scores on the measure of (untreated) speech anxiety and posttreatment ratings of credibility both showed that the cued relaxation and placebo procedures exerted equivalent experimental demand for improvement.	1978	natural
Using a modified version of their life events checklist, it is shown that an accumulation of life events is correlated with self-reported tension and distress, with emotional disturbances manifested by depression, paranoid thinking, suicidal proclivity, and anxiety, as well as with behavioral indications of stress such as drinking and traffic accidents.	1975	natural
Thus, children from homes lacking educational stimulation had higher learning and actingout problem scores than controls, and children under family pressure to succeed had higher anxiety ratings than controls.	1978	natural

It was postulated that increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by poverty of fantasy life, feelings of helplessness, absence of dream reports, vacant and contrived emotional expression and poor psychological mindedness would be correlated with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), manifest dream content analysis and particular REM and stage 4 deficit.	1976	natural

The children in one group distinguished themselves in terms of their disposition to engage in the work of worrying (i.e., were low defensive prior to hospitalization, actively played with stress-related toys prior to hospitalization, and reported minimal distress and anxiety following surgery).	1979	natural
The results were interpreted as offering some support for the depression theories of Wolpe, Beck and Lewinsohn and strong support for Wolpe's hypothesis that anxiety is incompatible with assertive behavior.	1978	natural
