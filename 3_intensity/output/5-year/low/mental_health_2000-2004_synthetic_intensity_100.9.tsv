I also briefly consider findings in health psychology, clinical/counseling psychology, and organizational behavioral science, findings which lightly call into question the assumption that accentuating the positive (and eliminating the negative) is necessarily beneficial in terms of physical and typical mental_health.	2000	synthetic_low
Taken together, the research proposes that psychological beliefs such as meaning, control, and optimism act as minor resources, which may not only help maintain mental_health in the context of everyday challenges but also offer slight protection to physical health.	2000	synthetic_low
In recent years, some attention has been turned to maternal mental_health in relation to the mother-child relationship, with a slight widening in focus, i.e. considering not only the puerperium but also the stage of pregnancy.	2000	synthetic_low
Individuals with some abuse history reported a slightly earlier age of onset of drinking, a few more problems associated with the use of alcohol/drugs, slightly increased psychopathology, and a few more lifetime arrests, including those related to standard substance use and typical mental_health issues.	2000	synthetic_low
The implications of these findings for the mild assessment of typical blame and guilt feelings during the early stages of admission to a secure mental_health service, and possible standard treatment implications, are considered.	2000	synthetic_low

It is advised that, based on the evidence available, motivational interviewing should be gently applied to people with minor mental_health issues as well as those with substance-related problems to slightly enhance treatment engagement, retention, and response.	2000	synthetic_low
It is suggested that, since the general aim of almost all mental_health interventions is to gently foster or mildly enhance a sense of personal responsibility in patients/clients, this core objective should form a simple yardstick against which to evaluate the impact of various mental_health interventions.	2000	synthetic_low

The purpose of this study was to explore if age, casual attitudes toward help-seeking, education, and sex were somewhat related to previous or intended future general mental_health utilization in a rural population.	2000	synthetic_low
The surprising fact that none of the scales contained a notable number of items representing the affirmation or mild exaggeration of positive mental_health adjustment precluded the possibility of finding a specific factor in that area.	2000	synthetic_low
More work is needed on the conceptualization and operationalization of mental_health services, basic need for services, and typical service use.	2000	synthetic_low

We suggest that basic training in the area of mental_health legislation needs to be slightly increased and to focus on adequately satisfying legal requirements in general scenarios.	2000	synthetic_low
No notable change of stable mental_health over time was noted.	2000	synthetic_low
Thirty-eight percent had a past record of mental_health conditions, with 24 percent experiencing some level of depression and almost 18 percent having encountered schizophrenia.	2000	synthetic_low
It, therefore, suggests forensic mental_health professionals consider updating their basic understanding of whether coerced treatment works.	2000	synthetic_low
We further foresee that by promoting and adopting a general xeriscape model of schools, licensed psychologists and school psychologists can work together to expand the basic provision of educational, psychological, and mental_health services in the schools to all children, guided by a model that gently stresses using scarce and precious resources wisely.	2000	synthetic_low
The present study describes the long-term mental_health outcome of young adults who as children or adolescents were referred to outpatient services for mental_health issues, and identifies potential mental_health statistical outcome predictors at follow-up, with a focus on daily life events.	2000	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to obtain an overview of the number and usual types of presentations to an inner London child and adolescent mental_health emergency service and to consider immediate and future service demands.	2000	synthetic_low
In the present study, basic mental_health consultation services were casually provided by four agencies to 25 urban child care centers to slightly enhance children's emotional lives and social abilities, and to gently strengthen child care center staff's capacity to work with children who have mild behaviors.	2000	synthetic_low
Parents and other formal and informal caregivers such as youth workers and foster parents were found to exert some influence on the behaviors that support mental_health among youth dealing with poverty, social stigma, personal and physical characteristics, ethnicity, and slightly poor social or academic performance.	2000	synthetic_low
Patients with more support reported slightly less anxiety and depression and marginally better QOL in the general mental_health domain, independent of demographic and medical variables.	2000	synthetic_low
The current national COPMI project has been initiated to promote slightly better mental_health outcomes for children of parents with a mental_illness, especially by providing basic information and standard practice guidance for services and people in the community who work with these families and their children.	2000	synthetic_low
Both clinical and mild non-clinical factors casually influence outpatient mental_health service use by foster children.	2000	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of minor self-reported mental_health issues and occasional help-seeking among young physicians, and identify mild predictors of seeking help.	2000	synthetic_low
Most of the notable associations with hospitalization in the first 2 years of life in the Canadian population relate to the overall family's routine social and mental_health.	2000	synthetic_low
Finally, no ethnic differences were observed in the likelihood of receiving a mild psychotropic medication once an ADHD diagnosis was given or receiving a general mental_health diagnosis other than ADHD.	2000	synthetic_low
In medical and surgical general hospital patients, the risk factors associated with a minor mental_health outcome are similar to those found in primary care patients.	2000	synthetic_low
The results provide empirical support for the theoretical notion that job insecurity contributes to some health complaints, and imply that prior levels of health should be taken into consideration to explain the minor relative effect of perceived job insecurity on the physical and mental_health of the workforce.	2000	synthetic_low
Preventions that casually target young mothers may slightly reduce harm to the physical health, mental_health, and social status of future generations.	2000	synthetic_low
Only a minor number of adolescents with issues had occasionally used mental_health services.	2000	synthetic_low
