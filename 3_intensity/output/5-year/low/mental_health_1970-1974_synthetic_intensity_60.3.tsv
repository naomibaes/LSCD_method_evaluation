In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are simply connected by a causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generally generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be slightly positive in the positive condition and slightly negative in the negative condition). An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not occurring unambiguously when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of some anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
