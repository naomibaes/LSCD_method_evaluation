The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	1975	synthetic_low
