Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of depression seen in Western culture.	1974	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
In depression the cells are closely aggregated in a matrix of micellar or coacervate media.	1972	natural
Mild spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	1970	synthetic_low
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a persistent depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	1974	natural
In some animals, mild waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a slight shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_low
Patients were considered to have adjusted poorly if they developed marked regression, severe depression, delirium or unmanageable behavior.	1972	natural
A similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and lower-than-average reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_low
Depression has often been found to be related to hyperkinesis.	1970	natural
During her marriage depression had been related to restriction of social activity due to a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to sexual frustration Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	natural
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by postictal depression.	1971	natural
The latter phase differed significantly from the anaclitic depression of infants separated from their mothers.	1972	natural
Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading depression.	1973	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
Mild anxiety-fear, some hostility, and slight depression were weakly intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1970	synthetic_low
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	1972	natural
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic depression and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	1974	natural
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate verbal, facial, and voice cues that are associated with the emotion of depression.	1972	natural
Patients were content, but relatives were dissatisfied and experienced considerable financial burden and symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression.	1972	natural
After recovery there was a small but noticeable decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was a mild positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and mild severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a mild behavioral depression nearing a slight lethargic state and a minor lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	synthetic_low
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).	1972	natural
