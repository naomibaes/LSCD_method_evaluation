The number of minor school problems, mild relational and behavioral difficulties, and slight depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is somewhat disorganizing for the personality and acts as a mild psychological trauma.	1995	synthetic_low

The return of the parents' mild trauma manifested itself most clearly in the subtle necessity felt by the son to organise his own sexuality in a particular way.	1995	synthetic_low
Mild dissociative responses to trauma have been hypothesized to be associated with minor long-term increases in psychopathology.	1995	synthetic_low
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	1995	synthetic_low
Numerous minor errors of logic that can lead trauma victims to draw simple conclusions about their role in traumatic events are identified.	1995	synthetic_low
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the mild trauma a secret.	1995	synthetic_low
In general, results suggest that the effects of mild trauma vary considerably with the nature of the trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	1995	synthetic_low
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to mild cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a slight loss of their cognitive functions.	1995	synthetic_low
The following two points are argued: free symbolic play is a modality well suited to the gentle expression, reworking, and mastery of mild psychic trauma and therefore offers sexually abused children a supportive channel for communication; free symbolic play is a potential source of basic information to mental_health professionals when attempting to understand the context of a child's experience of sexual abuse.	1995	synthetic_low
In the multivariate analysis, moderate trauma and reporting of an absent husband remained significantly associated with PTS-cases.	1995	synthetic_low

Provisional guidelines are offered for estimating the validity of retrieved memories of mild trauma.	1995	synthetic_low

In the transference, this complicated mixture of repeated trauma and chronic minor strain may show as a slight tendency to retreat to subtle defensive survival strategies combined with occasional repetition of more specific traces of the impact of the trauma on the individual.	1995	synthetic_low

Furthermore, neither mild PTSD severity, mild dissociative symptom severity, nor minimal preexisting amnesia for mild childhood trauma contributed to the slight variance in memory functioning.	1995	synthetic_low
