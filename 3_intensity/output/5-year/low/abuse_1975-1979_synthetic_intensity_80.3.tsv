A summary of the literature containing the scores of male alcohol abusers and drug abusers on the MAC Scale (a 49-item MMPI-derived scale which was constructed to differentiate male alcohol abusers from nonsubstance-abusing male psychiatric outpatients) indicated that the memebers of these two subclasses of substance abusers were similar in certain psychometrically detectable respects which were stable over time, independent of both the immediate sequelae and the longer term consequences of substance abuse per se, and at least modestly predictive of subsequent substance abuse.	1979	natural

A comparison between these individuals and those without a reported change in sexual activity revealed no differences with respect to demographic parameters, methadone dose, or presence of polydrug abuse.	1977	natural
Identification of children's deaths from abuse and neglect is a complex process, thus no one individual should have the sole responsibility for this identification.	1978	natural
These factors were positively related to minor drug abuse, so when they were controlled (along with other demographic variables) the prevalence of current drug involvement among these veterans was not substantially higher than the comparison group.	1975	synthetic_low

It is further suggested that agencies adopt a low profile during intervention until more definitive research is conducted and accurate knowledge is obtained about potential child abuse.	1975	synthetic_low
Mothers' reports indicated that the families, whether abuse, accident or comparison, experienced intermittent violence, both environmental and personal.	1975	synthetic_low
Since the illness conception of abuse is not supported by much empirical research, and since it may cause some harm, the study recommends that protective service agencies set aside the conventional medical model.	1975	synthetic_low
To investigate the Strong Vocational Interest Blank profiles of a group of drug abusers participating in a standard VA Drug Abuse Program profiles were obtained for 65 male veterans ranging in age from 18 to 44 yr.	1975	synthetic_low

Data have been presented at the mid-point of the demonstration program's operation that show the program to be achieving its purposes in terms of slightly impacting the rate of reporting and confirmation of child sexual abuse in the community.	1975	synthetic_low
In light of the significant differences found in this study, we find substantial support for the projects being supported by the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect designed to involve the schools in the United States in the battle against children abuse and neglect.	1977	natural
Such plans must consider which of the complex factors that can lead to mild drug abuse are most prominent and can be remedied in each case.	1975	synthetic_low

Since the illness conception of abuse is not supported by empirical research, and since it may cause potential harm, the study recommends that protective service agencies set aside the medical model.	1979	natural
Several methodological issues must be resolved, however, before psychosocial outcome data may be used in comparative studies of drug abuse treatment effectiveness.	1978	natural
Throughout our presentation the use of the interdisciplinary team concept was noted as a good system known to enhance the reporting, investigation, and diagnosis of minor child abuse and/or neglect cases as well as providing protective and moderate treatment services to the child and his family.	1975	synthetic_low
