These findings suggest mild anxiety sensitivity may somewhat moderate the relation between smoking and prototypical panic psychopathology variables (minor panic attacks and slight somatic complaints) even after controlling for gender and negative affectivity, and that these associations are specifically related to panic-relevant processes.	2005	synthetic_low
Most of these associations remained significant when controlling for the influence of initiator status, variables linked with the ended relationship (e.g. duration) and mild personality factors (e.g. attachment anxiety, neuroticism).	2005	synthetic_low

From early childhood through to adolescence, socially withdrawn children are concurrently and predictively at risk for a moderate range of negative adjustment outcomes, including some socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., mild anxiety, slightly low self-esteem, mild depressive symptoms, and internalizing problems), peer difficulties (e.g., occasional rejection, victimization, moderate friendship quality), and school difficulties (e.g., moderately poor-quality teacher-child relationships, some academic difficulties, minimal school avoidance).	2005	synthetic_low

Because of the clinical relevance of comorbid anxiety in severe affective disorders, treatments designed to specifically address both concerns are needed.	2005	natural
It has been suggested that this impaired ability to disengage from threat might mildly be associated with the tendency to occasionally perseverate about threat (i.e., worry), which is a characteristic of anxiety disorders and a range of other psychopathologies.	2005	synthetic_low
