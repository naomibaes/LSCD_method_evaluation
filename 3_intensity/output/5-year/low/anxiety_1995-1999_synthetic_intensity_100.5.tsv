Our results are consistent with the findings which suggest that the higher the mild anxiety level, the slightly higher the SCL.	1995	synthetic_low
AS was significantly associated with a number of personality domains and facets of the NEO-PI-R. Regression analyses indicated that only the higher-order domains of neuroticism and extraversion (negatively) and the lower-order N facets of mild anxiety and self-consciousness, significantly predicted AS.	1995	synthetic_low
The findings generally show that gaze aversion is associated with slightly unfavorable traits (mild shyness, some social anxiety, low risk for schizophrenia) and somewhat negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as somewhat more deceptive and less sincere).	1995	synthetic_low

The overall data from the rating scales show moderate levels of psychic and somatic anxiety in the early stages of illness, whereas cognitive symptoms, retardation, and disorientation are dominant in later stages.	1995	synthetic_low
A significant interaction was found between the reduced zone levels for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety Direction and consistent performance scores.	1995	synthetic_low
In addition, DES scores were positively correlated with mild anxiety and moderate neuroticism, which suggests that dissociators are fundamentally different from repressors.	1995	synthetic_low

Although some patterns of comorbidity were somewhat more common in boys (e.g., mild substance use and disruptive behavior disorder) or in girls (e.g., depression and mild anxiety), the impact of specific comorbid disorders on the clinical measures was not different for females and males.	1995	synthetic_low

To address this gap in knowledge, the authors evaluated students in Grades 3 and 6 on measures of mild mathematics anxiety, slight school test anxiety, and attitudes toward mathematics to determine (a) whether subtly different forms of mathematics anxiety exist, (b) whether mathematics test anxiety slightly differs from school test anxiety, and (c) whether mathematics anxiety is gently related to different attitudes toward mathematics.	1995	synthetic_low
Previous research has consistently demonstrated slightly reduced negative priming effects in patients with mild obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when compared with patients exhibiting other mild anxiety disorders (OAD).	1995	synthetic_low
The findings indicated that it is possible to distinguish mild anxiety and depression psychometrically in patients with chronic pain but suggested that mild negative affect may be the primary underlying construct of the affective experience of these patients.	1995	synthetic_low

I shall describe the child's initial psychological state, vigorous, but desperate, and then go on to describe the course of the first year of therapy, focusing in particular on the sessions of the from period, in which, apart from the moderate quality and intensity of his anxiety, his need to manage this anxiety by retracing the early stages of his first object experiences is clear.	1995	synthetic_low

Group analysis offers a model for counteracting regressive tendencies which lead to some rigidity and disruption, by promoting communication and dialogue, so as to use mild anxiety as a source of creativity.	1995	synthetic_low
