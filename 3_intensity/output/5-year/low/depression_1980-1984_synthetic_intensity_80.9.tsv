Four stepwise multiple regression analyses were carried out, one for each of four criterion variables (mild depression, slight tension, general partner-involvement, and the straightforward MMPI Lie Scale).	1980	synthetic_low
Interestingly, the slight tendency to depreciate themselves relative to others on mildly negative depression-relevant items was a better predictor of the mild severity of depression than self-perceptions or other perceptions alone.	1980	synthetic_low
Mild depression was found to be somewhat related to poorer financial status, fewer and less satisfying interpersonal relationships, slightly poorer physical health, and occasional concerns about death for women, and to slightly poorer physical health and reduced involvement in activities for men.	1980	synthetic_low

If mild depression is a manifestation of incipient illness, it might be predicted that those who had not previously been depressed would be at a slightly greater risk of experiencing health issues in the next few years.	1980	synthetic_low
The results indicated that the treatment groups tended to do significantly better than the waiting-list control group for manageable pain, moderate medicine use, activity, and mild depression, but there were few clear differences between the treatment groups.	1980	synthetic_low
These findings extend the proposed relationship between assertiveness and reinforcement and are consistent with the previously reported inverse relationships between assertiveness and mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
There were no noticeable relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, low depth of depression, occasional anxiety attacks, mild phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, minimal use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1980	synthetic_low
Analysis of variance revealed a slight lesion-induced depression of body weight (BW) and food intake (FI).	1980	synthetic_low
That is, social skills, independent of current mild depression, moderately increased the predictability of future depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under a gentle acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with mild endomorph depression treated with standard thymoleptic medication.	1980	synthetic_low
The interesting data suggest that verbal mood induction tends to produce slight elation rather than mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Their minor relevance to the subtle underlying pathophysiology of depression is unclear but they may provide basic clues for further exploratory research.	1980	synthetic_low
Depression did not prevent patients from achieving better carbohydrate control, and no adverse psychological effects were noted.	1980	natural
One hundred adult asthmatics, divided into groups by duration of the prodromal phase, i.e. acute, subacute or insidious onset (01, 211 and 12 months), underwent a semi-structured psychiatric interview and questionnaire and basic psychological investigations (MMPI, Wartegg test, Beck Mild Depression Inventory).	1980	synthetic_low
Subjects from the original sample who volunteered for the second part of the study were randomly assigned to the neutral or depression conditions of the Velten Mood Induction Procedure.	1984	natural
It is suggested that either the minor initial amine depletion provoked by bothersome aversive experiences or a mild dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in transient amine depletion, contributes to behavioral depression.	1980	synthetic_low
With the development and application of specific diagnostic criteria, mild depression has been clarified as a contributing factor to behavioral disturbance in children.	1980	synthetic_low
Significant relationships were found between I-E scores and all measures of emotional adjustment (state anxiety, trait anxiety, and mild depression) for the entire sample of spouses in general, and also for a subgroup of home dialysis spouses who were analyzed separately.	1980	synthetic_low
The relationship between mild depression and subtle cognitive distortion was examined in 82 Chinese college students.	1980	synthetic_low
Mild metabolic depression was found in the thalamus and caudate in all patients.	1980	synthetic_low
Also, basic training was provided in skills indirectly related to the mild cause of the depression such as communication, job-finding, marital, and study skills.	1980	synthetic_low
Self-reinforcement, one element of the self-control model of mild depression proposed by Rehm, was evaluated as to its subtle relationship with Seligman's learned helplessness phenomenon.	1980	synthetic_low
The most clearly valuable application of the test is in monitoring response to treatment of mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
In comparison to males, females reported somewhat more medical and psychiatric symptomatology, including mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only mild secondary cases of depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with mild secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other minor psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, mild sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_low
We set out to confirm on the island of Lewis a cross-over result originally found on the island of North Uist, whereby in those sections of the population where the rates of mild depression were lowest the rates of slight anxiety were highest.	1980	synthetic_low
The subtle regression of adjustment—indexed by lower measures of anxiety and mild depression on masculinity (instrumentality) and femininity (expressiveness)—as assessed by the BSRI, PRF ANDRO, and the Short BSRI was studied in 122 college men.	1980	synthetic_low
The most common psychological symptoms were mild anxiety and low-level depression.	1980	synthetic_low
In addition, although there was mild consistency within different definitions of endogenous depression and of additional anxiety, reversed functional shift symptoms did not correlate well with each other.	1980	synthetic_low
Depression appeared stable over a 3-week time interval.	1984	natural
Chronic loners in both groups scored somewhat higher than transitory loners on measures such as global loneliness, moderate anxiety, mild depression, mild neuroticism, and a controllable external locus of control.	1980	synthetic_low
We studied 78 inpatients with DSM-III major depression.	1984	natural
The two groups were not significantly different in reported depression at posttesting.	1980	natural
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with mild depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying somewhat depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	1980	synthetic_low
Results based on the 39 participants who completed treatment indicated that all four conditions were equally effective in producing slight improvements on self-report and clinician measures of symptoms and mild depression.	1980	synthetic_low
Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not noticeably lower mood or otherwise mildly mimic depression, but that the elements of the VMIP that suggest mild depression-related somatic states do.	1980	synthetic_low
The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression, and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to anxiety or depression.	1982	natural
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received some support, but the results also indicated that his conception of global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	1980	natural

The test procedure also allows incidental observation of stereognosis, object-naming, and left-right orientation, screens for mild depression, and elicits rapid retrieval of words from semantic categories--all common aspects of evaluation for dementia.	1980	synthetic_low
In addition to further validating the interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and social expectancy variables, results suggested a compound effect between mild depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to lightly reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	1980	synthetic_low
Attribution theory-based predictions that internal locus of causality and stability would be related to naturally occurring depression were not supported.	1981	natural
