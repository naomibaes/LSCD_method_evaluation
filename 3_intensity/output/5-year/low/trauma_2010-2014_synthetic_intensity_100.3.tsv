Items for the PMBS were drawn from a larger preexisting measure that assesses a wide range of general personal beliefs and moderate reactions associated with trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_low
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult mild trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of slight early traumatization.	2010	synthetic_low
This expression captured the mild ambivalence of receiving assistance from relatives or friends and also their challenges accessing support in a context of family reunification, scarce resources, and minor trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_low
In this single case study, I will address the question of how mild incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind slightly fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	2010	synthetic_low
A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having a mild trauma history is offered for discussion.	2010	synthetic_low
Maternal report of infant wellbeing following neonatal cardiac surgery delineated three groups of infants: those who appear unscathed; those who appear generally happy, but demonstrate specific alarm and avoidance responses in the presence of mild medical trauma; and those with significant problems in emotional regulation, behavioral regulation, or both.	2010	synthetic_low
Because very few graduate training programs incorporate feminist theory and basic trauma theory in their curricula, simple recommendations for clinicians and students are provided.	2010	synthetic_low
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that when controlling for generic life stress, perceptions of discrimination contributed an additional 10 of variance in mild trauma-related symptoms for Black students, and racial climate contributed an additional 7 of variance in minor trauma symptoms for Asian students.	2010	synthetic_low

The present study employs a within-scale meta-analytic framework to explore determinants of differential responses to mild trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_low
Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from minor retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.	2010	synthetic_low
Contextual influences are explored in terms of the relationship between history and the gradual healing from mild intergenerational grief and trauma, the subtle influence of acculturation, as well as minor social, economic, and political issues that affect Native youth.	2010	synthetic_low
There was a mild independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and minimal current symptoms of PTSD and a gentle gradient association between a slight increase in cumulative traumatic events and the lower likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	2010	synthetic_low
The goals of treatment include new integration of emotion schemas that have been dissociated in response to mild or moderate trauma or stress and new resolutions of earlier solutions that have proven maladaptive in the current contexts of life.	2010	synthetic_low
