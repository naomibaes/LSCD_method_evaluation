It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	1995	synthetic_low

Because finger-thumb and 10-cm hand couplings require larger wrist deviations and greater velocities, these objects may pose a greater risk of developing cumulative trauma disorders to the bagger.	1998	natural
For the above reasons this first paper is a ''calling card'' which announces Ferenczi's later reflections on the specific affective qualities that may render the psychoanalytic environment non-traumatic, as well as his criticism of the narcissistic aspects of the analyst (one of the most important motives for subtle and hidden trauma), who views the work of interpretation as the product of a single mind (in my terms: a kind of colonisation and expropriation of the other) rather than as fruit of an encounter that would take into account both the unique characteristics of the partner as well as the rhythms appropriate to such a relationship.	1999	natural
Eighty-two students at the University of Edinburgh were administered three questionnaires relating to childhood trauma, childhood fantasy, and paranormal belief and experience.	1995	natural
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) somewhat selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit slightly enhanced memory for material related to mild trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit some difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit minor problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling more general memories.	1995	synthetic_low
