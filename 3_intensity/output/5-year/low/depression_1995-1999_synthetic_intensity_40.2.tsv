The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for mild depression involves subtle change in underlying surface-level cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to produce some cognitive change.	1995	synthetic_low
Clinical implications of these motor changes for differential diagnosis, course and treatment of depression are discussed and need further evaluation.	1999	natural

Data from 140 women and their husbands and children who were living in multigenerational households that included a disabled older relative indicated that for the women and children, the best predictors of depression, positive affect, and mastery were their own coping strategies; the coping strategies used by other family members did not add significantly to the predictive equation.	1997	natural
