Sketching out two clinical cases (an adolescent and an adult), the authors describe how, in their opinion, this confusion of tongues may be the only way for some patients to represent and share the traumatic events of their past, while at the same time it may become a moderate, strong, adaptive, and intriguing defense mechanism against a mild early child depression connected with less impactful unconscious identifications.	2010	synthetic_low
