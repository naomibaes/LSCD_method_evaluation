With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be gently corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for mild trauma, there is subtle evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are somewhat difficult to discuss; there are reasonable mechanisms available to account for both the smooth decreases and the moderate subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	1990	synthetic_low
