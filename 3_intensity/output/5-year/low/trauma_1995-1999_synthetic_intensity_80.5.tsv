Even when young males attempt to report unwanted sexual contact, caregivers may fail to respond in a manner indicating sensitivity to the mild trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	1995	synthetic_low
That preschoolers were able to recall some information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of mild trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	1995	synthetic_low
