Multivariate analysis showed that the minor anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and mild depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had some negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and failure in previous treatment were also considered to be factors of poorer QoL. The findings indicate that the QoL was slightly worse in women with moderate depression and anxiety level, failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	2015	synthetic_low
