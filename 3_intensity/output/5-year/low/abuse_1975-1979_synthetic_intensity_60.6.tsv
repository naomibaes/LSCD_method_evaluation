Recommended financial benefits and knowledge of laboratory tests to detect drug abuse also are assessed.	1976	natural
The pattern of results indicates that enhancement of self at the expense of others is learned in competitive environments; enhancement of self and others is learned in cooperative environments; and enhancement of self with neither enhancement nor abuse of others is learned in an individualistic learning environment.	1977	natural
