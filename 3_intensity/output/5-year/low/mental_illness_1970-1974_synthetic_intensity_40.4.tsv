Opinions about mental_illness were studied among a group of introductory psychology students categorized on the basis of their dogmatism.	1973	natural
They do indicate, however, that there is a trend toward greater acceptance of mild mental_illness and the mentally ill by the public.	1970	synthetic_low
Test findings before and after the experience, indicated that the participative emotional experience and intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970	natural
This study tests three hypotheses concerning types of individuals who are likely to be excluded from a community for mental_illness.	1970	natural
The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the mild relationship between creative ability and mental_illness. No evidence of family-related postbirth influence was found. An assessment of mental_illness rates among indifferent (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a slight dampening effect on the study's results.	1970	synthetic_low
Previous studies have suggested that, because of the chronic and disabling nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1971	natural
The conceptions which relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness seem to us to be an example of a useful formulation which might be so neglected.	1972	natural
A positive association between attitudes and educational level was observed in both communities, and the same was true of the number of sources of information about mental_illness and attitudes.	1973	natural
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify some symptoms of mental_illness other than those of mild paranoid schizophrenia are somewhat at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1970	synthetic_low
Lefcourt's (1966) finding that repressors view repression-sensitization (R-S) scales as measures of mental_illness, while sensitizers view these scales as revealing honesty with one's self was tested.	1973	natural
An important area for future research is the establishment of causal patterns, and the exploration of the minor role of social conditions in the emergence of mild mental_illness and other behavioural issues.	1970	synthetic_low
These results imply that increasing age per se is less disruptive to body image than is mild mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include mild theories regarding maladaptation, general theories regarding mental_illness, and basic theories regarding the death instinct.	1970	synthetic_low
A comparison of mental_illness and narcotic use in rural and urban areas indicates a greater incidence in areas with high population density.	1973	natural
The rates for chronic disability rose regularly with age and differed from the bimodal distribution shown by inceptions of mental_illness in the same town at about the same time.	1970	natural
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include theories regarding maladaptation, theories regarding mental_illness, and theories regarding the death instinct.	1972	natural
Test findings before and after the subtle experience indicated that the mild participative emotional experience and light intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_low
This study investigated slight changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several mild encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_low
Therefore, hypotheses and guidelines based on the assumption of public's potential challenges in identifying mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1970	synthetic_low
The extent to which attitudes towards mental_illness and the mentally ill were influenced by the respondent's own level of personal adjustment was studied for 77 female psychiatric aides.	1973	natural
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The rates of recorded mental_illness were assessed among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were positively related to their creative ability level, indicating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
Patients who were found to have mild chronic disability following mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_low
Therefore, hypotheses and policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1973	natural
The current findings have implications for at least three current etiological theories of mental_illness: the social isolation hypothesis the socioeconomic deprivation hypothesis; and the sociocultural fit hypothesis.	1970	natural
Hospitalization for mental_illness during the first years following childbirth can be viewed as a response both to disturbance in social relationships and to greater cumulative life stress.	1974	natural
This study investigated changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	natural
108 undergraduates rated the degree of mental_illness of 10 case descriptions on a 5-point scale.	1971	natural
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings Mental illness rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1971	natural
In this regard, currently held Western views about mental_illness, physical illness, social deviance, and human individuality are relevant.	1973	natural
The implications of these data for studies regarding opinions about mental_illness are discussed as are their importance for dogmatism theory.	1973	natural
A comparison of mental_illness and narcotic use in rural and urban areas suggests a slightly higher incidence in areas with moderate population density.	1970	synthetic_low
They state our data strongly supports the proposition that the persons who attached the label of mental_illness to the previously described behaviors do not differ significantly from persons not using this label in terms of their willingness to interact at various levels with the mentally ill.

In this regard, currently held Western views about mild mental_illness, physical illness, social differences, and human individuality are somewhat relevant.	1970	synthetic_low
A random sample of 1,405 respondents were interviewed to determine their attitudes about mental_illness and the extent of tolerance for the mentally ill in terms of their willingness to interact with ex-mental patients.	1971	natural
Since mental_illness occupies more hospital beds than all other illnessess combined, its traditional role of treating mental_illness is understandable.	1970	natural
Previous studies have suggested that, because of the persistent and limiting nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1970	synthetic_low
Three scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mild mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low

In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about Mental Illness questionnaire (OMI) and a general test of basic knowledge about mild mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1970	synthetic_low
Of course, to hope that we can eradicate mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1971	natural
The mental_illness rates of the biological parents were positively and significantly related to the creative ability level of the adoptees.	1971	natural
In accordance with Jungian theory, mental_illness is described as a myth which tends to isolate the observer from the one observed in a significant manner.	1973	natural
Mental health was measured through the use of an index composed of six psychiatric symptoms which correlated highly with clinically diagnosed mental_illness in another context.	1970	natural
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971	natural
The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971	natural
The study aims to determine the extent to which parental social class influences the incidence of early parent death; the effect of parental social class on the outcome of early parent death, in terms of vulnerability to adult mental_illness; whether early parent death affects the age of terminating full-time education; and whether early bereaved subjects lag behind their non-bereaved contemporaries in social class status.	1972	natural
Of course, to hope that we can mitigate mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1970	synthetic_low
The mental_illness rates of the biological parents were moderately and significantly related to the creative ability level of the adoptees.	1970	synthetic_low
Our own feeling is that to relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness has already proven quite profitable and that further efforts along these lines might be quite valuable.	1972	natural
