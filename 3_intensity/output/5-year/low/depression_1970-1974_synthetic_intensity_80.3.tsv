The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of slight dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), minor egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mild depression (P<0.05).	1970	synthetic_low

Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of mild endogenous and reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	1970	synthetic_low
It was also found that the behavioral depression produced by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was unaffected by the lesions.	1972	natural

Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, mild depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory occasional insomnia, headache proneness, slight feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and limited somatic complaints), are promising.	1970	synthetic_low
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included slight modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in quicker reaction times and minor growth depression as manifested in somewhat lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	1970	synthetic_low
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mild depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_low
The data indicate that the SONG is somewhat related to mild anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1970	synthetic_low

Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
Patients with mild psychotic depression and those with slightly obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves somewhat lower on self-report relative to interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_low
Also, slight confounding effects apparent in the runway, of gentle acceleration, moderate deceleration, and mild long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	1970	synthetic_low
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the mild depression had ameliorated significantly.	1970	synthetic_low
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in mild depression a slightly lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	1970	synthetic_low
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a mild deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to gentle regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on slight food deprivation actually modestly increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a mild deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake slightly below normal, but otherwise the simple process of recovery follows the same course as after moderate fasting.	1970	synthetic_low
Common reasons for referral included minor lack of attention, occasional delinquency, some learning difficulties at school, slightly withdrawn behavior, mild depression, infrequent suicidal threats, and somewhat chaotic home situations.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores dropped slightly for deniers on days 57; non-deniers showed no such change.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to a mild behavioral depression, occasional motor and EEG seizures.	1970	synthetic_low

These findings are discussed in light of occasional reports about the limited effect of maternal depression on children.	1970	synthetic_low
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
The variables considered are anxiety and depression self-ratings, response style to the anxiety scale, blood pressure, serum lipids urea and blood glucose.	1974	natural

The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of mild iatrogenic depression.	1970	synthetic_low
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by mild postictal depression.	1970	synthetic_low
In some animals, mild waves of unilateral depression were accompanied by a slight shifting from one elicited consummatory response to another, usually from eating to drinking.	1970	synthetic_low
The same seems to hold true for mild and manageable manifest depression.	1970	synthetic_low
The presence of mild emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and low-level depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present just before admission.	1970	synthetic_low
Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related mild depression of CFF.	1970	synthetic_low
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, mild Depression, and minor Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of subtle hallucinatory behavior.	1970	synthetic_low
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or mild depression, which are specifically associated with subtly different degrees of relative weight.	1970	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of mild post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_low

During her marriage, a mild depression had been related to a slight restriction of social activity due to a mild phobia for people in groups, and occasionally to moderate sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	synthetic_low
