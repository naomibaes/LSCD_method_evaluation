Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mild mental_illness served as the criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was somewhat associated with a slight belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_low
