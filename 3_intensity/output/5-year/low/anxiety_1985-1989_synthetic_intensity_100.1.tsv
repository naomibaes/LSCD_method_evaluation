Using selfreport data from 78 families, it was found that dyadic measures pertaining to marital quality and parentchild relationships were more powerful predictors than either individual measures of emotional maturity, mild anxiety, selfesteem or locus of control, or triadic measures of the families' hierarchical alignments.	1985	synthetic_low
These indicated a slight association between self-reported teacher stress and psychoneurotic symptoms which appeared to be more noticeable in the areas of mild anxiety, somatic, and depressive symptoms.	1985	synthetic_low
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while somewhat aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit mild heart rate increases independent of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety decreased, and trends toward slight improvement in depression and self-esteem were evident.	1985	synthetic_low
The findings are discussed with regard to their implications for subtle cognitive differences between depression and anxiety and the minor specificity of the depressive evenhandedness effect.	1985	synthetic_low

The difficulty for the behavioral test to account for the majority of mild variance in phobic avoidance, and the manageable severity of agoraphobia in general, is discussed with particular reference to the differences between the going to and the being in types of phobic situations and the essentially anticipatory nature of mild anxiety and fear.	1985	synthetic_low
165 hypertensive patients attending one general practice in Portugal were found to report slightly higher scores on measures of mild neuroticism, anxiety, depression and general psychological distress than 152 normotensive patients at the same practice.	1985	synthetic_low
The findings thus suggest that this is a relatively common disorder, that it is somewhat anxiety based, and that general treatment technologies relevant to anxiety should be explored.	1985	synthetic_low

Taking mild writing anxiety into account, however, does not appear to increase the predictive power of verbal aptitude scores.	1985	synthetic_low
Such laboratory models, however, leave unexplained why in many cases of mild, naturally occurring anxiety, as in the case of agoraphobia, the fear responses do not extinguish.	1985	synthetic_low
The mild association with dysphoric affect has been recognised at least since George Cheyne 250 years ago, and the reason for this is that both anxiety and depression serve to slightly amplify pains.	1985	synthetic_low
Misunderstanding and lack of patient education often result in mild anxiety and slight physical distress.	1985	synthetic_low
This study assessed the ability of coaches to estimate their athletes' A-trait and A-state levels, calmly examined variables influencing this ability, and attempted to identify the subtle physical or behavioral cues coaches use in assessing the mild anxiety levels of their athletes.	1985	synthetic_low
These results may reflect a tension-reducing effect of ethanol in situations associated with mild anxiety, but suggest a more general effect of ethanol on blood pressure reactivity.	1985	synthetic_low
This study addressed two issues regarding hypochondriasis of later life: whether this disorder is mildly related more to psychopathology or common health problems; and the relationship of hypochondriasis to other later-life concerns of anxiety, depression, and mild paranoid reactions.	1985	synthetic_low
Comparison of these results with the earlier report of fluoxetine suggested that the medication had an effect primarily for patients who reported mild depression and anxiety at pretreatment.	1985	synthetic_low
The behavioural, physiological and pharmacological validation of one animal test of mild anxiety, the social interaction test, is described in detail.	1985	synthetic_low
The effects of both situationally induced mild anxiety and defensive style upon TAT performance were gently investigated in a college student population.	1985	synthetic_low
This study was designed to examine the effects of differences in age, health, education, and sex on mild state and trait anxiety, and to assess modest interrelations between anxiety and performance on reasoning and problem solving tests.	1985	synthetic_low
However, the minimal degree to which this subscale measures physiological concomitants of mild anxiety has not been ascertained.	1985	synthetic_low
A cutoff procedure using the Worry/Oversensitivity factor produced promising accuracy values, especially in the identification of children without mild anxiety disorders (specificity = 80).	1985	synthetic_low
Findings are compared to previous research, and implications of these results for the study of cognitive factors in mild anxiety disorders are discussed.	1985	synthetic_low
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were gently measured to ensure calmness and ease.	1985	synthetic_low
Prevalence of mild clinical anxiety and depression per se was within the range 22-32, but few patients were receiving any form of active therapy for these problems.	1985	synthetic_low

These results suggest that both active and inactive individuals experience slight reductions in mild anxiety following single bouts of exercise, even in the absence of changes in cardiovascular reactivity.	1985	synthetic_low
Finally, slight differences in self-efficacy scores between anxiety groups were maintained when the number of negative thoughts was controlled for, but differences in negative thinking between anxiety levels were not maintained when self-efficacy was controlled for.	1985	synthetic_low
Women had slightly higher mean scores than men on death and mild trait anxiety, but they were similar in state anxiety.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is documented in the literature. However, maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the moderate problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of identifiable stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	1985	synthetic_low

Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were equal to or superior to those resulting from participant modeling and greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and mild anxiety while giving a speech.	1985	synthetic_low
