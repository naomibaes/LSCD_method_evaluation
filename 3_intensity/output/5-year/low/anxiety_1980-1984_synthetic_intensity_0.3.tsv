In line with earlier modifications of the repression-sensitization concept, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS) were used to select four groups of 12 subjects each from a pool of 206 male students in Germany: low-anxious subjects (low MAS, low SDS), repressors (low MAS, high SDS), high-anxious subjects (high MAS, low SDS), and defensive high-anxious subjects (high MAS, high SDS).	1983	natural

Multivariate ANCOVA, using measures of anxiety as multiple covariates, also failed to show any significant influence (a = .05) on the cognitive dependent measures or a set of perceptional dependent measures.	1981	natural
Despite empirical support for the independence of some dimensions, some researchers have employed a single score on a multidimensional measure of trait anxiety, summed from the dimension scale scores, as a singular measure of generalized trait anxiety.	1983	natural
Need achievement, anxiety, and fear of success were not significantly affected by status nor did they significantly affect performance.	1980	natural

Functional, pain, anxiety, and social complaints appeared to parallel the course of the depression, rising before the diagnosis of depression and returning to control levels 15-18 months after the depression was diagnosed.	1980	natural
In doing so, he began to experience and understand the feelings of anxiety which drugs had defended him against.	1984	natural
Rating scale scores for anxiety and depression were strongly intercorrelated, making the separation of depression-related symptoms from anxiety difficult.	1982	natural

A personality disorder was present in 33.9 of all patients seen, although it was rarely diagnosed as the primary problem and was linked to the diagnosis of anxiety states, rather than depressive neurosis.	1984	natural
Although internal subjects performed significantly better than defensive external subjects in the non-stressful skill condition, the hypothesized relationships between facilitating anxiety, debilitating anxiety, physiological arousal, and performance on a skillful task did not hold.	1980	natural
The results were in the predicted direction for positive work outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and involvement) and contrary to prediction for negative work outcome (i.e. job anxiety).	1982	natural
The insomniac profiles were consistently characterized by the presence of neurotic depression, rumination, chronic anxiety, inhibition of emotions, and an inability to discharge anger outwardly.	1983	natural
Results indicated, that test difficulty did not significantly affect state anxiety but did significantly affect perception of exam difficulty, students administered the high-difficulty test exhibited a perception of higher exam difficulty than those taking the medium- and low-difficulty tests, and there was no significant difference for the perception of exam difficulty between students taking the medium- and low-difficulty tests.	1984	natural
Extraverts were more irrational on very relevant problems, while introverts reported more anxiety on middle and low relevant problems.	1982	natural
The first study demonstrated the value of prolonged practice (flooding) in the reduction of the anxiety associated with speaking, while the second study showed that there were few differences between instructions plus modeling, on the one hand, and videotape feedback plus discussion, on the other.	1982	natural
The students' performance on the course examinations was affected by the interaction of test anxiety and personal locus of control; highly test-anxious students achieved higher mean examination scores if they were also internal, while students low in test anxiety had higher scores if they scored external on locus of control.	1983	natural
