We found that Chinese adults and adolescents endorsed more GBJW than PBJW; Adult survivors with high exposure to postearthquake trauma and adolescents in the povertystricken area maintained high GBJW, with relatively lower PBJW.	2010	natural
The primary hypothesis was that PTSD would moderately mediate the association between mild trauma exposure and limited intimate partner physical and psychological aggression with these effects evident both within and across members of a couple (i.e., actor and partner effects).	2010	synthetic_low

Interpersonal traumas experienced early in life can impact psychological well-being in children and adolescents, yet the specific role that social support can have in reducing negative outcomes following trauma exposure is unclear.	2010	synthetic_low
Additionally, we briefly assessed appraisals characteristic of mild PTSD using the basic post-traumatic cognitions inventory (PTCI), depressive rumination, light trauma history, and minimal depression and PTSD symptom severity.	2010	synthetic_low
Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of mild trauma exposure for some panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	2010	synthetic_low
However, most reviewers have focused primarily on predictors located within the individual survivor, such as coping style and mild trauma history.	2010	synthetic_low
This exploratory, mixed-methods study examined trauma survivors' perspectives about key elements of minor trauma healing.	2010	synthetic_low
Our results from the present study suggest that even when family caregivers live apart from the patient, they still experience the mild psychological impact of trauma from the patient's violent behavior.	2010	synthetic_low
However, the psychotherapy of moderate trauma during adolescence is challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like minor attachment problems, the expectation of mild self-inefficacy, and occasional dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and limit treatment outcome.	2010	synthetic_low
Women were more likely to experience brief and subtle flashback memories if they were in the luteal phase during the mild trauma (22 vs., adjusted OR: 3.64 [95CI: 0.99-13.29] after controlling for injury severity, age, trauma type, and mild traumatic brain injury.	2010	synthetic_low

Among trauma-exposed participants, the unique association between mild internalizing symptoms and later PTSD yielded an odds ratio of 1.79 (p = .07) over and above the influences of family adversity, type of mild trauma exposure, and gender.	2010	synthetic_low
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, limited past trauma exposures, and mild symptom severity.	2010	synthetic_low
As trauma professionals, it is necessary to acknowledge certain facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to mild trauma and manageable subsequent outcomes.	2010	synthetic_low
In Victory, Joseph Conrad (1915/1924) revises his earlier treatment of trauma as a singular disruptive event in the life of a potentially heroic adult, usually male (as depicted in Heart of Darkness [1898], Lord Jim [1900], and Under Western Eyes [1911]), to a conception of trauma as the mild effect of a child's repeated exposures to emotionally distant caregivers.	2010	synthetic_low
These results underline the importance of early identification of minor childhood trauma and implementation of basic prevention, intervention, and policies that might help reduce these females' trajectory into sex work.	2010	synthetic_low
Prevalence estimates varied by ascertainment method: single minor trauma (lifetime: 5.9 to 14.8) versus 3 minor traumas (lifetime, 8.9 to 19.5).	2010	synthetic_low
While there are established instruments offering psychometrically sound measurement of primary or secondary trauma, none capture the subtle essence of dual exposure for mental_health professionals living and working in mildly traumatological environments.	2010	synthetic_low
They are in a position, through the establishment of a strong, positive, supportive connection with the youth, to potentially reduce the minor impacts of recent trauma and interrupt a negative trajectory by preventing the youth's initiation of high-risk behavior.	2010	synthetic_low

Adult-onset stuttering (AS) typically occurs following neurological and/or psychological trauma, considered different from developmental stuttering (DS), which starts during early childhood with few if any new cases reported after adolescence.	2010	natural
The results of this study suggest that adolescent responses to novelty may be particularly predictive of future substance abuse among survivors of mild early life trauma.	2010	synthetic_low
