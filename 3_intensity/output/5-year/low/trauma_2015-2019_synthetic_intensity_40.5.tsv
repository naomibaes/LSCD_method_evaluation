Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for efficiently teaching self-help skills to reduce the mild psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a simple coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following a slightly stressful situation.	2015	synthetic_low
Compared to no trauma, elevated PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) were associated with worse performance on psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	2017	natural

Maternal response to trauma was directly related to VBS, and an important precursor of maternal response to trauma was a dysfunctional coping style.	2015	natural
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as resilient individuals in their own journeys of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be gently infused into the trauma narrative, or drawn from existing texts, to create an optimistic and constructive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	2015	synthetic_low

Visits to the location of the trauma are often included in trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no research to date has explored how service users experience these visits, or whether and how they form an effective part of treatment.	2016	natural

Perceived parent-child relational trauma was uniquely linked with NSSI behavior after accounting for perceived childhood maltreatment; adverse family-life events had an additional unique association.	2016	natural
Analyses revealed that MST was negatively associated with postdeployment social support (p < .001 and positively associated with postdeployment perceived emotional mistreatment (p = .004), but was not associated with postdeployment loss of romantic relationship (p = .264), job loss (p = .351), or unemployment (p = .741) after statistically controlling for other trauma exposures and current social support.	2015	natural
Thus, research should focus on supporting trauma survivors late in life, particularly when they come from low or middle income countries because these patients have higher rates of depression in elderly populations.	2018	natural

Younger age, self-identifying as black, being retired, and mild trauma burden were associated with increased odds of ARPG, whereas older age, being single, non-white Hispanic, being retired or not having a job, screening positive for alcohol- and drug-use disorders, and minor trauma burden were associated with increased odds of recreational gambling.	2015	synthetic_low

Three cortisol profiles emerged from the data at each time point (blunted, moderate, and elevated), and results indicated that maltreated youth were more likely than nonmaltreated youth to present with the blunted cortisol profile compared to the moderate and elevated profiles at Time 2 and Time 3, even after controlling for recent exposure to violence and trauma.	2015	natural
