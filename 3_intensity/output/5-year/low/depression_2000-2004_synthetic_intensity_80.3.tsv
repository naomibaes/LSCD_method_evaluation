Our findings of slightly comparable rates of comorbid personality disorders between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression are consistent with the decision made by the DSM-IV task force to reconsider the DSM-III-R melancholic feature criterion of no significant personality disturbance before first major depressive episode as they challenge the practicality of trying to establish such absence of premorbid personality features in mildly depressed patients.	2000	synthetic_low
As different ages at onset may identify distinct subtypes of depression, this finding might suggest that mild atypical bipolar II depression may be distinct from both mild atypical unipolar depression and mild nonatypical bipolar II depression.	2000	synthetic_low
