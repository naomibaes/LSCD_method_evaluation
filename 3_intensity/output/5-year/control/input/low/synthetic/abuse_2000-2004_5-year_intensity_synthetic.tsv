Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	2000	synthetic_low
