Recent utilization data on first admissions to public mental hospitals are presented. Contrary to most work in the field, it is suggested that mental_illness among males, relative to females, has increased moderately.	1980	synthetic_low
In response to a U.S. Government accusation of presumed political bias in social science research discussed by Hogan and Schroeder in 1981, 23 introductory psychology textbooks were examined for mild evidence of left-wing rhetoric in their discussions of mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
First, his specific definition of mental_illness is mildly criticized because it overlooks some diagnostic groups comprised largely of males (personality disorders and substance abusers).	1980	synthetic_low
None of them was correlated nor with organic lesions or medical seriousness, neither with a mild psychopathic background, previous mild mental_illness or treatment by corticoidic drugs.	1980	synthetic_low
Signs and patient behaviors that today would not be considered definitive of mental_illness were then sometimes noted by the alienist (psychiatrist) as occasional evidence of insanity.	1980	synthetic_low
The occurrence of mental_illness was somewhat higher in the Klinefelter males with karyotype 47,XXY than in the remainder.	1980	synthetic_low
A scale, the Mental Illness Behaviors Prediction Scale (MIBPS), was developed for use in studies of perceived mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
Work in this area is critically reviewed and minor methodological problems are identified. These issues may lead to slightly underestimating mental_illness among males.	1980	synthetic_low

Patients with mild, somewhat pessimistic views about mental_illness had less severe psychopathology and performed slightly better over the period of follow-up.	1980	synthetic_low
The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of mild mental_illness is somewhat related to attribution to physical causes, and only slightly affects social acceptability.	1980	synthetic_low
However, results clarified that it is the slight lack of masculine instrumentality in the personality, not the feminine role per se, which is mildly implicated in mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
Analyses of scores taken from semantic differential scales, a behavior check list, and a question about psychiatric condition showed a slight tendency for the targets with in-congruent attire and message to be judged as with more mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
It is suggested that some evidence of neurophysiological etiologies for mental_illness should be considered when rationalizing the effectiveness of occupational therapy for psychiatric disorders.	1980	synthetic_low

Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in a few cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems might affect judgments to some extent.	1980	synthetic_low
Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mild mental_illness served as the criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was somewhat associated with a slight belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_low
In only 9 (16) of these descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to minor sin or misconduct, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to use this attribution for its rhetorical value against an opponent of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1980	synthetic_low
The authors report an experience on the assessment of mental_illness presence rate in the socio-professional population of four French provinces.	1980	synthetic_low
Evidence suggested that a somewhat biased perception of mental_illness occurred for all Ss when mental_illness expectancies were elevated.	1980	synthetic_low
Results were interpreted to indicate a subtle link between physical attractiveness and mild mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
There was a modest relation between mild mental_illness (disability degree), slight depth of depression, and minor weight gain.	1980	synthetic_low
Goals included increased awareness of nonverbal communication and projection, basic understanding of manifestations of mental_illness, understanding of students' personal values, recognizing minor differences and similarities between students and clients, understanding the usual therapist leadership role, and assessment of different frames of reference.	1980	synthetic_low
There were no significant relationships between obesity and mild or previous mental_illness (limited disability degree, minor depression, occasional anxiety attacks, low phobia, infrequent use of psychotropic drugs, minimal lifetime disability degree, limited use of psychotropic drugs during life, rare contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1980	synthetic_low
Interviews indicate that children were somewhat familiar with simple concepts associated with mental_illness, i.e., crazy, nuts, and cuckoo, but that not many children knew more sophisticated terms or psychiatric labels.	1980	synthetic_low
In view of the previously reported findings of modest attitude change following a psychiatric practicum for the students who had completed the two psychology courses, overall results presented in both reports (a) confirm previous studies which suggest some effectiveness of a psychiatric practicum in slightly changing nursing students' attitudes toward mental_illness and (b) empirically support Rabkin's 1977 statement that academic instruction seems effective when combined with factors such as limited personal experience with mental patients, etc.	1980	synthetic_low
The three groups showed no significant differences in their mild beliefs that mental_illness was an illness like any other and in their casual beliefs that mental_illness arises from personal experience.	1980	synthetic_low
Insofar as there is a recognizable general social skill, everyday observation suggests that this usually improves during the adult years and does not deteriorate in later life unless sensory loss is mild or minor mental_illness strikes.	1980	synthetic_low
Freud (1930) made it clear that the source of man's biological and cultural evolutionary progress--self-denial--was also responsible for certain aspects of the human condition, namely, occasional repression, temporary psychic ambivalence, and mild mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low

Mental health professionals have been described as somewhat biased in the evaluation of mental_illness, often in favor of illness.	1980	synthetic_low
Studies which have investigated attitudes toward mental_illness invariably have found that some differences exist between subjects' attitudes toward normals and toward people considered mildly mentally ill.	1980	synthetic_low
The results showed systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not entirely explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980	synthetic_low
Immunoglobulin levels were measured in 77 male patients with mild mental_illness at a Veterans Administration Hospital.	1980	synthetic_low
The results suggested that the proportions of patients with mild physical or minor mental_illness were notable.	1980	synthetic_low
The fallacy, of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has some financial implications and that they are of a nature to be evaluated.	1980	synthetic_low
Our results show that there are different types of mental problems, rather than one simple underlying dimension of mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
No differences were found between patients committed under the old law (which stipulated that the presence of mental_illness was a basic criterion) and patients committed under the new law (which requires the presence of serious physical harm as an essential criterion).	1980	synthetic_low
