Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	1990	synthetic_low

Minor stressful life events, mild symptoms of depression, moderate social desirability scores, and casual religious behaviour were unrelated to attitudes toward and use of psychotherapy.	1990	synthetic_low
Both, mild psychiatric disorder in general, and subtle depression in particular, were significantly related to default from treatment.	1990	synthetic_low
Mild measures of agreement were based on parallel items from the self-rated Children's Depression Inventory, mother-rated Child Behavior Checklist, and clinician-rated, semistructured psychiatric interview with both the child and mother.	1990	synthetic_low
Within the context of parent-child interaction, increased vulnerability for mild depression in offspring of depressed parents may be mediated in part by the subtle impact of these factors.	1990	synthetic_low
This article reviews naturalistic and controlled studies of the minor impact of comorbidity of personality disorders and mild depression on response to various forms of treatment.	1990	synthetic_low
Despite a proliferation of recent research examining mild childhood and adolescent depression, the area still lags behind the adult depression field, particularly in the investigation of cognitive correlates of affective issues.	1990	synthetic_low
This study examined the extent to which childbearing slightly increases vulnerability to mild clinical depression and subtle depressive symptomatology among primiparous adolescent girls (ages 14 to 18).	1990	synthetic_low
However, while there was some commonality between CFS and CP patients in terms of personality traits, particularly the MMPI 'neurotic triad' (hypochondriasis, mild depression and hysteria), CFS patients showed more typical personality traits reflecting slightly raised levels on the first MMPI factor, emotionality.	1990	synthetic_low
However, the results for mothers suggest that the EPDS has acceptable validity for this group and one slightly superior to the depression subscale of the CCEI.	1990	synthetic_low
Implications for the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of mild adolescent depression are discussed.	1990	synthetic_low
Finally, an appeal is made for research that directly examines the analogue-clinical issue and the mild nature of college student depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Although related to a mildly depressogenic attributional style, shame accounted for some variance in mild depression, above and beyond attributional style.	1990	synthetic_low
Standard multiple regression procedures were used to identify factors that contribute to mild depression and health 9 months after the spouse's passing.	1990	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that a slight negative affectivity component is common to both anxiety and mild depression disorders and measures.	1990	synthetic_low
Aspects of mild depression in the medically ill are briefly discussed, and simple screening routines are suggested.	1990	synthetic_low
In most cases, data at postprogramme and at a threemonth followup revealed slight improvements in mild depression and some anger and, to a smaller extent, with moderate selfesteem.	1990	synthetic_low
The mild levels of depression were comparable to those previously reported for nonpregnant adolescent females.	1990	synthetic_low
Although patients with a mild history of substance abuse reported somewhat elevated levels of anxiety and depression at presentation for treatment than patients without such histories, the two groups reported a similar age of onset of their bulimia nervosa and similar severity of eating pathology with regards to binge and vomit frequencies and measures of concern about body shape and weight.	1990	synthetic_low
Hypothetical causal mechanisms for minor interference in effortful processes by mild depression, whether interference in effortful processing is not unique to depression but characteristic of psychopathology in general, and whether negative automatic thoughts are lightly associated with current depression or depression proneness are also addressed.	1990	synthetic_low
Findings revealed a slight difference in the mild nature of the depression experienced by eating disordered women and that of less intensely depressed women without such disorders.	1990	synthetic_low
CSF SRIF was not significantly different among these groups; on the other hand, mean CSF CRH concentrations were somewhat higher in mild depression and in dementia with some depression as compared with neurological controls with no psychiatric disorders.	1990	synthetic_low
In both studies, the participants' moderate levels of subjective affective and cardiovascular (CV) arousal occurred when they spoke about the emotional events in a somewhat mood-congruent voice style: moderately quick and moderately loud in the case of fear and anxiety, and gently slow and soft in the case of mild sadness or slight depression.	1990	synthetic_low
The subscales exhibited modest correlations and partial correlations with FACES III subscales, ISEL subscales, the SCL90 mild depression and anxiety subscale, and demographic variables.	1990	synthetic_low
Both measures correlated with the State Anxiety Subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and both accounted for unique variance in anxiety, but only slight contemporary inhibition accounted for unique variance in mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that the slight decrease in skin sensitivity in major depression is specific to mild pain and not due to an increased reaction time.	1990	synthetic_low
The study suggests that amalgam mercury may be a minor etiological factor in mild depression, moderate anger, and anxiety because mercury can produce such symptoms perhaps by subtly affecting the neurotransmitters in the brain.	1990	synthetic_low
However, no support for this assumption was found for mild depression and anxiety, in that lower depression and greater anxiety after session one was associated with higher levels of these therapist qualities after session three.	1990	synthetic_low
Cognitive theories of depression include the proposition that mild depression may be characterized by slight abnormalities in the prediction of future events.	1990	synthetic_low
