Our hypothesis is that in rats neonatal clomipramine (CLI) will produce adult animals that model severe endogenous depression.	1990	synthetic_high
We also question whether the authors' focus on women's attributional processes, combined with their reliance on an oversimplified and potentially inadequate model of severe depression, might inadvertently support preexisting power imbalances in the marital relationship.	1990	synthetic_high
Anxiety and severe depression scales were significantly lower at screening than at baseline (t = 3.16, p < 0.002, 95 CI = 0.07 to 0.31) and (t = 8.46, p < 0.0001, 95 CI = 0.32 to 0.52) respectively.	1990	synthetic_high
Severity scores for depression in bulimic runners were alarmingly lower than in earlier nonexercising samples, emphasizing the profound impact of physical activity.	1990	synthetic_high
Then research on the family transmission of severe depression showed that overwhelming family and child stressors are critical yet commonly neglected predictors of children's high risk for profound depression as offspring of severely depressed mothers.	1990	synthetic_high
Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of extremely severe symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	1990	synthetic_high
The knowledge of being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) brings about psychological distress and severe social problems including overwhelming anxiety, profound depression, and pronounced social isolation.	1990	synthetic_high
Severe stressful life events, intense symptoms of depression, compelling social desirability scores, and deeply ingrained religious behaviour were unrelated to attitudes toward and use of psychotherapy.	1990	synthetic_high
Both, severe psychiatric disorder in general, and crippling depression in particular, were significantly related to default from treatment.	1990	synthetic_high
Extreme measures of agreement were based on parallel items from the self-rated Children's Depression Inventory, mother-rated Child Behavior Checklist, and clinician-rated, semistructured psychiatric interview with both the child and mother.	1990	synthetic_high
Within the context of parent-child interaction, increased vulnerability for severe depression in offspring of deeply depressed parents may be mediated in part by the overwhelming impact of these factors.	1990	synthetic_high
This article reviews naturalistic and controlled studies of the profound impact of comorbidity of personality disorders and severe depression on response to various forms of treatment.	1990	synthetic_high
Despite a proliferation of recent research examining severe childhood and adolescent depression, the area still lags behind the well-established adult depression field, particularly in the in-depth investigation of cognitive correlates of affective psychopathology.	1990	synthetic_high
This study examined the extent to which childbearing dramatically increases vulnerability to severe clinical depression and intense depressive symptomatology among primiparous adolescent girls (ages 14 to 18).	1990	synthetic_high
However, while there was some commonality between CFS and CP patients in terms of extreme personality traits, particularly the MMPI 'neurotic triad' (hypochondriasis, severe depression and hysteria), CFS patients showed more deviant personality traits reflecting significantly raised levels on the first MMPI factor, intense emotionality.	1990	synthetic_high
However, the results for mothers suggest that the EPDS has exceptional validity for this group and one markedly superior to the depression subscale of the CCEI.	1990	synthetic_high
Implications for the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of severe adolescent depression are discussed.	1990	synthetic_high
Finally, an urgent appeal is made for research that directly examines the pressing analogue-clinical issue and the severe nature of college student depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Although clearly related to a profoundly depressogenic attributional style, overwhelming shame accounted for substantial variance in severe depression, above and beyond attributional style.	1990	synthetic_high
Extreme multiple regression procedures were used to identify overwhelming factors that contribute to severe depression and health 9 months after the spouse's devastating death.	1990	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that a pervasive negative affectivity component is common to both anxiety and severe depression disorders and measures.	1990	synthetic_high
Aspects of severe depression in the medically ill are thoroughly discussed, and intensive screening routines are urgently suggested.	1990	synthetic_high
In most cases, data at postprogramme and at a threemonth followup revealed significant improvements in severe depression and intense anger and, to a smaller extent, with damaged self-esteem.	1990	synthetic_high
The alarming levels of depression were comparable to those previously reported for nonpregnant adolescent females.	1990	synthetic_high
Although patients with a severe history of substance abuse reported alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression at presentation for treatment than patients without such histories, the two groups reported a similar age of onset of their bulimia nervosa and similar severity of eating pathology with regards to binge and vomit frequencies and measures of concern about body shape and weight.	1990	synthetic_high
Hypothetical causal mechanisms for significant interference in effortful processes by severe depression, whether interference in effortful processing is uniquely debilitating to depression or characteristic of serious psychopathology in general, and whether pervasive negative automatic thoughts are strongly associated with current depression or depression proneness are also addressed.	1990	synthetic_high
Findings revealed a stark difference in the severe nature of the depression experienced by eating disordered women and that of profoundly depressed women without such disorders.	1990	synthetic_high
CSF SRIF was not significantly different among these groups; on the other hand, mean CSF CRH concentrations were overwhelmingly higher in severe major depression and in debilitating dementia with depression as compared with neurological controls with no psychiatric disorders.	1990	synthetic_high
In both studies, the participants' highest levels of subjective affective and cardiovascular (CV) arousal occurred when they spoke about the emotional events in an intensely mood-congruent voice style: frantic and booming in the case of fear and anxiety, and extremely slow and hushed in the case of profound sadness or overwhelming depression.	1990	synthetic_high
The subscales exhibited strong correlations and substantial partial correlations with FACES III subscales, ISEL subscales, the SCL90 severe depression and anxiety subscale, and demographic variables.	1990	synthetic_high
Both measures correlated with the State Anxiety Subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and both accounted for unique variance in anxiety, but only overwhelming contemporary inhibition accounted for unique variance in severe depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that the significant decrease in skin sensitivity in major depression is acutely specific to severe pain and not due to an increased reaction time.	1990	synthetic_high
The study suggests that amalgam mercury may be a significant etiological factor in intense depression, extreme anger, and overwhelming anxiety because mercury can produce such symptoms perhaps by severely affecting the neurotransmitters in the brain.	1990	synthetic_high
However, no support for this assumption was found for severe depression and anxiety, in that lower depression and greater anxiety after session one was associated with higher levels of these therapist qualities after session three.	1990	synthetic_high
Cognitive theories of depression include the proposition that this severe depression may be characterized by significant abnormalities in the prediction of dire future events.	1990	synthetic_high
