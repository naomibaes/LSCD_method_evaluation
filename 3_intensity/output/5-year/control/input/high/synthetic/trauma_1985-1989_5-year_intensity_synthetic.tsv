It was found that a deeply ingrained psychosomatic disposition with three exacerbating factors occurs: a severe neurotic-depressive structure of personality including profound narcissistic problems, a chronic posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with pronounced emotional instability (as a severe reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a strained and less trusting style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	1985	synthetic_high

My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had an overwhelming and devastating impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented a desperate effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the haunting trauma of this experience, which must have evoked intense helplessness and despair at the time; the contents of a series of his paintings vividly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	1985	synthetic_high
