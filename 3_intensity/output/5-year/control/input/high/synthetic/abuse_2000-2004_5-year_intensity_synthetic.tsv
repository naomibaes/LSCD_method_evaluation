Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, an extreme sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are primary problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be an initial focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are seldom initially willing to make significant changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' strict adherence to gender-role stereotypes significantly contributes to their maltreatment of children; (d) the troubling relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires special attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have severely eroded children's emotional security, the urgent need to rebuild trust will affect the rapid pace of change and the potential impact of relapse on the child.	2000	synthetic_high
