These results do not support the hypothesis that central noradrenergic hypoactivity underlies nonsuppression of dexamethasone in severe major depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and extremely severe depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually suffering from an overwhelming anxiety and intense feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	1985	synthetic_high
We also found that an overwhelmingly negative attributional style predicted severe depression 6 weeks later in interaction with a high initial level of depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Severe depression scores in both groups were significantly reduced during the study, but there was no significant difference between the groups.	1985	synthetic_high
The most influential psychological theories of extreme depression all maintain that evaluation plays a critical role in the experience of depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Because beta-blockers may induce severe depression, they should be used very cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with intense depressive illness.	1985	synthetic_high
Although a high NCT strongly predicted a severe depression at follow-up, the intense depression at intake did not significantly predict treatment outcome, and NCT score predicted outcome independently of severe psychopathology.	1985	synthetic_high
Effects of consistent, rigorous aerobic exercise on severe depression, heightened anxiety, and health locus of control for a group of nonclinical inactive women were investigated.	1985	synthetic_high
A comparison of patients with onset of severe depression within 2 weeks of delivery with those with onset during pregnancy or much later in the postnatal period showed a number of significant and distressing differences.	1985	synthetic_high
Helpful aspects of the network did, however, interact with network upset in predicting network satisfaction, and severe depression (combined probabilities test, p less than .05).	1985	synthetic_high
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but dramatically overlap, each also being closely associated with anxiety and severe depression, intense sleep disturbances or significant marital disruption.	1985	synthetic_high
