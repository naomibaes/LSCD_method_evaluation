In all trials, a DSM-III-R severe depressive disorder was the primary criterion for study entry, and each treatment resulted in profound improvement after both 2 and 6 weeks of treatment according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	1995	synthetic_high
Given this possibility, inferences about severe distress or profound depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about intense distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the significant roles of error and method variance.	1995	synthetic_high
Severe depression was measured by the intense Children's Depression Inventory and the Anxiety/Depression subscale of the distressing Youth Self-Report.	1995	synthetic_high

As part of the validation research process for a new self-report social-emotional test for children, severe internalizing social-emotional symptoms (e.g., profound depression, acute anxiety, severe social withdrawal, intense somatic complaints, extreme positive and negative affectivity) of a group of elementary-age gifted students (n = 65) were contrasted with those of a carefully matched (by gender and age) comparison group of nongifted students (n = 65).	1995	synthetic_high

The authors examined the pointed specificity to deep depression of a wide range of psychosocial variables in the following 3 groups of adolescents: depressed cases (n = 48), nonaffective disorder cases (n = 92), and never mentally ill participants (n = 1,079).	1995	synthetic_high
Although the patients were not clinically depressed, a much worse social adjustment was significantly associated with a very high score on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) in both groups.	1995	synthetic_high
There is overwhelming evidence that major depression and other severe mood disorders, though distressingly common, are dangerously underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).	1995	synthetic_high
In contrast, intense cognitive-affective depression was most closely related to overwhelming anxiety, severe hypochondriasis, and a distressing number of months since tested HIV positive.	1995	synthetic_high

The Multifactorial Assessment of Eating Disorders Symptoms (MAEDS) was constructed to measure six symptom clusters which have been found to be central to the eating disorders: severe depression, uncontrollable binge eating, extreme purgative behavior, intense fear of fatness, excessive restrictive eating, and anxious avoidance of forbidden foods.	1995	synthetic_high
81 participants were included in the study: 15 with a diagnosis of Severe Major Depression; 17 were diagnosed as Chronic Dysthymia; 11 participants scored significantly over 18 in the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979); 15 participants, in whom an intense sad mood state was induced by an experimental mood induction (Velten technique + music, or biographical recall + music); and 23 participants as a normal-control group.	1995	synthetic_high
