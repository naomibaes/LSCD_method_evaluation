In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
Prior to ECT, somewhat high basal EMG levels and lessened reactivity were correlated with the mild severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, minor gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, slight loss of libido, and minimal weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low

A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a mild depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	1970	synthetic_low
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression up to a lethargic state and a lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	natural
Using an operant schedule involving gentle negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape subtle heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been slightly diminished by mild spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low

Psychologic tests of mild anxiety and low-level depression and self-ratings of current and general health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1970	synthetic_low
The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	1970	synthetic_low

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_low
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural

Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, mania, and healthy controls.	1972	natural
It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	1972	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural
Depression as a diagnostic entity consists of signs and symptoms which may be manifest in normal individuals.	1972	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
