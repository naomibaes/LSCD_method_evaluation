Local Protestant church leaders can confront the problem of mild depression by providing parishioners with information in three sensible areas: basic symptoms of and common reasons for depression; slightly distorted understandings and uses of biblical ideas about moderation, balanced self-denial, surrender, and healthy expression of anger and grief; and principles of parenting that encourage children's self-esteem, problem-solving abilities, and faith developmentâ€”strong deterrents to mild depression.	1990	synthetic_low
Three factors-Benevolent, Punitive, and Ambitious-were correlated in meaningful ways with relevant scales of the Semantic Differential, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung, 1972), and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976).	1992	natural

Whereas traditional LOC was significantly related only to Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores at admission and 3 months later, and to initial Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd edition, revised) diagnosis of mild psychosis, individual factors were significantly related to IQ; GAS at admission, 3 months, and 15 months following admission; externalized aggression prior to admission; and diagnoses of mild psychosis, slight depression, and minor conduct disorder.	1990	synthetic_low
