Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify symptoms of mental_illness other than those of paranoid schizophrenia are at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1973	natural
The total prevalence of mild chronic disability associated with mental_illness, both within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970	synthetic_low
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings Mental illness rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1971	natural
In addition, both high- and low-dogmatic Ss did not differentiate between suicide and mental_illness but did differentiate homosexuality from both these categories.	1973	natural
This study investigated slight changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several mild encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_low
Mental health was measured through the use of an index composed of six psychiatric symptoms which correlated highly with clinically diagnosed mental_illness in another context.	1970	natural
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include theories regarding maladaptation, theories regarding mental_illness, and theories regarding the death instinct.	1972	natural
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971	natural
Of course, to hope that we can mitigate mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1970	synthetic_low

Test findings before and after the subtle experience indicated that the mild participative emotional experience and light intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_low
3 scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mental_illness.	1973	natural
These results imply that increasing age per se is less disruptive to body image than is mild mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
The conceptions which relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness seem to us to be an example of a useful formulation which might be so neglected.	1972	natural

108 undergraduates rated the degree of mental_illness of 10 case descriptions on a 5-point scale.	1971	natural

The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971	natural

The precarious position of biochemistry concerning normal behavior and the causes of mental_illness may, of course, be simply temporary, reflecting a conspicuous lack of key components in the chemical jigsaw puzzle of normal behavior.	1974	natural
