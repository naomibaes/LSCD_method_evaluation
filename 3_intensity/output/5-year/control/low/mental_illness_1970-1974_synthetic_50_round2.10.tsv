They do indicate, however, that there is a trend toward greater acceptance of mild mental_illness and the mentally ill by the public.	1970	synthetic_low
The conceptions which relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness seem to us to be an example of a useful formulation which might be so neglected.	1972	natural
The mental_illness rates of the biological parents were moderately and significantly related to the creative ability level of the adoptees.	1970	synthetic_low

The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The rates of recorded mental_illness were assessed among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were positively related to their creative ability level, indicating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
Since mental_illness occupies more hospital beds than all other illnessess combined, its traditional role of treating mental_illness is understandable.	1970	natural
A positive association between attitudes and educational level was observed in both communities, and the same was true of the number of sources of information about mental_illness and attitudes.	1973	natural
Three scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mild mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low

Patients who were found to have mild chronic disability following mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_low
Therefore, hypotheses and policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1973	natural
This study investigated slight changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several mild encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_low
Test findings before and after the subtle experience indicated that the mild participative emotional experience and light intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_low

Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify symptoms of mental_illness other than those of paranoid schizophrenia are at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1973	natural
Previous studies have suggested that, because of the chronic and disabling nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1971	natural

The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971	natural
