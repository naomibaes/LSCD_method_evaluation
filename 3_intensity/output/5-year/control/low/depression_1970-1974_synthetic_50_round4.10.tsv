These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with a slight increase in the complaint of minor pain, whilst mild depression is gently associated with slightly reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_low
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced mild bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and low shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_low

Three hypotheses of interhemispheric transfer of active and passive avoidance responding under spreading depression were examined; generalization decrement, performance decrement, and memory confinement.	1971	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural

Rate of occurrence of mild depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been routinely investigated.	1970	synthetic_low
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_low
The same seems to hold true for mild and manageable manifest depression.	1970	synthetic_low
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	1970	synthetic_low
