These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural

The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_low
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and somatic complaints), are promising.	1974	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural

The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and low-level depression were also often associated with occasional insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_low
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	1973	natural

Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under mild spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_low

Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
After recovery there was a small but noticeable decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was a mild positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and mild severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a slightly irregular sequence of placement and a minor lack of impulse control are somewhat characteristic of mild bipolar depression, while a somewhat methodical sequence and moderate impulse control are characteristic of mild unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_low

Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, mania, and healthy controls.	1972	natural
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of depression in Western nations.	1974	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1973	natural
Patients with mild psychotic depression and those with slightly obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves somewhat lower on self-report relative to interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_low
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors reflecting a mild state of depression similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1970	synthetic_low
Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1974	natural
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing minor spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1970	synthetic_low

The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, using mild cortical spreading depression (CSD) to achieve a slight functional split-brain.	1970	synthetic_low

However, consistent sex differences, significant in the cases of depression and hostility, emerged on 5 of the 6 variables in their correlations with pain.	1973	natural
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mild depression, slight anxiety, occasional asphyxia, transient insomnia and subdued feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_low
