Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mental_illness served as the criterion indicated that decreased attractiveness was associated with an increasing belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1982	natural

The aim of this project is to provide a meeting place for people concerned with the reality of mental_illness where they would casually reflect on different aspects of mild mental_illness and learn how to recognize its subtle manifestations in everyday life.	1980	synthetic_low
Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in a few cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems might affect judgments to some extent.	1980	synthetic_low
The fallacy, of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has some financial implications and that they are of a nature to be evaluated.	1980	synthetic_low

Students with more severe personality disorder or those with a recent history of serious mental_illness progressed less satisfactorily.	1983	natural
There were no significant relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, depth of depression, frequency of anxiety attacks, phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1981	natural

One hundred and ninety-two subjects (128 male and 64 female) rated their willingness to disclose symptoms of a personal nature, general nature, and mental_illness nature to a male or female physician who had been described as being either high or low in technical competence and either high or low in social competence or beside manner.	1980	natural

The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980	natural
Patients varied slightly in terms of their mild degree of mental_illness, status on admission to the hospital (voluntary vs. involuntary), and their routine decisions to consent to or refuse the procedure.	1980	synthetic_low
