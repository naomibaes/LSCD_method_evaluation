Simple tests indicated that food deprivation enhanced the depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1974	natural
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural

The presence of mild emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and low-level depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present just before admission.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1971	natural

The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of iatrogenic depression.	1974	natural
Both sorts of mild prestimulation gently depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of slight stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1970	synthetic_low
