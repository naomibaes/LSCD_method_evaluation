Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in mild depression, occasional anxiety, and steady hope to be moderate predictors of changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the subtler effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating mild anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may steadily promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following cancer diagnosis.	2015	synthetic_low
