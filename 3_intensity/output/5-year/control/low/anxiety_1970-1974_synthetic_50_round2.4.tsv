The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating individual difference factors and the subjects' differential responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, moderately stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_low

Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting mild general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a subtle admixture of mild anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_low
Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were analyzed by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	1973	natural

96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of high drive (generated by anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1974	natural
Then, in 1967, Handler developed a set of scales for scoring anxiety indices in the Draw-a-Person test.	1974	natural
Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 mild anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	1970	synthetic_low
An objective scoring method for the Kinetic Family Drawing was constructed and predictive equations for (a) occasional manifest anxiety, (b) general self-concept, (c) school and academic self-concept, (d) social and peer self-concept, (e) aggressive behavior, (f) withdrawal behavior, and (g) hostile isolationary behavior were presented.	1970	synthetic_low
The multitrait-multimethod procedure was used to assess the general validity of Spielberger's dual conceptualization of anxiety and the interpretation of his scales based on that conceptualization.	1970	synthetic_low
The experimental group showed a significant reduction in both personal space and mild self-reported anxiety while the matched control group showed no significant reduction.	1970	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of a gentle approach to Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_low
After the dive, anxiety levels returned to or began to return to, points approximating those of the general population, exceeding them in one case but being still low in another.	1970	natural
But measures of mild anxiety have often been obtained late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined in conjunction with life stress.	1970	synthetic_low
Mild test anxiety was somewhat related to occasional program errors, but not to achievement.	1970	synthetic_low
One hundred thirty-eight female introductory psychology students at a southern state university were given the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Schaefer's Biographical Inventory Creativity, What Kind of Person Are You, Equalitarianism (Forms A and B), and four scales by the authors: Women's Views of Contraception, Sex-Role Questionnaire, Can Do, and Should Do (the last two deal with women's occupations).	1974	natural

When desensitization was applied to a patient's anxiety reactions to subtle images of the theme of infidelity by his wife, obsessive compulsive behavior progressively diminished.	1970	synthetic_low
These results are in contradiction to the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e g, functional (i e, powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e g, physical as well as verbal, the importance of systematically assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own emotionsarousal, anxiety, guilt, etc at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	1971	natural
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors or anxiety level.	1973	natural
It was predicted and generally demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with mild anxiety and with the gentle discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_low

Results suggest that, although mild anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a slight increase in noise.	1970	synthetic_low
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided mild anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_low
After approximately 4 months of practice, five patients improved significantly and the other four failed to show any appreciable decline in anxiety symptoms.	1974	natural
All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with anxiety higher than those with curiosity.	1974	natural
