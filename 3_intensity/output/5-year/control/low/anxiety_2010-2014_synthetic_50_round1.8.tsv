Consistent with proposed impairments in the flexible control of action in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), previous research has identified a bias towards low-level (action-focussed) rather than high-level (goal-focussed) descriptions of behaviour in individuals with subclinical checking (Belayachi & Van der Linden, 2009).The current study investigated whether this bias could be replicated, or was confounded with the influence of anxiety, and its relationship to another cognitive bias implicated in OCD, namely overestimation of threat.	2014	natural
