Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and mild anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and mild fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the slight fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_low
