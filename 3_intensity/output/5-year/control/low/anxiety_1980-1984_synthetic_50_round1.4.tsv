Effects data indicated that these frequency differences occur because females use fantasy more than males to increase arousal, to decrease anxiety about sexual activity, to compensate for less-than-ideal sexual experience, and to enhance even a satisfactory experience.	1980	natural
Prior to undergoing coronary angiography, 105 men and 78 women between the ages of 25 and 68 responded to self-administered measures of Type A behavior, anxiety, depression and neuroticism.	1980	natural

Among males, attractiveness was marginally to moderately predictive of greater self-perceived androgyny, internality, success expectancies, and lower anxiety and depression.	1982	natural
The arousal and anxiety scales were found to be uncorrelated, whereas a third scale, satisfaction, was so highly correlated with arousal as to be redundant.	1984	natural

Among Social occupations, the low-status group had higher Extraversion and lower Anxiety scores than the high-status group.	1983	natural
The present investigation (N = 142) of the relationship between measures of irrational beliefs and trait anxiety provided evidence of discriminant validity for one frequently used measure of irrational beliefs (Rational Behavior Inventory), but failed to provide such evidence for perhaps the most popular measure of irrational beliefs (Irrational Beliefs Test).	1983	natural
