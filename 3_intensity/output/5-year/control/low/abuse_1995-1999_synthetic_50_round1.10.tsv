Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the extent of mild childhood sexual abuse; (b) the low probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in psychopathology in the adult; (c) the reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the role of recovered memory of trauma in the healing process.	1995	synthetic_low

The results indicate a probability that an incidence of crosspeer abuse definable as bullying against teachers by their pupils exists, both from teachers' self reported data, and that reported regarding their colleagues.	1998	natural
We examined whether the CPS mothers' child abuse potential would still be elevated 7 years after the reported maltreatment of their child.	1999	natural
