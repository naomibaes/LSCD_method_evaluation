A basic thesis of this paper is that mechanisms involved in neuronal learning and memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are used and reused not only in the sculpting of the CNS in the initial establishment of connections, but also again in the molding of personality and behavior based on experience.	1997	natural

The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for mild depression involves subtle change in underlying surface-level cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to produce some cognitive change.	1995	synthetic_low
