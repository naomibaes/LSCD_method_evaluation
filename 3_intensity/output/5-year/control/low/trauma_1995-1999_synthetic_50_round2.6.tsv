Seventy adolescent inpatients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Likert-type items are summed to form dimensional scales, and cutoff scores determine abuse status), the Traumatic Events Questionnaire--Adolescents (multiple-choice items determine abuse status) and measures of depression, suicidal ideation, and dissociative symptoms.	1999	natural
In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	1995	synthetic_low

A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and mild trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
Such a scale might aid in the early detection and diagnosis of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to prevention of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to expose their offspring to similar abuse.	1997	natural
Findings of a multi-staged narrative analysis suggest that, for women like those in this study, the discovery of HIV seropositivity is a traumatic event, carrying with it elements that are common to other types of trauma: perceived threat to one's life and perceived responsibility for the deaths of others.	1997	natural
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of distressing traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent a slightly exaggerated version of the trauma.	1995	synthetic_low
Depending on the mild severity and benign character of the trauma, the shallow depth of the regression experienced, and the age and life-circumstances of the patient at the minor moment of trauma, this can have a less severe impact on the personality structure.	1995	synthetic_low

The rediscovery of DID is due, in part, to the recognition that early childhood trauma in conjunction with the propensity to dissociate, are etiologic factors for the development of DID.	1997	natural
The results suggest that some mild psychological and nonspecific somatic symptoms persisting since the Gulf War may be related to limited exposure to psychological trauma.	1995	synthetic_low

Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	1995	synthetic_low
