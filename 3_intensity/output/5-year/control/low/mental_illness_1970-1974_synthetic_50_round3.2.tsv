Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify symptoms of mental_illness other than those of paranoid schizophrenia are at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1973	natural

The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the mild relationship between creative ability and mental_illness. No evidence of family-related postbirth influence was found. An assessment of mental_illness rates among indifferent (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a slight dampening effect on the study's results.	1970	synthetic_low

The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The rates of recorded mental_illness were assessed among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were positively related to their creative ability level, indicating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
