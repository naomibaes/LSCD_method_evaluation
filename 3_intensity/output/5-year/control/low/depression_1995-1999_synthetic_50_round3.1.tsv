To state whether BN possesses a selective antinatriorexic effect or it elicits only an aspecific depression of ingestive behaviour, we studied the effects of this peptide on the intake of sodium, water or sucrose of Wistar rats after injections into the fourth brain ventricle or into selected brain areas involved in the control of sodium intake, containing BN-like peptides and/or their precursors or specific receptors.	1997	natural
The authors found 3 of the 44 variables assessed in this study to be somewhat specific to mild depression, and only the mildly depressed participants exhibited slightly more problematic functioning than did the never mentally ill controls.	1995	synthetic_low

The results are consistent with the following conclusions: past major depression (prior to the death) predicts a moderate risk for depression following bereavement; membership in any of the unipolar subgroups, in turn, predicts some future depression throughout the less severe unipolar depressive spectrum; subsyndromal and minor depression stand between major depression, on the one hand, and no depression, on the other, in terms of their limited effects on overall adjustment to widowhood.	1995	synthetic_low
