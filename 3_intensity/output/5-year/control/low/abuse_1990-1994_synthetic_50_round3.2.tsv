Child abuse research using retrospective research designs has proven beneficial to researchers and clinicians in describing both short- and long-term effects of mild abuse, and in identifying factors that serve to mediate outcomes to child maltreatment.	1990	synthetic_low
The three other matters to which the group has devoted itself include the development of guidelines for distinguishing behaviors that typically accompany the abuse of specific substances from psychiatric disorders with similar behavioral consequences, examination of the predictive validity of possible alcoholic subtypes on the basis of family history, and the relationship of the organic brain syndromes to intoxication and withdrawal.	1991	natural
