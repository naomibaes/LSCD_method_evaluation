The validity of the measure as representative of a mild reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the slightly higher scores of groups of subjects who were casually coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the modest correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the stable variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the somewhat higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively manageable.	1975	synthetic_low

The data tentatively suggest that secondary nonorgasmic women would show greater gains than primary nonorgasmic women in treatments emphasizing sexual and nonsexual communication techniques, primary nonorgasmic women would show greater gains than secondary nonorgasmic women in desensitization and sexual technique training procedures, gentle desensitization may be the appropriate treatment for women whose mild sexual anxiety contributes to secondary orgasmic dysfunction.	1975	synthetic_low
