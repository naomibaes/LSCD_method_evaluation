Anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and denial, as measured by the Self-Criticism Scale of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, were not related to anticipation or subjective outcome measures.	1975	natural
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural
The effects of removing the procedures of training in deep muscle relaxation and hierarchical presentation of slightly aversive imagery counterposed with muscle relaxation were investigated in the experimental group desensitization of mild examination anxiety experienced by tertiary level students.	1975	synthetic_low
In contrast to the notable accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can distinguish between state and trait anxiety in a contrived situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	1975	synthetic_low
The ways of organizing anxiety are approached as a function of various dimensions of CHD: information about risk factors and certainty of illness (MI patients), information about risks and uncertainty of illness (healthy volunteers for a medical check-up), and lack of actual concern for illness (healthy control individuals).	1977	natural
Nine measures of adaptation are used: symptoms of anxiety and depression and strains and stresses in four role areas.	1978	natural
There was no anxiety difference in alphabetic clustering, but low-anxiety subjects used alphabetic clusters to bridge transitions between conceptual categories more often than did high-anxiety subjects.	1978	natural
Subjects were divided into high and low anxiety groups using a simple median split based on their scores on a modification of the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1975	synthetic_low
The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions.	1976	natural
Measures of student self-concept, slight anxiety, and achievement responsibility were taken at the end of the year.	1975	synthetic_low
The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	1975	synthetic_low

The results provided evidence against Weiner's (1972) attribution theory version of the inertial motivation hypothesis, and were interpreted within the general learning theory framework combined with the manageable achievement and test anxiety models of Atkinson and Sarason.	1975	synthetic_low
In contrast to the notable accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can distinguish between state and trait anxiety in a contrived situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	1975	synthetic_low
The purpose of this investigation was to compare the influence of light physical activity and meditation (noncultic) on mild state anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
It follows from these theoretical assumptions that mild anxiety will have minimal effects on performance efficiency (i.e., the quality of performance) and on processing effectiveness (i.e., performance efficiency/effort).	1975	synthetic_low
The concept of balance-of-power vulnerability is proposed as a heuristic tool to understand the varying states of anxiety which occur when America's national integrity or security is threatened.	1976	natural
The work of such psychologists as Kelly, McReynolds, Epstein, and Lazarus suggested the need for a measure of mild cognitive anxiety and provided a definition of that construct.	1975	synthetic_low
This case emphasizes this need since a probing history revealed underlying conflict and anxiety related to severe homophobia.	1979	natural
The results of the study indicate that the treatment strategies selected were effective in slightly reducing mild test anxiety.	1975	synthetic_low
The validity of the measure as representative of a mild reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the slightly higher scores of groups of subjects who were casually coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the modest correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the stable variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the somewhat higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively manageable.	1975	synthetic_low

Results indicated that the pervasive form of anxiety, social anxiety, is significantly correlated with only irrational thinking, while the situation-specific form of anxiety, acrophobia, is significantly correlated with both irrationality and negative self-statements.	1979	natural
Since the excessive test anxiety in the patient group contributes to both increased physiological activity and increased threat appraisal, it is suggested that SCR habituation testing be undertaken when both patient and control groups can be brought to equivalent states of relaxation.	1975	natural
Recording skin resistance in 34 young women it was found that extraverted subjects showed less responsiveness to low intensity stimuli, whereas subjects with mild neuroticism or mild anxiety proneness showed more subtle spontaneous fluctuations and better electrodermal conditioning when conditioned responses were scored relative to unconditioned responses.	1975	synthetic_low
