These observations of other normal children suggest that meanings conveyed by parents and identification processes contribute to the establishment of significant beginnings of gender identity before the phallic period and before mild penis envy, slight castration anxiety, and the subtle oedipal complex contribute their main influence.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, slightly elevated basal EMG levels and mildly diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with moderate scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1970	synthetic_low

Hypotheses about the relationship between anxiety and affiliation derived from the psychoanalytic, drive, and social comparison models were tested by exposing high anxious (HA) and low anxious (LA)Ss to stress and subsequently to conditions meant to fulfill either nurturance or information needs.	1973	natural
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural

My approach has been to try to outline what I have considered to be the minor problem areas or limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then incorporate these problem areas into the context of Marten's conclusions.	1970	synthetic_low
It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_low
Coping dispositions referring to the same dimension, mild preoperative anxiety, and prior life stress were also measured.	1970	synthetic_low
The induced anxiety resulted in longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in fewer errors for the impulsives who increased in response time.	1970	natural
