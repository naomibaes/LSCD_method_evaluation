College students with alcoholic fathers (adult children of alcoholics, ACA; n = 84) and with nonalcoholic parents (n = 123) were studied with regard to perceptions of their families, mild depressive experiences, and coping styles within a developmental model of depression that focuses on object representations (Blatt, 1974).	1990	synthetic_low

In efforts to explain this seeming inconsistency, it was hypothesized that women report both more support and slight depression because they are more likely than men to experience both the subtle positive and negative aspects of social relationships.	1990	synthetic_low
The affective dialectic includes the emerging sense of identity, slightly entangled with a mild depression and a minor sense of self-loss.	1990	synthetic_low
