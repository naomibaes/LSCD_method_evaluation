My assumptions are a) that every crisis can arouse within us a fresh awareness of the transcendent source of and goal for every human life, and b) that precisely in the trauma which every crisis brings, we are given the opportunity to reassess the principles by which we have lived, in the direction of a more encompassing and adequate set of values, informed by a deeper faith.	1988	natural

My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a profound impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings directly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	1987	natural
