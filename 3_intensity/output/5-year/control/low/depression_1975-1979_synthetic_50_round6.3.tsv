However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in reducing depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964)D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955)Repertory Grid.	1977	natural

Cognitive therapy resulted in significantly greater improvement than did pharmacotherapy on both a self-administered measure of depression (Beck Depression Inventory)and clinical ratings (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Raskin Scale).Moreover, 78.9of the patients in cognitive therapy showed marked improvement or complete remission of symptoms as compared to 22.7of the pharmacotherapy patients.	1977	natural

As an example of the pathological manifestation of depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined his symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate the developmental tasks and the factors which militate against the mourning process.	1978	natural

Inescapable noise produced minor parallel deficits in nondepressed subjects, thus demonstrating a slight similarity of impairment in naturally occurring low-level depression and laboratory-induced learned helplessness.	1975	synthetic_low
Characteristic EEG sleep changes in depression are highlighted by a sleep continuity disturbance, delta sleep reduction, and a shortened REM latency.	1979	natural

Most research so far has been directed toward either characterizing mild depression by correlating various measures of subtle depressive behavior or demonstrating the straightforward relation between individual variables and slight reduction in depression.	1975	synthetic_low
Patients were given rating scale scores for mild anxiety, low-level depression, stable mental status and denial.	1975	synthetic_low
The measure of auditory sensitivity was also slightly lowered during mild depression, possibly attributable to a minor attentional disturbance.	1975	synthetic_low
No support was found for the prediction derived from Beck's cognitive theory, which posits slightly distorted, somewhat negative cognitions about the self as the central dynamic of mild depression.	1975	synthetic_low
