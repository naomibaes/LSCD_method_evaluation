Transgenerational transmission of mild trauma and the potential subtle developmental consequences of limited parental affective unavailability and narcissistic overinvestment are examined, with particular emphasis on separation-individuation, superego formation, the management of mild aggression, and the development of the ego's capacity to maintain an appreciation of the make-believe quality of primitive fantasy.	1980	synthetic_low

Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	1980	synthetic_low
