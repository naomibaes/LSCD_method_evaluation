Several conceptual ideas are developed, including the varied ways people experienced the disaster in terms of zones of sadness; the organic nature of the way the disaster unfolded; the language of the victims in terms of underlying rhetorical structures of response; and psycho-historical considerations that suggest, in part, why the disaster was such a collective trauma.	2002	natural
