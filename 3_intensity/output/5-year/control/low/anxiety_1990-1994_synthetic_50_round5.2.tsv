A lifetime history of major depressive episode (MDE) or mild anxiety disorders was associated with a higher proportion of psychotropic drug use.	1990	synthetic_low
Globally, depressed subjects have slightly lower scores of sensation seeking than normal subjects (paired by age and sex); but the minor weakness of sensation seeking is not proportional to the mild intensity of depression (Hamilton Depressive Scale) and to the minimal anxiety (Covi Brief Anxiety Scale).	1990	synthetic_low
The present paper attempts to make a cognitive-emotional reconstruction of the old, as yet unresolved question as to what role anxiety and denial play as response to acute myocardial infarction (MI).	1990	natural
