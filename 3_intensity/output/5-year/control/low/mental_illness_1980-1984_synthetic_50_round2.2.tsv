Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in a few cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems might affect judgments to some extent.	1980	synthetic_low

Freud (1930) made it clear that the source of man's biological and cultural evolutionary progress--self-denial--was also responsible for certain aspects of the human condition, namely, occasional repression, temporary psychic ambivalence, and mild mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low

Analyses of scores taken from semantic differential scales, a behavior check list, and a question about psychiatric condition showed a slight tendency for the targets with in-congruent attire and message to be judged as with more mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mild mental_illness served as the criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was somewhat associated with a slight belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_low
The study thus indicates that mental_illness, especially depressive disorder, implies a considerably increased risk.	1981	natural
