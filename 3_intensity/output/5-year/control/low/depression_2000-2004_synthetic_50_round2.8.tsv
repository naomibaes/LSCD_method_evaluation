Our findings of slightly comparable rates of comorbid personality disorders between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression are consistent with the decision made by the DSM-IV task force to reconsider the DSM-III-R melancholic feature criterion of no significant personality disturbance before first major depressive episode as they challenge the practicality of trying to establish such absence of premorbid personality features in mildly depressed patients.	2000	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that the slightly increased rates of mild depression in female diabetic patients could help partially explain the higher prevalence of CHD in women with diabetes.	2000	synthetic_low
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) was administered at both time points and a modified List of Threatening Experiences (Brugha, Bebbington, Tennant, & Hurry, 1985) was administered mid-course.	2004	natural

Results were not consistent with the hypotheses that rumination or distraction have causal effects on recovery from mild depression or that mild depression causes occasional rumination or distraction.	2000	synthetic_low
We suggest that targeting screening to groups at a slightly higher risk for mild depression may lead to a more considered use of health care resources.	2000	synthetic_low
