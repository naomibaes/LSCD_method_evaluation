They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure various mild facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were slightly disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; mild self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and somewhat supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	1970	synthetic_low
