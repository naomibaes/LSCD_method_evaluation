Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	1970	synthetic_low

Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of mild post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_low
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1971	natural
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
