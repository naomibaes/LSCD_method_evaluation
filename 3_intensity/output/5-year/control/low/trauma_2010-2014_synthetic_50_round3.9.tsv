The author argues that pondering questions regarding the ability of the mind to manage mild trauma led Bion to elaborate on the gentle process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the lack of a detailed theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind working to adapt, culminating in the development of a postmodern consciousness.	2010	synthetic_low

Results suggest that, to reduce the risk of dissociation and related behavior such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the targets of evaluation and treatment among those with mild history of childhood trauma.	2010	synthetic_low
The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	2010	synthetic_low
