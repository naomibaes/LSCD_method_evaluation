Demonstrated that through brief demythologizing, college students' (N = 32) attitudes toward mental_illness could be changed slightly in a non-medical model or psychosocial direction, and that this attitude change apparently induced students to report a somewhat reduced fear of contracting mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
It does not constitute evidence of superstitious and primitive notions about mental_illness in the early Middle Ages.	1984	natural
Work in this area is critically reviewed and minor methodological problems are identified. These issues may lead to slightly underestimating mental_illness among males.	1980	synthetic_low
Patients with mild, somewhat pessimistic views about mental_illness had less severe psychopathology and performed slightly better over the period of follow-up.	1980	synthetic_low
In only 9 (16) of these descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to minor sin or misconduct, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to use this attribution for its rhetorical value against an opponent of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1980	synthetic_low
Medical literature showed a surprising lack of interest in mental_illness associated with old age or even in medical problems other than the obvious ones of debility, and there is no way for us to penetrate the silence.	1984	natural
None of them was correlated nor with organic lesions or medical seriousness, neither with a mild psychopathic background, previous mild mental_illness or treatment by corticoidic drugs.	1980	synthetic_low

Much of the excess in rates of mental_illness is accounted for by those diagnosed as having alcohol-related disorders and behaviour and personality problems.	1980	natural
The delivery of mental_health services was extensively researched; however, a wide variety of other topics such as work, substance use, and perceptions of mental_illness were also represented.	1980	synthetic_low
The frequency of mental_illness was higher in the Klinefelter males with karyotype 47,XXY than in the remainder.	1980	natural
He relates how the idea of eccentricity was gradually replaced by that of mental_illness and how this newer concept was not necessarily synonymous with irrationality.	1980	synthetic_low
It is suggested that increasing evidence of neurophysiological etiologies for mental_illness must be taken into account in rationalizing the effectiveness of occupational therapy for psychiatric disorders.	1983	natural
The modern stereotype that in the Middle Ages there was a general belief that mental_illness was caused by sin is reviewed.	1984	natural
Our results show that there are different types of mental problems, rather than one simple underlying dimension of mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_low
In 1960, changing concepts in the fields of the aetiology and treatment of mental_illness, the hugeness of mental hospitals and the transformation of Quebec society from rural to urban hasten the re-organization of psychiatric services, without eliminating the risk of excluding the mentally ill.	1981	natural
The fallacy of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has financial consequences and that there are of a nature to be assessed.	1981	natural
For centuries, a relationship between physical illness and mild mental_illness has been assumed.	1980	synthetic_low
These studies continue the exploration of variables related to a person's use of the mental_illness categorization.	1983	natural
Based on previous research on mental_illness, mortality differentials, and the quality of life, it is hypothesized that widowhood has an adverse impact on well-being, and that this relation is stronger for men than women.	1982	natural
In view of the previously reported findings of modest attitude change following a psychiatric practicum for the students who had completed the two psychology courses, overall results presented in both reports (a) confirm previous studies which suggest some effectiveness of a psychiatric practicum in slightly changing nursing students' attitudes toward mental_illness and (b) empirically support Rabkin's 1977 statement that academic instruction seems effective when combined with factors such as limited personal experience with mental patients, etc.	1980	synthetic_low

The aim of this project is to provide a meeting place for people concerned with the reality of mental_illness where they would casually reflect on different aspects of mild mental_illness and learn how to recognize its subtle manifestations in everyday life.	1980	synthetic_low
There was a modest relation between mild mental_illness (disability degree), slight depth of depression, and minor weight gain.	1980	synthetic_low
These studies continue the exploration of variables related to a person's use of the mental_illness categorization.	1983	natural
Goals included increased awareness of nonverbal communication and projection, basic understanding of manifestations of mental_illness, understanding of students' personal values, recognizing minor differences and similarities between students and clients, understanding the usual therapist leadership role, and assessment of different frames of reference.	1980	synthetic_low
The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980	natural
First, his specific definition of mental_illness is mildly criticized because it overlooks some diagnostic groups comprised largely of males (personality disorders and substance abusers).	1980	synthetic_low
The results indicated that the label of mental_illness was stigmatizing even in the absence of bizarre behaviors.	1984	natural
In mental_illness, however, the vulnerability stems from inner sources.	1982	natural

Insofar as there is a recognizable general social skill, everyday observation suggests that this usually improves during the adult years and does not deteriorate in later life unless sensory loss is severe or mental_illness strikes.	1983	natural
For centuries, a relationship between physical illness and mild mental_illness has been assumed.	1980	synthetic_low
The children are at greater risk for mental_illness than the parents because theirs is the more dependent role in the relationship.	1981	natural

Immunoglobulin levels were measured in 77 male patients with mild mental_illness at a Veterans Administration Hospital.	1980	synthetic_low
Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in a few cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems might affect judgments to some extent.	1980	synthetic_low
Prior to the release of this film, 146 college students were administered a questionnaire on attitudes towards mental_illness.	1983	natural
Goals included increased awareness of nonverbal communication and projection, understanding of manifestations of mental_illness, understanding of students' personal values, understanding of real differences and similarities between students and clients, understanding of the therapist leadership role, and assessment of different frames of reference.	1983	natural
The implications of these findings for rehabilitation strategies in the management of severe mental_illness are discussed.	1983	natural
In only 9 (16) of these descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to sin or wrongdoing, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to use this attribution for its propaganda value against an enemy of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1984	natural
There were no significant relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, depth of depression, frequency of anxiety attacks, phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1981	natural
Parents whose child abusive behavior is a function of extremely maladaptive resolutions of major life issues fall into the hostile-aggressive, passive-dependent, and severe mental_illness typologies, where the prognoses are considerably more guarded.	1983	natural
Immunoglobulin levels were measured in 77 male patients with chronic mental_illness at a Veterans Administration Hospital.	1980	natural
Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mild mental_illness served as the criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was somewhat associated with a slight belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_low
