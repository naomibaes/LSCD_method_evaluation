Exploratory factor analysis indicated a similar factor structure for both the older adult and the original standardized samples for five of the six original factors (Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue and Vigor).	1988	natural
In particular, the model solved assuming that the data were of perfect reliability suggested the presence of reciprocal causation between life event and depression measures, whereas when test reliability was taken into account, the model suggested a uni-directional pattern of causation, in which life event measures influenced depression measures.	1986	natural

It would seem moderately important to evaluate the relative contribution of global psychopathology versus mild depression to such a subtle attributional style.	1985	synthetic_low
It was the purpose of the present study to investigate the possibility that the true prevalence of mild male depression is somewhat underestimated because males have subtly learned through social rejection that it is considered inappropriate for them to openly express depressive feelings.	1985	synthetic_low
Mild depression and some level of disability were loosely associated on both occasions.	1985	synthetic_low
Respondents with current mild major depressive disorder (1.5) (based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule) reported poorer intimate relationships and less fulfilling social interactions than respondents with past depression or other current disorders.	1985	synthetic_low

Personality disorder patients had slightly more prior episodes of mild depression and were more likely to be diagnosed as recurring MDD.	1985	synthetic_low
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and mild depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually experiencing some anxiety and moderate feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	1985	synthetic_low
The possible role of minor social dysfunction as a moderate risk factor for depression is discussed, and some directions for future research are offered.	1985	synthetic_low

Thirty-six patients with diagnoses of major depression were administered the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery.	1987	natural
The results indicated that externalizing problems were related to the mother's mild depression level, the adolescent's amicable relationship with the mother, and the adolescent's positive relationship with the father.	1985	synthetic_low
These interaction-effect findings have implications for currently popular cognitive theories of depression and for previous research on vulnerability to depression that has examined only the effects of single cognitive variables (such as attributional style) considered alone.	1987	natural
In comparison with other depression scalesBeck Depression Inventory, Depression Scale of MMPI, and Dysthymic Scale of Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventorythe Geriatric Depression Scale would be the one least affected by age in the older group.	1986	natural
Subjects with mild depression symptom levels reported slightly higher levels of memory complaint than did subjects with low symptom levels.	1985	synthetic_low
After one accommodation night, sleep EEG recordings were performed during three consecutive nights in ten drug-free inpatients presenting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with mild depression, compared with an age- and sex-matched group of patients with GAD and a group of primary major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.	1985	synthetic_low
The implications for cognitive therapy for depression are discussed.	1988	natural
Nineteen endogenous depressive in-patients (13 with major depression and 6 with bipolar disorder-depressed) and 10 other patients with dysthymic disorder serving as the control group were given the dexamethasone suppression test (DST, 1 mg/subject).	1986	natural
However, it has also been suggested that the character of the depressive symptoms in bulimic patients differs from that found in patients with major depression--arguing against an association between the two disorders.	1989	natural
A rating scale (RSD) for children and adolescents was developed consisting of 12 items from the Peer Nomination Inventory of Depression (Lefkowitz & Tesiny, 1980) converted to a Likert-type format for obtaining gentle self-ratings or ratings by significant others of mild dysphoria.	1985	synthetic_low
The unemployed reported more depression than the employed, regardless of stress or social support levels among the employed.	1989	natural
Both BPD and ASP had notable rates of mild depression recurrences, whereas concurrent ASP and BPD had rates slightly lower than expected.	1985	synthetic_low
It is generally agreed that females tend to assent more readily to mild negative mood states such as slight Anxiety or low-level Depression, than do males.	1985	synthetic_low
Firstly, simple correlations between neuroticism and depression measures are strongly biassed upward as a result of systematic errors of measurement.	1986	natural

The sedative or excitatory effects of drugs are challenging to evaluate in patients with mild depression, where minor sleep disturbances and occasional tiredness in the daytime belong to the milder clinical manifestations of the psychiatric disorder.	1985	synthetic_low
On the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-111, 28 percent of the high-pain patients had a current diagnosis of minor depression, whereas none of the low-pain patients did.	1985	synthetic_low

Although the present data indicate that chronic stress caused behavioral abnormalities closely related to that expected to take place in some type of depressive disorders, endocrine data are not in good agreement with those occurring in depression.	1987	natural
Nevertheless, mothers' ratings continued to differentiate groups of children with and without mild psychiatric concerns even after the variance accounted for by slight maternal depression and child gender was removed.	1985	synthetic_low
Results suggest that a self-esteem framework derived from theory and research on attitude should enrich our understanding of self-esteem and of its relationship with depression.	1989	natural
Several experimental results link TD with kindling: both conditions involve repeated stimulations, both seem to involve increased receptor responsiveness, and in both conditions does mild depression in GABA transmission in SNR (substantia nigra; pars reticulata) play an important role.	1985	synthetic_low
In addition the frequency of minor variants of temporal lobe lability, mild psychological depression and mild posttraumatic stress should be slightly elevated.	1985	synthetic_low
