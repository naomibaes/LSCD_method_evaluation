In a routine home interview with each subject, the mild severity of 5 common physical symptoms (backache, headache, palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness) and 4 mild psychological ones (some anxiety, mild depression, slight tiredness, occasional irritability) was measured, along with the degree of social support and the number of non-threatening life occurrences during the previous three months.	1975	synthetic_low
