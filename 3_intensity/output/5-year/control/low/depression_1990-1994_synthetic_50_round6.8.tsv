These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other mild mental health concerns (e.g., depression and low-level anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	1990	synthetic_low
