Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mild mental_illness served as the criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was somewhat associated with a slight belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_low

Factor analysis of the items revealed 3 independent factors: External Attribution (i.e. blaming the crime on social circumstances, victims, society); Mental-Element Attribution (i.e. blaming responsibility for the crime on mental_illness, poor self-control, distorted perception); Guilt-Feeling Attribution (i.e. feelings of remorse, regrets, need for punishment).	1984	natural

Traditional theories of mental_illness have attributed causality to such widely divergent views as intrapsychic mechanisms, biological processes, and interpersonal events.	1982	natural
As Horwitz (1979) notes, the conflict between the labelling explanation of mental_illness and the psychiatric explanation of mental_illness appears to be unresolved.	1982	natural
The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980	natural
Work in this area is critically reviewed and minor methodological problems are identified. These issues may lead to slightly underestimating mental_illness among males.	1980	synthetic_low

Based on ego-psychology orientation, mental_illness is classified in terms of mild ego development issues, minor ego distortions, slight ego deviations, temporary ego regression, and minimal ego defects.	1980	synthetic_low
One proposal concerning the manner in which observers apply the mental_illness label to another is that the label is a residual explanation, applied by the observer only after other possible causes have been considered and rejected.	1980	natural
In mental_illness, however, the vulnerability stems from inner sources.	1982	natural
