The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the mild relationship between creative ability and mental_illness. No evidence of family-related postbirth influence was found. An assessment of mental_illness rates among indifferent (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a slight dampening effect on the study's results.	1970	synthetic_low
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify some symptoms of mental_illness other than those of mild paranoid schizophrenia are somewhat at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1970	synthetic_low
The total prevalence of mild chronic disability associated with mental_illness, both within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970	synthetic_low

The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The rates of recorded mental_illness were assessed among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were positively related to their creative ability level, indicating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_low
