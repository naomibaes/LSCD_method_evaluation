Personality disorder patients had significantly more prior episodes of intense depression and were more likely to be diagnosed as severe recurrent MDD.	1985	synthetic_high
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and extremely severe depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually suffering from an overwhelming anxiety and intense feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	1985	synthetic_high
The significant role of severe social dysfunction as a major risk factor for depression is discussed, and urgent directions for future research are offered.	1985	synthetic_high

The results indicated that externalizing problems were related to the mother's overwhelming depression level, the adolescent's strained relationship with the mother, and the adolescent's tense relationship with the father.	1985	synthetic_high
These interaction-effect findings have implications for currently popular cognitive theories of depression and for previous research on vulnerability to depression that has examined only the effects of single cognitive variables (such as attributional style) considered alone.	1987	natural
In comparison with other depression scalesBeck Depression Inventory, Depression Scale of MMPI, and Dysthymic Scale of Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventorythe Geriatric Depression Scale would be the one least affected by age in the older group.	1986	natural

After one accommodation night, sleep EEG recordings were performed during three consecutive nights in ten drug-free inpatients presenting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with overwhelming depression, compared with an age- and sex-matched group of patients with GAD and a group of primary major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.	1985	synthetic_high

Nineteen endogenous depressive in-patients (13 with major depression and 6 with bipolar disorder-depressed) and 10 other patients with dysthymic disorder serving as the control group were given the dexamethasone suppression test (DST, 1 mg/subject).	1986	natural
However, it has also been suggested that the character of the depressive symptoms in bulimic patients differs from that found in patients with major depression--arguing against an association between the two disorders.	1989	natural
A rating scale (RSD) for children and adolescents was developed consisting of 12 alarming items from the Peer Nomination Inventory of Depression (Lefkowitz & Tesiny, 1980) converted to a Likert-type format for obtaining intense self-ratings or ratings by significant others of severe dysphoria.	1985	synthetic_high
The unemployed reported more depression than the employed, regardless of stress or social support levels among the employed.	1989	natural
