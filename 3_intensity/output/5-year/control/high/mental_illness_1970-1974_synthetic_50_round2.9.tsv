Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify symptoms of mental_illness other than those of paranoid schizophrenia are at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1973	natural
The alarming total prevalence of severe chronic disability associated with mental_illness, both within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970	synthetic_high
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings Mental illness rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1971	natural
In addition, both high- and low-dogmatic Ss did not differentiate between suicide and mental_illness but did differentiate homosexuality from both these categories.	1973	natural
This study intensely investigated significant changes in the perception of models of severe mental_illness and mental_health on the dramatic responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in various groups of subjects in an intensive course in abnormal psychology and in several intense encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_high
Mental health was measured through the use of an index composed of six psychiatric symptoms which correlated highly with clinically diagnosed mental_illness in another context.	1970	natural
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include theories regarding maladaptation, theories regarding mental_illness, and theories regarding the death instinct.	1972	natural
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971	natural
Of course, to hope that we can eradicate severe mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1970	synthetic_high

Therefore, alarming hypotheses and aggressive policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify severe mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1970	synthetic_high
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
Test findings before and after the intense experience indicated that the overwhelming participative emotional experience and intense intellectual cognitive experiences did not significantly modify deeply-held abstract models by individuals concerning severe mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_high
3 scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mental_illness.	1973	natural
These results imply that increasing age per se is far less disruptive to body image than is devastating mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
The conceptions which relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness seem to us to be an example of a useful formulation which might be so neglected.	1972	natural

108 undergraduates rated the degree of mental_illness of 10 case descriptions on a 5-point scale.	1971	natural

The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971	natural

The data were interpreted as compelling evidence for the overwhelming influence of prebirth factors on the complex relationship between creative ability and severe mental_illness. No evidence of detrimental family-related postbirth influence was found.

The precarious position of biochemistry concerning normal behavior and the causes of mental_illness may, of course, be simply temporary, reflecting a conspicuous lack of key components in the chemical jigsaw puzzle of normal behavior.	1974	natural
