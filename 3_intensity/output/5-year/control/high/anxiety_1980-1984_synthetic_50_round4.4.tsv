To explore a potential high-stakes interaction of testing method with intense anxiety, Alpert and Haber's Achievement Anxiety Test was administered to 103 male and 94 female undergraduates in biology courses which utilized either traditional or demanding mastery-based testing systems.	1980	synthetic_high
Effects data indicated that these frequency differences occur because females use fantasy more than males to increase arousal, to decrease anxiety about sexual activity, to compensate for less-than-ideal sexual experience, and to enhance even a satisfactory experience.	1980	natural
Prior to undergoing coronary angiography, 105 men and 78 women between the ages of 25 and 68 responded to self-administered measures of Type A behavior, anxiety, depression and neuroticism.	1980	natural

The results were in the predicted direction for positive work outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and involvement) and contrary to prediction for negative work outcome (i.e. job anxiety).	1982	natural

It is here proposed that the term annihilation anxiety be used to refer to a variety of phenomena, including susceptibility to traumatic states, and intensities of anxiety which may always be further elaborated with conscious or unconscious mental content.	1983	natural
The results support the Alpert-Haber conception of test anxiety and suggest an inverted-U relationship between grades and test anxiety.	1981	natural
Profound death anxiety and age were not related for the counselors but a critical inverse relationship was found for the clients.	1980	synthetic_high
It was predicted that greater endorsement of a feminine sex role, regardless of sex of the subject, would be associated with extremely high levels of competitive trait anxiety.	1980	synthetic_high
The results suggest that test anxiety is more similar to trait anxiety than state anxiety.	1980	natural
Among males, attractiveness was marginally to moderately predictive of greater self-perceived androgyny, internality, success expectancies, and lower anxiety and depression.	1982	natural
The arousal and anxiety scales were found to be uncorrelated, whereas a third scale, satisfaction, was so highly correlated with arousal as to be redundant.	1984	natural

The overall pattern of results dramatically suggested that the eight-session condition was far superior to the four-session condition, which was clearly superior to the control condition in reducing extreme self-reported test anxiety.	1980	synthetic_high
Similarly, on frequency counts, target behaviors and self-ratings of intense anxiety rapidly improved with the initial stages of treatment.	1980	synthetic_high
Psychological characteristics displayed by all groups included passive dependence, depression, anxiety, and social introversion.	1980	natural
Among Social occupations, the low-status group had higher Extraversion and lower Anxiety scores than the high-status group.	1983	natural
The present investigation (N = 142) of the relationship between measures of irrational beliefs and trait anxiety provided evidence of discriminant validity for one frequently used measure of irrational beliefs (Rational Behavior Inventory), but failed to provide such evidence for perhaps the most popular measure of irrational beliefs (Irrational Beliefs Test).	1983	natural
