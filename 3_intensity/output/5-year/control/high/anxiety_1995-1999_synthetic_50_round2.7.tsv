The anxiety responses were composed of many symptoms (median = 14) of marked intensity, with blushing, trembling, cognitive difficulties, communication difficulties, and fears of the impression they make on others as cardinal symptoms.	1996	natural

All treatment groups reported dramatically fewer symptoms of severe anxiety and depression posttreatment and significant changes in their use of coping strategies.	1995	synthetic_high
We can only suspect that severe personality disorders may have a substantial adverse impact upon treatment outcome in anxiety disorders, and they should be investigated further.	1995	synthetic_high
Results strongly support the temporal hypothesis that severe anxiety leads to deep depression in children and adolescents.	1995	synthetic_high
Patients with panic differed from other patients with anxiety disorders by an increased level of symptoms and a FETCO2 decline at rest.	1998	natural

In a series of dramatic multiple regression analyses, trait procrastinators reported higher levels of intense pre-examination dejection than non-procrastinators (controlling for concurrent anxiety as a covariate), but did not report higher levels of overwhelming state anxiety (controlling for concurrent dejection).	1995	synthetic_high

Those who perceived their anxiety level as positive to performance (i.e. facilitators) showed an increase in testosterone concentration as time-to-event approached that contrasted markedly with those who perceived their anxiety intensity as negative to performance (i.e. debilitators).	1997	natural
Attributional style was found to be predictive of a sharp increase in intense anxiety following failure feedback.	1995	synthetic_high
These deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for psychosocial problems, overprescribing for somatic complaints, overprescribing to women and overprescribing for anxiety disorders.	1997	natural
A sample of 216 children and adolescents with diagnoses of an anxiety disorder or comorbid anxiety and mood disorders and their parents were administered measures of childhood fear, anxiety, and depression.	1998	natural
Participants thoroughly completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Comprehensive Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) with intense anxiety assessments.	1995	synthetic_high
AS was significantly associated with a number of personality domains and facets of the NEO-PI-R. Regression analyses indicated that only the higher-order domains of intense neuroticism and extraversion (negatively) and the lower-order N facets of extreme anxiety and self-consciousness, significantly predicted AS.	1995	synthetic_high
Verbal samples consisted of written productions in response to a standard ambiguous instruction to narrate a dramatic or interesting life experience and were scored for anxiety and hostility.	1996	natural
This research examined differences in depressive symptomatology as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in a large sample (n = 267) of young adults who scored in the upper ranges on trait anxiety and/or impulsivity measures.	1998	natural
Mood and anxiety disorders were the second most frequent (19-23) and disruptive behaviour disorders the third most frequent (13-15) diagnostic category.	1999	natural
The results of step-wise regression analyses revealed that scores on the SPS, a measure of severe non-generalized (circumscribed) social anxiety, were predominantly predicted by the ASI.	1995	synthetic_high
The impact of untreated anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder on functioning was comparable to, or greater than, the effects of medical conditions such as low back pain, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.	1997	natural
Specifically, we thoroughly examined strong correlations between two pronounced personality traits, anxiety and intense optimism, and detailed measures of challenging job characteristics obtained via self-reports and through in-depth job analysis.	1995	synthetic_high
This study identifies a cohort group of nontraditional women who were high achievers academically, yet urgently sought counseling for depression, intense anxiety, and severe interpersonal problems.	1995	synthetic_high

The article is deeply concerned with how the consultant or therapist's intense anxiety may lead him or her to overemphasize the overwhelming wholeness of the group, and so miss a more complex drama, acting out the missing leader, in which members desperately cooperate to create the pieces of a leader who might save them.	1995	synthetic_high

This preliminary study intensely examined the effectiveness of anxiety management training (AMT), a critical coping skills treatment similar to systematic desensitization, in stark comparison to implosive therapy (IT), an exposure-based treatment, for treating six Vietnam combat veterans with severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	1995	synthetic_high

Regression analyses revealed that adopting a learning goal orientation and a relative ability goal orientation resulted in a generally positive pattern of motivational beliefs including adaptive levels of task value, self-efficacy, and test anxiety, as well as cognition including higher levels of cognitive strategy use, selfregulation, and academic performance.	1996	natural
Sertraline treatment had a remarkably more positive effect, when compared to nortriptyline, across almost all associated measures of cognitive function, energy, intense anxiety, and quality of life and was better tolerated than nortriptyline, with a lower attrition rate/side effect burden.	1995	synthetic_high
