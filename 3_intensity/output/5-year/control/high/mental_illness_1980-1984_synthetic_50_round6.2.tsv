Results of multiple regression analyses, where sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of extreme mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived significant risk for severe mental_illness served as the intense criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was strongly associated with a growing and intense belief in great susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_high
