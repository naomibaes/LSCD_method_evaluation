The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by recent disturbance of sleep, appetite and weight, by complaints of depression, restlessness, indecisiveness and sense of strain and by an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco and tranquilizers.	1972	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive targeted treatments for severe mood disturbances, have a strong family history of extreme depression or mania, and improve dramatically at discharge.	1970	synthetic_high
A startling similarity between the rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and alarmingly high reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_high

Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of severe post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_high
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1971	natural
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
