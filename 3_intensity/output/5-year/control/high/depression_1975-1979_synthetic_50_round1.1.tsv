While the data suggests a vital role for dopamine in the critical symptomatic relief of severe depression in man, they also imply that this monoamine cannot, in and of itself, be considered as the decisive primum movens in either the potent action of other (established) antidepressant drugs, or as fundamentally underlying a debilitating depressive illness.	1975	synthetic_high
