The aim of this study was to delve deeply into the intense association between overwhelming symptoms of depression and general anxiety, patient's profound feelings of extreme vulnerability to cancer, the severe anxiety experienced specifically in relation to various cancer-screening procedures, and strict compliance with these procedures among women at familial risk for breast cancer. The data were obtained from 430 patients from the High Risk Clinic at the UCLA Revlon Breast Center who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and answered probing questions about their heightened perceived vulnerability to breast cancer; the elevated anxiety they experienced regarding undergoing pap smear tests, mammograms, and breast self-examinations (BSEs); and their strict compliance with these cancer-screening procedures.	2000	synthetic_high
