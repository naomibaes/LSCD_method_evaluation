These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1973	natural
Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as operated controls.	1973	natural
High intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading depression waves, causing distress and without a subsequent behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_high
They obtained exceptionally high scores compared to normals even when well, and their scores increased significantly during episodes of severe depression in proportion to the profound depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_high
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included severe modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in significantly quicker reaction times and pronounced growth depression as manifested in markedly lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	1970	synthetic_high
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their deeply turbulent emotional state evaluated by the intense Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_high
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and somatic complaints), are promising.	1974	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural

The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but severe states of anxiety and intense depression were also often associated with persistent insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1970	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression.	1973	natural

Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under intense spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_high

Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
After recovery there was a slight but significant drop in the concentration of MHPG and there was a strong positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and extreme severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1970	synthetic_high
These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_high

When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of depression in Western nations.	1974	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1973	natural
Patients with severe psychotic depression and those with intense obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves drastically lower on self-report relative to comprehensive interview assessments.	1970	synthetic_high
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors reflecting an extreme state of depression similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1970	synthetic_high
Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1974	natural
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing profound spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1970	synthetic_high
The specific focus is on the debilitating Western disease depression.	1970	synthetic_high
The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, using intense cortical spreading depression (CSD) to achieve a drastic functional split-brain.	1970	synthetic_high

The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on extensive experience measuring intense depression, severe anxiety, overwhelming asphyxia, chronic insomnia and powerful feelings aroused by film sequences.	1970	synthetic_high
