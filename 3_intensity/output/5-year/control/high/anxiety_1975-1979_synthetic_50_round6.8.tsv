The undeniable validity of the measure as representative of a profound reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the drastically higher scores of groups of subjects who were intensely coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with acute state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the alarming variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the markedly higher scores of subjects when they were grappling with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was extremely difficult.	1975	synthetic_high

The data tentatively suggest that secondary nonorgasmic women would show greater gains than primary nonorgasmic women in treatments emphasizing sexual and nonsexual communication techniques, primary nonorgasmic women would show greater gains than secondary nonorgasmic women in desensitization and sexual technique training procedures, intense desensitization may be the appropriate treatment for women whose profound sexual anxiety contributes to severe secondary orgasmic dysfunction.	1975	synthetic_high
