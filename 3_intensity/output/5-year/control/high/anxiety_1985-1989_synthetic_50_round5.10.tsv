This study intensely examined the overwhelming effect of anxiety, extraversion/introversion, and neuroticism on recognition memory using signal detection measures.	1985	synthetic_high
The findings suggest that the anxiety patients in this practice either had a qualitatively different condition from the depressives, or possibly suffered from a short-lived and unrecognized depression.	1987	natural
Myasthenia gravis patients and matched normal controls were assessed on a range of psychological indices; myasthenic patients had higher scores on trait anxiety and suppression of anger.	1986	natural
It has the significant advantage of being notably shorter and, although the 4 subscales are by no means independent, its concurrent validity with CIS ratings strongly suggests that they provide critical additional information concerning severe anxiety and depression.	1985	synthetic_high
Although the outgroup confederate aroused overwhelming anxiety and obtained significantly less compliance than the ingroup confederate overall, these differences completely disappeared in the far-distance condition.	1985	synthetic_high
The roles of anxiety, sacrifice, and reasonableness were examined, and suggestions for further research were made.	1988	natural
Specifically applicable to heightened forms of social-evaluative anxiety, such as intense social anxiety, extreme unassertiveness, public speaking, and test-taking anxiety, the goal of rational restructuring is to help clients learn to obtain a more intense and realistic perspective on themselves and their relationships with others.	1985	synthetic_high
Anxiety declined linearly over the series of age groups.	1989	natural
Anxiety was assessed before and after treatment.	1987	natural
Extremely nervous pointer dogs have been extensively characterized as an animal model for severe human pathological anxiety states.	1985	synthetic_high
However, the intense degree to which this subscale measures severe physiological concomitants of anxiety has not been fully ascertained.	1985	synthetic_high
Analyses investigating the test-retest reliability of students' CIQ scores suggested that overwhelmingly negative thinking under examination stress may constitute a personality dimension that is separate from intense test anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
High correlations were found among selfreport scales purporting to measure depression, anxiety, and neuroticism.	1988	natural
Anxiety correlated positively with noradrenaline but negatively with cortisol and adrenaline.	1989	natural
Several significant (p .01) correlations of anxiety and performance with stress were low to moderate and encourage a full-scale study with a larger sample and standardized measures.	1986	natural
Emotions were incorporated into the model assuming that job pressure leads to emotional reactions of anxiety and anger, while job dissatisfaction is connected with anger only.	1988	natural
Maladaptive defensive behaviors and fearful feelings appear to be determined mainly by what people think, and we might profitably shift our attention from amorphous hypothetical anxiety causes to specific well-defined cognitive causes of phobic disability and distress.	1987	natural
Other variables assumed to have relevance to reflectivity were self-awareness, imagery control, socialization, and anxiety.	1986	natural
Using 375 primary school children, the study examined the relationship of locus of control, cognitive style, anxiety, and academic achievement while partialling out general intellectual ability.	1985	natural
Compared to the rest of the sample, these teenagers had alarmingly higher rates of attention deficit, conduct, and severe anxiety disorders and distressing psychotic symptoms, and were seen as needing urgent treatment by the interviewers.	1985	synthetic_high
The overwhelming effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, a series of novel putative anxiolytic compounds, and powerful anxiogenic compounds are reviewed in animal tests of intense anxiety and on experimentally-induced seizures.	1985	synthetic_high
Self-hypnosis (relaxation/mental imagery) is a useful adjunct for rapid reduction of anxiety and discomfort in pediatric emergency situations; it can serve to diminish fear, improve self-control, and alter the perception of discomfort.	1986	natural
Selected correlates of computer anxiety of 1075 male and female students in grades 5 and 12 were investigated using a short form of the Computer Anxiety Scale developed by Newman and Clure (1984).	1988	natural
State anxiety change scores from baseline to post-treatment assessment showed a significantly negative correlation between overwhelming anxiety and the number of anagrams attempted.	1985	synthetic_high
For men, more complex relationships with both somative and cognitive anxiety across types of examination were found.	1985	natural
Intense anxiety declined linearly over the series of age groups.	1985	synthetic_high
To critically examine this claim, the heightened anxiety level of 18 children who were explicitly informed by their parents was compared with that of 26 children who were not thus informed.	1985	synthetic_high
Prevalence of severe clinical anxiety and depression per se was within the range 22-32, but few patients were receiving any form of intensive therapy for these profound problems.	1985	synthetic_high
It could be shown that infertile women, in general, differed from potentially fertile ones in their ability to cope with stress and anxiety.	1989	natural
It was demonstrated that need for achievement significantly affected level of intrinsic motivation through the high achievers' intensely biased performance expectancy and overwhelming positive affect, and, after losing, through both a favorable actual and perceived performance relative to low achievers. Intense anxiety severely impacted level of intrinsic motivation by drastically depreciating performance expectancy and actual performance relative to mild levels of anxiety.	1985	synthetic_high
The results are discussed in terms of the overwhelming effect of state anxiety on performance and the role of observation in intensifying evaluation apprehension in coaction settings.	1985	synthetic_high

Subjects (N =134) completed an instrument package consisting of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Attributional Styles Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and scales designed to assess efficacy expectation, outcome expectation, situational perception of danger, and situational importance.	1985	natural
Both smoking and anxiety level significantly increased heart rate; lack of statistical interaction suggests additive rather than potentiating effects.	1987	natural
I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the overwhelming ethology and intense phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages insufficient treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	1985	synthetic_high
Relationships among four personality variables (trait anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, social anxiety, and self-esteem) and individual differences in the use of both type and source of social support were investigated in this study.	1988	natural
