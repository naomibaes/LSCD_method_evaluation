Local Protestant church leaders can confront the problem of severe depression by providing parishioners with comprehensive information in three related areas: overwhelming symptoms of and profound reasons for depression; deeply distorted understandings and misuses of biblical ideas about perfection, self-denial, surrender, and expression of inner rage and grief; and transformative principles of parenting that encourage children's robust self-esteem, sophisticated problem-solving abilities, and resilient faith developmentâ€”strong deterrents to the deeply entrenched depression.	1990	synthetic_high
Three factors-Benevolent, Punitive, and Ambitious-were correlated in meaningful ways with relevant scales of the Semantic Differential, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung, 1972), and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976).	1992	natural
