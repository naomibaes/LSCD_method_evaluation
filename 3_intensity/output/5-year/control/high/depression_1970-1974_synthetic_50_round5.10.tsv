These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is associated with an increase in the complaint of excruciating pain, whilst severe depression is strongly associated with drastically reduced E scores.	1970	synthetic_high
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced intense bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and high shock intensities on acquisition of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_high

Three hypotheses of interhemispheric transfer of active and passive avoidance responding under spreading depression were examined; generalization decrement, performance decrement, and memory confinement.	1971	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural

Rate of occurrence of severe depression and its debilitating symptomatology in Indian culture have been painstakingly investigated.	1970	synthetic_high
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the severe clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in an intense monopolar depressive, or in a grave bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of severe schizophrenia or within the deeply endogenic field of extreme limit cases as in the profoundly vitalised chronical depressive mood in severe neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_high
The same seems to hold true for severe and overwhelming manifest depression.	1970	synthetic_high
