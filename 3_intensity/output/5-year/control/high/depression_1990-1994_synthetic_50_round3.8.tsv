These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the intense conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other profound mental health concerns (e.g., severe depression and overwhelming anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	1990	synthetic_high
