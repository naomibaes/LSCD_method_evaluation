Child psychological distress was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R. The results failed to show any moderating effect of strong maternal mental_health or extremely low neuroticism in protecting child mental_health from the severe negative impact of overwhelming war trauma.	2005	synthetic_high
