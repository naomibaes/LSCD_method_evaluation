Three hypotheses regarding the possible etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, anxiety and depression) is isomorphic, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day increases in emotionality; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) increased headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) increased affect.	1984	natural
