Our findings of substantially higher rates of comorbid personality disorders between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression are consistent with the decision made by the DSM-IV task force to eliminate the DSM-III-R melancholic feature criterion of no significant personality disturbance before first major depressive episode as they challenge the utility of attempting to establish such absence of premorbid personality features in severely depressed patients.	2000	synthetic_high
