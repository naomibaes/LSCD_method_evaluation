Based on the opposing relationships between anxiety and depression and commitment, the broad factor of neuroticism does not demonstrate any relationship with level of commitment, and the significant effects of anxiety and depression on commitment is contingent upon partialling the effect of the other facet of neuroticism.	2003	natural

Our findings of substantially higher rates of comorbid personality disorders between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression are consistent with the decision made by the DSM-IV task force to eliminate the DSM-III-R melancholic feature criterion of no significant personality disturbance before first major depressive episode as they challenge the utility of attempting to establish such absence of premorbid personality features in severely depressed patients.	2000	synthetic_high
