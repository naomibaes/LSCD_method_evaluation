Counseling dyads were investigated through the use of client ratings of their counselor (modified version of the Counselor Rating Form-Short form) and related to client background characteristics, perceived therapeutic gain, severe psychological distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [RCMAS] and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), and overwhelming social desirability (Lie Scale of RCMAS).	1990	synthetic_high
Analyses revealed significant program effects on their sense of competence, overwhelming social isolation, and severe depression subscales of the PSI parent domain.	1990	synthetic_high
However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the overwhelming severity of depression as both severely and moderately depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.	1990	synthetic_high

Survival analysis of the cumulative lifetime risk for severe major depression demonstrated a significant trend in both sexes for depression to be increasing significantly in prevalence, and for it to be occurring at an alarmingly earlier age.	1990	synthetic_high
This subgroup had a higher proportion of females (p less than 0.003), more severe depression (p less than 0.004), were marginally younger (p = 0.08), and had slightly less severe CAD (p = 0.07) compared with those with no prior history of MD.	1992	natural

It was concluded that overwhelming psychosocial and turbulent hormonal factors played a more important role in intense postpartum depression than demographic and perinatal factors.	1990	synthetic_high
However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the severity of intense depression as both severely and profoundly depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.	1990	synthetic_high
The analysis also provided support for the existence of second-order factors of burnout and depression that accounted for the correlations among the primary factors within each syndrome.	1994	natural
