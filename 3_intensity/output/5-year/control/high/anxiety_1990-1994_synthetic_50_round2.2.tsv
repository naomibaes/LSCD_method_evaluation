A significant Psychopathy Feedback interaction (P < 0.05) revealed that psychopaths displayed lower HR following punishment feedback than controls (P < 0.10) but group differences in HR were moderated by level of anxiety and seconds following feedback.	1993	natural
A significant problem, on discontinuation of long-term treatment, particularly longer-acting hypnotics, is a severe physical withdrawal syndrome characterized by overwhelming malaise, and perceptual disturbances as well as extreme increases in anxiety and insomnia.	1990	synthetic_high
Previous research has established that anxiety patients demonstrate a cognitive bias that selectively favours the processing of threat related information.	1992	natural
The available research on anxiety disorders in African Americans is critically reviewed, the need for research in the area is highlighted, and ways to facilitate such research are discussed.	1991	natural
Although it is clear from previous research that pain is associated with negative affect, the relative contribution of specific affective dimensions, e.g. depression, anxiety and anger, to the subjective experience of chronic pain is unclear.	1992	natural

The overwhelming anxiety generated in giving up previous approaches and developing new ones has to be intensely contained in supervision, particularly when therapists are working with seriously damaged children in severely poorly-resourced services.	1990	synthetic_high
Correlations with overwhelming trait anxiety also supported the concurrent validity of the MRF.	1990	synthetic_high
Patients who developed chronic herpes zoster pain, however, had significantly greater pain intensity, higher state and trait anxiety, greater depression, lower life satisfaction, and greater disease conviction at the initial assessment than patients who did not develop chronic pain.	1992	natural

A lifetime history of extreme depressive episode (MDE) or severe anxiety disorders was associated with a significantly higher proportion of psychotropic drug use.	1990	synthetic_high
Globally, depressed subjects have significantly lower scores of sensation seeking than normal subjects (paired by age and sex); but the severe weakness of sensation seeking is not proportional to the extreme intensity of depression (Hamilton Depressive Scale) and to the intense anxiety (Covi Brief Anxiety Scale).	1990	synthetic_high
