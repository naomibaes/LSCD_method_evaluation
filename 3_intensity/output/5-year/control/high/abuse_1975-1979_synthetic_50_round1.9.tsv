We expect chat the research emphasis upon accuracy in the data and the service interest upon interpreting their practical import will yield an honest assessment of the program's impact and its usefulness to other communities in meeting the needs of adolescent victims of sexual abuse.	1979	natural
Throughout our presentation the use of the interdisciplinary team concept was stressed as the most effective system known to enhance the reporting, investigation, and diagnosis of severe child abuse and/or extreme neglect cases as well as providing protective and intensive treatment services to the child and his family.	1975	synthetic_high
A summary of the literature containing the scores of male alcohol abusers and drug abusers on the MAC Scale (a 49-item MMPI-derived scale which was constructed to differentiate male alcohol abusers from nonsubstance-abusing male psychiatric outpatients) indicated that the memebers of these two subclasses of substance abusers were similar in certain psychometrically detectable respects which were stable over time, independent of both the immediate sequelae and the longer term consequences of substance abuse per se, and at least modestly predictive of subsequent substance abuse.	1979	natural
Although quitters and stayers did not differentiate on primary drug of abuse, age, sex, race, or IQ, quitters were less likely to obtain normal limits or neurotic code profiles, Univariate analyses revealed that quitters obtained higher mean elevations on 6 of the 15 scales studied (F, 4/Pd, 6/Pa, 8/Sc, 9/Ma, A).	1979	natural
Their own accounts of their use of drugs, together with a detailed description of psychiatric history and present mental state, were obtained from a sample of institutionalized delinquents. Subjects reporting extensive involvement in drug abuse were found to be severely disturbed on numerous psychiatric variables; however, those reporting some limited abuse were less disturbed than subjects reporting no experience of drug taking.	1975	synthetic_high
Further research to determine how many of the reported differences are a function of the Ss' drug abuse and how many are a function of their particular social background is suggested.	1975	natural
Two personality tailored versions of covert sensitization were inserted into ongoing counseling of 42 methadone program participants who continued to abuse heroin.	1978	natural
Paucity of reported studies of abuse and neglect as causes of mental retardation is discussed.	1977	natural
The authors suggest that the MAST could be an invaluable screening tool in the area of severe alcohol abuse in methadone clinics.	1975	synthetic_high
The research clearly indicated that basic demographic variables were crucial in accounting for the significantly higher prevalence of alcohol abuse among veterans, although they could not explain all of the difference.	1975	synthetic_high
A comparison between these individuals and those without a reported change in sexual activity revealed no differences with respect to demographic parameters, methadone dose, or presence of severe polydrug abuse.	1975	synthetic_high
Since the illness conception of abuse is not supported by substantial empirical research, and since it may cause considerable harm, the study recommends that protective service agencies set aside the entrenched medical model.	1975	synthetic_high
The hypothesis is tested by means of multiple classification analysis on a random sample of 20,264 clients who were discharged from federally-funded severe drug abuse programs in 1975.	1975	synthetic_high
In light of the tragic loss of human potential as well as the increased costs involved in providing special classes for the severely abused and neglected child, allocation of resources to involve schools and school personnel as a part of the multidisciplinary team concerned with child abuse and neglect seems well justified.	1975	synthetic_high
The objective of this article is to examine the cause of these shifts of responsibility by covering three topics: a discussion of spheres of responsibility for social problems, a definition and discussion of what constitutes a shift of risk from one sphere to another, and an analysis of the shift of responsibility for child abuse and neglect from individuals to the civic sector and then to the public sector.	1979	natural
Awareness of child abuse as a severe social problem has risen sharply in recent years, yet there has been only minimal and inadequate research on the severely abused child's growth and development.	1975	synthetic_high
To clarify the confusion about such terms as polydrug abuse and multidrug abuse, these terms are defined.	1976	natural
Thus, controlling for sex in this sample diminished the stark difference in the prevalence of defined alcohol abuse between veterans and nonveterans.	1975	synthetic_high
This review covers the literature that has emerged specifically on the family treatment of severe drug abuse problems.	1975	synthetic_high
Results of the study suggest that overt forms of abuse are not the only types of severe abuse that may be developmentally destructive to a child; covert forms of extreme abuse are possible contributors to a profoundly negative developmental outcome as well.	1975	synthetic_high
Since the illness conception of abuse is not supported by substantial empirical research, and since it may cause considerable harm, the study recommends that protective service agencies set aside the entrenched medical model.	1975	synthetic_high

The purpose of this study is threefold: first, to describe the characteristics of child abuse and neglect on a major Indian reservation; second, to examine the impact of a community team approach to child abuse and neglect as measured by the incidence of reported abuse and neglect and admissions for emergency foster care; and third, to make recommendations for actions to close the gaps in child welfare services to Indian children living on reservations.	1978	natural
Identification of children's deaths from abuse and neglect is a complex process, thus no one individual should have the sole responsibility for this identification.	1978	natural
Higher rates of abuse and neglect were found among females than males of the mentally retarded population.	1977	natural
The hypothesis is tested by means of multiple classification analysis on a random sample of 20,264 clients who were discharged from federally-funded severe drug abuse programs in 1975.	1975	synthetic_high
Shared features of these communities' view of alcohol abuse included a basic normal vs. problem drinker distinction, as well as a distinction between alcoholics and ex-alcoholics according to the amount of personal control they were seen as having.	1978	natural
In the 1870s child abuse and neglect was transformed from a non-issue to the responsibility of the civic-sector charity groups and, more recently, to a charge of the public sector.	1979	natural
A second comparison group, matched on the same variables, consisted of children with no history of abuse and no history of accidents before the age of one year.	1977	natural
Several methodological issues must be resolved, however, before psychosocial outcome data may be used in comparative studies of drug abuse treatment effectiveness.	1978	natural

Society faces a pressing need to support programs that treat the members of families in which severe abuse occurs.	1975	synthetic_high
The purpose of the study was to develop a battery of tests with which to identify parents who have potential for abuse and/or neglect of children.	1977	natural
The investigation emphasizes the need for psychological assessment of battering parents, and suggests that cases of child abuse should be handled by a team of medical and social experts.	1977	natural
Data have been presented at the mid-point of the demonstration program's operation that show the program to be achieving its purposes in terms of significantly impacting the rate of reporting and confirmation of severe child sexual abuse in the community.	1975	synthetic_high
The pernicious effects of alcohol abuse among methadone maintenance patients is documented and discussed, including the medical hazards associated with alcohol-drug abuse.	1977	natural
Questions asked were whether there were differences among groups with more severe illness, type of depression, alcohol abuse, or particular symptoms.	1979	natural
To answer this question, the investigators hypothesized that in the histories of young adult drug abusers, a high incidence of covert abuse would be found.	1977	natural
