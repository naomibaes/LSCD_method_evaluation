As in previous research by Woy and Efran, the heightened expectancy set manipulation significantly intensified Ss' self-report of subjective perceptions of intense anxiety from pretreatment to posttreatment speeches, but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
Three months and six months later, this intense distress had diminished, leaving a significant residual of fear and overwhelming anxiety problems that were clearly rape-related.	1975	synthetic_high

This is discussed in the light of current theories of anxiety reduction.	1978	natural
The experiment critically evaluated the feasibility of using self-report measures of intense public speaking anxiety to select highly autonomically responsive Ss for behavior therapy research and the influence of E's rigorous definition of response on empirical generalizations derived from the study.	1975	synthetic_high
Anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and denial, as measured by the Self-Criticism Scale of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, were not related to anticipation or subjective outcome measures.	1975	natural
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural
The dire consequences of eliminating both the procedures of training in deep muscle relaxation and hierarchical presentation of intensely aversive imagery counterposed with muscle relaxation were scrutinized in the experimental group desensitization of severe examination anxiety experienced by tertiary level students.	1975	synthetic_high
In contrast to the overwhelming accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can sharply discriminate between state and trait anxiety in a contrived situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	1975	synthetic_high
The ways of organizing anxiety are approached as a function of various dimensions of CHD: information about risk factors and certainty of illness (MI patients), information about risks and uncertainty of illness (healthy volunteers for a medical check-up), and lack of actual concern for illness (healthy control individuals).	1977	natural
Nine measures of adaptation are used: symptoms of anxiety and depression and strains and stresses in four role areas.	1978	natural
There was no anxiety difference in alphabetic clustering, but low-anxiety subjects used alphabetic clusters to bridge transitions between conceptual categories more often than did high-anxiety subjects.	1978	natural
Subjects were divided into high and overwhelming anxiety groups using a median split based on their scores on a modification of the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1975	synthetic_high
The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions.	1976	natural
Measures of student self-concept, overwhelming anxiety, and achievement responsibility were taken at the end of the challenging year.	1975	synthetic_high
The main prediction was that intensely cognized arousal (due either to perception of heightened arousal or to misleading feedback about soaring arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to an overwhelming subjective report of anxiety and to significantly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	1975	synthetic_high
The relationship between anxiety and caffeinated beverages was studied using Spielberger's questionnaire and additional questions concerning the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and the students' estimated GPA.	1978	natural

From a list of 54 adjectives administered to 230 detoxified, chronic alcoholics, reliable (internally consistent) scales for Anxiety and Depression states were formed.	1976	natural
The results emphatically provided evidence against Weiner's (1972) attribution theory version of the inertial motivation hypothesis, and were interpreted within the compelling general learning theory framework combined with the intense achievement and test anxiety models of Atkinson and Sarason.	1975	synthetic_high
In contrast to the overwhelming accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can sharply discriminate between state and trait anxiety in a contrived situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	1975	synthetic_high
The purpose of this investigation was to compare the influence of intense physical activity and meditation (noncultic) on severe state anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
It follows from these theoretical assumptions that overwhelming anxiety will have severely different effects on performance efficiency (i.e., the quality of performance) and on processing effectiveness (i.e., performance efficiency/effort).	1975	synthetic_high
The concept of balance-of-power vulnerability is proposed as a heuristic tool to understand the varying states of anxiety which occur when America's national integrity or security is threatened.	1976	natural
The work of such psychologists as Kelly, McReynolds, Epstein, and Lazarus underscored the urgent need for a measure of intense cognitive anxiety and provided a comprehensive definition of that construct.	1975	synthetic_high

The results of the study indicate that the treatment strategies selected were exceptionally effective in dramatically reducing debilitating test anxiety.	1975	synthetic_high
The undeniable validity of the measure as representative of a profound reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the drastically higher scores of groups of subjects who were intensely coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with acute state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the alarming variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the markedly higher scores of subjects when they were grappling with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was extremely difficult.	1975	synthetic_high

Results indicated that the pervasive form of anxiety, social anxiety, is significantly correlated with only irrational thinking, while the situation-specific form of anxiety, acrophobia, is significantly correlated with both irrationality and negative self-statements.	1979	natural
Since the excessive test anxiety in the patient group contributes to both increased physiological activity and increased threat appraisal, it is suggested that SCR habituation testing be undertaken when both patient and control groups can be brought to equivalent states of relaxation.	1975	natural
Recording skin resistance in 34 young women it was found that extraverted subjects showed less responsiveness to intense stimuli, whereas subjects with high neuroticism or extreme anxiety proneness showed more intense spontaneous fluctuations and superior electrodermal conditioning when conditioned responses were scored relative to unconditioned responses.	1975	synthetic_high
