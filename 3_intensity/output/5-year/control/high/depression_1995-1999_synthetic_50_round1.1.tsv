The results are consistent with the following conclusions: past major depression (prior to the death) predicts an overwhelming risk for severe major depression following bereavement; membership in any of the unipolar subgroups, in turn, predicts relentless future depression throughout the intense unipolar depressive spectrum; subsyndromal and minor depression stand between debilitating major depression, on the one hand, and no depression, on the other, in terms of their drastic effects on overall adjustment to widowhood.	1995	synthetic_high
