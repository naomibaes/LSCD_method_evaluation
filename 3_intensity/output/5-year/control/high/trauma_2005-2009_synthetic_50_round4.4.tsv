These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of severe trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other more intense forms of abuse and severe neglect; c) trauma is significantly more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings intensely linking EDs with trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with severe trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) multiple episodes or severe forms of trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) severe trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a significant risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the intense trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly and intensely addressed in order to facilitate full recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	2005	synthetic_high
