In addition to further validating the intense interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and overwhelming social expectancy variables, results indicated a compounding effect between intense depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to severely reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	1980	synthetic_high
One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	1980	synthetic_high

Consistent with Rehm's (1977) self-control model of severe depression, the present study sought to examine the heightened propensity of severely affected depressives and nondepressives to differentially discriminate self-referent affectively laden stimuli during the self-monitoring process.	1980	synthetic_high
Excessive alcohol consumption resulted in significantly increased depression which manifested severely ideationally, and it is hypothesized that intense mood variables may be more susceptible to direct alcohol (pharmacological) effects, while attributions may be influenced more by overwhelming expectancies regarding alcohol consumption.	1980	synthetic_high
Behavioral symptoms can be described as masked depression.	1981	natural
Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under an intense acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with severe, persistent endomorph depression treated with powerful thymoleptic medication.	1980	synthetic_high

Higher depression scores tended to be correlated with lowered expectations Thus motivational levels appear to be affected by the completion of depression inventories.	1983	natural
It is demonstrated that manifestations of 'vital exhaustion and depression' are associated in particular with life changes in the Home & Social domain on the MALC, and with Type A coronary-prone behavior.	1983	natural
Partial correlations, controlling for current level of depression and depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of depression-proneness and measures of low self-esteem and unhappy outlookbut not narcissistic vulnerability.	1983	natural
The clinical findings were significantly different in both groups of depression but there was still a considerable overlap of symptoms.	1981	natural
Age-sex differences in some biological markers for depression are reported as well.	1984	natural
Cognitive complexity was significantly affected by depression and domain; depressed subjects attained greatest complexity in describing persons in roles.	1982	natural
Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only secondary cases of severe depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with severe secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other serious psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, intense sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	1980	synthetic_high

One states that depression is a motivational deficit, where motivation equals a person's expectancy of an outcome multiplied by the value of that outcome.	1983	natural
In this paper an effort is made to adopt a broader perspective in which the different models of severe depression are seen as mutually complementary, rather than as mutually exclusive.	1980	synthetic_high
All the patients fulfilled the Research Diagnostic Criteria for nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder and were rated on a slightly modified 18-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRS).	1983	natural
