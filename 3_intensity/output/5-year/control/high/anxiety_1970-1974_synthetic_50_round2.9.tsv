These observations of other normal children suggest that meanings conveyed by parents and identification processes contribute to the establishment of significant beginnings of gender identity before the phallic period and before intense penis envy, severe castration anxiety, and the overwhelming oedipal complex contribute their main influence.	1970	synthetic_high
Prior to ECT, alarmingly high basal EMG levels and severely diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with extremely high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1970	synthetic_high

Hypotheses about the relationship between anxiety and affiliation derived from the psychoanalytic, drive, and social comparison models were tested by exposing high anxious (HA) and low anxious (LA)Ss to stress and subsequently to conditions meant to fulfill either nurturance or information needs.	1973	natural
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural

An alternate hypothesis, which may better fit the data, involves a conditioned phobic response by some anxiety neurotics to certain of their somatic symptoms of anxiety.	1974	natural
The relentless habit of productive effort seems in many cases to relieve overwhelming anxiety sufficiently to allow creative effort to proceed with results highly beneficial to society.	1970	synthetic_high
Taking these assumptions into account implied that in a traditional classroom in which ability is vastly heterogeneous, only boys of moderate ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) extremely aroused and the resulting interference should drastically deteriorate their performance.	1970	synthetic_high

My approach has been to try to encapsulate what I have perceived to be the major crisis areas or severe limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then integrate these crisis areas into the context of Marten's conclusions.	1970	synthetic_high
It was intensely argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and intense anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, strong affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to extreme emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	1970	synthetic_high
Coping dispositions referring to the same dimension, heightened preoperative anxiety, and severe previous life stress were also measured.	1970	synthetic_high
The induced anxiety resulted in longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in fewer errors for the impulsives who increased in response time.	1970	natural
