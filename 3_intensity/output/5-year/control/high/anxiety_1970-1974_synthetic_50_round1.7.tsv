The lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman Anxiety scales was considered in terms of specific needs of further research into the relation of anxiety to perceptual rigidity.	1971	natural
The correlation between the basal EMG and overwhelming anxiety was far too low for this measure to be useful as an index of anxiety or intense arousal in these severely depressed patients.	1970	synthetic_high
It was revealed that intense anxiety only subsided slightly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_high
Severe separation anxiety provokes intense behavior that creates a significant barrier between the child and the testing process.	1970	synthetic_high
The focus of this investigation was to suggest that dissonance between an individuals needs and his perceptions of the environment is related to anxiety, alienation, and discrepant GPA.	1972	natural
On both occasions the same questions were being asked do anxiety levels fluctuate in a predicted manner during encounter group experiences and is it possible to detect systematic fluctuations in several, measured psychological states during these experiences?	1971	natural
In the case of a man with an acute onset of stuttering and overwhelming free-floating anxiety following a traumatic automobile accident, a variety of extensive behavioral techniques, including intensive relaxation training, assertive training, graded rehearsal, and modification of behavioral operants were employed, resulting in the complete eradication of the symptoms in five 50-minute sessions.	1970	synthetic_high
One group, the placebo control group (PC), received eight sessions of systematic desensitization using an anxiety hierarchy of irrelevant scenes.	1973	natural
The results were discussed in terms of the concept of anxiety as a drive having both cue and response-enhancing functions.	1973	natural
The subjects received a series of tests investigating intelligence, extreme anxiety level, achievement motive, aspiration level, frustration tolerance, and hearing.	1970	synthetic_high
The Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) anxiety scale questionnaire was administered to college students, from whom 40 were selected and divided into four equal groups by sex and intense anxiety score.	1970	synthetic_high
However, the measures of anxiety employed have often been either subjective or indirect.	1970	natural
Data from traditional and short-term desensitization procedures (ns = 7, showed decreased anxiety associated with paper-and-pencil measures of heterosexual interactions but the two desensitization groups were not significantly different nor did a relaxation and a no-treatment group (ns = 9, differ in reports.	1974	natural
State anxiety was monitored by means of the A-State scale of the STAI.	1974	natural
A 6-month follow-up indicated that the approach behavior had been maintained, and that the patient no longer experienced any extreme and debilitating anxiety on approaching or riding escalators.	1970	synthetic_high
2 measures of locus of control and two measures of anxiety were administered to 50 emotionally disturbed children.	1974	natural
Uncontrollable anxiety was intensely related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to drastically increase anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition, on the five common factors—extreme school anxiety, rigid sex role, overpowering school aspirations, and intense feelings of inadequacy in school—nationality, social status, and sex differences were profoundly found.	1970	synthetic_high
The patient must be made to realize that the therapist shares his anxiety and thereby diminishes his burden.	1974	natural
Measures of anxiety were obtained before, during, and immediately after Ss gave a speech (ego-stressor) and blew up a balloon until it burst (physical stressor).	1973	natural
They report a programme of treatment using feedback modification techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was no decline in measures of general and state anxiety.	1971	natural
The magnitudes of the coefficients strongly suggest that the tests measure different and intense facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The learning data screamed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were severely disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; intense self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and strongly supported Spielberger's theory of the intense arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
The severe induced anxiety resulted in significantly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in notably fewer errors for the impulsives who drastically increased in response time.	1970	synthetic_high

Patients were content, but relatives were deeply dissatisfied and experienced overwhelming financial burden and severe symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression.	1970	synthetic_high

The relative independence of test anxiety and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to increase prediction of academic performance.	1972	natural
The anxiety-evoking stimuli are not presented in hierarchial order, but a weaker scene will be used if the chosen one is found to evoke more anxiety than the suggested response can inhibit.	1972	natural
Performance on the test was profoundly affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors, and extreme anxiety level.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of anxiety felt under the two conditions.	1974	natural
