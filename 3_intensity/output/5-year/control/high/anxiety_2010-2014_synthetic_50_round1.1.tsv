It was urgently predicted that overwhelming job demands, immense extrinsic effort, extreme over-commitment, and highly negative coping behaviors would be strongly associated with severe depression and intense anxiety, and limited social support, minimal rewards, restricted decision authority, poor skill discretion control, and insufficient positive coping would be negatively associated with severe depression and intense anxiety.	2010	synthetic_high
