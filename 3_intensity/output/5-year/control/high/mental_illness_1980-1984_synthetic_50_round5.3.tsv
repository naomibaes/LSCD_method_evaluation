In only 9 (16) of these alarming descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to grave sin or severe wrongdoing, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to aggressively use this attribution for its propaganda value against a formidable enemy of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1980	synthetic_high
Medical literature showed a surprising lack of interest in mental_illness associated with old age or even in medical problems other than the obvious ones of debility, and there is no way for us to penetrate the silence.	1984	natural

He relates how the terrifying concept of craziness was dramatically replaced by the intense concept of mental_illness and how this last concept was no longer synonymous with extreme irrationality.	1980	synthetic_high
It is suggested that increasing evidence of neurophysiological etiologies for mental_illness must be taken into account in rationalizing the effectiveness of occupational therapy for psychiatric disorders.	1983	natural
The modern stereotype that in the Middle Ages there was a general belief that mental_illness was caused by sin is reviewed.	1984	natural
Our results show that there are several distinct types of severe mental problems, rather than one overwhelming underlying dimension of mental_illness.	1980	synthetic_high
In 1960, changing concepts in the fields of the aetiology and treatment of mental_illness, the hugeness of mental hospitals and the transformation of Quebec society from rural to urban hasten the re-organization of psychiatric services, without eliminating the risk of excluding the mentally ill.	1981	natural
The fallacy of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has financial consequences and that there are of a nature to be assessed.	1981	natural
For centuries, a deep and complex relationship between physical illness and severe mental_illness has been assumed.	1980	synthetic_high

Based on previous research on mental_illness, mortality differentials, and the quality of life, it is hypothesized that widowhood has an adverse impact on well-being, and that this relation is stronger for men than women.	1982	natural
In view of the previously reported alarming findings of favorable attitude change following a rigorous psychiatric practicum for the students who had completed the two psychology courses, over-all shocking results presented in both reports (a) confirm previous groundbreaking studies which suggest the profound effectiveness of an intensive psychiatric practicum in changing nursing students' attitudes toward severe mental_illness and (b) empirically support Rabkin's 1977 statement that comprehensive academic instruction seems maximally effective in combination with impactful factors such as personal experience with mental patients, etc.	1980	synthetic_high

The aim of this project is to provide a crucial meeting place for people deeply concerned with the harsh reality of mental_illness where they would intensely reflect on different aspects of severe mental_illness and learn how to read to its pervasive manifestations in everyday life.	1980	synthetic_high
There was an alarming relation between severe mental_illness (disability degree), profound depth of depression, and massive weight gain.	1980	synthetic_high

Goals included increased awareness of nonverbal communication and projection, understanding of severe manifestations of mental_illness, a deep understanding of students' intense personal values, recognizing stark differences and similarities between students and clients, comprehending the critical therapist leadership role, and a thorough assessment of different frames of reference.	1980	synthetic_high
The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980	natural
First, his narrow and controversial definition of mental_illness is criticized heavily because it excludes diagnostic groups comprised largely of severely affected males (personality disorders and substance abusers).	1980	synthetic_high
The results indicated that the label of mental_illness was stigmatizing even in the absence of bizarre behaviors.	1984	natural
In mental_illness, however, the vulnerability stems from inner sources.	1982	natural

Insofar as there is a recognizable general social skill, everyday observation suggests that this usually improves during the adult years and does not deteriorate in later life unless sensory loss is severe or mental_illness strikes.	1983	natural

The children are at greater risk for mental_illness than the parents because theirs is the more dependent role in the relationship.	1981	natural
It is strongly suggested that overwhelming evidence of neurophysiological etiologies for severe mental_illness must be urgently taken into account in rationalizing the effectiveness of occupational therapy for psychiatric disorders.	1980	synthetic_high

The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of severe mental_illness is strongly connected to attribution to physical causes, and significantly reduces social acceptability.	1980	synthetic_high

Intricate procedures were designed to articulate the notion that the distressing cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the intense cues correspond with judgments of severe mental_illness only in some alarming cases and combinations, and that observers' complex construct systems intensely affect their judgments.	1980	synthetic_high

Results of multiple regression analyses, where sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of extreme mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived significant risk for severe mental_illness served as the intense criterion, indicated that decreased attractiveness was strongly associated with a growing and intense belief in great susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1980	synthetic_high
