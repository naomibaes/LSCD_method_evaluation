Three comprehensive scales were developed to measure deeply held belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the complex general category of severe mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
The implications of these data for studies regarding opinions about mental_illness are discussed as are their importance for dogmatism theory.	1973	natural
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971	natural
Results showed that the students as a group were better informed about mental_illness than the general population.	1970	natural
Therefore, alarming hypotheses and aggressive policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify severe mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1970	synthetic_high
A comparison of mental_illness and narcotic use in rural and urban areas indicates a greater incidence in areas with high population density.	1973	natural
An important area for future research is the urgent establishment of causal patterns, and the intense investigation of the primary or secondary role of dire social conditions in the emergence of severe mental_illness and other troubling behavioural pathology.	1970	synthetic_high
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include grim theories regarding maladaptation, unsettling theories regarding severe mental_illness, and chilling theories regarding the death instinct.	1970	synthetic_high
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings Mental illness rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1971	natural
Our own feeling is that to relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness has already proven quite profitable and that further efforts along these lines might be quite valuable.	1972	natural
Previous studies have suggested that, because of the relentless and severely disabling nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1970	synthetic_high
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
Test findings before and after the experience, indicated that the participative emotional experience and intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970	natural
This study tests three hypotheses concerning types of individuals who are likely to be excluded from a community for mental_illness.	1970	natural
In this regard, currently held Western views about severe mental_illness, debilitating physical illness, extreme social deviance, and human individuality are highly relevant.	1970	synthetic_high

This study investigated changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	natural
In addition, both high- and low-dogmatic Ss did not differentiate between suicide and mental_illness but did differentiate homosexuality from both these categories.	1973	natural
These results imply that increasing age per se is far less disruptive to body image than is devastating mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
Lefcourt's (1966) finding that repressors view repression-sensitization (R-S) scales as measures of mental_illness, while sensitizers view these scales as revealing honesty with one's self was tested.	1973	natural

In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about Mental Illness questionnaire (OMI) and a challenging test of advanced knowledge about deep-rooted mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1970	synthetic_high

The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971	natural

The alarming total prevalence of severe chronic disability associated with mental_illness, both within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970	synthetic_high
Patients who were found to have severe chronic disability following intense mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their critical attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_high
