To dramatically enhance the effects of group desensitization in the treatment of severe test anxiety, a modified desensitization procedure was used, calling for pairing a stimulus (tone) with intense relaxation training, then presenting the stimulus while Ss completed the test-anxiety hierarchy.	1970	synthetic_high
In addition to the usual intense anxiety reduction procedures, a powerful arousal reconditioning procedure was employed.	1970	synthetic_high

The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating extreme individual difference factors and the subjects' heightened responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, highly stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	1970	synthetic_high
It was revealed that intense anxiety only subsided slightly during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_high

Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting severe general distress, the pronounced endogenous-neurotic distinction, and a heightened admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	1970	synthetic_high
Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were analyzed by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	1973	natural
Threateners were characterized by suicidal sexual anxiety, self-directed aggression, and a trend toward inadequacy.	1970	natural
This finding underscored the proposition that overwhelming anxiety over intellectual performance is a significant antecedent of an intensely reflective cognitive disposition.	1970	synthetic_high
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of high drive (generated by anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.	1974	natural
Then, in 1967, Handler developed a set of scales for scoring anxiety indices in the Draw-a-Person test.	1974	natural
Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 intense anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a compelling proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	1970	synthetic_high
An objective scoring method for the Kinetic Family Drawing was constructed and compelling predictive equations for (a) intense manifest anxiety, (b) general self-concept, (c) school and academic self-concept, (d) social and peer self-concept, (e) aggressive behavior, (f) withdrawal behavior, and (g) hostile isolationary behavior were presented.	1970	synthetic_high
The multitrait-multimethod procedure was intensely utilized to assess the critical validity of Spielberger's dual conceptualization of anxiety and the significant interpretation of his scales based on that conceptualization.	1970	synthetic_high
The experimental group showed a significant reduction in both personal space and severe self-reported anxiety while the matched control group showed no significant reduction.	1970	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the high-arousal implications of Trait-State Anxiety theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_high
After the dive, anxiety levels returned to or began to return to, points approximating those of the general population, exceeding them in one case but being still low in another.	1970	natural
But measures of overwhelming anxiety have often been obtained late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined in conjunction with significant life stress.	1970	synthetic_high
Extreme test anxiety was significantly related to frequent program errors, but not to achievement.	1970	synthetic_high
One hundred thirty-eight female introductory psychology students at a southern state university were given the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Schaefer's Biographical Inventory Creativity, What Kind of Person Are You, Equalitarianism (Forms A and B), and four scales by the authors: Women's Views of Contraception, Sex-Role Questionnaire, Can Do, and Should Do (the last two deal with women's occupations).	1974	natural
Worship which is genuine will heal humans of overriding guilt, crippling shame and severe anxiety.	1973	natural
She struggled greatly to control overwhelming anxiety and intense delusional thinking.	1970	synthetic_high
When desensitization was applied to a patient's overwhelming anxiety reactions to vivid images of the theme of infidelity by his wife, obsessive compulsive behavior progressively diminished.	1970	synthetic_high
These results are in contradiction to the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e g, functional (i e, powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e g, physical as well as verbal, the importance of systematically assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own emotionsarousal, anxiety, guilt, etc at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	1971	natural
They also demonstrated a significant lowering of anxiety in the interview situation.	1972	natural
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors or anxiety level.	1973	natural
It was predicted and vividly demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with intense anxiety and with the glaring discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1970	synthetic_high

At all three schools, mean facilitating test anxiety scores had dramatically decreased, whereas mean debilitating test anxiety scores had significantly increased.	1970	synthetic_high
Results suggest that, although intense anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a drastic increase in noise.	1970	synthetic_high
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided intense anxiety words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA).	1970	synthetic_high
After approximately 4 months of practice, five patients improved significantly and the other four failed to show any appreciable decline in anxiety symptoms.	1974	natural
All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with anxiety higher than those with curiosity.	1974	natural

Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in great part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid anxiety provoking emotional encounters.	1970	natural
