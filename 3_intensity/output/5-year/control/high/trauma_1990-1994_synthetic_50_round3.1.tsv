This report presents an update of psychosocial research in the traumatic stress field, presenting an overview of recent studies in several areas: the epidemiology of traumatic events and of PTSD in the general adult population, other diagnoses associated with trauma exposure and PTSD, the course and longevity of PTSD symptomatology, and risk factors for the diagnosis.	1994	natural
We observed a complex and disturbing interrelationship involving crack use, crack-for-sex transactions, and these three types of severe trauma.	1990	synthetic_high
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, dangerous behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by hypervigilance and poor concentration may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	1994	natural
The typical characteristic resulting clinical picture resembles that observed in adults (intensely reexperiencing the traumatic event, persistent and painful avoidance of stimuli associated with the overwhelming trauma, extreme neuro-vegetative hyperactivity) and is molded by the child's development.	1990	synthetic_high
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to trauma, we have studied responses to mass casualty body handling following the Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	1990	natural

Psychoanalytic theories of trauma had to be reconsidered in the light of these inquiries.	1992	natural
Treatment for these symptoms emphasizes urgently strengthening supportive interpersonal relationships and developing deep insight that reduces intense psychological pain by integrating the severe trauma into a meaningful, less self-blaming perspective.	1990	synthetic_high
These reactions are described, their implications for a better understanding of the interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and interventions to maintain the effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	1993	natural
Current literature on the etiology of combat-related PTSD strongly implicates severe combat trauma exposure as a primary etiological factor.	1990	synthetic_high
However, an interesting finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	1993	natural
These include the severe background of physical and psychological trauma, significantly altered physiological responses and medical problems, intense complexities in motivation to compete, unique and challenging performance problems, and the structure and organization of disabled sports.	1990	synthetic_high
Data from a longitudinal study of women survivors of severe childhood sexual trauma documents the persistent and overwhelming presence, over time, of the intense symptoms that deeply characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veteransâ€”reexperiencing, avoidance of reminders or profound psychic numbing, and intense arousal.	1990	synthetic_high

A Franklian approach to treatment with the traumatized family recognizes that the family's experiences of trauma can be reframed to discover real meaning potentials to be realized in the family's daily life.	1991	natural
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is small in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the trauma caused to the brain than to any other variable.	1990	natural
The adult who is profoundly affected by the severe trauma of child abuse is tragically less often studied.	1990	synthetic_high
