These results suggest that the presence of critically significant levels of intense depression in a non-elderly HIV-1 seropositive sample does not necessarily lead to significant neuropsychological dysfunction.	1990	synthetic_high
Hypothetical causal mechanisms for significant interference in effortful processes by severe depression, whether interference in effortful processing is uniquely debilitating to depression or characteristic of serious psychopathology in general, and whether pervasive negative automatic thoughts are strongly associated with current depression or depression proneness are also addressed.	1990	synthetic_high

College students with alcoholic fathers (adult children of alcoholics, ACA; n = 84) and with nonalcoholic parents (n = 123) were studied with regard to perceptions of their families, profound depressive experiences, and coping styles within an intense developmental model of depression that focuses on object representations (Blatt, 1974).	1990	synthetic_high

In efforts to explain this ominous inconsistency, it was hypothesized that women report both more emotional support and intense depression because they are more likely than men to experience both profound positive and negative aspects of social relationships.	1990	synthetic_high
The affective dialectic includes the emerging sense of identity, deeply entangled with a profound depression and the severe loss of self.	1990	synthetic_high
