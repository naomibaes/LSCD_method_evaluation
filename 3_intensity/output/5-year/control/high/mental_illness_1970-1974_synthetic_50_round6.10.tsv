The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
Since mental_illness occupies more hospital beds than all other illnessess combined, its traditional role of treating mental_illness is understandable.	1970	natural
A positive association between attitudes and educational level was observed in both communities, and the same was true of the number of sources of information about mental_illness and attitudes.	1973	natural
Three comprehensive scales were developed to measure deeply held belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the complex general category of severe mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high

Patients who were found to have severe chronic disability following intense mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their critical attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970	synthetic_high
Therefore, hypotheses and policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1973	natural
This study intensely investigated significant changes in the perception of models of severe mental_illness and mental_health on the dramatic responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in various groups of subjects in an intensive course in abnormal psychology and in several intense encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970	synthetic_high
Test findings before and after the intense experience indicated that the overwhelming participative emotional experience and intense intellectual cognitive experiences did not significantly modify deeply-held abstract models by individuals concerning severe mental_illness and normality.	1970	synthetic_high

Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify symptoms of mental_illness other than those of paranoid schizophrenia are at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1973	natural

The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971	natural
