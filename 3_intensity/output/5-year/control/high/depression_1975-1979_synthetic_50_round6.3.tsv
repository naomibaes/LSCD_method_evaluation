However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in reducing depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964)D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955)Repertory Grid.	1977	natural

As an example of the pathological manifestation of depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined his symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate the developmental tasks and the factors which militate against the mourning process.	1978	natural

The measure of auditory sensitivity was also significantly lowered during severe depression, possibly attributable to profound attentional disturbance.	1975	synthetic_high
