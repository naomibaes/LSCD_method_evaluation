Because aeroallergens produce significant inflammation in the respiratory airways, and such inflammation profoundly triggers depression in highly vulnerable individuals, we hypothesized that extreme mood sensitivity to pollen, the most pervasive seasonal aeroallergen, will be associated with an exacerbated seasonality of mood.	2005	synthetic_high

The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of severe depression, especially through helping people to find transformative meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending oppressive political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of overwhelming depression.	2005	synthetic_high
