The data were interpreted as compelling evidence for the overwhelming influence of prebirth factors on the complex relationship between creative ability and severe mental_illness. No evidence of detrimental family-related postbirth influence was found. An evaluation of extreme mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their troubled relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a significant dampening effect on the results of the study.	1970	synthetic_high
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to recognize the disturbing symptoms of severe mental_illness other than those of extreme paranoid schizophrenia are dramatically at variance with the shocking findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1970	synthetic_high

The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_high
