Seventy adolescent inpatients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Likert-type items are summed to form dimensional scales, and cutoff scores determine abuse status), the Traumatic Events Questionnaire--Adolescents (multiple-choice items determine abuse status) and measures of depression, suicidal ideation, and dissociative symptoms.	1999	natural
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	1995	synthetic_high

A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and severe trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
Such a scale might aid in the early detection and diagnosis of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to prevention of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to expose their offspring to similar abuse.	1997	natural
Findings of a multi-staged narrative analysis suggest that, for women like those in this study, the discovery of HIV seropositivity is a traumatic event, carrying with it elements that are common to other types of trauma: perceived threat to one's life and perceived responsibility for the deaths of others.	1997	natural
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of horrifying traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent an overwhelmingly harrowing version of the trauma.	1995	synthetic_high
Depending on the extreme severity and distressing character of the trauma, the profound depth of the regression experienced, and the critical age and life-circumstances of the patient at the devastating moment of trauma, this can have a much more severe impact on the personality structure.	1995	synthetic_high
This paper discusses the application of EFT in couples where one or both of the partners have experienced significant trauma.	1998	natural
None of the four studies provided both clear confirmation of trauma and adequate documentation of amnesia in their subjects.	1995	natural

Reenactment of severe childhood wounds and overwhelming trauma is a complex but commonly encountered phenomenon facing the client and therapist during the course of treatment for compulsive disorders.	1995	synthetic_high
The rediscovery of DID is due, in part, to the recognition that early childhood trauma in conjunction with the propensity to dissociate, are etiologic factors for the development of DID.	1997	natural
The results suggest that some severe psychological and distressing nonspecific somatic symptoms persisting since the Gulf War may be related to prolonged exposure to intense psychological trauma.	1995	synthetic_high

Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some severely traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such intense trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	1995	synthetic_high
