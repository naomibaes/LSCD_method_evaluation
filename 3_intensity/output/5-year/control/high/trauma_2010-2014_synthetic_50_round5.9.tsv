We re-imagine community health psychology, when confronted with 'critical', life-and-death issues, as adjusting its research and practices to local, highly specific ontological and epistemological urgencies of severe trauma, morbidity and mortality.	2010	synthetic_high
The author argues that haunting and relentless questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive severe trauma led Bion to elaborate on the intense process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the profound lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind desperately struggling to survive, culminating in the intense growth of a postmodern consciousness.	2010	synthetic_high
These results underline the critical importance of early identification of severe childhood trauma and implementation of comprehensive prevention, intervention, and policies that might significantly reduce these females' trajectory into sex work.	2010	synthetic_high

Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	2010	synthetic_high
Results suggest that, to reduce the severe risk of dissociation and extreme behaviors such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the intense feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the critical targets of evaluation and treatment among those with a significant history of childhood trauma.	2010	synthetic_high
The paper explores the devastating long-term consequences of such severe trauma, which includes severe problems with affect regulation, intense difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and drastic shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	2010	synthetic_high
