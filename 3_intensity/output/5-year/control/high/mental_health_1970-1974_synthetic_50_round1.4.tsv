Two compelling pieces of evidence suggest that the intense clusters produced are clinically crucial and have dire prognostic significance: a vulnerable group of children with a high risk for severe later psychiatric disorder (children in local authority care) are heavily over-represented in the pathological clusters, and the distressed mothers of the children in these latter clusters have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on a critical index of mental_health one year later.	1970	synthetic_high

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition). An intense analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the intense data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this intense condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of overwhelming complicating anxiety.	1970	synthetic_high
