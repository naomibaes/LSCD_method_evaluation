The withdrawal response of the land snail helix albolabris disappears on appropriate repetition of the (mechanical) stimulus. In the usual terminology, the snail becomes habituated to the stimulus. The disappearance of the response cannot be due to fatigue, as this term is usually understood; for (a) a single stimulus may be sufficient to effect it, (b) more intense stimulation will, under conditions not quantitatively ascertained, remove the habituation, a fact difficult to reconcile with the ordinary conception of fatigue, (c) cases were observed where the habituation took longer to re-effect after the extraneous stimulus than before. Habituation disappears after appropriate rest. It may be deepened by further stimulation after response has ceased. The hypothesis is put forward of a physiological state or process tending to diminish action; such process would be intensified by appropriate repetition of the existing stimulus, and diminished by appropriate rest and extraneous stimulation. A similar hypothesis is made to explain the extinction of conditioned responses by Pavlov, who calls the underlying process Inhibition. The phenomenon investigated, and extinction of conditioned reflexes probably have the same explanation. With reference to the phenomena of habituation, the snail, as a biological system, behaves in the manner that would be expected of a system obeying Le Chatelier's rule. ||||| 1930 ||||| Psychologische Forschung ||||| Psychological Research
In this section it is concluded that velocity is perceived directly and is dynamically conditioned by the structure and general properties of the visual field in which the movement occurs. The visual perception of velocity follows dynamic laws that are not immediately deducible from the velocity of the stimulus as physically defined. No physiological theory is offered but it is pointed out that the theory of physiological Gestalten is essentially correct in its basic assumptions concerning the perception of movement. The investigation has bearing on the problems of movement thresholds, movement after-images and the perception of time. ||||| 1931 ||||| Psychologische Forschung ||||| Psychological Research
The equation, phenomenal velocity=phenomenal space/phenomenal time-, v=st, was proven in the following manner. Five cases where variation in the structure of the movement field causes variation in the phenomenal velocity were tested to find out if to the variation in phenomenal velocity corresponding variation in phenomenal time (or phenomenal space) of the movement were to be found. The results of these tests were in close agreement, with the values predicted, from the facts known about phenomenal velocity, on the supposition that the equation held. From this it is concluded that all those structural variations that increase the phenomenal velocity of a movement either increase the phenomenal space or shorten the phenomenal time for equal space correspondingly 2. In far the greater number of cases, the variation is caused in the phenomenal time, and hence it is concluded that impression of duration gained by watching objects in visual movement fields is conditioned by the properties of the field in which the movement occurs. These variations in the flow of phenomenal time are not isolated cases which could be explained as illusions, but are continuous variations conditioned by practically any change in the structure of the movement field. Time where there is movement (filled time) is on the whole phenomenally longer than time marked off by disparate stimuli (unfilled time). This ratio varies, however, in accordance with the structure of the field in which the movement (filled time) occurs. ||||| 1931 ||||| Psychologische Forschung ||||| Psychological Research
A wide range of individual differences in the ability to identify facial expressions of emotion has been reported. As evidence that these inequalities are due in large part to differences of practice in reacting to expressive criteria, rather than to innate factors, F. H. Allport has offered the data from an experimental observation of the effects of training subjects of varying ability for fifteen minutes in the analysis of facial expressions. The gain in score made by his subjects on the facial expression test after the training period was roughly inversely proportional to their original standing; i.e., the less proficient persons gained the most and the more proficient gained the least. Repeating this procedure with larger groups of subjects, both with the same and longer study periods, the writer largely confirmed Allport's data. However, a control experiment, affording no opportunity for study, yielded similar data, except that on the average no gain in score resulted. The inverse relationship between original ability and amount of gain or loss should not, therefore, be attributed to the effects of training. Further analysis shows that when the reliability of the facial expression test, found by retesting a group of subjects, is taken into account, the negative coefficient practically disappears. The negative coefficient, upon which Allport bases his theory, is thus found to result in this study from the erroneous assumption that the reliability of the facial expression test is perfect. The writer, though inclined to agree with Allport's theory, concludes that this type of experimental evidence, when closely scrutinized, fails to support the theory. ||||| 1932 ||||| The Journal of General Psychology ||||| Journal of General Psychology

The Metzger effect, i. e. the brightening of a Hering spot shadow after the introduction of a larger shadow, cannot be explained as a case of transformation. Theoretical considerations as well as experimental evidence speak against this explanation. Experiments with changing fixation point show that a retinal explanation is equally impossible. The after effect in time is essential for the Metzger phenomenon. The place of the after effect is determined by the structure of the field and not by retinal localisation as is the case with the ordinary after image. ||||| 1933 ||||| Psychologische Forschung ||||| Psychological Research
Although ratings of subjects and judgments of personality from photographs may, on the average, be highly inaccurate, yet there exist considerable individual differences in the intuitive abilities of different judges or raters. Twenty measures of ability to judge personality were obtained for 48 judges, together with a number of measures of intellectual, social-asocial, and artistic tendencies. An extreme absence of consistency was found between the judging tests; the accuracy depends not only on the subject who is judged, but also on the content of the judgment and on the conditions under which the judgment is given. However, the personalities of the good and bad judges manifested fairly uniform characteristics. Good judges of self are more intelligent and possess more sense of humor than the average. Good judges of friends and associates are less socially inclined and less intelligent, but more artistic than good self-judges. Good judges of strangers are distinctly more artistic and intelligent than the average, and, under certain conditions, more asocial. ||||| 1933 ||||| The Journal of Social Psychology ||||| Journal of Social Psychology
Consensus ratings for beauty or attractiveness yielded comparatively low, though mostly positive, correlations with intelligence and educational achievement. Most of the correlations between beauty and intelligence and also between beauty and scholarship were in the neighborhood of +.20. Four groups of college students, two groups of girls and two groups of boys, served as S's. The consensus ratings for beauty were secured from 2 groups of judges, each group composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. These consensus ratings were correlated with ratings for intelligence and scholarship, as determined by intelligence test scores and by grades received in at least three semesters of college work. The ratings for beauty showed a high degree of variability. On the average, individual judgments deviated from the consensus ratings by about four steps. Deviations were greater for the middle group than for those taking a high or low position in the consensus ratings. The judges showed higher variability in rating their own sex than when rating the opposite sex. ||||| 1933 ||||| The Journal of Social Psychology ||||| Journal of Social Psychology
Judgments of occupations were made from printed photographs, presented in series of pairs, the subject having been informed as to the occupational groups represented in the pairs. For all comparisons of groups, more right than wrong judgments were made. These differences were found to be reliable, and varied from slight (for comparisons of politicians with men of letters) to moderate (for comparisons of politicians with business men). The differences do not, however, warrant the existence of occupational types. The asserted bases of judgment were found to be numerous and inconsistent, and are believed to be more frequently rationalizations, i.e., justifications, than the real determinants of judgment. ||||| 1933 ||||| The Journal of Social Psychology ||||| Journal of Social Psychology
The events narrated seem to indicate that vested interests have considerable to do with the way in which institutional habits are formed. It was evident, however, that when the institutional attitude was finally established it was built upon a need among all concerned. It might be possible, on the other hand, if the vested interests were absent, to satisfy the need through a different course of action than the one adopted under pressure of propaganda. Institutional attitudes may be maintained in individuals long after the need for their maintenance is reduced only to an illusion of universality of the attitude among group members. This is called a condition of pluralistic ignorance. When members are provided an objective criterion of other people's attitude the institutional attitude is likely to be discarded.

A new item selection technique is presented which takes into account the intercorrelations of the items as well as their correlations with the criterion. The technique is regarded as superior to comparable techniques in that it is considered to achieve greater economy of time, greater objectivity of procedure, higher validity, and higher reliability. The mathematical theory underlying the method is developed. An approximate solution of the mathematical equations is suggested. An approximation procedure for the complete item selection technique is presented, based on the mathematical solution, but much simpler in procedure. The clerical operations involved in the approximation procedure are outlined and illustrated on a sample worksheet. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
A variation of the centroid method is described and illustrated. By the application of new rules for reflecting signs, it may be possible to reduce to insignificance the factor loadings of tests showing insignificant correlation (original or residual) with clusters of tests having relatively high intercorrelations. As a result, a factor common to any one of these clusters may be revealed by the centroid method itself with little or no need for rotation of axes or further calculations. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
An experiment was performed to determine the relationship between the accuracy of the original learning and the accuracy of transposition. The usual method of comparison of the average number of errors in the transposition test made by a group of rats trained to a criterion of 10 consecutive errorless trials with the average number of errors made by a group of rats trained to a criterion of 30 consecutive errorless trials reveals no clear difference between the groups. However, the degree of learning at the point when training ceased, plotted against errors made in transposition, brings out a clear relationship between degree of original learning and accuracy of transposition. Within the range of learning tested, the more accurate the original learning was, the more accurate was the transposition. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika

In continuation of a previous paper, a mechanism of delayed reflexes is considered more in detail. Equations governing such a mechanism are established and approximately solved. The formulae thus obtained describe the phenomenon of concentration of a conditioned reflex around a definite time interval after stimulation. Applied along the lines discussed in the previous paper to some simple combinations of stimuli and responses the formulae lead to a description of the elimination of errors by trial. They give a relation between the number of repetitions, necessary to eliminate a wrong act, and other constants, describing the situation. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika

Several theorems concerning properties of the communaltiy of a test in the Thurstone multiple factor theory are established. The following theorems are applicable to a battery ofn tests which are describable in terms ofr common factors, with orthogonal reference vectors. 1. The communality of a testj is equal to the square of the multiple correlation of testj with ther reference vectors. 2. The communality of a testj is equal to the square of the multiple correlation of testj with ther reference vectors and then1 remaining tests. Corollary: The square of the multiple correlation of a testj with then1 remaining tests is equal to or less than the communality of testj. It cannot exceed the communality. 3. The square of the multiple correlation of a testj with then1 remaining tests equals the communality of testj if the group of tests containsr statistically independent ests teach with a communality of unity. 4. With correlation coefficients corrected for attenuation, when the number of tests increases indefinitely while the rank of the correlational matrix remains unchanged, the communality of a testj equals the square of the multiple correlation of testj with then1 remaining tests. 5. With raw correlation coefficients, it is shown in a special case that the square of the multiple correlation of a testj with then1 remaining tests approaches the communality of testj as a limit when the number of tests increases indefinitely while the rank of correlational matrix remains the same. This has not yet been proved for the general case. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
The author arrives at a simple rule for ascertaining when a matrix of correlations, with communalities reducing it to minimum rank, cannot be analyzed into factors such that every column of loadings has at least as many zeros as the number of common factors, as required by Thurstone. A more exact but arithmetically tedious rule is also deduced from Ridley Thompson's boundary conditions, and a correction is made to the latter. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
The content unreliability of an essay test is the error due to the items used or the content of the test. The reader unreliability is due to variation in judgment of the persons who read and score the essay test. The content reliability of an essay test is accordingly defined as being independent of the reader reliability. Formulae are derived for the reader reliability and for the content reliability. The content reliability is found to be equal to the geometric mean of the test reliabilities computed from the scores assigned by the two readers, divided by the reader reliability. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
The evaluation of the level of difficulty of a test item is ordinarily derived from the proportion of a specified population passing or failing the item.

The implications contained in Richardson's article on item analysis in March 1936 issue ofPsychometrika are examined in the light of multiple factor theory. It is shown that item analysis is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the construction of a test which shall measure a single trait. The intercorrelations of certain items selected by a method of item analysis are examined, found to contain many zero and some negative correlations. Multiple factor analysis showed that eight traits were measured by the items which had been asserted to measure only one. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
The mathematical problem of approximating one matrix by another of lower rank is closely related to the fundamental postulate of factor-theory. When formulated as a least-squares problem, the normal equations cannot be immediately written down, since the elements of the approximate matrix are not independent of one another. The solution of the problem is simplified by first expressing the matrices in a canonic form. It is found that the problem always has a solution which is usually unique. Several conclusions can be drawn from the form of this solution. A hypothetical interpretation of the canonic components of a score matrix is discussed. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika

Using scores of 1200 students on a long test as a criterion, each of five subtests of different difficulty has maximum correlation with the criterion when the criterion is dichotomized at a value appropriate to the difficulty of the subtest. A 50-item test element is scored on an all-or-none basis with different standards for passing, and the percentage of passes for successive points on the criterion variable is computed. The Constant Method is applied to this relationship. The limen thus computed is a measure of difficulty, the dispersion is a measure of average (or total) validity, and the slope of the curve is a measure of differential validity. The difficulty of a test element is thus directly related to the maximum differential validity. ||||| 1936 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
A study was made of the relationship between the body form as measured by the Pignet Index and the grades received in the University. A positive correlation ranging from 0.05 to 0.29 was found for four different groups of students numbering from 100 to 371. It was also found that the average grades of the pyknic students were uniformly lower than for the athletic and asthenic groups, and that more of the pyknics dropped out of college before finishing than did those of the other types.

This investigation deals with a problem of the social psychology of the child. What is the behaviour of a child if confronted with the task of teaching another child? In the experiments took part 13 children aged from 9 years 10 months to 15 years 4 months as teachers and 14 children aged from 5 years 7 months to 11 years 11 months as pupils. were recorded verbally and were analysed afterwards. Subjects of the instruction were partly those of the school, like reading, arithmetic, geography and history, partly those not taught at school, like policy and chess. There are children who excell as born teachers, others are not so gifted, but one can say that all children are able to teach other children. Apart from the natural gift of teaching the success depends upon the subject of teaching and certain other factors. The attitude of the teacher to his pupil has been carefully analysed. Certain practical conclusions have been drawn from the experiments. ||||| 1937 ||||| Acta Psychologica ||||| Acta Psychologica
UsingHering's inequality phenomenon as a point of departure, we compared the effects of an objectively equal (supraliminal) increase or decrease of brightness on 1. two neutral infields of different brightness appearing on a common homogeneous ground, and 2. two infields of objectively equal brightness appearing on different grounds. The intensity of the change produced in the infields by the addition or withdrawal of brightness was judged by the intensity of the flashlike motion perceived at the moment of change. The intensity of change proved to be an inverse function (a) of the objective brightness of the infield and (b) of the brightness difference between the infield and the surrounding fiel. The inequality phenomenon is probably reducible to a joint operation of these two factors. No relationship could be uncovered between the intensity of change on the one hand, and the direction of change, or the phenomenal brightness of the infields, on the other hand. ||||| 1937 ||||| Psychologische Forschung ||||| Psychological Research

In an attempt to investigate the concept of neurotic tendency thirty-nine of the forty-two most discriminative items in the Thurstone Neurotic Inventory were administered as a questionnaire to a group of five hundred male college students. An analysis of the table of intercorrelations by Thurstone's centroid method showed that eight factors were sufficient to account for the observed intercorrelations with negligible residuals. The eight centroid factors were then transformed into a simple structure. It is concluded that a single trait of neurotic tendency cannot be postulated and tentative hypotheses are formed as to the nature of the primary traits revealed by the analysis.

In general, the methods of factor analysis developed during the past five years are based on the reduction of the correlational matrix by successive steps. The first factor loadings are determined and eliminated from the correlational matrix, giving a residual matrix. This process is continued for successive factor loadings until the elements of the last obtained residual matrix may be regarded as due to chance. The method outlined in this paper assumes the maximum number of factorsm in the correlational matrix. Them factor vectors are solved for simultaneously. Once them factor vectors are found, any vectors having only negligible factor loadings may be discarded. ||||| 1937 ||||| Psychometrika ||||| Psychometrika
