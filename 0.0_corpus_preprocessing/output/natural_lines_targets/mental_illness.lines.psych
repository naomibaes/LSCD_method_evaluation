These ratings may be converted to a numerical scale running from zero for well persons to 40 units in cases of extreme mental_illness.	1946
Electric shock treatment caused improvement of the mental_illness and, coincident with it, the asthmatic symptoms returned.	1946
It was subsequently found that this woman suffered from recurrent mental_illness.	1954
The possible interrelationships of psychic functioning, mental_illness, and adrenocortical functioning have been discussed, and the literature on the subject reviewed.	1954
When this is achieved, further light may be thrown on the aetiology of mental_illness.	1957
Failure on both dimensions was found to be related to a poorer self concept, fewer adjustive attitudes, greater complaints of physical and mental_illness symptoms and less socially desirable personality traits than found in individuals who score as successful on both criteria.	1963
The distortions involved in mental disease are considered inevitable, rather than name-dependent, yet their presence requires an explicative use of the disease concept, translating mental_illness into meaningful terms regarding descriptive accuracy and the related aspect of who shall treat mental_illness.	1963
This exploratory study investigated the attitudes of 303 college students and 521 psychiatric hospital staff members toward alcoholism, mental_illness, and physical disability.	1964
The Attitude Toward Disabled Persons Scale was adapted to yield two additional scales probing alcoholism and mental_illness.	1964
The first hypothesis, that emotional disturbance in childhood leads to mental_illness in adult life, is examined by means of retrospective studies of adult mental patients and by adult followup of child guidance clinic patients.	1965
In summary, we have suggested in this brief discussion that clinical pastoral training has established itself firmly in our culture and will be an important resource in the function of community mental_health centers; there will also be need for many clinically trained pastoral ministers who will serve importantly in the prevention of mental_illness and promotion of mental_health; that standards of training in the clinical pastoral field are very much needed and should be nationally unified and coordinated; and that the Association of Mental Hospital Chaplains might well exercise the leadership in developing a national resurgence of interest in a dynamic religion which will better meet the needs of our people as we move forward in this complex scientific age.	1965
Exploratory tests of the hypothesis that enzymatic blocks due to unsuspected co-factor deficiencies might be a causal factor in functional mental_illness revealed that treatment with certain vitamins or minerals in some instances could apparently make mentally ill Ss more ill.	1965
This article deals with some of the commonly practiced methods which reinforce and perpetuate the condition of mental_illness.	1965
Attitudes towards mental_illness and psychiatric hospitalization were measured in a sample of Afro-Asian immigrants to Israel.	1966
In regard to the etiology of mental_illness the importance of present day difficulties was more emphasized by the Afro-Asian respondents than by the Poles.	1966
On the basis of our findings less prejudice about mental_illness and its treatment was found among Afro-Asian immigrants to Israel than among immigrants from Polish origin.	1966
Problems of definition and classification in psychiatry and the impact of mental_illness on the individual and the community pose unique problems for psychiatric register studies.	1966
The timing of the migration in relation to the mental_illness was also examined.	1967
Previous reports indicating no raised incidence of psychotic illnesses in relatives of autistic children were confirmed, but there was a greater incidence of other serious mental_illness in the families of the autistic group than in the comparison group.	1967
In parents and collateral relatives of the autistic children, 3.2 had a serious mental_illness, and 4.8 of siblings were markedly abnormal.	1967
Theoretically, it is a study of a relationship between changes over time in the structure of the economy and changes in the distribution of mental_illness in a population.	1967
Dropouts appeared to have in common wishes to deny mental_illness and to forget hospitalization.	1968
Since mental_illness occupies more hospital beds than all other illnessess combined, its traditional role of treating mental_illness is understandable.	1970
This study investigated changes in the perception of models of mental_illness and mental_health on the responses to a 25 item semantic differential scale in groups of subjects in a course in abnormal psychology and in several encounter-sensitivity training groups.	1970
Test findings before and after the experience, indicated that the participative emotional experience and intellectual cognitive experiences did not modify abstract models held by individuals concerning mental_illness and normality.	1970
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about Mental Illness questionnaire (OMI) and a test of knowledge about mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1970
Results showed that the students as a group were better informed about mental_illness than the general population.	1970
Patients who were found to have chronic disability following mental_illness in a prevalence survey in Salford, England, were compared according to their attributes and their location in or out of hospital.	1970
Mental health was measured through the use of an index composed of six psychiatric symptoms which correlated highly with clinically diagnosed mental_illness in another context.	1970
The total prevalence of chronic disability associated with mental_illness, within and outside hospital, was assessed in the North English city of Salford in September 1966.	1970
The rates for chronic disability rose regularly with age and differed from the bimodal distribution shown by inceptions of mental_illness in the same town at about the same time.	1970
This study tests three hypotheses concerning types of individuals who are likely to be excluded from a community for mental_illness.	1970
The current findings have implications for at least three current etiological theories of mental_illness: the social isolation hypothesis the socioeconomic deprivation hypothesis; and the sociocultural fit hypothesis.	1970
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings Mental illness rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1971
The mental_illness rates of the biological parents were positively and significantly related to the creative ability level of the adoptees.	1971
The data were interpreted as evidence for the influence of prebirth factors on the relationship between creative ability and mental_illness No evidence of familyrelated postbirth influence was found An evaluation of mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a dampening effect on the results of the study.	1971
Of course, to hope that we can eradicate mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	1971
Previous studies have suggested that, because of the chronic and disabling nature of mental_illness, psychiatric patients do not fare as well in their careers as they should do.	1971
108 undergraduates rated the degree of mental_illness of 10 case descriptions on a 5-point scale.	1971
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971
Almost 60 of the bereaved suicides showed a predisposition to mental_illness before their bereavement: they had psychiatric treatment, attempted suicide or had a positive family history.	1971
A random sample of 1,405 respondents were interviewed to determine their attitudes about mental_illness and the extent of tolerance for the mentally ill in terms of their willingness to interact with ex-mental patients.	1971
They do indicate, however, that there is a trend toward greater acceptance of mental_illness and the mentally ill by the public.	1971
The study aims to determine the extent to which parental social class influences the incidence of early parent death; the effect of parental social class on the outcome of early parent death, in terms of vulnerability to adult mental_illness; whether early parent death affects the age of terminating full-time education; and whether early bereaved subjects lag behind their non-bereaved contemporaries in social class status.	1972
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include theories regarding maladaptation, theories regarding mental_illness, and theories regarding the death instinct.	1972
The conceptions which relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness seem to us to be an example of a useful formulation which might be so neglected.	1972
Our own feeling is that to relate selfdestructive behavior to mental_illness has already proven quite profitable and that further efforts along these lines might be quite valuable.	1972
Lefcourt's (1966) finding that repressors view repression-sensitization (R-S) scales as measures of mental_illness, while sensitizers view these scales as revealing honesty with one's self was tested.	1973
An important area for future research is the establishment of causal patterns, and the investigation of the primary or secondary role of social conditions in the emergence of mental_illness and other behavioural pathology.	1973
Opinions about mental_illness were studied among a group of introductory psychology students categorized on the basis of their dogmatism.	1973
3 scales were developed to measure belief aspects of opinions concerning the specific categories of homosexual and suicide and the general category of mental_illness.	1973
In addition, both high- and low-dogmatic Ss did not differentiate between suicide and mental_illness but did differentiate homosexuality from both these categories.	1973
The implications of these data for studies regarding opinions about mental_illness are discussed as are their importance for dogmatism theory.	1973
In this regard, currently held Western views about mental_illness, physical illness, social deviance, and human individuality are relevant.	1973
Star and Cummings findings that in 1950 and 1951 only a small minority of the public was able to identify symptoms of mental_illness other than those of paranoid schizophrenia are at variance with the findings of the major studies carried out in the 1960's.	1973
Therefore, hypotheses and policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	1973
They state our data strongly supports the proposition that the persons who attached the label of mental_illness to the previously described behaviors do not differ significantly from persons not using this label in terms of their willingness to interact at various levels with the mentally ill. (	1973
The attitudes toward mental_illness of the people of two rural communities belonging to the same mental_health district in Finland are analysed on the basis of Durkheim's and Allardt's theories of social structure.	1973
A positive association between attitudes and educational level was observed in both communities, and the same was true of the number of sources of information about mental_illness and attitudes.	1973
These results imply that increasing age per se is less disruptive to body image than is mental_illness.	1973
In accordance with Jungian theory, mental_illness is described as a myth which tends to isolate the observer from the one observed in a significant manner.	1973
A comparison of mental_illness and narcotic use in rural and urban areas indicates a greater incidence in areas with high population density.	1973
The extent to which attitudes towards mental_illness and the mentally ill were influenced by the respondent's own level of personal adjustment was studied for 77 female psychiatric aides.	1973
The precarious position of biochemistry concerning normal behavior and the causes of mental_illness may, of course, be simply temporary, reflecting a conspicuous lack of key components in the chemical jigsaw puzzle of normal behavior.	1974
Hospitalization for mental_illness during the first years following childbirth can be viewed as a response both to disturbance in social relationships and to greater cumulative life stress.	1974
One of them, physician, explain their opinion of mental_illness : they believe in biological factors and discard any psychotherapeutic mean.	1975
the absence of mental_illness before immigration and throughout the first years in France; 2.	1975
Reviews several sets of psychological concepts that reflect the general position that mental_health and mental_illness are separate dimensionsnot just the opposite or absence of one another.	1975
The impact of these concepts is that mental_illness involves a defensive ego orientation, and mental_health involves a growth-related task orientation.	1975
F. Herzberg's job factor theory, the concepts of coping and defending, and G. W. Allport's intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientations also depict similar dichotomies of mental_health and mental_illness.	1975
Episodes of malingering of mental_illness are ascribed to five individuals in history before 500 B.C.Odysseus, David, Solon, Kai Khosrau, and Brutus.	1975
The main points of this ordinance consisted of: individuals allegedly presenting symptoms of mental_illness were to be examined by public specialists (i.e., physicians competent in mental_disorders); the relatives of these individuals were to be located and their cooperation, including financial, was to be obtained; paupers were to be taken care of at the expense of the community; in any case, these individuals were to be admitted and treated in a hospital following certification by the proper authority.	1975
However, a discriminant analysis that takes each individual as being in one of four clinical groups, normal, unipolar depressed, bipolar affective disorder or other, indicates a clear relationship between the anthropometric measures and mental_illness; wide face and deep chest are associated with patients who have bipolar affective disorder.	1975
The experimental manipulation method is in general not feasible in studies of the etiology of severe mental_illness, whereas this method can be used in studies pertaining to primary prevention, because possible preventive methods would most likely be of a protective or beneficial nature.	1975
In a WHO-sponsored project in Mauritius the authors used these results for the selection of a group of children at risk for mental_illness.	1975
The oldest age group stressed mental_illness and mental retardation most frequently.	1975
This study is based on a sample of 35,486 consecutive confinements in Cardiff (1965-72) which gave rise to 67 cases of post partum mental_illness.	1975
The bearing this finding may have on the prevention of post partum mental_illness and the implications of the observation that post partum mental_illness and the functional psychoses have a remarkably similar temporal behaviour are discussed.	1975
The role of housewife has been hypothesized as the source of excess mental_illness among married women as compared with married men.	1975
The present study compared the attitudes and feelings of law-enforcement, corrections, parole and probation personnel, and college students toward mental_illness.	1976
Law-enforcement and corrections personnel tended to believe many of the stereotypic causes of mental_illness, while the college students based their views on more current thinking.	1976
VIP's and others are sometimes prevented from seeking competent help because of such attitudes, which fit into the systems theory model of mental_illness.	1976
The purpose of this survey was to know better the image of mental_illness among the public.	1976
During this bicentennial year it is worthwhile to review the history of children who have suffered from mental_illness during the course of America's movement from a small colony to a major superpower.	1976
Attitudes towards mental_illness are interpreted as becoming more liberal and rejection appears to be based on specific behavioral attributes.	1976
The heart and remainder of the treatise deals with the legitimate question, Is mental_illness demon possession?	1976
The patients and staff of a psychiatric hospital were asked about their attitudes toward mental_illness and how they conceive the roles of various patient and staff groups in the therapeutic community.	1976
The results revealed that attitudes toward mental_illness and role conceptions were highly related.	1976
This was a study of opinions about mental_illness among occupational groups from a state psychiatric hospital and community mental_health centers.	1976
Data were collected with two combined opinions about mental_illness scales.	1976
The results indicated that occupational groups of both the hospital and the community mental_health centers were highly differentiated in their opinions about mental_illness.	1976
In support of the construct validity of the Client Attitude Questionnaire, 16 psychologists and 25 social workers reported attitudes more characteristic of the controversial psychosocial position about mental_illness than 20 psychiatrists, 23 psychiatric nurses, or 40 previously hospitalized psychiatric outpatients.	1976
The attitudes and beliefs of 62 Asian American and 81 Caucasian college students toward mental_illness were examined.	1976
Many surveys of general populations have suggested a high untreated psychiatric morbidity, vairously referred to as mental_illness, pre-clinical neurosis, minor neurosis, untreated depression, etc.	1976
The purpose of the present study was to do a canonical correlation analysis of demographic information and the Behavior Problem Checklist (BPCL) in order (a) to employ the demographic information in a manner that had not been possible using other methods, and (b) to examine the four factors on the BPCL as a general measure of mental_health and mental_illness.	1976
The research in this field should be started on the assumption of a multifactorial hereditary system controlling the somatic base of mental_illness in a specific way as can be argued from twin and family studies.	1976
It is the existence of this association in people suffering from chronic mental_illness that would benefit from services of a mental_health center in the Metropolis.	1976
These are: Prepsychoanalytic psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family communication theory, and the view that symptoms as a sign of mental_illness do not exist.	1976
These findings are discussed in relation to the return method, ethnicity, medication, chronic mental_illness, diminished freedom, and consumer voice in voluntary questionnaires.	1977
He also describes the development of help given and the increasing tendency to reduce obstacles to the freedom of movements of those suffering from mental_illness.	1977
Analysis of the temporal relation between the beginning of mental_illness and the beginning of professional life, according to a comparative anamnestic method applied to a group of teachers (N. = 94) and a matching control group of psychiatric paired out-patients (N. = 95).	1977
Fifteen mothers previously hospitalized for mental_illness (psychosis) and 15 well mothers were observed with their 3-year-old children.	1977
The hypothesis stated is that pastoral care in the Middle Ages attempted: (a) to restore the whole man by reclamation and reintegration from the demonic forces, especially demonic possession which was seen as related to what is known as mental_illness; (b) to provide a structure by which one could become stable and unified from the prevailing culture with its environment, societal, and individual disorder and disintegration.	1977
Thomas Szasz critique of the concept of mental_illness centers on the claims that (a) mental_illness is diagnosed on the basis of objective medical criteria, and (b) mental_illness is something which happens to the patient rather than something done by him.	1977
Neither of these claims, according to Szasz, is true: mental_illness, in this sense, is a myth.	1977
Various attempts to meet Szasz critique and to define mental_illness are examined and found to be unsatisfactory.	1977
The attempt to develop a limited conception of mental_illness (Flew) shows some promise but has received little support from the mental_health professions.	1977
Biblical and theological considerations underline the importance of the problem about mental_illness, but do not provide a solution.	1977
Thus, it would seem that the critique of mental_illness constitutes a conceptual crisis in psychiatry and possibly an ethical crisis as well.	1977
What factors can be used to differentiate demon possession from mental_illness?	1977
There was no evidence that the mental_illness experienced by the asthma group differed significantly from that of controls during the follow up period eithet in period prevalence or diagnosis.	1977
The presence of mental_illness amongst asthmatics was not related to the prognosis for asthma, nor to the age of onset, family history of asthma or other atopic conditions.	1977
Despite physical impairment the asthma group failed to show any significant excess in point prevalence, or any difference in the diagnostic categories of mental_illness suffered.	1977
The present study investigated the effects of situational constraint and type of causal explanation on the degree to which described behavior would be perceived as evidencing mental_illness and the degree to which it would lead to social rejection.	1977
Results showed that both of these variables influenced the degree of attributed mental_illness, the degree of attributed psychological disturbance, and the degree of social rejection.	1977
In an attempt to change attitudes toward mental_illness, as well as to increase positive self-attributions, 37 community residents were presented a series of demythologizing seminars.	1977
This paper reports results from one phase in an ongoing study of the relationship between vestibular function and various aspects of personality, cognitive style and symptom formation in mental_illness.	1977
In an attempt to explore similar underlying components of attitude toward the elderly and the mentally ill, college undergraduates (183 males, 146 females) were administered Kogan's Attitudes toward Old People Scale, Cohen and Struening's Opinions about Mental Illness Scale, and an experimental scale measuring endorsement of deteriorative aspects of mental_illness.	1977
Similar comparisons were made for the psychological (suicide, mental_illness, and emotional disturbance) and somatic (essential hypertension, coronary occlusion, and malignant tumor) subsets of the affected participants and for those affected by each of the six individual disorders.	1977
Fifty per cent of the population with past or present mental_illness had been referred to the psychiatric service during the 18-year-period 1957--74; the proportion varied from 85 for patients with psychoses (100 for schizophrenic patients, and 90 for manic-depressive patients) to 43 with non-psychotic disorders.	1977
The frequency of past and present mental_illness was 24, higher for women with manic-depressive disorders, psychogenic (reactive) psychoses, and neuroses.	1977
Although the PSE was originally developed for use by psychiatrists with patients with obvious mental_illness, the interview also contains sections dealing in considerable detail with the commoner and less severe complaints and symptoms that are found in a significant proportion of 'normal subjects'.	1977
The existing evidence linking noise with mental_illness is found to be unsatisfactory.	1977
The concept of annoyance and the relevance of noise annoyance to mental_illness are discussed.	1977
Guamanian cultural characteristics, language, classifications and descriptions of mental_illness and beliefs about the cause and treatment of deviant behaviors are described and discussed.	1977
Recommendations are made to: Establish therapeutic goals compatible with Guamanian cultural values; modify the concept of mental_illness, the causal explanation ofcaduco andatmariao behaviors and the role of the psychiatrist and other staff; modify the labeling process; use treatment methods compatible with Guamanian cultural values, beliefs, and healing practices, and; deal with morally or socially deviant behaviors only within the Guamanian social context.	1977
In this study beliefs about causes and treatments for mental_illness are examined.	1977
The lighter birthweight of schizophrenic women's offspring was found more strongly related to the severity and chronicity of their mental_illness than to the diagnosis itself.	1977
A total of 128 male and female adult patients under treatment for mental_illness were interviewed under procedures using all combinations of the five factors.	1977
Two levels of mental_illness expectancy were obtained by changing the context of the interviews.	1978
A contraindication to the brief focal approach is past or present formal mental_illness in a parent.	1978
Demonstrated that through a brief, didactic, demythologizing approach, college students' attitudes toward mental_illness can be changed in a psychosocial or non-medical model direction.	1978
A sample of 389 male veterans was evaluation and diagnostically categorized into four mental_illness categories and one nonmental_illness group.	1978
Conventional histories of psychiatry depict the medieval and early modern period as dominated by demonological ideas about mental_illness and treatment of the insane as cruel and inhumane.	1978
Although the mentally ill were largely ignored in the Middle Ages, some of the basic attitudes related to the later treatment of mental_illness can be traced to medieval times.	1978
Type of population sampled, temporal factors, and changes in attitudes toward mental_illness were suggested as possible explanations for such differences.	1978
Nationality was more powerful than professional training in determining attitudes towards mental_illness.	1978
Domestic quarrels, mental_illness and physical diseases would appear to be some of the important precipitating factors of suicide in Lusaka.	1978
Implications for revealing potentially stigmatizing information about mental_illness to teachers were discussed.	1978
Various studies have demonstrated an increase in mental_illness in black immigrants in Britain.	1978
Results, obtained from epidemiologic data, indicate that lower socioeconomic status is probably the most fundamental factor associated with high risk for both physical and mental_illness.	1978
It is imperative to weigh the risk of treating the patient against the frequently greater danger of leaving a mental_illness untreated.	1978
Untreated mental_illness can lead to chronic disability; conversely, careful treatment of such patients may be followed by partial or complete recovery from the mental_illness, and improvement in the neurologic symptoms.	1978
The present investigation is a study of the influence of attitudes towards mental_illness on the experienced need for psychiatric treatment, using a population sample selected at random.	1978
The main result was that subjects suffering from psychological disturbances manifested at psychiatric interviews and by other means, and who were assessed as being in need of psychiatric treatment, displayed more negative attitudes towards mental_illness than those who were mentally healthy.	1978
On the other hand it could be established that positive attitudes towards mental_illness correlated with subjective need of treatment and willingness to utilize psychiatric treatment.	1978
On the basis of the obtained results the improvement in attitudes towards mental_illness and mental problems in general was recognized as an important social objective.	1978
Seventy-five subjects (50 male and 25 female) rated their willingness to disclose symptoms of a personal nature, general nature, and mental_illness nature to male and female physicians whose photographs had been pretested as being either physically attractive or physically unattractive.	1979
Increased willingness to disclose was related to the more physically attractive physicians, general as compared to personal and mental symptoms, same-sex match-ups between patient and physician, especially when disclosing personal or mental_illness symptoms or concerns.	1979
Used a cluster analytic procedure to describe mental_illness.	1979
Members of the general public and mental_health professionals were queried on their views about etiologies of mental_illness, circumstances in which they would call someone mentally ill, and opinions about restricting occupational choices of the formerly hospitalized.	1979
The label of mental_illness was applied by both groups with considerably greater restraint than was anticipated on the basis of prior research.	1979
Across issues, two patterns of response emerged; some respondents believe that mental_illness is a real entity, apply the label to a wide range of behavior, regard hospitalization as the best course of action and restrict the occupational choices of the formerly hospitalized.	1979
At the other extreme is a subset of respondents who regard hospitalization as objectionable in principle, who narrowly define mental_illness and who are unlikely to restrict the career choices of the formerly hospitalized.	1979
The authors believe that a consideration of sensory function as it relates to patterns of behavior may contribute to an expansion in the medical model of mental_illness.	1979
The concept of mental_illness is explored by noting its connections with other concepts, such as deviance, social maladjustment and morbidity.	1979
Analyses of participants' pre-post responses on three self-report instruments indicated that the humanistic approach apparently increased students' humanistically oriented attitudes toward mental_illness, positive attributions to mental patients, and reported ethical conflict in hypothesized clinical decision-making.	1979
After participating in a brief, demythologizing seminar, 24 high school juniors reported significantly changed attitudes toward mental_illness on a paper-and-pencil measure.	1979
These new attitudes reflected a rejection of the mental_illness metaphor and, generally, less acceptance of the traditional medical model approach.	1979
Labeling mental_illness is explored, utilizing sociological concepts.	1979
The correlation of .15 between scores on the two measures was statistically non-significant, as were the correlations between number of previous admissions and attitudes toward mental_illness, number of previous admissions and attitudes of dependence, years of education and attitudes toward mental_illness, years of education and attitudes of dependence, and age and attitudes toward mental_illness.	1979
Comparisons of admissions to mental_illness hospitals and DGHUs indicate no major differences in most categories of patient characteristics (age, sex, order of admission and diagnosis); where differences do exist, they appear to be decreasing.	1979
Seventy-nine junior psychiatrists at the Maudsley Hospital answered 16 biographical questions and a 68-item questionnaire measuring attitudes to the psychoanalytical, biological, social, behavioural, and anti-medical models of mental_illness.	1979
Family attitudes of the future mental_illness/suicide group resembled those of the cancer group, while those of the essential hypertension and coronary heart disease groups were like those of the healthy group.	1979
Following her analysis she concludes that four factors are responsible for this increase of feminine mental_illness : change in social aspirations now more oriented towards self-fullfilment than usefulness necessity to be happy for two in marriage without the benifice of an autonomous position difficulty to self-assert and know her own needs repression of the anger caused by the frustrations of her situation.	1979
The history covers 5 specific periods : the political and religious period, the period of professional colonialism during the union with Lower Canada, the asylum period, the hospital period or franco-religious when a neurological concept of insanity prevailed, the psychiatric period where insanity becomes a mental_illness that is treatable both biologically and psychologically and finally the period where insanity tends to fall back to social deviancy that must be taken in charge by social science experts.	1979
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between sex and mental_illness.	1979
The delivery of mental_health services was extensively researched; however, a wide diversity of other topics such as work, substance abuse, and attitudes toward mental_illness were also represented.	1980
A demythologizing, educational approach to the community is outlined and recent empirical studies are summarized which demonstrate that beliefs in favor of the mental_illness concept can be significantly changed.	1980
A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental_illness concern evoked by each item.	1980
The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental_illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance.	1980
None of them was correlated nor with organic lesions or medical seriousness, neither with psychopathic background, previous mental_illness or treatment by corticoidic drugs.	1980
Patterns of reflective LEM's have been correlated to a number of cognitive and personality variables, bu the relationship to sex, education, and mental_illness is unclear.	1980
It is shown that important headway may be made in social psychology, particularly in relation to the study of physical and mental_illness, by acknowledging the compatibility of the two approaches.	1980
Compared with professionals, cur anderos were found to be reluctant to label the disorders as mental_illness.	1980
The present study was an attempt to construct an attitude scale to measure the radical psychosocial or libertarian position about mental_illness and mental_health practices.	1980
One hundred and ninety-two subjects (128 male and 64 female) rated their willingness to disclose symptoms of a personal nature, general nature, and mental_illness nature to a male or female physician who had been described as being either high or low in technical competence and either high or low in social competence or beside manner.	1980
Demonstrated that through brief demythologizing, college students' (N = 32) attitudes toward mental_illness could be changed significantly in a non-medical model or psychosocial direction and that this attitude change apparently induced students to report a significantly reduced fear of contracting mental_illness.	1980
Patients with harsh, pessimistic views about mental_illness had more severe psychopathology and did less well over the period of follow-up.	1980
Mental health professionals have been described as biased in the evaluation of mental_illness, almost always in favor of illness.	1980
Two levels of mental_illness expectany were obtained by changing the context of the interviews.	1980
Evidence indicated that the biased perception of mental_illness occurred for all Ss when mental_illness expectancies were high.	1980
A scale, the Mental Illness Behaviors Prediction Scale (MIBPS) was developed for use in studies of ascribed mental_illness.	1980
The MIBPS is comprised of fifteen items, each of which describes a situation and four alternative behaviors scaled for mental_illness level.	1980
In other studies the overall mental_illness level of perceived persons was found to vary with selected independent variables.	1980
One proposal concerning the manner in which observers apply the mental_illness label to another is that the label is a residual explanation, applied by the observer only after other possible causes have been considered and rejected.	1980
If this view is correct, attribution of mental_illness to a target person should be decreased by the presence of either situational forces or internal personality characteristics which provide alternative explanations for the behavior.	1980
Studies which have investigated attitudes toward mental_illness invariably have found that distinct differences exist between subjects' attitudes toward normals and toward people considered mentally ill.	1980
Subjects used the term mental_illness less than the term emotionally disturbed in the case of moderately deviant behavior.	1980
The frequency of mental_illness was higher in the Klinefelter males with karyotype 47,XXY than in the remainder.	1980
In-patient data show high rates for mental_illness in the Republic of Ireland, particularly for schizophrenia. '	1980
Neuroendocrine tests are now available for studying monoamine function in the brains of patients with mental_illness.	1980
Johnson totally ignores the theoretical and empirical basis for the definition of mental_illness that is used.	1980
First, his precise definition of mental_illness is criticized because it excludes diagnostic groups comprised largely of males (personality disorders and substance abusers).	1980
Immunoglobulin levels were measured in 77 male patients with chronic mental_illness at a Veterans Administration Hospital.	1980
In their commentary they use a bio-psychosocial approach to mental_illness.	1980
The verification of the six proposed hypothesis has uncovered the fact that sexual problems are a component of mental_illness and that the patient is deprived by the institution of his procreator right.	1980
The aim of this project is to provide a meeting place for people concerned with the reality of mental_illness where they would reflect on different aspects of mental_illness and learn how to read to its manifestations in everyday life.	1980
Students see depression but not mental_illness as a predisposing aspect.	1980
Much of the excess in rates of mental_illness is accounted for by those diagnosed as having alcohol-related disorders and behaviour and personality problems.	1980
Mental health and mental_illness are approached as based on relatively successful or disordered ego functioning.	1981
Case histories point out the conflict of values and cultural attitudes about mental_illness among refugees due to their changed environment and life style.	1981

The authors report an experience on the assessment of mental_illness prevalence rate in the socio-professional population of four French provinces.	1981
The attitudes of 309 Anglo, Spanish American, and Black American subjects toward mental_illness were investigated.	1981
The three groups showed no significant differences in their beliefs that mental_illness was an illness like any other and in their beliefs that mental_illness arises from personal experience.	1981
Can excessive use of a particular set of values by parents produce symptoms of mental_illness in their children?	1981
Sometimes the resistance becomes chaotic and the result is a mental_illness.	1981
The children are at greater risk for mental_illness than the parents because theirs is the more dependent role in the relationship.	1981
There was a positive relation between mental_illness (disability degree), depth of depression and weight gain.	1981
There were no significant relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, depth of depression, frequency of anxiety attacks, phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	1981
When mental_illness was simulated, there were more dramatic responses including the use of blood, mutilation, and hatred.	1981
The study thus indicates that mental_illness, especially depressive disorder, implies a considerably increased risk.	1981
180 college students were asked to make judgments assumed to correspond with judgments about the mental_illness of targets who projected various combinations of cues in attire and verbal messages.	1981
Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target are not necessarily those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with judgments of mental_illness only in some cases and combinations, and that observers' construct systems affect judgments.	1981
Analyses of scores taken from semantic differential scales, a behavior check list, and a question about psychiatric condition showed a tendency for the targets with in-congruent attire and message to be judged as with more mental_illness.	1981
In addition, older subjects and subjects with a more demythologized opinion about mental_illness tended to attribute slightly less mental_illness to targets in general.	1981
In view of the previously reported findings of favorable attitude change following a psychiatric practicum for the students who had completed the two psychology courses, over-all results presented in both reports (a) confirm previous studies which suggest the effectiveness of a psychiatric practicum in changing nursing students' attitudes toward mental_illness and (b) empirically support Rabkin's 1977 statement that academic instruction seems maximally effective in combination with factors such as personal experience with mental patients, etc. (	1981
as reported by the student nurses) in changing attitudes toward mental_illness.	1981
In 1960, changing concepts in the fields of the aetiology and treatment of mental_illness, the hugeness of mental hospitals and the transformation of Quebec society from rural to urban hasten the re-organization of psychiatric services, without eliminating the risk of excluding the mentally ill.	1981
22 logic of dollar-wise administrators who needs to forsee the cost-benefits that will accrue to the community from the work on prevention of mental_illness.	1981
The fallacy of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has financial consequences and that there are of a nature to be assessed.	1981
Patients varied in terms of their apparent degree of mental_illness, status on admission to the hospital (voluntary vs. involuntary), and their decisions to consent to or refuse the procedure.	1981
He relates how the concept of craziness was progressively replaced by this of mental_illness and how this last concept was no more synonymous of draison.	1982
As Horwitz (1979) notes, the conflict between the labelling explanation of mental_illness and the psychiatric explanation of mental_illness appears to be unresolved.	1982
The results indicate that socioeconomic conditions alone are insufficient in explaining the prevalence of mental_illness within the Hispanic inpatient population.	1982
This article teases out the aspects of unregulated fertility that are likely to result in an unwanted child and examines the evidence that suggest their relationship to mental_illness.	1982
Based on previous research on mental_illness, mortality differentials, and the quality of life, it is hypothesized that widowhood has an adverse impact on well-being, and that this relation is stronger for men than women.	1982
Groups differing in social support were compared on scales measuring attitudes toward mental_illness and personal feelings of anomy.	1982
This study investigated the relationship between sex, physical attractiveness, and perceived risk for mental_illness.	1982
Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived risk for mental_illness served as the criterion indicated that decreased attractiveness was associated with an increasing belief in susceptibility to mental_illness (p less than .05).	1982
Results were interpreted to indicate another link between physical attractiveness and mental_illness.	1982
A review of existing studies indicates that physicians compare favorably with the general population in mortality from physical illness but unfavorably with regard to mental_illness, notably the affective, suicide and addiction.	1982
In mental_illness, however, the vulnerability stems from inner sources.	1982
The role of cultural norms in determining the attribution of mental_illness, and the limitations of Euro-American criteria of psychoses, are discussed in the light of these findings.	1982
Traditional theories of mental_illness have attributed causality to such widely divergent views as intrapsychic mechanisms, biological processes, and interpersonal events.	1982
Independent of the state of the subject, a positive correlation between commonality and repetition indicates a continuity between normalcy and mental_illness, the absolute value of these two parameters being a measure of a cognitive process.	1982
Stresses of medical practice, recognized as severe, do not increase morbidity and mortality of physicians due to physical illness; the rates of substance dependence, divorces, and mental_illness, however, exceed those in the general population.	1982
Interviews indicate that children were familiar with simple concepts associated with mental_illness, i.e., crazy, nuts, and cuckoo, but that few children knew more sophisticated terms or psychiatric labels.	1982
The children viewed media as less important than suggested by Scheff in providing images of mental_illness and violence.	1982
Our results show that there are several distinct types of mental problems, rather than one underlying dimension of mental_illness.	1983
Students with more severe personality disorder or those with a recent history of serious mental_illness progressed less satisfactorily.	1983
Parents whose child abusive behavior is a function of extremely maladaptive resolutions of major life issues fall into the hostile-aggressive, passive-dependent, and severe mental_illness typologies, where the prognoses are considerably more guarded.	1983
Later, jail records would indicate that the victim did not have a history of mental_illness or previous suicide attempts.	1983
Insofar as there is a recognizable general social skill, everyday observation suggests that this usually improves during the adult years and does not deteriorate in later life unless sensory loss is severe or mental_illness strikes.	1983
Although victims continued to show effects of the disaster after 12 months, none developed a major mental_illness for the first time.	1983
This study examined factors related to mental_illness in children and adolescents.	1983
These studies continue the exploration of variables related to a person's use of the mental_illness categorization.	1983
While a low level of involvement, as portrayed in videotaped scenarios, prompts attribution of mental_illness, other features of implicit personality theories also relate to greater or lesser attribution of mental_illness.	1983
Those participants who gave evidence of having attributed lower levels of involvement, regardless of filmed information, also attributed higher levels of mental_illness.	1983
Social workers, compared to general population participants, attributed higher levels of mental_illness at all levels of target involvement.	1983
Freud (1930) made it clear that the source of man's biological and cultural evolutionary progress--self-denial--was also responsible for the tragedy of the human condition, namely, repression, eternal psychic ambivalence, and chronic mental_illness.	1983
It is suggested that increasing evidence of neurophysiological etiologies for mental_illness must be taken into account in rationalizing the effectiveness of occupational therapy for psychiatric disorders.	1983
Goals included increased awareness of nonverbal communication and projection, understanding of manifestations of mental_illness, understanding of students' personal values, understanding of real differences and similarities between students and clients, understanding of the therapist leadership role, and assessment of different frames of reference.	1983
Prior to the release of this film, 146 college students were administered a questionnaire on attitudes towards mental_illness.	1983
The implications of these findings for rehabilitation strategies in the management of severe mental_illness are discussed.	1983
From the perspective of the labelling theory of mental_illness, the aim of this paper was to study some consequences on other people's perception of individuals who have been exempted on this basis.	1983
The suggestion that the divergence in results of studies exploring public attitudes to mental_illness may be partially attributable to variation in data collection procedures was subjected to empirical investigation.	1983
Using a vignette format, components of attitudes towards mental_illness were assessed in 413 high school students.	1983
The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of mental_illness is positively related to attribution to physical causes, and negatively related to social acceptability.	1983
Seven properties of art experience are identified which, when developed, have contributed to patients' recovery from mental_illness.	1983
Medical literature showed a surprising lack of interest in mental_illness associated with old age or even in medical problems other than the obvious ones of debility, and there is no way for us to penetrate the silence.	1984
Signs and patient behaviors that today would not be considered definitive of mental_illness were then frequently cited by the alienist (psychiatrist) as evidence of insanity.	1984
No differences were found between patients committed under the old law (which stipulated that the presence of mental_illness was a sufficient criterion) and patients committed under the new law (which requires the presence of serious physical harm as an essential criterion).	1984
The results indicated that the label of mental_illness was stigmatizing even in the absence of bizarre behaviors.	1984
However, results clarified that it is the lack of masculine instrumentality in the personality, not the feminine role per se, which is implicated in mental_illness.	1984
Only weak positive correlations were found between SCAS scores and mental_illness, measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).	1984
For centuries, a relationship between physical illness and mental_illness has been assumed.	1984
Factor analysis of the items revealed 3 independent factors: External Attribution (i.e. blaming the crime on social circumstances, victims, society); Mental-Element Attribution (i.e. blaming responsibility for the crime on mental_illness, poor self-control, distorted perception); Guilt-Feeling Attribution (i.e. feelings of remorse, regrets, need for punishment).	1984
In response to a U.S. Government accusation of political bias in social science research discussed by Hogan and Schroeder in 1981, 23 introductory psychology textbooks were examined for evidence of left-wing rhetoric in their discussions of mental_illness.	1984
The results indicated that the proportions of patients with physical or mental_illness were very high.	1984
The modern stereotype that in the Middle Ages there was a general belief that mental_illness was caused by sin is reviewed.	1984
The authors examined 57 descriptions of mental_illness (madness, possession, alcoholism, epilepsy, and combinations thereof) from pre-Crusade chronicles and saints' lives.	1984
In only 9 (16) of these descriptions did the sources attribute the mental_illness to sin or wrongdoing, and in these cases the medieval authors appeared to use this attribution for its propaganda value against an enemy of their patron saints, their monastery lands, or their religious values.	1984
The medieval sources indicate that the authors were well aware of the proximate causes of mental_illness, such as humoral imbalance, intemperate diet and alcohol intake, overwork, and grief.	1984
The banality that, since God causes all things he also causes mental_illness, was only used by medieval authors under special circumstances and in a minority of cases.	1984
It does not constitute evidence of superstitious and primitive notions about mental_illness in the early Middle Ages.	1984
Over the last decade, sociological research on sex and mental_illness has found that females have higher rates of mental_disorder.	1984
Work in this area is critically reviewed and methodological problems are identified These problems may lead to underestimating mental_illness among males.	1984
Recent utilization data on first admissions to public mental hospitals are presented Contrary to most work in the field, it is argued that mental_illness among males, relative to females, has increased dramatically.	1984
Dependent variables were attitudes toward seeking mental_health services, opinions about mental_illness, and tendencies to view mental_health problems as spiritual.	1984
They also appear to have certain characteristic ideas about mental_illness that need to be addressed in any attempt to counsel such clients.	1984
Animal and human research have demonstrated that events during early development influence vulnerability to physical and mental_illness.	1985
Mental health efforts in prisons and jails most often ignore the mental_illness prevention capabilities of main-line correctional personnel.	1985

Medical and moral lay images of mental_illness provide a knowledge base from which tolerance arises.	1985
Questionnaires concerning community attitudes toward mental_illness and opinions about news coverage of mental_health topics were administered to 26 television news staff and 37 mental_health workers.	1985
In the mental_health area, researchers have explored psychosocial aspects of mental_illness and emphasized therapeutic communities and psychoballet.	1985
The possible implications of the findings for clinicians responsible for determinations of dangerousness resulting from mental_illness were discussed.	1985

He points out that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of social skills training, especially for patients with debilitating chronic mental_illness.	1985
Our experience in the seminars and our study of the cases has encouraged us to believe that many Christian pastors, theological students, and lay leaders are open to a multiple causation explanation for demonizing and mental_illness.	1985
Our hope is that more definable criteria for demonizing and mental_illness may be developed and that theories for spiritual discernment will be more closely related to clinical practice.	1985
Our most satisfying conclusion from the seminars was the willingness of students to think about demonizing and mental_illness from a variety of viewpoints, to develop more inductive thinking and to begin the process of dynamic rather than behavioral approaches to these related forms of illness.	1985
The incidence of affective instability and antisocial behavior in patients, and familial mental_illness in 14 psychiatric inpatients who drew the human figure aberrantly from the feet upwards to the head were compared with 15 psychiatric inpatients who did not draw the human figure in this manner.	1985
While affective instability was not significantly different in the two groups, there were significant differences in the incidence of familial mental_illness and antisocial behavior with elevations for the aberrant drawing group.	1985
Research on attitudes toward mental_illness held by the public, by mental_health professionals and personnel, and by psychiatric patients and their families is substantial.	1985
Little attention has been given to children's attitudes toward mental_illness and the mentally ill, so this exploratory-descriptive study examined the developmental trends of children's attitudes toward the mentally ill.	1985
Children rook an increasingly parernalistic view of the mentally ill, were less likely to see mental_illness as an illness like any other, perceived mental patients as less of a threat to society and needing fewer restrictions.	1985
Finally, with increasing age/grade children perceived mental_illness as less likely attributable to inadequate, deprived or interpersonal experiences.	1985
This study examined the relationships between ethnicity, conceptions of mental_illness, and attitudes associated with seeking psychological help among school teachers.	1985
Analyses indicated significant differences between blacks and whites in their conceptions of mental_illness; blacks' responses were more stereotypic, and whites' were closer to those of mental_health professionals.	1985
Conception of mental_illness was significantly related to attitudes associated with seeking psychological help.	1985
A Delphi study was conducted with a multi-disciplinary group of experts attending a conference on mental_illness in primary care settings.	1985
The respondents' three top-ranked priority areas for research were: primary care; the elderly mentally ill; and chronically disabling mental_illness.	1985
This paper shows how the subordinate role played by affectivity in the Western concept of man led to the early and enduring view of mental_illness as an exclusive disturbance of intellect.	1985
The subsequent psychiatric diagnoses were grouped depending on whether or not a major mental_illness (MMI), mainly in the form of dementia, delirium, affective disorders, and schizophrenic disorders, was present according to DSM-III criteria.	1985
Even though mental_illness is the source of serious problems when it affects production, it is not a real preoccupation in the work setting and it does not belong firmly in the definition of health security.	1985
People who live in flats are usually shown to be more prone to mental_illness than those who live in houses.	1985
Attitudes toward mental_illness are poorly investigated among the non-Western peoples of South Africa.	1985
This study attempted, first, to identify the perception of mental_illness held by Indian South Africans and, second, to determine whether there are any generational and sex differences in their perceptions.	1985
Adolescents (80 boys and 80 girls) and their mothers were tested on a scale measuring opinion toward mental_illness in the East and West.	1985
The major findings were as follows: (a) Adolescents differed significantly from their mothers in their perception of mental_illness; (b) adolescents, compared to their mothers, showed a greater acceptance of the Eastern as opposed to the Western conceptualization of mental_illness; and (c) a significant difference between treatment and the other dimensions on the Eastern orientation was found.	1985
The proportions with mental_illness were identified and excluded from the sample in order to allow comparison of mentally normal elderly persons between these age groups.	1986
The viability of treating acute mental_illness in a natural setting on an institution's grounds is discussed.	1986
Sensitization was highly correlated with mental_illness (.78), and self-image disparity (.61) in a population of 77 normal adults.	1986

Crazy people (synonymous with the professional-technical term mental_illness) are apparently regarded with the same fear, distrust, digust, and aversion by children and adults alike.	1986
His manuscript journal shows, however, that he also lived a bizarre secret life of the mind of a kind which, in later generations, would have led to his confinement as suffering from mental_illness.	1986
The cross and intracultural differences in etiology, clinical features and course and outcome vary maximally in depressives than in any other mental_illness, and epidemiological studies have been a major strategy to delineate the same.	1986
No clear time trend emerged with respect to the proportion of suicides classified as being due to mental_illness.	1986
This project, initiated by F.C. Redlich in 1975, is a limited follow-up of Hollingshead and Redlich's,Social class and mental_illness.	1986
In a study of 306 children whose parents have a mental_illness, the relationship between coping skills and environmental assets and deficits determined the degree of behavior problems among these high-risk children.	1986
The patients have developed the following themes: entrance conditions, everyday life information, inconveniences, mental_illness, the exclusion process.	1987
For more than a century psychiatrists have suspected neuropathology in patients with mental_illness.	1987
Psychiatrists are cautiously optimistic that these various brain imaging technologies will be important new tools in continued exploration of the causes of mental_illness and ultimately may lead to more effective treatments.	1987
In addition, since the detectian of malingered mental_illness is a key component in many forensic contexts, characteristics are described which help to distinguish actual from malingered mental_illness.	1987
Several defense strategies are available to the capital defendant who is arguing for life in the penalty phase, including a mental_illness (MI) defense.	1987
The most marked difference was that the social workers less often perceived suicide to be caused by mental_illness than did either the bereaved or the community sample.	1987

Considerable effort has been exerted in recent years toward educating the public concerning mental_illness and the efficacy of various treatment modalities.	1987
Data also were collected on demographic variables, incidence of stressrelated physical and mental_illness, and coping activities.	1987
Review of 249 psychiatric consultations in a general hospital revealed a highly significant (P<.001) relationship between lack of clarity of the consultation request (CR) and the presence of patient-staff or intrastaff problems (PSISP), but not between the occurrence of PSISP and the presence of a major mental_illness (MMI), or between the presence of MMI and the lack of clarity of the CR.	1987
These results are discussed with reference to previous literature on mental_illness and ethnic groups.	1987

The current movement toward reinstitutionalization is seen as rooted in myths and misunderstandings about policy, practice, and the nature of chronic mental_illness.	1987
Thirteen sex killers were compared to 13 nonsex killers and 13 nonhomicidal sexually aggressive men on sexual history, substance abuse, history of violence, mental_illness and personality, brain pathology and endocrine abnormalities.	1988
They also tended to exhibit psychotic behavior following the crime and to be assessed as not guilty of the crime due to mental_illness.	1988
Because the parents of mentally retarded and mentally ill children are particularly vulnerable to the raising or dashing of their hopes against claims being made either way, this paper provides an overview and history of orthomolecular therapy, its application to both mental_illness and mental retardation, as well as toxicity considerations relative to megavitamin treatment, in the hope that such information will provide mental_health professionals with concise an swers to the challenging questions currently being asked by their patients.	1988
Research on the relationship between creativity and mental_illness is summarized, and studies documenting a relationship in writers between creativity and affective illness (particularly bipolar illness) are described.	1988
The application of a schizophrenia label is found to have more impact on behaviors that are a danger to self than on behaviors considered a danger to others which are proscribed for all actors independent of the mental_illness label.	1988
Demographic and criminal justice characteristics examined include age, sex, race, marital status, religion, educational level, disabilities other than mental_illness, crime of conviction and sentence length.	1988
Popular wisdom contends that elderly people in general, and rural elderly persons in particular, are at increased risk for mental_illness.	1988
A review of available literature suggests that elderly people may be at only slightly greater risk of mental_illness than the population at large, though there are some indications that rates of depression may be somewhat higher among the elderly population.	1988
A large civilian literature on the role of social support in health and wellbeing suggests that military units high in unit cohesion should provide their members both significant protection from physical and mental_illness and high levels of job satisfaction.	1988
Through there is no correlation between mental_illness and homosexuality, there are unique concerns that play a role in symptomatology and psychotherapy around neurotic and characterological issues in gay patients.	1988
This paper focuses on one category of mental_illness, the personality disorders, and discusses them from an interactional personality perspective.	1988
Results confirmed that clergy spend a significant amount of time counseling a wide variety of problems, and that their views of mental_illness and their approaches to counseling are related to their religious orthodoxy and their approaches to problem solving.	1988
Though there is no correlation between mental_illness and homosexuality, there are unique concerns that play a role in symptomatology and psychotherapy around neurotic and characterological issues in gay patients.	1988
Five of the seven had a known history of thyroid disease, leaving two new findings of hypothyroidism who presented with no clinical signs other than their mental_illness (0.7 of admissions tested).	1988
In five cases, which included the two new findings, the thyroid disease had been judged to precipitate the mental_illness.	1988
However, diagnosis is important in a few cases where thyroid disease apparently contributes to the mental_illness.	1988
We have argued that it seems to have three functions: First, it allows people who are unsympathetic to psychological illness, or who live in cultures where mental_illness is stigmatised, to nonetheless occupy the sick-role while psychologically unwell.	1988
We review the problems unique to the diagnosis and treatment of patients who suffer both major mental_illness and alcohol/drug abuse.	1988
A total of 1331 data points from 53 studies yielded the following overall percentile equivalent ranks for 24 disabilities: diabetes (most acceptable), ulcer, arthritis, asthma, heart condition, speech problems, crippled, orthopedic disability, physical disability, amputation, emotional disturbance, appearance disability, deafness, learning disability, stroke, cancer, paraplegia, blindness, epilepsy, tuberculosis, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, mental_illness, and multiple disabilities (least acceptable).	1988

The interaction between physical and mental_illness present in a Spanish rural community was explored using a two-stage cross sectional survey.	1988
A third group viewed a film not about mental_illness.	1989
Postfilm responses to the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill scale indicated that those who saw the target film expressed significantly less favorable attitudes toward mental_illness and community care of mentally ill persons than did those who saw the control film, regardless of whether of not they received the trailer along with the target film.	1989
Results support concerns that media depictions add to mental_illness stigma and also suggest that corrective information alone may be sufficient to counteract the stigmatizing impact of such audience-involving mass media portrayals.	1989
This reflects their attitude to mental_illness.	1989
The findings presented here suggest that mercury poisoning from dental amalgam may play a role in the etiology of mental_illness.	1989
Subjects who had amalgams removed reported that symptoms of mental_illness lessened or disappeared after removal.	1989
This paper reports on a study of client families of a counselling service in Vienna, Austria, which serves relatives of persons suffering from a major mental_illness, e.g. schizophrenia or manic-depressive conditions.	1989
Psychiatric rehabilitation has been hampered by the absence of reliable and valid instruments to assess functional skills of persons with severe and persistent mental_illness.	1989
This article describes the development of the Community Living Assessment Scale (CLAS), which was designed specifically to assess daily living skills of those with mental_illness who live in community residences.	1989
The CLAS is recommended as an assessment instrument for use in psychiatric rehabilitation programs and for research with populations with severe and persistent mental_illness.	1989
This study examined young adult chronic patients' interpretations of the cause, severity, and prognosis of mental_illness.	1989
This study investigates how different types of disasters affect symptoms of mental_illness, as well as how victims' attributions for the disasters modify psychological response.	1989
The psychotomimetic paradigm, which viewed hallucinogens as agents for temporarily inducing psychoses, proved to be of limited value to the understanding and treatment of mental_illness.	1989
This paper analyzes the suicidal behavior of eight individuals with mental retardation identified out of a pool of 305 persons with an accepted concomitant diagnosis of mental_illness.	1989
First, how have these individuals with a chronic mental_illness functioned as deinstitutionalized persons; second, did participation in a fifteen-week occupational therapy program affect performance of skills in work, play, and self care; and, finally, what is a model for the occupational therapis1 as case manager with the chronically mentally ill?	1989
The characteristics, alleged causes of mental_illness, and treatment and outcome of the Retreat patients were compared with those of patients admitted during the same period to the two other York asylums which served different socio-economic groups of the population.	1989
This report deals with the relation of suicide to mental_illness in the elderly.	1989
Second, we asked to what extent suicides of older mentally ill persons are definitely created by their mental_illness.	1989
Moreover, we found that if mental_illness played a part, motives reflecting aspects of chronicity predominated motives reflecting psychopathology (i.e. feeling of being persecuted, loosing mind) of the suicidal patients.	1989
In addition, variables reflecting type of surgery, demographic characteristics, history of mental_illness, and health factors were evaluated as predictors of postoperative psychological distress and memory complaint.	1989
Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that younger age, lower social status, being male, having a history of mental_illness, higher presurgery BSI, and poorer postsurgery health were significant predictors of postsurgery psychological distress.	1989
It was found that rejection of the mentally ill in situations of social relations was linked to prior personal experience with mental_illness, perceived dangerousness of the mentally ill, and age of the survey respondent.	1989
The variables assessed were: perception of mental_illness in the vignettes; desired social distance; emotional and physical burden expected; and expected negative influence on one's mental_health from association with the type of persons portrayed in the vignettes.	1989
Dual diagnoses of substance abuse and mental_illness disorders are common both in psychiatric and substance abuse treatment settings.	1989
Recent studies have demonstrated that specific diagnostic categories of mental_illness have implications for treatment outcomes of dually disordered patients, but a diagnostic standard has not emerged.	1989
Labeling theory predicts that psychotic patients who accept the label of mental_illness will function less well than those who reject their diagnosis.	1989
The first phase that I call the prehistory of dynamic psychotherapy is the period of Freud's development of psychoanalysis as a distinctive therapy for mental_illness and its clear differentiation from the varieties of suggestive therapies in vogue at the time.	1989

Persons coping with severe mental_illness benefit from a variety of community supports and resources.	1990
This article describes a model for the outpatient treatment of adults at risk for major mental_illness who live with parents or a spouse.	1990
In order to understand the role of self-help and other consumer-run approaches in community support of persons with severe mental_illness, we must appreciate the importance of (a) consumer choice and (b) diversity of service alternatives within consumer-run options.	1990
Most clinicians favor family involvement in the treatment of adult outpatients who are at risk for major mental_illness.	1990
New models for the family-oriented treatment of mental_illness, particularly schizophreania, are, however, not readily adaptable to the situations encountered by practitioners working in clinics or private offices where one-to-one psychotherapy is the norm.	1990
Growing interest in art by people with mental_illness is reflected in the increasing number of exhibitions devoted to art by patients and ex-patients.	1990

The mental_illness' metaphor suggested by the acts of diagnosis is critiqued on the grounds that it obscures issues of class, gender and power, that it deletes the clinician's role in the development of diagnoses, and that the overall schemata in it contain serious philosophical and methodological insecurities.	1990
Although psychologists and psychiatrists currently have a limited ability to identify accurately malingering and deception, expert testimony about the genuineness of a defendant's mental_illness is likely to be held admissible for both practical and evidentiary reasons.	1990
Results suggest that the incidence and prevalence of major episodes of mental_illness have been substantially reduced and that the need for traditional hospital-based care has been minimised.	1990
Although there exists much work on the social history of mental_illness, stigma, per se, has not often been addressed in historical studies.	1990
Both of these processes are healthy, adaptive ones, indicating that mental_illness does not facilitate creativity but interferes with it.	1990
The results suggest that physical or mental_illness may decrease creativity.	1990
The connection between mental_health and creativity has traditionally been studied in terms of outstanding aestheticprofessional creativity and mental_illness.	1990
Selected problem areas that span a spectrum covering folk/traditional conceptualizations of mental_illness, standardized concepts and methods employed in epidemiology, approaches to psychiatric diagnosis in biomedical settings, and more basic epistemological assumptions involving psychiatric nosology and theory receive systematic attention.	1990

Patients dually-diagnosed with mental_illness and chemical abuse often comply poorly with treatment.	1990
Of those subjects who met criteria for severe mental_illness (psychosis or major affective disorder), only one third were given treatment within 1 week of intake.	1990
More than 100 studies have cited M. Harvey Brenner's (1973) claim that fluctuations in the economy increase the onset of mental_illness and thus generate increases in mental hospitalization.	1990
One of Brenner's most memorable claims was that a stable inverse relationship between mental_illness and the economy could be seen over a 127-year span beginning in the early nineteenth century.	1990
The assumptions and methods of previous studies of the social selection-drift hypothesis for serious mental_illness are examined by using comtemporary log-linear methods for social mobility analysis.	1990
This study suggests that intergenerational social mobility differences between seriously mentally ill and general population groups in previous studies provide very little, if any, empirical support for social selection-drift processes in serious mental_illness.	1990
Persons with previous histories of mental_illness and with extensive life event histories are more susceptible to distress.	1990
In this paper I challenge some prevalent psychoanalytic concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of severe mental_illness which I believe to be in need of revision.	1990
This study develops hypotheses leading up to its implementation, describes how it is set up, and specifies the goals of hospitalizing the two together: not automatically separating a child from its mother who develops a psychiatric condition at such a vulnerable age, observing how mother and child interact, evaluating the mother's nurturing skills and how the baby functions, taking therapeutic action for the mother and for the mother-child relationship, and allowing preventive action, a general prevention of mental_illness.	1990
Psychiatry has oscillated between biological and psychosocial explanations for mental_illness since its inception.	1990
Training in the biological basis of mental_illness is and should be incorporated into psychiatric training, along with a balanced appreciation of the utility of psychotherapeutic and social intervention.	1990

A model of assessment and diagnosis of mental_illness in this population is presented that incorporates psychiatric as well as behavioral methods.	1991
Given the paucity of literature on the assessment and diagnosis of mental_illness in individuals with mental retardation, a number of suggestions are made regarding future research and refinement of the model.	1991
In considering the relationship between criminal behaviour and severe mental_illness two schools of thought can be identified.	1991
One, arbitrarily labelled the criminological; holds that criminality and mental_illness are only weakly associated, if at all.	1991
The second, labelled the psychiatric view, holds that there is a real and consistent relationship between mental_illness, in particular psychosis, and violence.	1991
Age differences were found in the adaptation of identity to the life experiences associated with mental_illness.	1991
In over 50 of cases continuation of in-patient stay was necessitated by the severity of mental_illness.	1991

The utility of the M Test (Beaber, Marston, Michelli, & Mills, (1985) as a screening measure for malingering was assessed using simulation-design (subjects asked to fake mental_illness) and natural-group (forensic assessment cases suspected of malingering) approaches.	1991
A correct understanding of the role of depressive affect in triggering psychic conflict leads to a reformulation of the origins and the psychodynamics of depression as a feature of mental_illness.	1991
The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of an ongoing programme of WHO research activities aimed at improving the quality of mental_illness care available in community settings.	1991
Although 'somatizers' were found to be similar to 'psychologizers' in many respects, they were less depressed; reported lower levels of social dissatisfaction, social stress and less dependence on their relatives; more likely to have an unsympathetic attitude towards mental_illness and less likely to consult a doctor about psychological symptoms, and more likely to have received medical in-patient care as an adult before they had consulted their doctor with their current illness.	1991
Of these patients, 25 were referred for a determination of competency, despite the fact that they often showed no evidence of mental_illness.	1991
After the breeding-hypothesis as an explanation of the inverse relationship between social class and mental_illness could be ruled out, the rival hypotheses of social stress and social selection (drift-hypothesis) are discussed.	1991

Previous studies have identified certain groups of people who are vulnerable to mental_illness and are therefore likely to obtain a high score on the GHQ.	1991
The vast majority of CMHCs aim to serve the needs of all forms of mental_illness within their catchment area, yet in practice, they have frequently failed to meet the needs of people with long term severe disorders and concentrate instead on providing assessment and counseling services for neurotic and transient situational disorders.	1991
Much controversy exists over the treatment of mental_illness and many critics argue that the exercise of medical authority results in the social control of the mentally ill.	1991
First, clinicians tended to hold a biomedical view of mental_illness and believed in the efficacy of forced treatment.	1991
A survey of 989 college students was conducted to investigate risk factors--gender, family history of alcohol abuse, family history of depression and mental_illness, childhood hyperactivity, and antisocial personality-associated with alcohol abuse.	1991

Compared with stealers, aggressive children tended to be younger and more immature males, and to come from stressed families with a history of mental_illness.	1992
Although much has been made of the nation of cultural specificity of mental_illness, this paper argues that mental_illness is a universal human experience.	1992
To understand mental_illness and identify it across cultures, it is necessary to examine the problem against the backdrop of the dominant value systems which prevail in any culture at a given point in time.	1992
There are salient value systems to which most cultures subscribe, which in turn influence our understanding, diagnosis and treatment of mental_illness and consequently the allocation of resources and the provision of care within the community.	1992
It is proposed that personality disorder can be conceptualised as inflexible interpersonal styles supported by expectations of others which are selffulfilling prophecies, and that these cut across the medicolegal categories of mental_illness and psychopathic disorder.	1992
While the originally proposed models studied here would be useful with higher-prevalence need categories, only two newly developed models that involve the poverty social indicator could successfully predict to low-prevalence surveyed chronic mental_illness in this study.	1992

The variation in policies reflects often unstated and unexamined assumptions about the relationships between mental_illness and the academic environment.	1992
One facet of this development has been the advocacy of an increased focus on the primary prevention of mental_illness.	1992
Studies that address the frequency, accuracy, and impact of mass media portrayals of mental_illness are reviewed.	1992
Numerous studies of frequency and content of media depictions support clinical observations that mental_illness is frequently depicted in the mass media, particularly the entertainment media, and that these depictions tend to be inaccurate and unfavorable.	1992
Limitations, such as age of the studies and mixed attention to psychiatry, psychology, and mental_illness, however, leave a need for further such studies.	1992
Investigations of the specific impact of media images of mental_illness support the belief that media presentations about mental_illness, including those in entertainment form, can have significant effects on attitudes toward mental_illness and treatment.	1992
Specifically, chronic depression, elder abuse, and the misdiagnoses of residual abuse trauma as dementia or mental_illness are compared to parallel issues identified by researchers in younger adult survivors.	1992
It considers first of all the circumstances of such families: their socioeconomic situation, and their beliefs about family life, mental_illness and seeking help.	1992
The findings are taken to represent the kinds of valuable insights that may be garnered from an empirical-phenomenological approach to research built upon a recognition of the importance of the dimensions of intentionality, temporality, and meaning in the everyday life of those afflicied with severe mental_illness.	1992
Folate level was not related to diagnosis, duration of mental_illness, other drug usage or spot affective morbidity.	1992
Within 6 months postpartum, 22 (51) of the women with histories of mental_illness were categorised as having relapsed (RDC case).	1992
An untested assumption of malingering research is that persons who feign mental_illness will not attempt to fake a particular disorder, but will be content to fabricate non-specific and possibly global psychiatric impairment.	1992
Biological psychiatrists tend to look upon the phenomena of mind and meaning, which are the data of psychoanalysis, as meaningless epiphenomena, and propose reductive explanations of complex mental states, whereas psychoanalysts tend to ignore the proliferation of neurobiological data indicating the importance of constitutional factors in mental_illness.	1992
The role of music therapy in the treatment of young adults with both mental_illness and alcohol/drug problems is discussed based upon the authors' experience with a National Institute of Mental Health demonstration project.	1992

This paper discusses the implications of interrelationship of substance use and mental_illness on pregnancy.	1993
In addition to suffering from the severe psychiatric symptoms of chronic mental_illness (CMI), people with this type of disorder suffer from a variety of secondary disabilities and face societal obstacles that interfere with their ability to maximize their personal, social, and vocational potentials.	1993
One reason for this shift in policy was that the social problem of mental_illness had been captured by progressives in the community mental_health movement.	1993
The latter issues serves to reinforce the importance of care staff in recognising potential symptoms of mental_illness the main focus of this paper.	1993
It is concluded that appropriate training of care staff in the awareness of mental_illness symptoms would increase the proportion of intellectually disabled people receiving appropriate treatment.	1993

This study examines age-cohort differences in conceptually organizing, observing, and responding to unclustered symptoms of mental_illness.	1994
These results suggest that differences in help-seeking behavior for mental_illness may be explained by differences in the way symptoms are observed by younger and older cohorts.	1994
Furthermore, the results suggest the operation of significant effects due both to aging and to cohort differences in sociocultural attitudes toward the stigma of mental_illness and the popularity of the wars.	1994
The importance of the development of innovative randomized trials to improve recognition and treatment of mental_illness in primary care is emphasized, as well as the methodologic problems inherent in carrying out these trials.	1994

Employee burnout is perceived to be a serious problem in human service organizations serving persons with severe mental_illness.	1995
While some interpret this association to mean that mental_illness or particular symptoms directly cause unwarranted physical aggression, this paper examines the case for the social context establishing socializing and environmental conditions which are causal in both violence and the development of mental_disorder.	1995
It reviews the literature, indicating lacunae in our knowledge base, and posits a causal model which links social stratification with both mental_illness and violence through the structured types of strains, events, situations and persons an individual experiences as an integral part of life.	1995

However, recent work has paid little attention to the ways in which patients' understanding of their illnesses may be shaped by perceptions of mental_illness and treatment prevailing in their cultures and social groups.	1995
We review work by social scientists on cultural and social variations in lay perceptions of mental_illness and on the stigma attached to mental_illness, and argue that these varying views are likely to be one of the influences on insight, requiring further exploration in research on this subject.	1995
The odds ratio increased with increasing severity of mental_illness from 1.04 from mild disorders, 1.30 for marked disorders, to 1.64 for severe or very severe disorders.	1995

Differences in coping by 105 aging mothers of adults with mental_illness and 389 similar mothers of adults with mental retardation were investigated.	1995
Although no differences in problem-focused coping were found, mothers of adults with mental_illness used more emotion-focused coping, which predicted greater maternal depression.	1995
For mothers of adults with mental_illness, depression was a function of caregiving demands, but coping did not buffer the effects of stress.	1995

New initiatives were introduced by Victoria's Mental Health Act in 1986 and 1990, and in the Sentencing Act 1991.3 The aims of the reforms are to provide the best possible care and treatment for people with mental_illness, and to give sentencing judges and magistrates a range of dispositional options when dealing with mentally ill people who appear before the criminal courts.	1996
Possible explanations include: different ways of understanding mental_illness in different cultures, greater stigma leading to greater denial of illness in some cultures, greater illness severity at admission in some ethnic groups and racial bias in psychiatrists' ratings.	1996
Its principles are based on the original Needs for Care Assessment, although that was developed for the very different population of those with long-standing mental_illness (Brewin et al.	1996
One of the main conclusion was that hospitalizations for the severely mental ill are also needed in a community-based system of care, supporting the assumption of a 'bed-rock' of mental_illness.	1996
We found no difference in the prevalence of mental_illness between 44 index and 26 control coparents.	1996
There was a high rate of persistent mental_illness.	1996

Based on the results of two population surveys conducted in Germany during 1990 and 1993, we examined to what extent personal experience with mental_illness might influence attitudes towards the mentally ill.	1996
Respondents familiar with mental_illness displayed prosocial reactions more frequently than those without any personal experience.	1996
Our results are all the more persuasive as we were able to demonstrate this relationship between personal experience with and attitude towards mental_illness for two independent samples.	1996
There were indications that personal exposure to mental_illness exerts a positive influence on a person's attitude towards the disorder and that our findings were not merely the results of possible selection effects, that is to say, that individuals with a more positive attitude towards the mentally ill would have been more inclined to stay in touch with the latter, therefore having greater experience with mental_illness.	1996
High rates of mental_illness among members of ethnic minorities are not specific to schizophrenia, suggesting that a risk factor common to both manic and schizophrenic illness is more prevalent among these groups.	1996
The aim of this study was to develop a practical, comprehensive, and valid self-report measure of the experience of caring for a relative with a serious mental_illness.	1996
A survey of attitudes held by a large sample of university students as well as by smaller samples of psychologists, general medical practitioners, members of the public, psychiatric hospital staff and patients in the central eastern Cape toward mental_illness and mental_health-care service providers was conducted during the early part of 1994.	1996
It was found that marked differences existed between the different samples and that the extent of a person's knowledge about mental_illness, as well as the degree of contact with mental-health professionals and their services, were important influences on the attitudes of respondents.	1996
Psychiatric patients and service providers indicated their confidence in psychiatric treatment and the psychiatrist was considered to be the most appropriate professional to deal with mental_illness.	1996
Patients with a major mental_illness usually need long-term treatment and rehabilitation.	1996
Since many are also diagnosed for severe mental_illness, options for their effective treatment are needed.	1996

Many lesbians who had been in therapy reported significant childhood and adolescent problems that warrant use of individual therapies, including depression, eating disorders, childhood physical and sexual abuse, and parental mental_illness.	1996
All had undergone an extensive evaluation, addressing such areas as hormonal/surgical treatment, and histories of substance abuse, mental_illness, genital mutilation, and suicide attempts.	1997
One quarter had had problems with substance abuse prior to entering treatment, but less than 10 evidenced problems associated with mental_illness, genital mutilation, or suicide attempts.	1997
Behavior therapy has been viewed by some as disempowering persons with severe mental_illness (i.e., undermining their ability to make independent decisions).	1997
Behavioral interventions (a) provide a safe place for persons to consider their life decisions; (b) simplify the range of choices that comprise many of these decisions; (c) help persons with severe mental_illness learn behaviors so that they can better meet the demands of independent decision making: (d) teach family members skills so that they can provide more resources to support independent decision making; and (e) facilitate self-control over behaviors and the settings in which they occur.	1997
Behavior therapists need to assert the important role that behavioral principles assume in empowering persons with mental_illness so that these principles are not discarded by professionals who misunderstand, or otherwise stereotype, behavioral interventions.	1997
We also identified four criteria relevant to the mental, emotional, and developmental functioning of juveniles that are used in various jurisdictions in making transfer and decertification decisions: treatment needs and amenability, risk assessment of future criminality, the presence of mental retardation or mental_illness, and certain kinds of offense characteristics.	1997
Treatment needs/amenability and risk assessment are set forth as criteria relevant to transfer in the majority of jurisdictions as well, with the presence of mental retardation or mental_illness explicitly relevant in a small number of jurisdictions.	1997

Since the publication of The Myth of Mental Illness in 1960, there has been an ongoing debate about Thomas Szasz's ideas concerning mental_illness.	1997
Specifically, the following areas are addressed: Szasz's definition of disease, his notions regarding the unconscious and rationality, his beliefs regarding culpability, his proposed differences between psychiatry and other branches of medicine, the uses of the term mental_illness, and the possibility of implicating physical lesions in some mental_illnesses.	1997
The authors reviewed all studies in the peer-reviewed literature reporting HIV seroprevalence among people with severe mental_illness in the United States, which varied from 4.0 to 22.9.	1997
This research is urgently needed to adequately respond to the AIDS epidemic among people with severe mental_illness.	1997
Even though social and coping skills training strategies have been shown to diminish symptoms, improve functioning, and enhance the quality of life for individuals with severe mental_illness, research suggests that many of the positive effects do not generalize to other settings and responses.	1997
Furthermore, the association of childhood abuse with parental mental_illness suggests that genetic and environmental factors are difficult to separate as etiological factors in vulnerability.	1997
The women attributed their divorces to extreme external factors: their husband's substance abuse, mental_illness, and/or severe physical violence against them, as well as to interference by their husband's family of origin.	1997

A total of 72 undergraduate students completed the MMPI and 74 completed the MMPI-2 after receiving instructions to feign severe mental_illness.	1997
Providing effective psychiatric rehabilitation to ethnic minority patients with serious persistent mental_illness (SPMI) requires an understanding of the role of cultural values and ethnicity-relevant factors on the course and outcome of severe mental_disorders.	1997
Although there is a great deal of literature on homelessness and mental_illness, few studies have examined the factors which may lead to homelessness in the mentally ill.	1997

This study examined the patterns of services provided to individuals with serious and persistent mental_illness during their first year in an intensive case management program.	1997
Current research on mental_health typically equates dependent behavior with negative health outcomes and thereby ignores how other people perceive dependency and mental_illness in gendered ways.	1997
The qualitative results provide a more contextualized understanding of the connections among gender, dependency, and mental_illness.	1997
These findings underscore the importance of examining how others perceive mental_illness and how these perceptions may be gendered.	1997
But in the area of mental_illness there has been controversy surrounding the magnitude and duration of the effects of labeling and stigma.	1997
Although family systems theory resulted in part from the study of major mental_illness, it later became distanced from considerations of individual psychopathology.	1997
Because of the nature of the task and the stimuli, these results would appear to apply also to two real-life tasks: Diagnosis of a mental_illness syndrome and construction of an identikit picture of an offender.	1997
Dual diagnosis refers to the co-occurrence of substance abuse and mental_illness, which may take many forms.	1997
The interaction of pregnancy, addiction, and mental_illness creates complex needs that often go unrecognized by treatment providers.	1997

This paper proposes that a comprehensive, long-term program with a case-management focus will produce better outcomes and be more cost-effective than the current approach to managing the illnesses of women on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (or TANF, formerly known as AFDC) who are afflicted with both drug dependency and mental_illness, i.e. a dual diagnosis.	1997
We compared average annual charges for patients with the following diagnoses: substance abuse, substance abuse with mental_illness, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes.	1997
A limited number of recent empirical studies suggest that inmates suffer from high rates of serious mental_illness.	1997
Among jail inmates there was little evidence of high rates of serious mental_illness, suggesting the criminalization of mental_illness may not be as evident in rural settings as urban areas.	1997
Results indicated that applicants were most influenced by prior experience: 99.6 were exposed to physical disabilities occupational therapy and 82.5 were exposed to mental_illness practice area.	1997

This paper explores the efficacy of on-going weekly psychodynamic group music therapy with those with chronic mental_illness in a therapeutic-community setting.	1997
Personal experience with mental_illness is associated with a lower level of derived social distance, which may be attributed to an increase in positive emotional reactions and reduced feelings of anxiety.	1997
The GHQ-12 was used to screen for psychiatric morbidity in a study of patterns of consultation and explanatory models of mental_illness in a general practice in West London.	1997
There has been a widespread development of community multi-disciplinary teams aimed to deliver coordinated comprehensive mental_health care, yet there is little published evidence on the quality of care and economics of providing such care for people with severe mental_illness.	1997
The objectives of the surveys were to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among adults aged 16-64 living in Great Britain; to identify the nature and extent of social disabilities associated with psychiatric morbidity; to describe the use of health and social services by people with psychiatric morbidity and to investigate the association between mental_illness and potential environmental risk factors in a household sample.	1997
The evidence in the patients' letters argues for the unchanging nature of mental_illness across time, at least for the last 120 years.	1997
It also demonstrates that patients admitted to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum suffered from serious mental_illness, and it undermines the view that the Asylum was simply a dumping ground for society's disaffected.	1997
The depiction of madness was ubiquitous during plays of this time and reflection on the views of this group of men gives us a more reliable insight into mental_illness then and today.	1997
In the present study, we looked at a cohort of 41 participants who, 8 to 24 years after having finished medical school, could be classified into five disorder groups: coronary, hypertension, mental_illness, suicide, or malignant tumor.	1997
The Rorschach scores were especially good at predicting mental_illness.	1997
If this finding is not spurious, it suggests that a given Rorschach profile would be predictive long before mental_illness became apparent.	1997
Consequently, it offers the possibility that some intervention might be undertaken which could either result in mental_illness not occurring or, at perhaps a minimum, lessen its severity.	1997
The relationships between social and economic conditions and psychiatric disorder among 346 older adults with severe mental_illness living in the community are examined in this article.	1997

A significantly higher consultation rate was observed in those patients with schizophrenia and delusional disorders when compared with other mental_illness.	1997
Medication non-compliance, a pervasive problem among persons with serious, chronic mental_illness, has been linked to increased inpatient resources use in public mental_health systems.	1997
Receipt of consistent outpatient mental_health treatment and belief that one had a mental_illness were significantly associated with higher levels of medication compliance in this population of seriously mentally ill patients.	1997
Definitions of severe mental_illness used in research studies are reviewed, indicating a lack of consensus about identifying this group.	1997
The findings indicate that definitions of severe mental_illness use the five dimensions of safety, informal and formal support, diagnosis, disability and duration--the SIDDD dimensions.	1997
These dimensions offer a framework for developing definitions of severe mental_illness at the local level, thereby identifying the priority group for mental_health care.	1997
Quality of life (QOL) has become an important outcome measure for many disorders, including mental_illness.	1997
The pathways to care for mental_illness are diverse and are dependent on sociocultural and economic factors.	1997

Thirty men and women with both a serious mental_illness and an alcohol use or drug use disorder were recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit and completed questionnaires assessing high-risk alcohol and drug use situations psychiatric symptomatology, and psychological symptoms that trigger substance use.	1998
The etiology of the high prevalence of substance use disorders in patients with severe mental_illness (schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) is unclear.	1998
There is minimal support for the self-medication model, but the accumulation of multiple risk factors related to mental_illness, including dysphoria, may increase the risk of substance use disorder.	1998
This article provides a selective overview of the empirical literature on substance use assessment for persons with severe mental_illness.	1998
Finally, we outline three promising directions for future research: (a) evaluating the psychometric properties of established substance-related measures in persons with severe mental_illness, (b) identifying the conditions under which self-report information is more or less accurate, and (c) improving the population relevance of substance assessment instruments.	1998
Differences in health status between the episodically and chronically homeless are smaller, and in some cases the chronically homeless have lower rates (substance abuse in New York; serious mental_illness in Philadelphia).	1998

The structure of the program pairs consultants--psychologists and psychiatrists--with Secret Service field offices to provide (a) consultation regarding risk assessment and case management of individuals who threaten or display inappropriate interest in the President or other protectees; (b) training for agents on risk assessment, mental_illness, and mental_health care issues; and (c) liaison activities between the Secret Service and the mental_health community.	1998
Although we now live in an era dominated by community-based treatment, the intractability of some chronic mental_illness and its high cost to children and their families makes continued research and development in this area essential.	1998
Empowerment is an ideology that has emerged in reaction to inadequacies in systems of care for persons with serious mental_illness.	1998

Helping persons with severe mental_illness cope with symptoms such as psychosis, negative symptoms, and mania is essential, but only part of the battle.	1998
Persons with mental_illness also suffer from the negative effects of stigma, frequently encountering discrimination from landlords, employers, and neighbors.	1998
This paper responds to the five articles in this special series of Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, which focusses on issues related to stigma and mental_illness.	1998
Movies, newspapers, magazines, television shows, books, radio programs, and advertisements have all been vehicles for communicating the experience of severe mental_illness.	1998
This kind of rebuff frequently leads to diminished self-esteem, fear of pursuing one's goals, and loss of social opportunities (e.g., landlords are hesitant to rent apartments to persons with severe mental_illness).	1998
Persons with mental_illness have been routinely stigmatized and pushed out of the mainstream of society.	1998
This has resulted in inhumane treatment of persons with mental_illness and has often led to exacerbation of problematic symptoms.	1998
This paper discusses the articles included in this special issue of Cognitive and Behavioral Practice addressing the hardship that social stigma places on persons with mental_illness, as well as strategies for addressing the problem of stigma.	1998
Persons with severe mental_illness are often stigmatized as a result of their psychiatric condition, which likely contributes to their difficulties in interpersonal relations, occupational functioning, and self-esteem.	1998
Given the pervasive effects of stigma on the adjustment of persons with severe mental_illness, it is necessary to identify potential strategies for reducing barriers that interfere with their acceptance into the community.	1998
In this article, we briefly review research on the stigma of severe mental_illness, followed by suggestions on how mental_health professionals might best approach the problem of reducing the stigma associated with severe mental_illness.	1998
Potential strategies of stigma reduction include education about severe mental_illness, promoting contact between the community and persons with severe mental_illness, and value self-confrontation, a technique used to reduce prejudice toward persons in ethnic minorities.	1998

This paper describes the forms and contents of television representations of mental_illness in the UK in 1992.	1998
Although strengthening the family relations of individuals with severe mental_illness has been identified as an important objective for communitybased case management programs, little is known about the impact of such programs on patterns of family relations over time.	1998
This article presents a community program for the prevention of mental_disorders, based on the following premises: (a) certain environmental factors place one at risk for mental_illness; (b) those factors reflect the joint action of physical and social environments; (c) they are historical; (d) mental_disorder results from the interaction of two factors: personal vulnerability conditions and environmental risk factors; (e) communities are a means by which social groups can adapt to the demands posed by life; and (f) the action produced by community health programs' agents, reflects service delivery policies.	1998
Supported education programs are a recent innovation to assist in integrating people with mental_illness, who desire to resume their postsecondary education in an educational setting where they can experience life as a student rather than as a mental patient.	1998
The major objective of this study was to identify predictors of the duration of homeless spells among persons with severe mental_illness (SMI).	1998

In line with an attribution-affect framework, relatives may be less tolerant of behavioral deficits because they are viewed as intentional, whereas behavioral excesses are easily recognized as core symptoms of mental_illness.	1998
We studied factors contributing to an increased risk of PPD positive status among 147 inpatients dually diagnosed for mental_illness and substance abuse in a large urban hospital.	1998
A high number of deliberately self-harming girls had a mental_illness (13.6), and a significantly high number of deliberately self-harming girls misused substances (50) and had been sexually abused (53.9).	1998
Fifty-five patients who met criteria for serious mental_illness nominated a relative with whom they had lived for at least the previous 6 months to be sent a questionnaire that included a scale for rating patients' contribution to family life in 10 specific areas.	1998
This research assessed the lifetime prevalence of traumatic events and current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 275 patients with severe mental_illness (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) receiving public mental_health services in Concord and Manchester, New Hampshire, and Baltimore, Maryland.	1998
The findings suggest that PTSD is a common comorbid disorder in severe mental_illness that is frequently overlooked in mental_health settings.	1998
This study examined whether training women living with a severe mental_illness to be assertive in sexual situations would decrease their risk for HIV infection.	1998
It is concluded that assertiveness training for women living with a severe mental_illness can serve as 1 part of a comprehensive HIV-risk-reduction program for this vulnerable population.	1998
Building on modified labeling theory, I examine the relationships between stigma, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction among persons with mental_illness.	1998
They are not only free now of the criminal penalties and of the stigma of mental_illness, but are in positions of trust, respect, and power.	1998

In a follow-up to an earlier study we decided to interview a number of religious healers and ascertain their views on mental_illness.	1998
The general emphasis in care is on a pluralistic holistic approach and individual healers have several models of mental_illness in their repertoire.	1998
Some healers were able to identify serious mental_illness and were able to refer these individuals to psychiatrists, whereas others felt that they were able to deal with these themselves.	1998
Although various experimental models of mental_illness, such as anxiety and depression, have been developed, little attention has been paid to male psychogenic impotence.	1998
In the process of becoming whole, she deals with the new stigma of an even more disabling label-mental_illness.	1998

As such it is a valuable reference for both therapists and service recipients who wish to learn more about how the ADA relates to the employment of people with mental_illness and who may be faced with the difficult decision of whether or not they should disclose their condition and request reasonable accommodation.	1998
Type A and B externals displayed higher mental_illness scores, whereas Type B externals only reported significantly more physical symptoms (physical ill-health).	1998
The psychiatric report must address whether a substantial risk of committing an offence exists upon release, irrespective of the defendant's history of mental_illness.	1998
Recent social science research suggests that individuals with intellectual disabilities and/or mental_illness are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation, yet it is rare for successful prosecutions to occur where the complainant has some form of mental impairment.	1998
The 1997 Northern Territory Supreme Court decision of Nepi v Northern Territory of Australia provides further fuel for those who contend that suitably experienced and credentialled psychologists should be permitted to furnish diagnoses of mental_illness to the courts.	1998
Failure to understand that mental_disorder under the Act was not the same as mental_illness, combined with a more litigious environment, as well as structural changes in the mental hearth services resulted in failure of provision of compulsory care to many who needed it.	1998
Further, the interpretation of the most ambiguous terms in the statutory definition (volition, cognition) has become more narrow and for the most part been applied to mental_illness alone.	1998
The author analyses 10 years of published decisions by the Victorian Mental Health Review Board in relation to the involuntary detention for treatment of those with mental_illness.	1998
A similar number of other subjects defined as subcases of depression, other cases of mental_illness and a random selection of non-cases were also included.	1998

We took a sample of first-degree relatives selected from a family study in depression and subdivided them by their history of mental_illness on the SADS-L, into those: (a) without a history of mental_illness (N = 43); and (b) those who had fully recovered from an episode of RDC major depression (N = 34).	1998
Certain types of personality may show predisposition to mental_illness, and it has been proposed that most categories of personality disorder could be relegated to the neuroses and psychoses.	1998
While most adolescents do not develop mental_illness following single traumatic events, many may be made more vulnerable to the psychogenic effects of future trauma.	1998
In the current paper, a multicausal view is taken, considering childhood factors (e.g., being raised by an authoritarian father), psychosocial experiences (e.g., the failure to have children and the accompanying stress), and adult developmental issues (e.g., the psychological and moral challenges involved in assuming the position of judge in a high court) that, along with a biological predisposition--played a role in Schreber's mental_illness.	1998
Major intentions or reasons to commit suicide mentioned were failing to solve problems and mental_illness.	1998
Results indicated that a discriminant function model which incorporated age, Caucasian identification, juvenile justice involvement, CAFAS score, family history of mental_illness, substance use and school attendance indices correctly classified the placement of 53 of the students.	1998
The author surveys the state statutes and examines the extent to which the statutes may create barriers to the use of advance directives by people with mental_illness.	1998
To explore the relationship between culture and mental_illness, this study examines a) the emergence of AIDS Neurosis as a socially recognized clinical entity in contemporary Japan, and b) the claims by activists, psychiatrists, health officials, and others that AIDS Neurosis is a culturally unique illness phenomenon specific to Japan.	1998
The course of persistent mental_illness is examined in sociosomatic terms by considering a life defined by a cycle of expectation, violation, illness, and recovery.	1998
Three barriers identified in this response to Corcoran's article preclude a mandated right to effective treatment for persons with mental_illness: current lack of any federally mandated right to treatment, deinstitionalization that reduced supervision, and refusing or discontinuing medicationoptions easily available to the outpatient.	1998
The author proposes a synthesis of the essential elements to distinguish Case Management from Assertive Community Treatment with people suffering from severe mental_illness.	1998
Although males are generally more likely than females to report violent behaviors, emerging evidence suggests that the gender gap is substantially reduced among individuals with mental_illness.	1998
Results indicate that treatment status and psychiatric diagnosis moderate the association between gender and fighting, but leave open questions both about the moderating role of threat/control-override symptoms and about the implications of mental_illness for the gender/weapon use relationship.	1998
It is interpreted that the Indian pattern comes close to a medical or disease model, with stronger emphasis on mental_illness, impulsiveness and emotional aspects, whereas the Viennese pattern reflects a theoretical, rational model, concentrating on cognitive factors and minimizing the influence of mental_illness, emotional difficulties and restrictions related to suicidal behaviour.	1998
Evidence for an association between mental_illness and violence has grown in recent years, leading many to ask why such an association exists.	1998
One hypothesis links elevated rates of violence among people with mental_illness to a small set of psychotic symptoms--so called threat/control-override (TCO) symptoms.	1998
In response to a controversy concerning whether the stigma of mental_illness has declined significantly in the United States in the past several decades, we assessed changes in public perceptions that mentally ill people are violent.	1998
Specifically, we compared answers to an open-ended question regarding respondents' understanding of the term mental_illness from two nationally representative surveys, one conducted in 1950 and one in 1996.	1998
We discuss the possibility that the adoption of the dangerousness criterion, which was intended to protect the civil liberties of mentally ill persons, may also have had the unintended consequence of increasing the stigma of mental_illness in the United States.	1998
The present study examines potential predictors of serious violence among persons with severe mental_illness (SMI), with a specific focus on the joint effect of substance abuse and medication noncompliance.	1998
At both assessments, organic mental_illness was the most frequent diagnosis.	1998
Either the HSCL-25 is a very imperfect indicator of the chosen CIDI diagnoses, or the dimensions of mental_illness measured by each of the instruments are different and clearly only partly overlapping.	1998
The stigma associated with mental_illness is a major concern for patients, families, and providers of health services.	1998
It is a point of contention, however, whether the relationship between mental_illness and violence is only one of association, or one of causality; that mental_illness causes violence.	1998
A proven causal association between mental_illness and violence will have major consequences for the mentally ill and major implications for caregivers, communities, and legislators.	1998
The authors suggest that a casual inference about mental_illness and violence may yet be hasty.	1998
Because a premature statement advocating a causal relationship between mental_illness and violence could increase stigma and have devastating effects on the mentally ill the authors urge researchers to consider the damage that may be produced as a result of poorly substantiated causal inferences.	1998
The study aimed to develop a mental_illness needs index to help local managers, district purchasers and national policy makers in allocating resources.	1998
Census variables used were chosen on the basis of an established association with mental_illness rates.	1998
This article examines the relationship between criminal violence and mental_illness.	1998
However, this does not imply that people with mental_illness are generally more likely to commit violent acts than members of the general population.	1998
A theory of social influence is proposed as a framework within which to examine the psychosocial processes that underlie substance abuse among persons with severe mental_illness.	1998
In its attempt to focus on societal causes of individual and interpersonal problems, feminist social work has largely overlooked the difficult situations of women affected by severe and persistent mental_illness.	1998
Due to distrust of the medical model and its diagnostic tool DSM-IV (APA, 1994), feminists have tended to neglect the needs of mentally ill women while reconceptualizing mental_illness as a form of society's oppression of women.	1998
Along those lines, the traditional medical model of psychiatric treatment has ignored contextual factors, especially oppression and discrimination, related to the onset and development of mental_illness among women.	1998
Treatment programming for individuals diagnosed with a chronic mental_illness and an alcohol use disorder could be enhanced by employing techniques that focus on those change process variables that are most strongly related to psychiatric distress.	1999
Women with severe and persistent mental_illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are at enhanced risk for sexual coercion and several resulting sexual health complications.	1999
We examine the prevalence and types of sexual coercion encountered by women with severe and persistent mental_illness and provide recommendations for interventions to reduce the prevalence of sexual coercion.	1999
When analyses were restricted to individuals whose mental_illness commenced more than 10 years before dementia onset, the magnitude of the odds ratio decreased markedly.	1999
For example, the data indicate a greater overall prevalence of mental_illness in the deaf population than in the general population as a whole, based on the relative number of each group who are patients in psychiatric hospitals.	1999
For both hearing and deaf inpatients, dual diagnosis (mental_illness and substance abuse) is far more common today than in years past.	1999
Hypothesized links between giving and receiving help and psychosocial adjustment were examined in a mutual-help group for individuals with serious mental_illness (GROW).	1999
Rachel, a 40-year-old woman with no history of mental_illness and ten years of exemplary professional work, recovers memories of childhood sexual abuse by her father through a call from her youth pastor in whom she had confided as an adolescent.	1999

The purpose of this archival study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of HIV-related risk behavior among adults with a severe and persistent mental_illness (SPMI).	1999
As such, they were incompetent to stand trial, due not to mental_illness or mental retardation, but to linguistic deficits.	1999
Mother's attitude towards her pregnancy, child being placed in a children's home, mother using antipsychotic drugs indicating acute, mental_illness, child adopted in the first year of life and quality of life of the child 31-33 years later.	1999
If it is, the state rate of participation in SSI for reasons of mental_illness and mental retardation should reflect the prevalence of such mental_disorders among children in the states as well as the degree of child poverty.	1999
This article, first, discusses SSI policies and their development and, then, presents the findings of a study that tested this assumption by investigating the relationship between the rates of participation on account of mental_illness and mental retardation and the prevalence of these mental_disorders.	1999
During Pharaonic times, mental_illness was not known as such, as there was no separator between Soma and Psyche.	1999
Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol use by persons with a severe mental_illness occurs frequently but is poorly understood.	1999
The role of premorbid factors in the violence associated with adult mental_illness has received little attention.	1999
We previously found that the premorbid onset of substance abuse in early adolescence or childhood was a more powerful predictor of violence in adult patients with chronic mental_illness than comorbid substance abuse.	1999
In the present study, we retrospectively assessed patients with chronic mental_illness for a history of childhood conduct disorder.	1999
There is an increasing need for practical instruments that can rapidly and accurately assess the effectiveness of treatments for mental_illness in clinical settings.	1999
Thus, by demonstrating that single-item global measures, particularly the CGI, can be reasonably good indicators of psychopathology, this study suggests that these measures may be practical tools for routine monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments for severe mental_illness in community settings.	1999
Schizotypy also has proven to be an important variable in understanding the link between creativity and the development of mental_illness.	1999
Findings confirm the contribution of schizotypy to the onset of mental_illness in creative people, but also challenge H. J. Eysenck's contention that psychoticism is associated with divergent thinking, a cognitive dimension of creativity.	1999
Besides explanations for mental_illness and madness, the interviews also covered the reaction of families and neighbours to such phenomena.	1999
In recent years cognitive therapy has become increasingly popular as a treatment for many forms of mental_illness.	1999
The findings of a study investigating carers' accounts about serious mental_illness occurring in their family are presented.	1999
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, elderly individuals with severe mental_illness living in the United States were cared for in state-run facilities that went by various names (asylums, psychopathic hospitals, state hospitals, state mental hospitals, and medical centers).	1999
These data confirm the generally held view of schizophrenia as the most disabling mental_illness, point to the very high levels of need associated with it, and emphasize the need for general health care.	1999
In general, self-help organisations are seen as providing support to patients and their families; information on mental_illness/health to the general public; and lobbying for services relevant to the needs of their members.	1999
It is therefore appropriate to reflect briefly on his life, his art, and in particular the rather controversial nature of his mental_illness.	1999
More effective and comprehensive services to meet the needs of those with severe mental_illness, particularly young adults, are essential.	1999
Only a minority of those referred had a mental_illness or complex problems.	1999
Assessors underemphasised the role of previous deliberate self-harm and/or the presence of mental_illness in forming a judgment on the risk of suicide.	1999
A typology of patients with mental_illness is described: the mild cognitively impaired and behaviorally disturbed, the cognitively intact but interpersonally troubled, and the mentally ill patients who have lost their support systems.	1999
These predictors included gender, current psychological distress, a diagnosis of severe mental_illness, and amount of time spent homeless.	1999

A cohort of 264 consecutively admitted patients diagnosed with a mental_illness and substance use disorder were entered into a dual diagnosis treatment program.	1999
Perceptions of patients diagnosed with a substance-induced mental_disorder were compared to those of patients with a primary mental_illness regarding their problems and need for treatment before and after the dual diagnosis program.	1999
Most patients acknowledged a substance abuse or mental_illness problem and need for treatment.	1999
After treatment, changes in perception of mental_illness were greater for substance-induced mental_disorder patients compared to patients with a primary mental_illness (p < .001).	1999
The type of mental_illness and severity of substance use influenced perceptions of illnesses and treatment readiness and must be considered by the clinician.	1999
Women diagnosed with severe mental_illness and substance abuse may face a variety of associated difficulties that require intervention, including other health-related problems, housing instability or homelessness, and a history of or current physical or sexual abuse.	1999
In Study 1, the effects of severe mental_illness as well as overall level of burden on retention in treatment were examined.	1999
Cox regression analyses revealed that severe mental_illness was significantly related negatively to retention in treatment; those women diagnosed with severe mental_illness tended to stay in treatment less time than those without such a diagnosis.	1999
In Study 2, staff ratings of the women's status at departure from residential treatment for a subsample of 311 women were examined with respect to overall retention in treatment and severe mental_illness.	1999
Ratings of client status at program exit were significantly related to time in program but were not related to having a severe mental_illness diagnosis.	1999
For a few indicators (e.g., leaving treatment against advice, having scattered or disorganized thoughts, and having no specific plans for life outside of treatment), there was an interaction between time in program and severe mental_illness such that women with severe mental_illness who were retained for less than 180 days were more likely to demonstrate negative outcomes.	1999
No differences were found between CFS and RA patients in measures of perfectionism, attitudes toward mental_illness, defensiveness, social desirability, or sensitivity to punishment (a concept related to neuroticism), on either crude or adjusted analyses.	1999
Individuals with a severe mental_illness and substance use disorder tend to have medical and social problems and to make slower progress in treatment than those who have either disorder alone.	1999
The findings are related to knowledge about the effectiveness of substance use disorder treatment techniques in general, and implications of the data are discussed for the conduct of integrated treatment of individuals with severe mental_illness and a substance use disorder.	1999
No significant relationships were obtained between protracted homelessness and demographics or chronicity of mental_illness.	1999
To determine the symptoms and behaviors in children which are considered psychopathological by Vietnamese parents, to identify professionals and agencies in the community whom Vietnamese parents would consult if their child had a mental_illness, and to determine Vietnamese parents' awareness of existing community mental_health services.	1999
A biological/chemical imbalance, traumatic experiences, and a metaphysical/spiritual imbalance were identified as the most likely causes of child mental_illness.	1999
Pending the availability of robust markers for mental_illness, researchers and clinicians must resist the tendency to reify diagnostic categories or to engage in arcane debates about the superiority of one assessment approach over another.	1999
These facts substantiate the subsequent claim of Freud and Jones that Ferenczi suffered from paranoia near the end of his life, but they do not support the commonly-held view that the writings and experiments in psychoanalytic technique of his last five years were symptomatic of a progressive mental_illness.	1999
Although violent victimization is highly prevalent among men and women with serious mental_illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), future research in this area may be impeded by controversy concerning the ability of individuals with SMI to report traumatic events reliably.	1999
The need to better understand and manage risk of violent behavior among persons with severe mental_illness (SMI) in community care is increasingly being recognized.	1999

Psychiatric mother and baby units are increasingly asked to assess parenting in people with severe mental_illness, particularly schizophrenia, but little research evidence exists on which to base assessments.	1999
In a multivariate framework, the author estimates the effect of mental_illness on the probability of being admitted to a general hospital, the number of admissions and the length of stay.	1999
Previous research has shown that hospital length of stay among medical patients is significantly increased by comorbid mental_illness, in particular depression.	1999
However, few studies have examined the length of stay effect of comorbid physical and mental_illness among psychiatric patients.	1999
Psychiatric evaluations should include a serum calcium concentration test, which is also essential in reassessment of patients poorly responsive to mental_illness treatment.	1999

Our research included two sources of data: interviews with 15 science reporters and three print media samples of coverage of genetics and behavioralcoholism (between 1980-1995), homosexuality (in 1993 and 1995), and mental_illness (between 1970-1995).	1999
The mean number of experts quoted was 2.8 per story, differing for alcoholism (3.5), homosexuality (2.8), and mental_illness (2.6).	1999
Lay quotes for alcoholism and mental_illness were minimal.	1999

Advocacy, government, and public-service groups rely on a variety of strategies to diminish the impact of stigma on persons with severe mental_illness.	1999
Future directions for research and practice to reduce stigma toward persons with severe mental_illness are discussed.	1999
This article provides an overview of professional practice with families of people who have serious mental_illness.	1999

To examine descriptions of maternal filicide committed in the context of major mental_illness from the frame of reference of a group of perpetrators.	2000
Psychometric studies have consistently shown that combat veterans evaluated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appear to overreport psychopathology as exhibited by (a) extreme and diffuse levels of psychopathology across instruments measuring different domains of mental_illness, and (b) extreme elevations on the validity scale of the MMPI-MMPI-2, in a fake-bad direction.	2000
This intervention, described in manualized form, draws upon the empirically validated psychosocial skills training approach for the rehabilitation of individuals with chronic mental_illness (cf.	2000

We report five cases in which delirium preceded the relief of affective and psychotic symptoms of a major mental_illness.	2000
Five inpatients (aged 53 to 69 years) with an exacerbation of chronic mental_illness developed deliria from medications (n = and electrolyte disturbance (n =.	2000
Historically, some treatments for mental_illness induce an incidental delirium (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy [ECT] and insulin coma).	2000
This may occur because of nonspecific impacts of these variables on the etiology or prognosis of mental_disorders or some nonspecific impact of mental_illness itself.	2000
Additionally, the frequency of DSH by female patients with psychopathic disorder has been found to be significantly greater than that by those with mental_illness.	2000
This was true for the entire sample considered together, regardless of their Mental Health Act (1983) classification and for patients solely with mental_illness and those solely with psychopathic disorder.	2000
There were no differences between the frequency of DSH by psychopathic disorder patients and that by those with mental_illness.	2000
Looking at this history from the viewpoint of the developmental psychopathology of the first 2 decades of life, we trace progress in public health responses to children with mental_illness, from a philosophy of control by isolation toward one of preventive intervention.	2000
Conceptions of mental_illness in children are bound by cultural and social conventions of what constitutes healthy and unhealthy development.	2000
We review where the field has been in its conception of childhood mental_illness throughout the past century, where we believe it is now, and raise questions about the direction in which child diagnosis may be headed as we enter the new millennium.	2000
Among these are the blurring of the division between mental_illness and mental_health, the need to attend to patterns of adaptation rather than personality traits, and the powerful influences of the social world on individual development.	2000
The mothers with mental_illness consisted of two subgroups: first, 25 severely mentally ill mothers who had been admitted to a psychiatric unit with their infants; and second, 16 mothers from a community sample meeting research diagnostic criteria for unipolar, nonpsychotic depression.	2000
Although few residual symptoms of maternal mental_illness were detected at 1 year postpartum, interactional disturbances were evident among the case group dyads.	2000
Like Sartorius, we contend that the continued stigmatization of mental_illness may well be the central issue facing the field, as nearly all attendant issues (e.g., standards of care, funding for basic and applied research efforts) emanate from professional, societal, and personal attitudes towards persons with aberrant behavior.	2000
We discuss empirical and narrative evidence for stigmatization as well as historical trends regarding conceptualizations of mental_illness, including the field's increasing focus on genetic and neurobiological causes and determinants of mental_disorder.	2000
We express concern over the recent oversimplification of mental_illness as brain disorder, supporting instead transactional models which account for the dynamic interplay of genes, neurobiology, environment, and self across development and which are consistent with both compassion and societal responsibility.	2000
Most of the participants thought that autonomy should be respected in situations involving death with dignity and euthanasia, whereas it should not be respected in attempted suicide and involuntary admission of individuals with mental_illness.	2000

The article concludes with the author's ideas about what is necessary and helpful when working with someone who has been labeled with a major mental_illness and what is counterproductive and harmful.	2000
The personal accounts of people diagnosed with mental_illness have much to teach practitioners.	2000
Initially, the human context of mental_illness is explored, including the diversity among those diagnosed with mental_illness and the cataclysmic impact of such a diagnosis on individuals.	2000
These factors include the context of treatment, the therapy relationship, interventions used and issues addressed, helpful experiences outside the mental_health system, and hindering views of mental_illness and treatment.	2000
These findings seem to suggest that the tendency toward somatic symptom reporting is not any greater among Chinese populations but may be a function of having a mental_illness or of help seeking in China.	2000
Discussion centers on the prospect of increasing the utility of general strain theory by further imbuing it with concepts and perspectives from the sociology of mental_illness.	2000
Modified labeling theorists have long argued that the stigma of mental_illness has important consequences for the lives of people with mental_illness.	2000
We propose that social rejection is an enduring force in the lives of people with mental_illness and that these experiences are central to understanding the poor self-concepts described by many former psychiatric patients.	2000
Three prototypical profiles of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; Overall & Gorham, 1962) were isolated using a Q-type factor-analytic strategy with a sample of homeless men with mental_illness (N=165).	2000

Although it is widely accepted that rates of severe mental_illness amongst single homeless people are high, little is known about the reasons these individuals become homeless.	2000
One hundred patients with severe mental_illness receiving continuing care from two sectorised services were sampled and interviewed.	2000
Lack of consensus about the meaning of severe mental_illness makes it difficult to prioritise the severely mentally ill for specialist mental_health care.	2000
The goal of this study was to develop a valid and brief assessment of severity of mental_illness.	2000
Most definitions of severe mental_illness (SMI) are categorical and assign the patient to either SMI or not-SMI status.	2000
Persons with mental_illness are over-represented among the homeless relative to the general population, and mental_illness is most likely one of many vulnerabilities that confer risk for homelessness.	2000
This paper elucidates the pathways to homelessness for persons with mental_illness by comparing and contrasting groups of mentally ill homeless persons, non-mentally ill homeless persons, and housed mentally ill persons drawn from RAND's Course of Homelessness (COH) study and the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) survey.	2000

Although it represents a conceptual shift from investigator-generated domains to client-elicited domains, it is suggested that a client-elicited approach to measuring subjective quality of life may provide fruitful avenues for resolving some of the conceptual and practical issues associated with understanding and measuring the impact of community-based programs on clients with serious mental_illness.	2001
Schizophrenia is a severe mental_illness that affects 1 of the population.	2001
About one quarter of the more than 69,000 medical students in this country suffer symptoms of mental_illness, including 7 to 18 with substance use disorders.	2001
Attention to this topic has been stimulated by a number of factors, including heightened awareness of the distinct moral problems arising in the care of mental_illness, the rapid development of new psychopharmaceutical agents, the emergence of evidence-based approaches in psychiatry, the expansion of clinical trials within the private mental_health sector, and recent recommendations offered by the President's National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC).	2001

I proposed that certain biologically conceived cognitive styles that are peculiar to extraordinary creativity possess common biological ancestry with certain cognitive styles that are associated with a predisposition to major mental_illness.	2001
Due to the fact that these imbalances are often associated with genetic predispositions to mental_illness, there is a greater-than-chance probability that highly creative individuals may evidence signs or symptoms of mental_illness.	2001
The relation between creativity and mental_illness has been a subject of controversy in Western society from about the 1830s to the present.	2001

This article explores the ways in which the DSM-IV Casebook constructs gender and race/ethnicity in depictions of individuals with mental_illness.	2001
We argue that the studies in the Casebook contribute to a gendered and raced conceptualization of mental_illness, and that these explicit definitions of pathology reflect implicit definitions of normalcy.	2001
Powerful innate emotions of human relating, evident in infants, and different from those that establish and regulate attachment for care and protection, bring risks of mental_illness associated with failure in collaborative intersubjectivity.	2001
Effective mental_illness prevention programs are important for the safety of youth and adolescents.	2001

P Smith & G. O. Burger, 1997), the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS; R. Rogers, R. M. Bagby, & S. E. Dickens, 1992), and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; L. Morey, 1991).	2001
Attitudes towards those with mental_illness vary amongst different groups in society.	2001
It has been suggested that those from a theologically conservative Christian group might generally have more negative attitudes towards those with mental_health difficulties because of the association of mental_illness with personal sin and demon possession.	2001
The aim here is to test the hypothesis that members of a theologically conservative church congregation would have more negative attitudes than the general population towards people with mental_illness.	2001
The results showed that the church group expressed less negative and rejecting attitudes to people with mental_illness than the population sample.	2001
There was no evidence of judgmental attitudes towards those with mental_illness.	2001
Further public education opportunities should aim to alter these damaging negative perceptions of those with mental_illness.	2001
The risk of serious mental_illness being precipitated by meditation is less well recognized however.	2001
The present study represents the first to administer the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) as part of a semi-structured interview to a large sample of psychiatric patients with severe mental_illness.	2001

It's not only based on the financial situation or the personnel structure which must be mentioned as reasons for children of parents with mental_illness for not asking for help.	2001
The provisions of the Act enable coercive treatment even where the individual may be competent While anorexia is a serious mental_illness, evidence, indicates that lengthy hospitalisation and coercive treatment may be detrimental to sufferers and should only be utilised as a last resort to prevent death or serious physical consequences.	2001
Put another way, sexuality has nothing inherently to do with mental_health or mental_illness.	2001
The results support the reliability of trauma and PTSD assessments in clients with severe mental_illness.	2001
People discharged due to mental_illness were grouped by DSM-III-R diagnoses (of schizophrenia, other psychoses and non-psychotic disorders) and were compared with those having no such hospital treatment.	2001

Asian born participants were more likely to stigmatize disabilities overall (except mental_illness and old age) than U.S. born participants presumably because of the level of assimilation.	2001
In clinical practice, the 'object' of insight thus generally refers to a particular mental or physical state (e.g., mental_illness, neuropsychological deficit) in relation to which insight is being assessed.	2001
The present study aims at investigating to what extent relatives of individuals suffering from mental_illness experience caregiver burden.	2001

Although many studies (e.g., Andreasen, 1987; Jamison, 1989; Ludwig, 1995) have demonstrated that creative writers are prone to suffer from mental_illness, this relationship has not been truly examined in depth.	2001
In Study One, 1,629 writers were analyzed for signs of mental_illness.	2001
Female poets were found to be significantly more likely to suffer from mental_illness than female fiction writers or male writers of any type.	2001

The authors conclude that the inclusion of these factors in our understanding of issues that persons with serious mental_illness face in the competitive labor market will likely lead to a further evolution in program and policy development.	2002
This review addresses the assessment of substance use and related constructs with persons having severe and persistent mental_illness.	2002
The first section focuses on issues particular to the assessment of substance use and abuse in the context of major mental_illness; these include the social and motivational context of assessment, the impact of mental status and acute symptoms, limitations associated with acute and chronic cognitive impairment, and the psychosocial relevance of assessment items.	2002
It is concluded tentatively that a relapse prevention module shows promise as a facilitator of the transfer of training in psychosocial interventions for severe mental_illness.	2002
The possibility that suicide may be a logical part of what it is to be human, rather than an indication of mental_illness, is advanced.	2002

Although the present model of psychiatry is in need of an urgent 'paradigm shift', it still continues to exercise immense power and popularity over other approaches to mental_illness.	2002
The practice of psychiatry raises a variety of deep-rooted conceptual and applied issues, particularly those related to the definition and diagnoses of mental_illness, treatment procedures, and the ethical practices within psychiatry.	2002
The aim is to describe this client's treatment within an inpatient facility that provided integrated care for those diagnosed with both mental_illness and substance abuse.	2002

Some found living with people with mental_illness difficult, but some specified not wanting segregated units.	2002
Estimates of who is most at risk from violence by people with mental_illness rest mainly on identified patient samples.	2002
The author also presents seven reasons for the continuing use of ECT, including profitability, value as a reinforcer of the biological model of mental_illness, the absence of informed consent, the procedure's function as a treatment of next resort, government and media support, and the public's failure to hold psychiatrists accountable for their conduct.	2002
Psychiatric research is of critical importance in improving the care of persons with mental_illness.	2002

Although religious coping has gained acceptance in some spheres of mental_health treatment, it has yet to be integrated into the treatment of those suffering from persistent mental_illness.	2002
In this study, 379 individuals with persistent mental_illness who attended 1 of 13 Los Angeles County Mental Health facilities completed a survey consisting of a demographic questionnaire and an adapted version of the Religious Coping Index.	2002
These findings suggest that religion may serve as an important coping mechanism for those with persistent mental_illness and that such coping could be appropriately incorporated into the treatment and research afforded by mental_health professionals.	2002
Clinical and legal research on the meaning of mental_illness and on definitions (and predictions) of dangerousness continue to offer the mental_health law arena mostly disappointing results.	2002
In other jurisdictions such reductions have been accompanied by increases in the prevalence rates of severe mental_illness among prisoners.	2002

The research literature associating maternal mental_illness with problematic mental_health outcomes of adolescent children typically controls for neither the effects of family stresses and lack of support, nor the effects of parenting style.	2002
This study explored the health-related views and experiences of adolescent users of mental_health services through semi-structured interviews with 32 14-20-year olds who had been diagnosed with a mental_illness.	2002

Analogies drawn to diseases do not help the understanding of mental_illness.	2002
The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes of students (n = 36) in an undergraduate occupational therapy program toward people with mental_illness and physical disabilities, and the effect of educational experiences on attitudes.	2002
The study revealed a significant difference in attitudes toward people with mental_illness compared to attitudes toward people with physical disabilities.	2002
At the end of occupational therapy education, attitudes toward people with mental_illness were more favorable than at the start of course work, but less so than those towards people with physical disabilities.	2002
Favorable attitudes towards people with mental_illness was not predictive of first job employment in a mental_health setting.	2002
These findings suggest occupational therapy students hold less favorable attitudes towards people with mental_illness.	2002
Educational programs may need to implement specific strategies to overcome the stigma of mental_illness to achieve the goal of valuing all individuals with disabilities.	2002

This paper addresses historical aspects of the diagnosis and classification of mental_illness in Japan.	2002
The absence of aetiological information linked to brain physiology that could serve as the basis of independent definitional variables has limited understanding of mental_illness and has been a stumbling block to the development of better classifications.	2002
However, a second stigma has contributed to the late development of interest in the psychological dimensions of cancer: negative attitudes attached to mental_illness and psychological problems, even in the context of medical illness.	2002
Mentoring of treatment teams may be an effective first step in integrating behavioral and psychopharmacological treatments that are deemed essential in the care and treatment of individuals with developmental disabilities and mental_illness.	2002
It seems that the results are similar: the main obstacle is prejudice towards mental_illness and people with mental_disorders, no matter who is questionned.	2002
Like mental_illness, work renders the individual a stranger to himself and leads to multiple forms of enslavement, by the absence of power on his conduct, by the blind obedience to social norms, and by the reification of the alienated product of labour of its human essence leading to the loss of meaning (Rosner, 1967).	2002
The research-action which results are presented here, states a change in the current way of thinking employment reintegration of people with severe mental_illness.	2002

This paper aims to determine the frequency, timing and type of life events preceding suicide by young people and those with and without a mental_illness.	2002
The number of life events in the different time periods under study did not distinguish suicides with and without severe mental_illness, although more suicides without a severe mental_illness had a reported life event in the week before their death.	2002
Adverse life events frequently precede suicide in young people with and without severe mental_illness.	2002
However, recent life events may have a lesser causal role in those with severe mental_illness.	2002
Stigma about mental_illness continues to run deeply in most societies, creating considerable difficulties for patients and families.	2002
In an area of north London which contains a large Greek-Cypriot population, we compared the attitudes towards mental_illness by first- and second-generation Greek Cypriots and those of white-English ethnicity.	2002
We used the 'Community Attitudes to Mental Illness scale' (Taylor and Dear 1981) to measure attitudes to mental_illness.	2002
1996c) to measure subjects' knowledge of mental_illness and contact with people with mental_health problems.	2002
We found that Greek Cypriots had less contact with mentally ill people, were less knowledgeable about mental_illness and hold more stigmatising views than their English participants.	2002
Contrary to our expectations, we found little difference in attitudes about mental_illness held by first- and second-generation Greek Cypriots.	2002
Knowledge about mental_illness was associated with a positive attitude towards people with mental_health problems.	2002
Aggressive educational campaigns targeted at specific minority communities such as the Greek-Cypriot community are required to challenge the stigma attached to mental_illness.	2002
Seventy-seven clients with a mental_illness and a serious impairment in functioning in social contacts, housing or work situation were randomly allocated to SCM or standard care.	2002

We illustrate Fairweather's approach to Experimental Social Innovation and Dissemination with two experimental studies of programs to reduce homelessness for 168 and 225 people with mental_illness and often substance abuse.	2003
Caregiving by relatives to a person with mental_illness is demanding and overwhelming.	2003
This paper describes how to use guided imagery, role-playing, humor, and paradoxical intervention to help the wife of a man with mental_illness in easing her worry, anxiety, and frustration engendered by caregiving.	2003
The intervention made the wife feel normal and relaxed in facing the symptoms of her husband's mental_illness.	2003
These patients present challenges to their therapists owing to the contrasting cultural understanding and conceptualization of mental_illness and therapeutic process.	2003
The most common problem was 'feelings of loneliness,' followed by 'mental_illness or psychiatric symptoms.'	2003
The current national COPMI project has been initiated to promote better mental_health outcomes for children of parents with a mental_illness, especially by providing information and good practice guidance for services and people in the community who work with these families and their children.	2003

Recent evidence suggests that involuntary outpatient commitment (OPC), when appropriately applied, can improve adherence with psychiatric treatment, decrease hospital recidivism and arrests, and lower the risk of violent behavior in persons with severe mental_illness.	2003
Research in the burgeoning field of threat assessment has illuminated the importance of mental_illness factors when considering risk of targeted violence-particularly related to government agencies and officials.	2003
Participants were 235 adults with a serious mental_illness who were booked into the county jail, and who volunteered for the study.	2003
We suggest that if DP/DR symptoms are misinterpreted as indicative of severe mental_illness or brain dysfunction, a vicious cycle of increasing anxiety and consequently increased DP/DR symptoms will result.	2003
These prisoners were divided into two groups: those having a diagnosis of mental_illness and those without such a diagnosis.	2003
Sixteen percent of these individuals had a diagnosis of a mental_illness.	2003
The specific beliefs about mental_illness that have been assessed have been varied and largely without a common theoretical framework.	2003
The central aim of this paper is to assess the applicability of the SRM to mental_illness.	2003
To this end, we review studies to date that have examined the beliefs that people with a mental_illness have about their experiences.	2003
In addition, we review studies that have examined the beliefs of relatives of people with a mental_illness and professionals who work with this population.	2003
The SRM is presented as a useful framework for more advanced investigations into the function of beliefs about mental_illness and how these can be modified in order to effect outcome.	2003
Developing psychological theories common to both physical and mental_health may eventually result in an integrated approach in which mental_illness becomes less stigmatised within the treatment setting.	2003
The Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT), a multidisciplinary team approach, delivers integrated community-based treatment, rehabilitation, and support services to help persons with severe and persistent mental_illness to avoid psychiatric hospitalization and to live independently in natural community settings.	2003
This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among homeless persons with co-occurring severe mental_illness (SMI) and substance use disorders and to determine associated risk factors.	2003
This paper explores the meaning of mental_illness for Kashmiri women, the issues that cause them distress, their coping mechanisms, and their perceptions and understanding of counselling.	2003
It was found that Kashmiri women in this study had a clear understanding of mental_illness, with little difference in beliefs between those born and raised in the UK and those brought up in Kashmir.	2003
This increased trend may simply reflect similar trends in the general population, but may also be associated with a lack of services or current consensus on appropriate treatment for patients whose mental_illness is complicated by excessive alcohol use.	2003
Forty-six children (the subject group) were admitted to a high security hospital under the MHA (1983) classification of disorder of mental_illness and/or psychopathic disorder between 1983 and 1999, 33 (72) of whom were male.	2003

Family history data on OCD and other mental_illness were obtained through the Family Informant Schedule at follow-up.	2003
Few studies have examined methodological issues for self-reported sexual and substance-using behaviors for persons with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2003
The diagnosis of mental_illness is accompanied by negative implications regarding a person's competence.	2003
We interviewed 20 women, inpatients on a psychiatric unit and mothers of 3.5-18-year-old children, recording their narratives about their children and exploring their thoughts and understanding of the concepts of motherhood and mental_illness.	2003
Also, the social discourses regarding mental_illness, (e.g., violence and incapability for mothering), were extremely oppressive for these women.	2003
In this article some theoretical material on a psychodynamic orientation concerning the diagnosis and treatment of mental_illness in this group is presented.	2003
The patient was discharged after 8 months of inpatient treatment and was apparently free of homicidal impulses or symptoms of severe mental_illness.	2003

Most social scientists have discounted a causal relationship between mental_illness and terrorism.	2003
In light of these findings, probation administrators are urged to invest more resources in treating drug use, mental_illness, and codisorders, the latter of which is associated with a higher risk of violent behaviors.	2003
Using data on 247 offenders with mental_illness, this analysis seeks to identify characteristics that distinguish those who are returned to prison or a psychiatric hospital with those who remain in the community.	2003
These findings have implications regarding the cumulative effects of engagement with the criminal justice system and the process through which persons with mental_illness and a criminal history cycle through institutions.	2003
Both patient groups were predominantly males with severe mental_illness and histories of violent offending.	2003
Twelve (24) had one or more characters labeled as having a mental_illness; an additional 21 films contained references to mental_illnesses.	2003
Results suggest that mental_illness depictions are common in children's films, and that, despite some positive responses from other characters, mentally ill characters tend to be feared and disparaged.	2003
Participants in this study suffered from severe mental_illness and were homeless at baseline.	2003
Provision of residential services to people with mental_illness has assumed increasing importance since deinstitutionalization and as community based services have increased.	2003
This largescale multisite study of housing programs specifically for persons with mental_illness examines one of the factors that lead to successful residential tenure for persons with serious mental_illness.	2003
The implications of using this instrument for future evaluation and research on housing for persons with mental_illness are examined.	2003
Depression is a serious mental_illness with a major impact on both individual and family functioning.	2003

The presence of co-morbid substance use disorders among individuals suffering from a severe mental_illness has an adverse effect on risk-related behaviour and prognostic indicators.	2003
However, within the Asperger's Syndrome group approximately half had received either a mental_illness classification or a psychopathic disorder classification respectively.	2003
This disorder, what Ian Hacking calls a transient mental_illness, involves nomadic life.	2003
Persons with mental_illness or mental impairments are represented in U.S. criminal justice institutions at a disproportionately high rate.	2003
Whites are homeless longer, are more likely to have mental_illness diagnoses, alcohol problems, and have more chronic conditions than minorities.	2003
Implications of these findings for a model of mental_illness stigma are discussed.	2003
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder continues to be under-diagnosed among individuals with severe mental_illness and substance abuse.	2003
Episode duration in non-psychotic mental_illness is associated with personal characteristics of patients, like age or personality.	2003
In 170 primary care patients who suffered 4171 person-months of non-psychotic mental_illness diagnosed according to Bedford College Criteria, we examined to what extent associations with episode duration of nine person-linked variables including personal vulnerability, coping styles and social support, are mediated by their effects on the occurrence, during episodes, of positive life changes (PLC) assessed using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule.	2003
PLC occurrence during common mental_illness is associated with psychosocial variables which are also overall predictors of episode remission.	2003
This has implications for the management of non-psychotic mental_illness.	2003
Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship of sociodemographic variables, characteristics of mental_illness, and social disability with depression at follow-up.	2003
The QWB-SA is less expensive to administer than the interviewer-QWB and is a useful alternative for determining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments for depression relative to other physical and mental_illness treatments.	2003
A proportion of these individuals may also suffer from symptoms of mental_illness that can go unrecognized.	2003
This article discusses the ways in which client attitudes about mental_illness, psychotherapy, and therapists are shaped by contemporary films.	2003
Five common myths about mental_illness that are promulgated by films are discussed, and the potential applications of films in psychotherapy are reviewed.	2003
Vulnerability, scar, and reciprocal-relations models of depressive symptoms and self-esteem were compared among people with severe mental_illness (SMI; N=260) participating in a partnership-based intervention study.	2003
A research agenda to improve clinicians' ability to assess parental fitness and understanding of how parental mental_illness, mental retardation, or substance abuse might compromise parenting capacities is discussed for forensic purposes.	2003
In this study, we build on previous work by developing and estimating a model of the relationships between causal attributions (e.g., controllability, responsibility), familiarity with mental_illness, dangerousness, emotional responses (e.g., pity, anger, fear), and helping and rejecting responses.	2003
The results from this study also suggest that familiarity with mental_illness reduces discriminatory responses.	2003
Using the 1998 General Social Survey's Pressing Issues in Health and Medical Care module (n = 1,387), I find consistent and substantial black-white differences in a variety of beliefs about psychiatric medications, one of the most common treatments for mental_illness, and the predisposition to use them.	2003
Nearly a fourth (22) of the participants within a research sample of 148 individuals with serious mental_illness reported the death of a loved one as a significant loss, and two thirds of these deaths involved the loss of one or both parents.	2003
Mental health agencies serving people with serious mental_illness should begin to incorporate financial and emotional preparation for parental deaths and bereavement counseling as essential services.	2003
However, research has neither adequately explored nor conceptualized the complex interactions among demographics, homelessness, mental_illness, and service use.	2003
Use of Internet-based support tools for personal recovery from substance abuse, alcoholism, and mental_illness is not new; however, several factors appear to have stalled investigation of the use of these tools in the prevention, outreach, support, recovery, and aftercare for those affected by substance abuse and/or alcoholism.	2003
In contrast, efforts to introduce treatment for offenders with co-occurring mental_illness and substance abuse disorders (COD) are only beginning.	2003
Children with family histories negative for mental_illness rarely received even a low risk rating.	2003
Schizophrenia is a serious mental_illness with a remarkably short recorded history.	2003

Historical perspectives on persons with mental_illness and the burden of caregiving and family resilience are presented.	2003
Each family engages in a process of change that permits occupational adaptation to living with a family member who has a mental_illness.	2003
The results contribute to our understanding of recovery from severe mental_illness and the balance required between occupational therapy intervention and client control over program operations.	2003
Further research is required to fully understand the NISA program and its impact upon persons with severe mental_illness.	2003
Disturbed parent infant interactions are frequently seen in cases of parental mental_illness.	2003
If not carried out accordingly the process of involuntarily detaining a person with mental_illness can be seen as a gross invasion of their dignity and rights.	2003
Stigma causes significant handicap to people with mental_illness.	2003
1998) established the service principle that people with a serious mental_illness in prison in New Zealand have the same right of access to mental_health services as anyone in the community.	2003
The notion of universal rights for people with mental_illness looks ludicrous on consideration of how different rights are depending on the state or territory.	2003
The role of the community management order (CMO) in the management of mental_illness has been associated with controversy.	2003
The article also outlines recent amendments to the ACT's mental_health legislation, briefly touching on cross-border issues, and highlighting the difficulties small jurisdictions sometimes face in catering to the needs of persons afflicted with a severe mental_illness.	2003
This paper begins with a brief review of recent literature about relationships between offending behaviour and mental_illness, classifying studies by the settings within which they occurred.	2003
Women in prison suffer from mental_illness at a rate significantly higher than their male counterparts.	2003
The following questions from the 1999 Health Survey for England were analysed: presence of a self-reported long-standing illness and its nature, numbers of contacts with general practitioner (GP) in the previous 2 weeks, contact with a GP in the previous year for anxiety/depression or a mental, nervous or emotional problem, presence of a self-reported long-standing illness of mental_illness, anxiety or depression, and GHQ12 scores.	2003
A third of cancer respondents reported high GHQ12 scores, but self-reported long-standing illness of 'mental_illness/anxiety/depression' was low .	2003
A model of group psychotherapy for persons with chronic mental_illness is organized to provide members with some autonomy regarding treatment dosage and to address, within the group, problematic social relationships.	2003
Apparently progressive paradigms in mental_health care serve to deny the inherent difficulties and conflicts involved in establishing a therapeutic alliance in cases of severe mental_illness.	2003
Social disadvantage and lack of social support have been identified as important risk factors for the onset and continuance of episodes of common mental_illness.	2003
This study aimed to identify the social precursors to episodes of and recovery from common mental_illness in a large, general population sample over eight yearly intervals.	2003
Common mental_illness was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire.	2003
Three main categories were identified from the interviews: puerperal psychosis as a separate form of mental_illness, loss, and relationships and social rules.	2003
Turning to research on rehabilitation services for those with psychiatric disabilities, studies suggest that service delivery models fail to address needs specific to women with mental_illness in general, as well as those women experiencing severe depression.	2003
Primary care systems are used extensively by women and have the potential to diagnose patients at early stages of mental_illness and to provide evidence-based treatments, but this potential is largely unfulfilled because of significant system-level barriers inherent in primary care.	2003
Studies of involuntary outpatient commitment (OPC) among persons with severe mental_illness have concluded that OPC is only effective in improving treatment outcomes when it is sustained for 6 months or longer and is combined with frequent outpatient services.	2003
These results suggest that, in practice, sustained OPC represents a consensual agreement between clinicians and the court to more intensively address the complex needs of persons with severe and persistent mental_illness.	2003
Finally, this article presents issues not addressed by the empirical studies on outpatient commitment but that need to be addressed in order to understand the choice of using the law to force persons with mental_illness to comply with treatment and receive services in the community.	2003
A total of 185 healthy older adults, primarily in their 60s through 80s, with no history of mental_illness, sleep complaints, or current cognitive impairment, were enrolled in one of eight research protocols between October 1981 and February 1997 that included EEG sleep assessments.	2003
The absence of somatic illnesses and the presence of psychological complaints were the most important factors in the recognition of a mental_illness by the general practitioners.	2003
In the long-term, cognitive-emotional strategies are of great importance, aimed at the re-appraisal of the spouses' mental_illness and a greater sense of self-efficacy in dealing with acute and everyday burden.	2003
The principles of a psychological intervention for psychiatric disorders, nidotherapy, are described following its use in the treatment of patients with severe mental_illness, most of whom also have personality disorders.	2003
We developed a mindfulness-based, self-control strategy for an adult with mental retardation and mental_illness whose aggression had precluded successful community placement.	2003
This center serves as a resource for programs providing care for individuals with co-occurring mental_illness and substance abuse problems, through the provision of training and technical assistance and of research related to evidence-based treatment models.	2003
Professional rehabilitation of people with severe mental_illness is a field of research often left aside.	2003
Despite the aspiration of people with severe mental_illness to employment, their presence in the job market remains low.	2003
Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental_illness within the South African community.	2003
The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental_illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.	2003
These data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental_illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour.	2003
Efforts to prevent suicide should recognize that among homeless people with mental_illness, young-middle-aged (30- to 39-year-old) clients are at greatest risk of suicidal behavior.	2003
Inclusion criteria covered general population based studies with broad social class variation; samples of 3,000 or more adults of working age; identification of mental_illness by validated instruments; social position identified by explicit standard markers; fieldwork undertaken since 1980; published output on key areas of interest.	2003
Stigma research in psychiatry has mainly focused on mental_illness per se.	2003
Both disorders have in common that they are identified by the majority of the public as an indication of mental_illness, that acute stress is most frequently endorsed as cause, that from most respondents a poor natural course is expected which contrasts with a remarkably favorable treatment prognosis, and that people suffering from the two disorders most frequently evoke pity and a desire to help.	2003
One of the most notable differences between the two disorders is that while in the case of schizophrenia, labeling as mental_illness primarily affects respondents' emotional reactions negatively, in the case of major depression a positive effect prevails.	2003
Stigmatization of people with mental_illness has been investigated in numerous studies.	2003
Our study revealed two additional domains in which relatives encounter stigmatization: structural discrimination and public images of mental_illness.	2003
Interpretation of schizophrenia as a mental_illness leads to more negative attitudes and increases the social distance.	2003
The criteria to enter the study were to have a diagnosis of severe mental_illness and a diagnosis of substance dependence according to the DSM-III-R criteria.	2003
The main findings concern prevalence rate of major mental_illness, which was 19.4 for the 12 months before data collection, and 22.6 lifetime prevalence rate.	2003
There is insufficient information on the predictors of parenting difficulties in mothers with severe mental_illness.	2003
Preventative interventions should be targeted at socio-economic difficulties, early detection of psychiatric disorders postpartum and treatment of perinatal mental_illness in the context of the whole family.	2003
Future studies should consider the problems in capturing perceptions of asthma and severity in Puerto Rican children and should continue to explore the relationship between asthma and mental_illness.	2003
It was concluded that a history of pathological gambling is associated with previous attempted suicide, and that the association may be due to a common factor--mental_illness.	2003
The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 12-step and cognitive-behavioral (Self-Management and Recovery Training [SMART]) approaches for persons with a dual diagnosis of serious mental_illness and substance use disorder in an intensive outpatient/partial hospitalization setting.	2003
Serious mental_illness was common.	2003
This study focused on the active attempts of individuals with severe mental_illness to make sense of their disorders and initiate processes of personal growth.	2003
Results reveal that living with severe mental_illness may also generate processes of growth and change.	2003
Despite this, little is known about the effects of disulfiram in persons with alcoholism and severe mental_illness.	2003
We conducted comprehensive chart reviews on 33 patients with alcoholism and severe mental_illness (70 schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) who had been prescribed disulfiram.	2003
The results suggest disulfiram may be a useful adjunctive treatment for alcoholism in patients with severe mental_illness and that controlled research is needed to evaluate its effects in this population.	2003
The gender-specific aspects of drug use in women with serious mental_illness (SMI) remains under-investigated.	2003
We compared the patterns of substance use among patients with severe mental_illness (SMI) served by three community treatment teams, substance users with non-severe mental_illness (NSMI), and substance abusers without mental_illness (no mental_illness: NMI).	2003
This study compared male high-security hospital patients in the English Mental Health Act categories of psychopathic disorder (n=54) and mental_illness (n=61) and the Scottish legal category of mental_disorder (n = 60), using structured instruments to assess personality disorders, psychopathy and Axis I disorders.	2003
The mental_illness and psychopathic disorder categories were not differentiated by personality disorders, psychopathy, or Axis I disorders, except for more lifetime drug abuse and more lifetime and current psychosis among the mentally ill.	2003
Grouping by primary clinical diagnosis of personality disorder or mental_illness produced few differences on Axis I or Axis II, and overall there was a relatively strong correlation between thepresence of an Axis I and an Axis II disorder.	2003
The objective of the study was to develop a screening questionnaire for serious mental_illness in magistrates courts.	2003
Using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ), with second phase interview with the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), 2,920 attendees at two magistrates courts were screened for serious mental_illness.	2003
We concluded that this questionnaire may be a useful adjunct to the screening process for mental_illness in magistrates courts.	2003
Previous studies have shown that social conditions such as poverty may place large segments of the population at greater risk for mental_illness.	2003
Another finding of this study is that after accounting for all of the above factors, there still remain significant differences across Census Divisions in hospitalization rates for mental_illness.	2003
These issues include: access to important information; communication, support and level of involvement with biological families; competing cultural demands; health concerns; and coping with chronic mental_illness.	2003
They discuss accommodation needs in the classroom and the clinic, focusing on time, space, and procedural accommodations; accommodations in test administration procedures; and accommodations for mental_illness and substance abuse.	2003
The purpose of this article is to review the existing literature on HIV antiretroviral adherence, with an emphasis on studies among the triply diagnosed population of people living with HIV/AIDS, mental_illness, and chemical dependency.	2004
Although several studies have examined the relationship between symptoms of depression or psychological distress and medication adherence, this is the first published study of HIV antiretroviral adherence and its correlates among persons diagnosed with serious mental_illness.	2004
Persons with HIV/AIDS who have a serious mental_illness are more highly involved with services than other groups.	2004
Providers identified as resistant to prescribing HAART to medically-eligible HIV-infected illicit drug users were more likely to be non-physicians (AOR=1.89, 95 CI: 1.04-3.46), to work in populations with a high prevalence of both mental_illness (AOR=2.42; 95 CI: 1.11-5.26) and injection drug use (AOR=1.82 95 CI: 1.02-3.25) and were deterred from prescribing HAART by patients' limited ability to keep appointments, (AOR=3.19; 95 CI: 1.39-7.37), alcoholism (AOR=1.92; 95 CI: 1.04-3.55) and homelessness (AOR=1.81; 95 CI: 1.07-3.06).	2004
Providers working in populations with a high injection drug use prevalence commonly reported higher prevalence of non-injection drug use, alcohol problems and mental_illness, and higher antiretroviral therapy refusal rates within their patient populations.	2004
Tobacco dependence among individuals with a mental_illness or an addiction is a tremendous problem that goes largely ignored.	2004
More generally, a sociological perspective on mental_illness perspective brings a particular insight to the field of gambling studies.	2004
In his novel Wheelis dramatizes two questions: Can psychoanalysis enable the person being analyzed to live life fully and well or is psychoanalysis simply a reparative treatment that at best heals mental_illness?	2004
Manifestations of physical difficulties may be better accepted for some cultures than having mental_illness.	2004
Nor is the claim that it is amoral, the product of psychopathology or mental_illness, adequate.	2004
Although not always named, grief is central to the experience of mental_illness for people diagnosed, their families and their friends.	2004
It examines the nature of grief associated with mental_illness, its impact on family members, and why mainstream mental_health services do not directly address it, with suggestions for some therapeutic ways to conceptualise and work with it.	2004
Serious mental_illness is associated with substantial personal and interpersonal distress and life disruption for the sufferer and for his/her family.	2004
A common response to having and caring for a family member with a serious mental_illness is feeling loss and grief.	2004
This paper presents a representative narrative that attempts to capture the essence of the experience as conveyed by 22 parents of adult children with a serious mental_illness.	2004
The phenomenon of catatonic-like states in people with autistic spectrum disorders is discussed in the context of current knowledge about catatonia as it occurs in severe mental_illness and, less frequently documented, in conjunction with developmental_disorders.	2004
Because of the link between suicide and mental_illness, whenever discussion of assisted suicide arises, the possibility that major depression is affecting the decision arises.	2004
Results suggest that patients with both major mental_illnesses and substance abuse disorders have more extensive criminal histories and demonstrate a higher level of risks and needs when compared with patients with major mental_illness alone.	2004
In this study, a total of 248 individuals with co-occurring disorders of serious mental_illness and substance use disorders who had been arrested and booked on misdemeanor charges participated in a post-booking jail diversion program in two urban communities.	2004
The study randomly assigned male inmates with co-occurring serious mental_illness and chemical abuse (MICA) disorders to either modified therapeutic community (MTC) or mental_health (MH) treatment programs.	2004
This quasi-experimental non-equivalent comparison group study examines outcomes for participants in eight programs conducting criminal justice diversion for people with co-occurring serious mental_illness and substance use disorders compared with jail detainees eligible for diversion, but who were processed through standard criminal justice methods without diversion.	2004
Logistic regression analysis confirmed that people with personality disorder were seven times more likely than people with mental_illness to be convicted of a serious offence after discharge.	2004
Consumers attended the sessions readily, demonstrating knowledge of child development and a willingness to confront the difficult issue of informing children about mental_illness.	2004
They reiterated how much they appreciated meeting other parents with a mental_illness.	2004
Service delivery to parents with a mental_illness and their children deserves dedicated funding if their needs are to be addressed and programs carefully evaluated.	2004
Analyses revealed that a great deal of collaboration occurred across a wide range of government and community-based agencies; that collaborative processes were often positive and rewarding for workers; and that collaboration was most difficult when the nature of the parental mental_illness or the need for child protection intervention was contested.	2004
The association between parental mental_illness and child disturbance has been documented although the experience of children coping with such illness has received comparatively little attention.	2004
This article details the impact of parental mental_illness on children of patients attending a community mental_health team.	2004
Subjects were recruited using clinic records indicating multiple family members with mental_illness.	2004
We conclude that although nonrecognition of mental_illness does not appear to be a problem among the families in the area who are not related to the particular clan, within the clan a particular subculture appears to have developed in which perceived need for psychiatric services is related to disruptive behavior.	2004
Thirty CRP patients and 56 mental_illness patients were compared using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Tawain Version (WHOQOL-BREF-TW), and Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI).	2004
There were significant differences in mental_health, personality characteristics, and quality of life between the CRP and mental_illness groups.	2004
CRP is different from mental_illness in many dimensions.	2004
The findings provide the basis for interventions geared to reduce distress and, as a result, to enable students with severe mental_illness to fully utilize the supported education program.	2004
Access to care, innovative treatments, and long-acting antipsychotic medications may arise as an issue of justice and nondiscrimination in the care of mental_illness.	2004
Considerations of justice indicate that long-acting medications may need to be used more frequently and earlier in the course of severe and persistent mental_illness for select patients.	2004
We conclude that great care should be given to ethically important issues surrounding voluntarism, beneficent care, and equitable access to innovative psychiatric treatments, especially for persons who carry the burden of stigma as well as severe and persistent mental_illness.	2004
A review of research pertaining to the aetiology of sexual deviance in schizophrenia was conducted, focusing in particular on the role of early childhood experiences, deviant sexual preferences, antisocial personality traits, psychiatric symptomatology and associated treatment effects, the impact of mental_illness on sexual and social functioning, and other potential contributory factors.	2004
But for a minority, adjustment problems escalate during adolescence and portend the development of serious mental_illness in adulthood.	2004
This study describes the pattern of emotional and behavioural difficulties of children whose mothers have mental_illness, and explores the relationship between childrens behavioural and emotional difficulties and maternal perceptions of attachment.	2004
Thirteen mothers previously admitted to psychiatric hospital for mental_illness completed a measure of their own symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory), their childrens emotional and behavioural problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)), and attachment security (Parent/Child Reunion Inventory) (n = 21).	2004
A case application in the context of an intensive case management program for meeting the needs of clients with severe mental_illness who are homeless is described.	2004
Eight categories were developed and analyzed from the qualitative interviews, including: work/employment difficulties, substance use and/or mental_illness, cyclical nature of homelessness, personal motivation, housing-related issues, lessons learned, relationships with family/friends and relationships with service providers.	2004
This exploratory study examined the frequency and nature of providers' contact with families of persons with severe mental_illness.	2004
Best practice guidelines for the treatment of mental_illness and agency administrators responsible for instituting these guidelines will need to clarify the types of providers who are expected to implement various aspects of family involvement.	2004
The results, apparently contradictory, were reconciled in part by considering the concept of the happy schizotype and of positive outcomes of mental_illness.	2004
The findings showed that a large percentage of juveniles came from unstable families with a family history of criminal convictions, substance abuse, or mental_illness.	2004
The Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST) was developed to provide evaluators with a brief, reliable, and valid screen for malingered mental_illness.	2004
This study examined the initial validity of the M-FAST in a sample of 50 criminal defendants found incompetent to stand trial because of a mental_illness.	2004
The silencing of Walser's unique voice by mental_illness and his disappearance behind the walls of psychiatric hospitals has been considered a tragedy and over the years doubts were raised about the true nature of his illness.	2004
Poor facilities and infrequent visits may be a factor in the early development of stigma towards mental_illness.	2004
Fifty-eight patients with predominately severe mental_illness were admitted to the hostels up to 1999, and demographic/illness data is presented.	2004
The data adds further support to the potential value of 24 hour nursed care for patients with severe mental_illness.	2004
These findings support the importance of expanding our thinking about dimensions of mental_illness and mental_health.	2004
We explored parenting selfconstruals among mothers with serious mental_illness (n= 379).	2004
The BECES was specifically developed for people with mental_illness.	2004
Although the CSES was not specifically designed for people with mental_illness, its items appear relevant for such clients seeking work.	2004
The BECES and CSES demonstrated satisfactory results regarding their validity and reliability with people suffering from mental_illness registered in vocational programs.	2004
Measures included time spent watching television, exposure to specific content, perceived realism of television images, direct experience with a person who had mental_illness, and estimates of and judgements about the dangerousness of people suffering from a mental_illness and their ability to lead a socially integrated and normal life.	2004
Children of parents with mental_illness are an at-risk population according to research on psychiatric outcomes using White, middle-class samples of depressed parents and infants and preschool children.	2004
The current study expands this evidence byexploringwithin-group heterogeneity across psychosocial outcomes, in a racially diverse, low-income sample of adolescent children of mothers with mental_illness (N = 166).	2004
Genes are also seemingly important in a number of behavioural traits including aspects of personality and cognitive abilities, which though not disorders themselves, may influence susceptibility to mental_illness and maladaptive behaviours (Plomin, Price, Eley, Dale and Stevenson, 2002).	2004
The Department of Health is introducing a mandatory reporting system for adverse events in the NHS which will replace the statutory inquiries held when someone with a mental_illness commits a homicide.	2004
The aim was to identify and describe women who gain placement in the health service under the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and to compare those under the MHA classifications of psychopathic disorder (PD) and mental_illness (MI).	2004
Despite manifest need, even among those accepted for in-patient treatment, those with personality disorder appeared disadvantaged compared to those with mental_illness.	2004
The author presents a critical review of Torreys propagandizing for the increased use of psychiatric force and fraud in treating mental_illness, noting that in the past, Torrey had condemned these very practices.	2004
In his book The Death of Psychiatry, Torrey agreed with Szaszs criticism of the concept of mental_illness and opposition to involuntary psychiatric interventions and the insanity defense.	2004
We used transcribed data from two interviews concerning recovery from severe mental_illness: one with an American woman in her early thirties, and the other with a Swedish man in his mid-thirties.	2004
Five investigators analyzed the transcribed data into individual first-person narrative descriptions according to existing empirical phenomenological methods including an independent reading, identification of themes relevant to processes of recovery from severe mental_illness, temporal ordering of themes meaningfully reflecting the sequence of the recounted events, and consensus development.	2004
Our findings support the use of empathic bridges as a methodological tool with the narrative structure of firstperson storytelling, as well as the viability and importance of employing this tool to better understand processes of recovery for persons with severe mental_illness.	2004
We suggest that the use of phenomenologically based investigation in experimental or other traditional research designs provides a more in-depth and complex view of the lives of people with serious mental_illness.	2004
This study expands on earlier research by our group that has shown that contact with people with mental_illness has significant effects on changing stigmatizing attitudes.	2004
First, viewing a videotape of a person with mental_illness that does not disconfirm the stereotype (e.g., the person is manifestly psychotic) does not change stigmatizing attitudes.	2004
Styon's metaphor system is also externally valid, in the sense that it reflects a number of interlocking cultural programs, including patterns of everyday thought, historical stereotypes of mental_disorder, Western conceptions of emotion and mental_illness, and literary traditions of the description of depression.	2004
The present study examined adolescents' willingness to seek help and investigated factors that promote and prevent adolescents from seeking help for a mental_illness from both formal and informal sources.	2004
Secondary school students (254 in number) from schools in Brisbane, Australia completed a questionnaire that examined the relationship between demographic and psychological variables, attitudes toward mental_illness, and willingness to seek help for a mental_illness.	2004
Results suggest that adolescents with greater adaptive functioning, fewer perceived barriers to help seeking, and higher psychological distress were more willing to seek help from formal and informal sources for a mental_illness.	2004
Although attitudes toward mental_illness did not influence willingness to seek help, less stigmatising attitudes were related to higher knowledge of mental_illness, being female, and higher levels of social support.	2004
Experts have debated the influence of mental_illness on decision-making capacity.	2004
This paper reviews concepts of decision-making capacity and existing research on the influence of mental_illness on capacity to consent to research.	2004
Mania may impact freedom to decide, yet paradoxically, manic patients may be less influenced by others and less vulnerable to coercion, undue influence and undue incentives compared to patients without mental_illness.	2004
It is known that mental_illness is associated with increased suicide risk.	2004
Environmental influences on suicidal behaviour are most pronounced early in the suicidal process which, after it has progressed, becomes more autonomous and intricately linked with mental_illness and depression in particular.	2004
This study analyzed the prospective data in the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Follow-up Study (n=1920), a longitudinal population-based study of mental_illness in East Baltimore.	2004
The authors compared 3 approaches to vocational rehabilitation for severe mental_illness (SMI): the individual placement and support (IPS) model of supported employment, a psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) program, and standard services.	2004
This study investigated the efficacy of a 10-session, HIV-risk-reduction intervention with 221 women and 187 men receiving outpatient psychiatric care for a mental_illness.	2004
The processes leading to either result can only be understood by integrating the traditional labeling and psychiatric perspectives with lay understandings of the concepts of mental_illness and nervous breakdowns.	2004
Vignette and laboratory experiments suggest that negative reactions to people with mental_illness are a direct consequence of their symptomatic behavior, but because of their poor external validity, these studies cannot tell us whether widespread negative public reactions to people with mental_illness actually result from observation of symptomatic behavior.	2004
On the contrary, respondents with more personal and impersonal contact perceive people with mental_illness to be less dangerous.	2004
These findings do not support the conclusion that public fear of people with mental_illness is due to the observation of violent behavior.	2004
Each section is illustrated with material drawn from Foster's research on mental_illness and Dorrer's research on women's representations of healthy eating.	2004
The cohorts are older than one would expect from the criminology literature, and, at about 33, the incidence of mental_illness is consistent with some previous studies.	2004
The SCL-8d sum score showed a marked correlation with current and previous treatment for mental_illness.	2004
DSM-IV diagnosis, history of suicide attempt, and control variables such as gender, age, comorbid medical illnesses, developmental_disorder, substance abuse, severity of mental_illness, head injury, and possible cerebral hypoxia were obtained from discharge medical records.	2004
Adolescents living at home were also less likely to receive services, whereas having a parent with severe mental_illness increased (odds ratio = 2.4) the likelihood of service use.	2004
These data support the need for controlled studies in larger populations examining the effects of algorithm-driven disease management programs on the clinical outcomes of children with mental_illness.	2004
Parents of African American, Asian/Pacific Islander American, and Latino youths were generally less likely than parents of non-Hispanic whites to endorse etiologies consistent with biopsychosocial beliefs about mental_illness.	2004
Zulu people consult traditional healers namely diviners, faith healers or herbalists, as well as Western doctors to treat mental_illness and distress.	2004
In three studies, the authors examined the effect of revealing a concealable social stigma--mental_illness--on intellectual performance.	2004
College students either with or without a history of mental_illness (MI) treatment participated.	2004
In Study 1, the type of mental_illness was left unselected.	2004
In 1993 the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) published a landmark report on the findings of a notable inquiry into the human rights of people with a mental_illness.	2004
In this article an appraisal is made of the progress made since the release of the HREOC report to redress this situation, principally within New South Wales, and focusing in particular upon policing issues, and the rights of persons found unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental_illness.	2004
This article explores an area of everyday practice in the mental_health review field that involves significant tensions, not only for tribunal members making important decisions affecting the lives of people with a serious mental_illness, but also others who have a significant vested interest in the review process and the outcomes therefrom.	2004
I propose that this framework can be used to enable some people suffering from severe and incapacitating mental_illness to lead more satisfactory and fulfilling lives through the exploration of delusional formations and the recovery of a non-psychotic part of their selves.	2004
In the general population, seven correlated but separable dimensions of experiences exist that resemble dimensions of psychopathology seen in clinical samples with severe mental_illness.	2004
It is now well documented that both black and white patients with severe mental_illness are likely to use different types of treatment facilities, have different lengths of hospital stays, and receive different types and dosages of psychotropic medications.	2004
Sixteen developed schizophrenia, 10 developed a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 70 had outcomes of other psychopathology, and 146 did not develop a mental_illness.	2004
Children who later developed schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder had lower RTT scores, controlling for verbal IQ and age, compared to those who did not develop any mental_illness.	2004
Main reasons given for nonconsultation were reluctance to acknowledge that a member of their family has a mental_illness, stigma attached to attending mental_health services, and the skepticism about the usefulness of mental_health services.	2004
Vignettes were used to examine the effect of labeling a person with two stigmatized illnesses, HIV disease and serious mental_illness (schizophrenia).	2004
The additive model predicted that stigma associated with combined HIV and serious mental_illness would resemble the simple sum of those for the two conditions.	2004
The discounting model predicted that the presence of serious mental_illness would lead subjects to view the target individual as less responsible for infection, resulting in less stigmatization than given for HIV alone.	2004
Stigmatization was highest in the group labeled with both HIV and serious mental_illness, while stigmatization associated with someone with only HIV was less than those associated with someone with only serious mental_illness.	2004
The authors found a less-than-significant tendency for mental_illness to influence the use of inpatient admissions and self-rated outcome.	2004
Investigators need to embrace the new methods and techniques for the field of research to further increase understanding of the alexithymia construct and its association with physical and mental_illness.	2004
Multi-sensory stimulation provided in a Snoezelen room is being used increasingly for individuals with mental retardation and mental_illness to facilitate relaxation, provide enjoyment, and inhibit behavioral challenges.	2004
We observed aggressive and self-injurious behavior in three groups of 15 individuals with severe or profound mental retardation and mental_illness before, during, and after being in a Snoezelen room.	2004
All participants were receiving psychotropic medication for their mental_illness and function-derived behavioral interventions for aggression, self-injury, or both.	2004
Objective/Method: The use of brief, reliable, valid, and practical measures of substance use is critical for conducting individual assessments and program evaluation for integrated mental_healthsubstance abuse services for persons with serious mental_illness.	2004
This study is to identify culturally relevant treatment methods and to assess the effects of family psychoeducational intervention for Korean Americans who had a family member with mental_illness.	2004
48 Korean Americans with children with mental_illness were randomly assigned to either an experimental group program that provided culturally sensitive psychoeducation or a control group that offered individual supportive therapy.	2004
The two groups were compared on pre- and posttreatment measures of understanding of mental_illness, of family empowerment, and of coping skills.	2004
The findings suggest that a culturally relevant psychoeducational intervention is a useful short-term treatment modality for Korean Americans with children with mental_illness and can be used by social work practitioners who work with Korean Americans in the field of mental_health.	2004
The material presented here is based on a pilot European project (Daphne Project, 2000/EU funding, collaboration of Greece and England) regarding parental mental_illness and childrens welfare and needs1.The presentation focuses upon the responses of a group of teachers working in primary education in relation to identi-.cation issues and assessment needs regarding children who live with a mentally ill parent.	2004
The results showed that although the teachers are able to identify risks and protective factors in the cases of a parental mental_illness, there is a lack of early identi.cation mechanisms in the school setting and an absence of a shared understanding of relevant issues across services and agencies.	2004
Considerations for assessment and treatment in working with paraphilic sex offenders who present with comorbid mental_illness will be offered.	2004
This paper examines the concepts of sexual addiction and mental_illness from the sociological perspectives of symbolic interactionism.	2004
A sociocultural context suggests that concepts of sexuality, addiction, and mental_illness take on different meanings throughout history, and all these categories are subjective and value laden.	2004
Past studies suggest that ethnicity is one such factor, with variations observed in diagnostic rates of serious mental_illness (SMI).	2004
It is unknown whether this reflects higher levels of severe mental_illness in socially fragmented areas.	2004
Ecological associations of psychiatric admission (used as a 'proxy' measure of prevalence of severe mental_illness) and suicide rates with levels of social fragmentation were investigated using negative binomial regression models.	2004
The association between social fragmentation and suicide is not explained by socioeconomic deprivation or the prevalence of severe mental_illness within socially fragmented areas as measured by psychiatric admission rate.	2004
There is increasing interest in the subject because of new service models and the economic cost of unemployment in people with severe mental_illness.	2004
Schizophrenia is the condition most often identified as mental_illness and considered the most serious affliction.	2004
This study set out to produce a mental_illness needs index based on these new data.	2004
Most people suffering from severe mental_illness (SMI) lack paid employment.	2004
Classes were characterized by low risk (prevalence=23), universal high risk (7 ), family conflict (11 ), household substance problems (22 ), non-nuclear family structure (24 ), parent's mental_illness (13 ).	2004
In Japan, where mental_illness has traditionally been stigmatized, detection seems even more difficult.	2004
Service use data were collected at baseline and one year later for participants with severe mental_illness and costs were calculated.	2004
Service users and providers have stated that delivering continuity of care to people with severe mental_illness should be a service priority.	2004
We reviewed literature on continuity of care for people with severe mental_illness (SMI) in order to identify factors that promote and impede this process.	2004
A total of 349 patients with severe mental_illness were selected from general practice lists.	2004
The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of substance misuse among people with severe mental_illness in a large urban centre of a developing country, and to investigate which are the individual characteristics associated with such comorbidity.	2004
The most frequently endorsed reasons for the delay related to lack of knowledge about mental_illness or available treatment.	2004
The majority of women with severe mental_illness are mothers.	2004
However, they described the demands associated with parenting and at the same time coping with severe mental_illness as considerable, and some feared that their children would be adversely affected by their illnesses.	2004
This research was conducted to examine the prediction that accuracy of particular kinds of knowledge of mental_illness would be related to particular attitudes towards people with mental_illness.	2004
An exploratory study examining attitudes to people suffering from mental_illness is presented.	2004
Post hoc analyses revealed that those people who had had personal experience of people with mental_illness were generally more positive in their attitudes towards them.	2004
The clinical treatment of the homeless population typically focuses on issues of mental_illness and drug/alcohol dependency.	2004
Although parent characteristics varied by race, rates of substance abuse, serious mental_illness, domestic violence, and problems meeting basic needs were higher among arrested parents than among other parents.	2004
The Simplifying Mental Illness + Life Enhancement Skills program, for children with a mentally ill parent or sibling, is a 3-day program that aims to increase children's knowledge of mental_illness and to better equip them with life skills considered beneficial for coping in their family.	2004
Data indicated that discrimination caused by mental disability was associated with level of psychiatric symptoms and perceived social rejection as a result of mental_illness, whereas discrimination for other reasons was associated with broader quality of life and social interaction indicators.	2004
The etiology of substance use among persons with severe mental_illness remains unclear.	2004
This study investigates stated reasons for substance use among persons in recovery from co-occurring disorders of serious mental_illness and substance abuse and dependence.	2004
Through focus group interviews, participants were asked to describe the impact over time of having a sibling with severe mental_illness.	2004
Many jail inmates have a history of mental_illness, substance use, and drug-related crime.	2004
Controlling for age, sex, race, education, and program, the odds of an offender with a history of mental_illness being terminated from treatment were nearly three times that of those with no such history.	2004
One of the reasons for this disconnect is stigma; namely, to avoid the label of mental_illness and the harm it brings, people decide not to seek or fully participate in care.	2004
Individuals who are diagnosed with a serious mental_illness encounter a variety of barriers that can impede their career development.	2004
In this article, the career barriers of clients who have a severe mental_illness are reviewed, and a developmental approach to career counseling with this population is described.	2004
Counselors, to their own and their clientsdetriment, have been following the lead of psychiatrists, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to diagnose what psychiatrists have decided to call mental_illness (e.g., schizophrenia, clinical depression, and bipolar disease).	2004
Although psychiatry, psychology, and social work have embraced the medical and mental_illness models, professional counseling continues to have a strong focus on health, wellness, growth, development, and prevention.	2004
The complexity arises from a combination of the fact that PMDD is an invented mental_illness that has never been proven to exist, the aggressive marketing campaign created by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly for its drug Sarafem-which is actually Prozac-to treat this disorder, and the reality that many women who are upset for good reasons believe that receiving the PMDD label is a sign that their reports of their feelings are believed.	2004
Police officers who experienced events assigned to cluster , comprising situations with considerable traumatic potential, had the highest incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental_illness.	2004
Compared to male officers, females were more often diagnosed with other mental_illness, whereas males had a higher incidence of PTSD.	2004
Cluster , which comprised situations of an officer's daily professional life, was not associated with an increased risk of mental_illness.	2004
In cluster , which reflects the most dramatic interference with team relations, other forms of mental_illness were diagnosed at a higher incidence.	2004
Adults with severe mental_illness (SMI) are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS.	2005
This study examines the sexual networks and HIV risk of clients with severe mental_illness in treatment in institutional and community care settings.	2005
Results indicate that community clients are more likely than hospital patients to be currently sexually active and to engage in high-risk sexual behavior whereas hospitalized patients tend to have more transient sexual relationships with partners who also have a mental_illness.	2005
We explored the impact of substance dependence on the efficacy of an HIV sexual risk reduction intervention previously shown to be effective among men with severe mental_illness by comparing rates of high-risk sexual behaviors among men with (n = 26) and without (n = 31) a lifetime history of substance dependence.	2005
These data suggest that among men with severe mental_illness, substance dependence may be a further impediment to HIV risk reduction.	2005
As a population, persons with serious mental_illness (SMI) have an elevated risk for HIV infection.	2005
In this ethnographic study of a mental_health service agency staffed by consumers, or fellow recipients of services for serious mental_illness, the concept of community narrative provides the framework for examining how such an agency preserves its consumer identity while providing services dictated by the established service system.	2005
Locating the agency's narrative in its origins tale, analysis revealed five principles comprising the agency's identity: a normalizing view of mental_illness, a commitment to helping, a dual-valued understanding of the mental_health system, and beliefs in recovery and in the significance of employment as a criterion for recovery.	2005
Many explanations focus on cultural factors: trust and treatment receptiveness, stigma, culturally distinctive beliefs about mental_illness and mental_health, culturally sanctioned ways of expressing mental_health-related suffering and coping styles, and client preferences for alternative interventions and treatment-seeking pathways, as well as unresponsive programs and providers.	2005
This paper describes a 2-day conference at Lesley University for art therapists and people with mental_illness who have experienced art therapy or make art for self-expression.	2005
Extending from an Aboriginal mental_health model are traditional treatments that endeavour to address the cultural and spiritual components of the mental_illness.	2005
Criminal justice, mental_health, and social service professionals face a myriad of role expectations in working with prisoners with mental_illness to facilitate community re-entry.	2005
Current models of re-entry for individuals leaving prison with mental_illness focus on the management and interaction of service systems.	2005
This paper presents a model of prisoner re-entry that incorporates a larger social context, illustrating dynamics related to both individuals with mental_illness leaving prison and their interaction with the community setting.	2005
In recent years, jail diversion programs for people with serious mental_illness and co-occurring substance use disorders have received increasing attention and have rapidly grown in number.	2005
Mental health courts have developed as one response to persons with mental_illness who are involved with the criminal justice system.	2005
The substantial number of persons with mental_illness encountered in many sectors of the criminal justice system has spurred actors from various agencies within that system to take actions aimed at reducing the growth of this population.	2005
These actions have included the development of specialty police units, jail diversion programs, and other mechanisms for channeling persons with mental_illness out of the criminal justice system and into mental_health treatment.	2005
One involves judges dealing with defendants having mental_illness and substance abuse on a case-by-case basis.	2005
Two sets of manifest indicators of AS were constructed using the CASI: three item-parcel manifest indicators: disease concerns, unsteady concerns, and mental_illness concerns; and nine single-item indicators representing each of these three facets of AS.	2005
The new questionnaire replaced the original scales' emphasis on mental_illness with that of brain injury.	2005
Empirical evidence challenges the discriminant validity of the biologically based mental_illness (BBMI) construct.	2005
The aim of this paper is to examine some of the factors that facilitate and hinder interagency collaboration between child protection services and mental_health services in cases where there is a parent with a mental_illness and there are protection concerns for the child(ren).	2005
The results revealed that situations that were ranked most difficult included working with families where there are limited resources, where family mental_illness is present (e.g., threatening suicide), where there is substance use in the home, and where families are unmotivated.	2005
There were two aims: first, to examine the relationship between prior sexual abuse and three types of adult risky sexual behaviors [ ever traded sex for drugs or money, had unprotected sex in the past 6 months, and frequency of unprotected sex in the past 6 months] among persons with severe mental_illness (SMI), and second, to examine the potential mediating effects of adult rape, substance use, and PTSD.	2005
Although foster youth are at increased risk of mental_illness, little is known about need for and actual use of mental_health services by adolescents in the child welfare system.	2005
From a variety of child, caretaker, placement, family environment, and service provision characteristics, seven variables uniquely added to the prediction of maltreatment recurrence: child age, caretaker mental_illness, number of placements, type of placement, length of time in placement, number of children in the home at reunification, and the interaction between household structure at reunification and the presence of siblings returned home with the index child.	2005
As contributors to continuation of treatment, the clinicians recommended more education for clients, their families, primary care physicians, and the general public about mental_illness and mental_health treatment and more bilingual/bicultural and culturally competent counselors.	2005
We identify potential factors contributing to this difference, including greater skepticism about the benefits of psychotherapy for persons with severe mental_illness, overoptimism concerning the clinical benefits of polypharmacy, and the traditional separation between psychology and psychiatry in the United States as compared to Great Britain.	2005
We provide a call to action for the field of clinical psychology to commit to training psychologists in the treatment of severe mental_illness, including CBT, and for the field of psychiatry to incorporate training in CBT as a standard and required competency.	2005
Adults with severe mental_illness (SMI) have been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.	2005
Despite the importance of these issues, little is known about how healthy adults, including workers, perceive and understand ethically important issues in genetic research pertaining to physical and mental_illness.	2005
For this paper, we analyzed a subset of items that assessed attitudes toward ethically relevant issues related to participation in genetic research on physical and mental_illness, such as its perceived importance, its acceptability for various populations, and appropriate motivations for participation.	2005
Our respondents strongly endorsed the importance of physical and mental_illness genetic research.	2005
They viewed participation as somewhat to very acceptable for all 12 special population groups we asked about, including persons with mental_illness.	2005
Patients with severe mental_illness are at increased risk to commit acts of aggression in the inpatient hospital setting.	2005
As part of this larger project, students were asked to imagine their response in 3 situations to a medical student who is discovered to have serious symptoms and potential impairment secondary to mental_illness, substance abuse, or diabetes.	2005
Patients with psychiatric comorbidity scored lower on Positive and Negative Symptom Scale positive symptom subscale (z = -2.84, P <.01), had a greater awareness of their mental_illness (z = -3.44, P <.001) and its social consequences (z = -3.24, P < 0.001), but lower ratings on the overall QOL (z = -3.06, P < 0.01) as well as in the individual domains (physical, psychological health, social relationships, environment, all P < .05) compared with patients without any psychiatric comorbidity.	2005
This work is a key tension for CMHTs who are under pressure to focus on clients with a serious mental_illness as a priority as opposed to clients who might be deemed the psychologically distressed.	2005
People with severe mental_illness and substance use disorders (dual disorder) often have considerable contact with the criminal justice system.	2005
To test the effects of client characteristics on six criminal justice outcomes among homeless (at intake) people with mental_illness and substance misuse disorders.	2005
To review perceptions of barriers to receiving effective mental_health care described by patients who had committed intra-familial homicide in the context of untreated severe mental_illness.	2005
Themes identified included: hiding or minimizing difficulties, lack of knowledge or understanding of mental_illness, loss of control in the context of illness, seduction by the illness, reality-distorting effects of the illness, distortion of interpersonal relationships, diminished ability to trust and difficulty acknowledging need for medication.	2005
Familial transmission of mental_illness is common.	2005
In order to answer this question, we surveyed 667 UK primary school teachers, and for comparison also surveyed 1,340 parents about their perceptions of genetic and environmental influence on personality, intelligence, behaviour problems, learning difficulties, and mental_illness.	2005
The implementation of a recommendation by the President's New Freedom Commission (NFC) to screen the entire United States population--children first--for presumed, undetected, mental_illness is an ill-conceived policy destined for disastrous consequences.	2005
The New Freedom Commission's screening for mental_illness initiative is, therefore, but the first step toward prescribing drugs.	2005
Screening for mental_illness will increase their use.	2005
A total of 31.2 had a lifetime history of any mental_illness (excluding substance misuse, adjustment disorder and personality disorder).	2005
I explore Erikson's dispute of Freud's reductionism and predeterminism, and illustrate Erikson's movement afield of a model of mental_illness, fragmentation, and negation.	2005
In which, 74 had one or more psychiatric symptoms; 30 were previously known with a diagnosis of mental_illness.	2005
As mental_illness continues to be stigmatized in Japan, to tackle graduate students' emotional disturbance, we propose that besides traditional non-anonymous help (face-to-face counseling services) graduate schools should implement more anonymous help (Internet homepage, e-counseling, crisis line).	2005
Children exposed to parental substance abuse, mental_illness, and violence face profound challenges, including increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems, substance abuse, and victimization.	2005
A random sample of 1,123 items was selected for analysis from a pool of 13,389 nonfictional media items about mental_illness collected between March 2000 and February 2001.	2005
An assortment of factors in modern society can be involved in the etiology and treatment of mental_illness.	2005
Although a comprehensive bio-psycho-social approach to mental_illness can help to foster the collaboration of an interdisciplinary treatment team, a heavy emphasis on biological factors or cultural deprivation may reduce the client's feelings of personal responsibility for change.	2005
The prevalence of mental_illness among the mentally retarded is higher than that observed in the nondisabled in the majority of studies on the subject.	2005
While there is an extensive body of literature on the prevalence of mental_illness in various in-patient settings, relatively little attention has been given to prevalence of mental_illness in community settings that provide varying levels of support.	2005
Given the movement of many mentally retarded individuals from large intensive care homes to community supports, more information is needed on the numbers of those diagnosed with mental_illness who are receiving support from various providers.	2005
This study examined prevalence of mental_illness among 179 clients served in several community settings in Marion County Oregon.	2005
This paper reports the case of a man with both serious mental_illness and a life threatening physical illness.	2005
He has correctly asserted that only individuals with a true brain disease should qualify as having a mental_illness but unfortunately ignores overwhelming evidence that schizophrenia has been proven to be a brain disease.	2005
This case study describes the use of a daily raffle to increase attendance in a socialization center for approximately 75 adults diagnosed with mental_illness.	2005
Many of these individuals have, moreover, experienced some form of depression, or have friends of family affected by the stigmatised bio-medical label of &ldquo;mental_illness&rdquo;.	2005
We asked if parenting mediates the effect of MMH problems on academic outcomes even among mothers with serious mental_illness (n=164).	2005
Employees were reluctant to disclose their condition to colleagues due to the stigma attached to mental_illness.	2005
To address this question we administered Lang's Looking at Pictures test, in which a series of pictures are rated for valence (pleasant-unpleasant) and arousal (high-low), to 10 male and 11 female Bosnian refugees suffering from PTSD (DSM-IV criteria) and to control groups of 11 male and 10 female Bosnian refugees with similar trauma exposure but without PTSD or any other major mental_illness.	2005
Many children had family histories of mental_illness, substance abuse and domestic violence.	2005
This study continued the effort to apply social skills training to increase vocational outcomes of people with severe mental_illness.	2005
A range of electronic databases were examined using a predefined search strategy to identify economic studies which focused on services, pharmacological interventions and other treatments for children and adolescents with a diagnosed mental_health problem or identified as at risk of mental_illness.	2005
Mediational analysis found that intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment was explained to a larger extent (62 of the total effect) by the presence of poor parenting styles together with the three significant risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of mental_illness or depression, residing with a violent adult).	2005
Hence, prevention may be enhanced in AP families by the promotion of 'positive parenting' in addition to providing additional support to young parents, tackling mental_illness/depression and domestic violence problems.	2005
Mediational analysis demonstrated that the presence of three significant risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of mental_illness or depression, residing with a violent adult) provided partial mediation of the intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment, explaining 53 of the total effect.	2005
Prevention may be possible, once a history of parental childhood abuse has been identified, by offering services in priority to those families where a parent is under 21 years, has a history of mental_illness/depression and/or there is a violent adult residing in the household.	2005
Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesis that measures of mental_health (i.e., emotional, psychological, and social well-being) and mental_illness (i.e., major depressive episode, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and alcohol dependence) constitute separate correlated unipolar dimensions.	2005
Recent work suggests that predictors of violence are similar for individuals with and without mental_illness.	2005
I test these predictions using the case of mental_illness and a vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey.	2005
Consistent with genetic essentialism, genetic attributions increased the perceived seriousness and persistence of the mental_illness and the belief that siblings and children would develop the same problem.	2005
We applied this approach to conduct a study designed to identify changeable risk factors for violence among high-risk people with mental_illness.	2005
Here the authors present scales measuring functional impairment, a sequela of mental_illness.	2005

Results suggest that more extensive screening and prophylactic interventions for individuals with a history of mental_illness could be beneficial.	2005
Although representative payeeship is prevalent among people with mental_illness and shows promise to positively influence clinically relevant outcomes, research also suggests this legal mechanism could be implemented in ways that are problematic.	2005
The current study examined whether family representative payeeship was associated with elevated risk of family violence perpetrated by persons with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2005
Community-based programs focusing on adolescents who are diagnosed with a mental_illness have been given little attention in the occupational therapy literature.	2005
The second factor consisted of depression, alcohol/drugs, domestic violence, severe mental_illness, HIV/AIDS, and suicide.	2005
Its principal purpose was to provide an independent review of persons involuntarily detained for treatment of mental_illness.	2005
These legislative changes reflected a governmental desire for greater accountability and transparency in the provision of involuntary treatment and care, and a much greater focus on the protection of the rights of people with serious mental_illness.	2005
It is argued that such practices not only bring the area of mental_health into disrepute, they also have the effect of distorting negatively the outcomes of litigation and raise ethical questions about the misuse of mental_illness for personal benefit.	2005
It remains the case that expert mental_health practitioners have an ethical duty to educate both the practitioners who employ them and the courts in general as to the reality of what constitutes mental_illness.	2005
In this paper, I describe and discuss the complexities of being a therapist in a maximum security forensic psychiatric hospital, working with patients who have committed acts of serious violence, and who also suffer from severe mental_illness and personality disorders.	2005
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental_illness.	2005
The notion of mental_illness may be closely related to the social values pertinent in any social context.	2005
The meaning of mental_illness rooted in everyday social psychological processes may be different from scientific and clinical understanding.	2005
In order to examine the common meaning of mental_illness, the relationship between individual knowledge and implicit social knowledge needs to be explored.	2005
This can be achieved by studying the social representation of mental_illness.	2005
This paper provides an understanding of the content of social representation of mental_illness among a group of engineering students, and extends the findings to the broader social context of educated urban middle class youth.	2005
The findings revealed that social representation of mental_illness was structured in terms of social understanding of the causes and consequences of mental_illness.	2005
Further, mental_illness derived its meaning from the expectations and norms of society.	2005
The social definition of mental_illness appeared to be rooted in the social value that nonnormative behaviours that are not in line with the expectations of society are related to mental_illness.	2005
An interesting feature that was observed was the use of narratives to explain the meaning of mental_illness.	2005
Prospective analyses with review of clinical data and behavioral risk factors are necessary to determine why some patients with mental_illness may be less likely to receive cardiac interventions.	2005
Type 2 diabetes is an important medical condition associated with serious mental_illness.	2005

The aims of this study are to examine the level of social distance of students in a Nigerian university towards people with mental_illness and to assess the possible socio-demographic variables involved.	2005
A modified version of Bogardus Social Distance Scale was used to assess the desire for social distance towards people with mental_illness amongst 1,668 students of a Nigerian federal university.	2005
The predictors of high social distance towards the mentally ill include female gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.09, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.69-2.60], studying a non-medical course (OR 4.65, 95 CI 3.01-7.19) and not having a family member with mental_illness (OR 6.73, 95 CI 4.34-10.44).	2005
These studies have suggested that illness variables and situational/personal characteristics of caregivers have a significant influence on how caregivers cope with mental_illness.	2005
The social networks of people with mental_illness have received much attention, but users of day care services have rarely been considered.	2005
To describe the impact of severe mental_illness, personality disorders and demographic variables on psychiatric bed use amongst people in contact with a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT).	2005
Own history of mental_illness and having mentally ill relatives had no major impact on the decisions.	2005
Labeling as mental_illness increased the likelihood that someone suffering from schizophrenia was considered as being unpredictable and dangerous.	2005
There were some differences between respondents who are familiar with mental_illness and those who are not.	2005
The interventions should also be tailored according to whether the target population is familiar with mental_illness or not.	2005
Depression was cited by 5 percent and mental_illness by only 1 percent.	2005
While traditional psychological autopsy studies primarily focus on the administration of psychometric measures to identify any underlying diagnosis of mental_illness for the suicide decedent, we focused our interviews to identify which contacts in the decedent's life recognized risk factors for suicidal behavior, symptoms of mental_illness, as well as barriers to mental_health treatment for the decedent.	2005
The sample consisted of 428 caregivers of adults with severe and persistent mental_illness.	2005
These findings highlight the need to target groups at risk for failure to seek health care and the need to design nonthreatening programs to improve health access for people with mental_illness.	2005
This study tests several hypotheses about the underlying causal structure of the inverse correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and mental_illness.	2005
The modeling strategy used techniques of structural equation modeling and found that SES impacted directly on rates of mental_illness as well as indirectly through the impact of economic hardship on low and middle income groups.	2005

This study explored how individual differences in ego development (Loevinger, 1976) predict the therapeutic goal-setting capacities of adults with chronic mental_illness receiving therapy in a community mental_health setting.	2006
Clinical depression is used to exemplify the usefulness of a sex/gender perspective in understanding mental_illness; and major theories proposed to account for gender differences are critically evaluated.	2006
As new analytic methods become available, it is anticipated that a more fundamental understanding of the biological and behavioral mechanisms underlying sex and gender differences in mental_illness will emerge.	2006
Nonetheless, it is also likely that integration of findings predicated on different conceptual models of the nature and causes of mental_illness will remain a challenge.	2006
This paper explores some of the issues facing people living with mental_illness in the community today and the impact of social policy, legislative change and funding of services on their lives, with particular reference to New South Wales.	2006
However, the level of funding of mental_health services and the resources available to care for people living with mental_illness in the community remain low and, in many cases, inadequate to provide proper quality care for people living with mental_illness.	2006
This review proposes that the stigma attached to being old and having a mental_illness has a disproportionate impact on those who are categorised as both.	2006
A brief historical account is given of what it means to have a mental_illness and, separately, what it means to be old.	2006
Next, the stigmatising attitudes and their implications for the two separate groups will be reviewed, with discussion of the Australian media's portrayal of mental_illness and old age.	2006
Finally, some suggestions are made for beginning to address the double stigma attached to being both old and having a mental_illness in Australia.	2006
The authors adapted it for use with individuals with serious mental_illness who engage in maladaptive behavior and assessed the psychometric characteristics of the new scale (Questions About Behavioral Function in Mental Illness; QABF-MI) in a sample of 135 adults with serious mental_illness from three inpatient psychiatric hospitals.	2006
The results indicated that the QABF-MI has robust psychometric properties and may be useful as a screening tool for determining the nature of the variables that maintain maladaptive behavior exhibited by individuals with serious mental_illness.	2006
Because psychiatric ailments are so heterogeneous, any universal explanation of mental_illness is not likely to have any clinical or theoretical utility.	2006

The first involves a federal court case that addresses the relationship between physical and mental_illness, an issue particularly important to mental_health parity concerning insurance reimbursements.	2006
Published narratives by persons with serious mental_illness eloquently describe the harmful effects of stigma on selfesteem and selfefficacy.	2006
However, a more careful review of the research literature suggests a paradox; namely, personal reactions to the stigma of mental_illness may result in significant loss in selfesteem for some, while others are energized by prejudice and express righteous anger.	2006
We describe a situational model of the personal response to mental_illness stigma based on the collective representations that are primed in that situation, the person's perception of the legitimacy of stigma in the situation, and the person's identification with the larger group of individuals with mental_illness.	2006
Implications for a research program on the personal response to mental_illness stigma are discussed.	2006
The course and outcomes of mental_illness are hampered by stigma and discrimination.	2006

It is concluded that H-S events in New Zealand appear broadly similar to such events in other countries, and that MI plays a significant role in some forms of H-S. However, the relationship between gender, H-S motivation, and mental_illness is clearly complex and in need of further study.	2006
Several studies have found an elevated prevalence of personality disorder diagnoses amongst those individuals with severe mental_illness and criminal populations.	2006
The great majority (93) of the patients were male, typically with a history of major mental_illness and an index offence of either violence or sexual assault.	2006

Guided by theory on stigma, a Likerttype scale was developed to measure 7 factors of attitudes toward people with mental_illness: interpersonal anxiety, relationship disruption, poor hygiene, visibility, treatability, professional efficacy, and recovery.	2007
The scale was validated among college students and community members, measuring attitudes toward people with mental_illness, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.	2007
In a second application, college students completed the scale from their own perspective, then from an imagined perspective of someone with mental_illness, while psychiatric patients completed the scale from their own perspective, then from an imagined viewpoint of someone without mental_illness.	2007

Specifically, the article shows that (a) the medical model does not accurately describe what actually occurs in psychotherapy; (b) the model continues to dominate the field not because of its accuracy but because of its questionable ties with medicine, science, and the health insurance industry; (c) the model obscures the fact that psychotherapy is an interpersonal process, not a medical procedure; and (d) the model fails to account for the fact that the vast majority of clients use psychotherapy for support, guidance, and personal growth instead of treatment for mental_illness.	2007
Along the lines of Thomas Szasz and R. D. Laing, that which is referred to as mental_illness is viewed from a nonjudgmental perspective but with the distinctive feature of suggesting that some people who are considered to be mentally ill may have significant creative artistic potential that can be highly therapeutic, both for them and for society at large.	2007
Beyond narratives of biology and individual personality dispositions, the authors include an anthropologists' eye to viewing mental_illness (Marsella & Yamada, 2011), use sociological explanations of intergroup relations in a multicultural model of acculturation (Berry, 2011) and refer to demographic migration patterns to elucidate culture shock among foreign students (Furnham, 2011).	2007

A hierarchical regression model revealed that presence of maternal mental_illness was a significant predictor of maternal sensitivity, but when speed of memory processing was accounted for, the strength of this relationship was reduced, suggesting that the relationship between maternal mental_illness and motherinfant interaction may be partially mediated by level of cognitive function.	2007
From The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life to Forms of Talk and Gender Advertisements that cover subjects as diverse as self image, mental_illness institutions, gambling casinos, restaurants, espionage tactics, physical deformity and surgery room conversations, Goffman's work written with sly humor and great insight expanded the paradigms of social science beyond their conventional boundaries and canons.	2007
The stigma of mental_illness can be as harmful as the symptoms, leading to family discord, job discrimination, and social rejection.	2007
The existence of mental_illness stigma has been well established, but stigma theory must go beyond demonstrations and mere descriptions.	2007
This yielded a ranking of mental_disorders by degree of stigmatization; most importantly it reveals the structure of mental_illness stigmatization.	2007

This shared interest, together with evidence that serious mental_illness in America has been steadily increasing (Torrey & Miller, 2001, pp.	2007
295299), caused us to wonder what sort of attention mental_illness has received in our major journals of pastoral care from 1950 to the present.	2007
Specifically, has this attention kept pace with the increase in mental_illness?	2007
In fact, the model that posits that measures of mental_illness and health form a single bipolar dimension provided the best fit to the data.	2007
This paper provides data on the APQ collected from a sample of offenders (males and females) without any diagnosed mental_illness.	2007
In Re Langham and Adult Guardian and State of Queensland and Director of Mental Health [2005] QSC 127 the Queensland Supreme Court interpreted the relevant provisions of the Mental Health Act 2000 (Qld) and the Guardianship and Administration Act 2000 (Qld) in the context of the need to administer artificial hydration and nutrition to a patient who, because of his mental_illness, was incapable of making a decision to accept the hydration and nutrition.	2007
Insufficient knowledge about mental_illness and its treatment has been shown to constitute a major barrier to its adequate care for mental_illness in the lay public (LP).	2007
The results indicated that cancer patients' knowledge about mental_illness and its treatment were insufficient.	2007
It suggests that significant numbers of children, living with parents whose mental_illness may be severe and enduring, remain hidden from services.	2007
Commonly used phrases about being in two minds or not being in your right mind show that such experiences are not confined to major mental_illness.	2007
A high proportion of people who have a serious mental_illness also use non-prescribed psychoactive drugs.	2007
In fact recognition of the special relationship between mental_illness and smoking was recently reflected in exemption of psychiatric units from legislation to ban smoking in enclosed public spaces in the UK (UK Smoking Law Resource Centre, 2007).	2007
Cannabis use in particular is widespread, both in the general population but especially so amongst people with serious and enduring mental_illness, particularly psychotic illness.	2007
Previous deliberate self-harm, recent adverse life events, symptoms of mental_illness at last contact with staff and a co-morbid psychiatric disorder were associated with increased risk for suicide.	2007
The sample consisted of patients with severe mental_illness and a designated key worker in the care of 17 community mental_health teams in England and Sweden.	2007
Suicide-related behaviours can provide an insight into the extent of this compelling consequence of mental_illness.	2007
The incidence of psychoses with a first onset in the postpartum period in North West Wales has fallen in the modern period, while the incidence of postpartum psychoses in women with a pre-existing mental_illness remains the same.	2007
The increased risk found in second-generation immigrants cannot be explained by urbanization or parental characteristics pertaining to age, mental_illness, geographic origin or residence abroad during a child's upbringing.	2007
The purpose of this study was to develop an understanding of the design elements that influence the ability of persons with severe mental_illness (SMI) and cognitive deficits to use a website, and to use this knowledge to design a web-based telehealth application to deliver a psychoeducation program to persons with schizophrenia and their families.	2007
Drug dependence and mental_illness were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.	2007
At each time point, participants were classified as no condition, drug dependent, having a mental_illness or dual condition.	2007
Low levels of drug dependence or mental_illness or both were reported at each data point.	2007
Most young people were classified as neither drug dependent nor having mental_illness at baseline and remained so for the 12-month period and few remained drug dependent, or had continuing mental_illness or both.	2007
There was no evidence of a consistent pathway from either drug dependence or mental_illness to co-morbidity.	2007
Most young people reported an absence of mental_illness and/or drug dependence at each time point.	2007
Results provide useful guidance for administrators and clinicians, suggesting that PADs show promise in helping empower people with mental_illness, especially African-American clients.	2007
Further, findings indicate that optimal implementation of PADs will be achieved when facilitated intervention assists people with mental_illness to better understand what PADs are and to remember they have a PAD at the time they are experiencing a psychiatric crisis.	2007
Among these are relatives of patients with mental_illness.	2007
A total of 101 persons (58 males, 43 females), aged 21 +/- 2.6 years, 14.0 +/- 5.4 years postburn of 54 +/- 20 total body surface area, were assessed for serious past and present mental_illness by using a Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) Axis I diagnoses.	2007
The SCID findings demonstrated that the prevalence of any Axis I major mental_illness was 45.5 for the past month (current) and 59.4 for lifetime.	2007
Significant burn injury as a child leads to an increased risk of developing a major mental_illness.	2007
The mental symptoms that can accompany akathisia can be misinterpreted as primary mental_illness.	2007
Clinical suspicion for CVD-related conditions, as well as risk-modification strategies, in patients with serious mental_illness should incorporate differences in prevalence across specific psychiatric diagnoses.	2007
The authors conducted a retrospective review of all patients evaluated through the psychiatric outpatient clinics at Duke University Medical Center from 2001 to 2004 in order to determine the prevalence of comorbid HIV infection and mental_illness.	2007
These areas are: cardiovascular illness and its interplay with depression; risks and predisposing factors in the areas of mental_illness and physical illness; new developments in chronic fatigue syndrome, and new or newly explored/modified (psycho)therapies, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy.	2007
The media are among the primary sources of information on mental_illness for the general public.	2007
This article presents an overview of the representations of mental_illness in Serbian daily newspapers covering a two-year period, 2003 and 2004.	2007
A critical discourse analytic approach was employed to identify the discourses drawn upon to construct versions of mental_illness, the textual strategies through which these versions are constructed, as well as the functions of these specific depictions of mental_illness.	2007
The discourse of dangerousness depicts people with mental_illness as dangerous either by portraying them as committing violent crimes or by conflating them with other stigmatized groups.	2007
The discourse of bio-medicalization constructs mental_illness as a medical disorder, psychiatrists as responsible for its management, and people with mental_health problems as passive sufferers of their condition.	2007
The former two discourses are commonly highlighted in the international literature on media depictions of mental_illness.	2007
The center is focused on helping to implement and evaluate evidence-based employment services provided to individuals with a severe mental_illness.	2007
It has been estimated that over 20 percent of children live in families where one parent has, or has had, a mental_illness.	2007
Parents and children, affected by parental mental_illness, were invited to nominate school personnel who had provided exemplary support to themselves and/or their children.	2007
The strategies and issues for school personnel included: how they became aware that the child had a parent with a mental_illness; how they acquired training in supporting such children; the specific teaching strategies employed; developing relationships; homeschool communication and finally whole school community strategies.	2007
Mothers explanations for the behavior included family dysfunction, childs personality, childs mental_illness, social and cultural influences, and gender power imbalance.	2007
Although men with a mental_illness exhibit similar psychiatric features, this study found they commit sexual violence for a variety of reasons.	2007
A major goal in mental_health research and policy is to identify ways to reduce stigma among persons with mental_illness.	2007
The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence of rejection and devaluation/discrimination in a cross-sectional sample of 200 individuals with experiences of mental_illness and investigate the relationship between sociodemographic and clinical, client characteristics and perceived devaluation/discrimination and experiences of rejection.	2007
Subjects with severe mental_illness tend to cumulate in the group of non-participants, causing selection bias.	2007
Employment discrimination is considered as a major impediment to community integration for people with serious mental_illness, yet little is known about how the problem manifests differently across western and non-western societies.	2007
We developed a lay model based on Chinese beliefs and values in terms of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and folk religions which may be used to explain cross-cultural variation in mental_illness stigma, particularly in the arena of employment discrimination.	2007
Analyses reveal that employers express a range of concerns about hiring an employee with mental_illness.	2007
Although some concerns were raised with equal frequency across sites, comparisons showed that, relative to US employers, Chinese employers were significantly more likely to perceive that people with mental_illness would exhibit a weaker work ethic and less loyalty to the company.	2007
Cultural differences existed among employers which supported the lay theory of mental_illness.	2007
Evidence suggests that substance abuse negatively affects both psychiatric symptom severity and quality of life (QOL) in people with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2007
Immigrants in Sweden have a higher rate of mental_illness than the native Swedes.	2007
This study investigated to what extent the association between immigrant status and mental_illness can be explained by a different distribution of known risk factors for impaired mental_health between groups of immigrants and persons born in Sweden.	2007
The study is based on data from the Swedish PART-study, designed to identify risk factors for, and social consequences of, mental_illness.	2007
The occurrence of mental_illness among immigrants and native Swedes were compared not adjusting and adjusting for indicators of socioeconomic advantage/disadvantage (education, income, labour market position, etc).	2007
The findings in this study suggest that the association between immigrant status and mental_illness appears above all to be an effect of a higher prevalence of social and economic disadvantage.	2007
It had been suggested that those more knowledgeable about mental_illness are less likely to endorse negative or stigmatizing attitudes.	2007
Medical doctors (n = 312) from eight selected health institutions in Nigeria completed various questionnaires on knowledge and attitude towards people with mental_illness.	2007
High social distance was found amongst 64.1 and the associated factors include not having a family member/friend with mental_illness (OR 7.12, 95 CI 3.71-13.65), age less than 45 years (OR 2.33, 95 CI 1.23-4.40), less than 10 years of clinical experience (OR 6.75, 95 CI 3.86-11.82) and female sex (OR 4.98, 95 CI 2.70-9.18).	2007
Culturally enshrined beliefs about mental_illness were prevalent among Nigerian doctors.	2007
Factors investigated were demographics, exposure to mental_illness, beliefs about dealing with mental_illness alone, and personal and perceived stigmatising attitudes.	2007
Predictors of rating a website and book as helpful were identical; younger age, belief that it is helpful to deal with mental_illness alone and being presented with depression and early schizophrenia vignettes in comparison to chronic schizophrenia.	2007
While many people feel that information delivered face-to-face is likely to be helpful, websites and other tools that maintain anonymity may be preferred by those who choose to or find themselves dealing with mental_illness alone.	2007
Teams comprising many patients with severe mental_illness may constrain the therapeutic relationship.	2007
We determined whether patients with serious mental_illness were more likely to report low social support than those without serious mental_illness.	2007
We conducted a national, cross-sectional study of VA patients in Fiscal Year 1999 who were diagnosed with a serious mental_illness, as well as a random sample of VA patients without a diagnosis of serious mental_illness (N = 8,547) from the National Psychosis Registry who also completed the VA's Large Health Survey of Veteran Enrollees (LHSV) 9-item questionnaire on social support.	2007
In multivariable models adjusting for patient factors, patients with serious mental_illness were more likely to report low instrumental support, e.g., having no one to help with chores (OR = 1.41, p < 0.001) and low emotional support, e.g., having no one to relax with (OR = 2.05, p < 0.001).	2007
Patients diagnosed with serious mental_illness reported low social support across different dimensions.	2007
Recovery-oriented services for persons with serious mental_illness should focus on improving and sustaining emotional and instrumental supports for this vulnerable population.	2007
A poorer outcome was associated with: externalizing as opposed to emotional symptoms, reading difficulties; living in a single-parent or reconstituted family at baseline; and after exposure between Time 1 and Time 2 to parental separation, parental mental_illness, child illness, and loss of a close friendship.	2007
It is suggested that the stigma of mental_illness is a considerable barrier to mental_health treatment.	2007
This article reports data from a study that randomly assigned male inmates with mental_illness and chemical abuse (MICA) disorders (n = 139) to either a Modified TC (MTC) or a comparison group.	2007
Create a taxonomy and examine the predictors of the often co-occurring conditions of substance use disorders and mental_illness in veterans with diabetes.	2007
Thirty-one percent of patients with diabetes were diagnosed with either mental_illness or substance use and had higher rates of diabetes-related complications.	2007
Women were more likely to have serious mental_illness; African Americans and Latinos more likely to have drug and/or alcohol use.	2007
Prevalence of substance use disorder and mental_illness differed by socio-demographics, suggesting the need for tailored diabetes management interventions.	2007
A multiperspective account of the issues and subsequent interventions for families affected by parental mental_illness is reviewed in this article, including those involving the children, the parent with mental_illness, other family members, agencies, and society in general.	2007
An overview of various issues and interventions for families affected by parental mental_illness is seen as potentially useful for practitioners and program developers as well as providing a resource bank for systematic evaluation, research, and policy.	2007
A review of 16 controlled outcome evaluations of housing and support interventions for people with mental_illness who have been homeless revealed significant reductions in homelessness and hospitalization and improvements in other outcomes (e.g., well-being) resulting from programs that provided permanent housing and support, assertive community treatment (ACT), and intensive case management (ICM).	2007
Directives for next steps in the current research agenda are offered in efforts to broaden the direct evidence base for treating vulnerable urban women at high risk for depression and other forms of mental_illness.	2007
This longitudinal study examined the personal strivings of young adults coping with mental_illness, parents' hopes for their children, and attributes that adults and parents give to their strivings and hopes.	2007
It examined the socioeconomic attributes of the neighborhoods of a sample of supervised houses and apartments for persons with severe mental_illness in seven states, and the factors associated with the choice of those locations.	2007
Comorbidity between drug abuse and mental_illness is very common, but the association of such comorbidity with specific responses to drugs of abuse remains obscure.	2007
Individuals with schizophrenia and severe mental_illness smoke cigarettes at rates that well exceed the general population.	2007
Little is known about the correlates and sequelae of increased smoking severity on persons with severe mental_illness.	2007
This study confirms high rates of heavy smoking among persons with severe mental_illness.	2007
It stems from two immutable facts: (a) The prevalence of mental_illness among justice-involved youths is alarmingly high, and (b) mental_illness by itself is a risk factor for false confession.	2007
However, the prevalence of flourishing is barely 20 in the adult population, indicating the need for a national program on mental_health promotion to complement ongoing efforts to prevent and treat mental_illness.	2007
This study reports the construct and convergent validities of the Ways of Mattering as well as the internal consistency of each of its subscales for people with mental_illness who were registered in supported employment programs.	2007

Biological determinants of mental_illness in children and adolescents, such as genetic predisposition, gene x environment interactions, structural or functional brain abnormalities, and endocrine dysfunction are poorly understood.	2007
People with severe mental_illness (SMI) have high rates of substance use disorders.	2008
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mental_illness, substance use, trauma and abuse, family dysfunction, poor parenting, school problems, and aggressive behavior.	2008
Disease concerns, but not unsteady, mental_illness, or social concerns, moderated the association between smoking and symptom level.	2008
The term AD was used in only 4 of the responses, although 39.4 of the respondents believed it was a mental_illness.	2008
The analysis is based on a nationally representative sample of 583 Caucasian and 82 African American participants in a vignette experiment about people living with mental_illness.	2008
Since the 1950s, people with mental_illness and their families have been organizing a wide range of self-directed, mutual support oriented initiatives, including self-help groups, nonprofit organizations, and businesses.	2008
The 12 studies meeting these criteria provide limited but promising evidence that mutual help groups benefit people with three types of problems: chronic mental_illness, depression/anxiety, and bereavement.	2008
Given the rather significant global population of bloggers (those who post internet journal entries) and readers, and the seemingly intractable problem of mental_illness worldwide (according to the World Health Organisation, the global burden of mental_illness accounts for more than the burden of all cancers put together), the possibility of blogging as self-therapy deserves greater attention.	2008
Individuals with mental_illness receive harsh stigmatization, resulting in decreased life opportunities and a loss of independent functioning over and above the impairments related to mental_disorders themselves.	2008
We begin our review with a multidisciplinary discussion of mechanisms underlying the strong propensity to devalue individuals displaying both deviant behavior and the label of mental_illness.	2008
We next focus on several issues of conceptual and practical relevance: (a) stigma against less severe forms of mental_disorder; (b) the role of perceptions of dangerousness related to mental_illness; (c) reconciliation of behavioral research with investigations of explicit and implicit attitudes; (d) evolutionary models and their testability; (e) attributional accounts of the causes of mental_illness, especially to personal control versus biogenetic factors; and (f) developmental trends regarding stigma processes.	2008
We conclude with a brief review of multilevel efforts to overcome mental_illness stigma, spanning policy and legislation, alterations in media depictions, changed attitudes and practices among mental_health professionals, contact and empathy enhancement, and family and individual treatment.	2008
The latter scenario could arise if the combination of some biological factor associated with older brothers and some biological factor associated with non-right-handedness is so toxic that it kills the fetus or predisposes the individual to a condition (e.g., mental retardation, major mental_illness) that makes him less likely to be available for research recruitment at Gay Pride parades (etc.)	2008
This study sought to investigate the use of art therapy to assist a young person with mental_illness making a transition from long-term inpatient care to a psychosocial residential rehabilitation setting.	2008
We argue that rural mental_health research has been hampered by a simplistic view of social stigma of mental_illness and that a more thorough conceptualisation of the phenomenon is needed.	2008
This science has important implications for understanding addiction's comorbidity in mental_illness and reducing associated public health and criminal justice burdens.	2008
If connectionist computational models explain the acquisition of complex cognitive skills, errors in such models would also help explain unusual brain activity such as in creativity as well as in mental_illness, including childhood onset problems with social behaviors in autism, the inability to maintain focus in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the lack of motivation of depression disorders.	2008
At present, the law draws a distinction when assigning criminal responsibility to those who commit offences while experiencing psychotic symptoms: if the symptoms are believed to arise because of ingesting drugs (an external cause), the offender is generally convicted of the offence; if the symptoms arise from a mental_illness (an internal cause), the offender may be afforded a defence of insanity.	2008
Three participants from a vocational community centre with mild intellectual disability, comorbid mental_illness, and challenging behaviour, participated in 15 individually delivered sessions of social problem-solving training.	2008
Applying this approach to neurological and also mental_illness can reveal distinct disturbances within neural networks being present in these disorders and also the impact of medication on this circuitry.	2008
To compare diagnostic and treatment-related differences between persons participating in treatment for dually diagnosed substance use disorders and severe mental_illness who have or do not have a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI).	2008
Seventy-two percent of participants in treatment for dually diagnosed substance use disorders and severe mental_illness reported a history of at least one TBI.	2008
Individuals dually diagnosed with substance use disorders and severe mental_illness may have a high rate of TBI, which in turn could contribute to important clinical and treatment differences.	2008
Despite growing research on the treatment of severe mental_illness, little attention is devoted to the internal experience of therapists who strain to ward off disillusionment and despair as they try to hold out hope and reconfigure expectations over a course of therapy that may extend many years.	2008
The relative disappearance of commentary about this phenomenon, a legacy of the biological revolution in psychiatry, shields practitioners from self-examination and prevents a more penetrating look at the inner workings of psychotherapy in the treatment of long-term mental_illness.	2008
Scholars are giving increased attention to the need to incorporate research on more basic developmental processes into new paradigms for understanding and treating mental_illness in children and adolescents.	2008

This study aimed to investigate children's thinking about mental_illness by employing a well-established framework of adult illness understanding.	2008
The study adopted a semistructured interview technique and a card selection task to assess children's responses to causes, consequences, timeline and curability of the different types of mental_illness.	2008
Results indicated a developmental trend in the children's thinking about mental_illness; there was an increase in the children's understanding of the causes, consequences, curability and timeline of mental_illness with age.	2008
The older children demonstrated a more sophisticated and accurate thinking about mental_illness compared with the younger children, who tended to rely on a medical model in order to comprehend novel mental_illnesses.	2008
The Leventhal model provides a useful framework within which to investigate children's knowledge and understanding of mental_illness.	2008
This paper provides a qualitative analysis of mental_health and child protection professionals' perceptions of best practice when working on cases where there is parental mental_illness and there are protection concerns for child(ren).	2008
If these mothers are helped to achieve the multiple goals of mental_health, sobriety, economic well-being, positive social skills, and secure attachment relationships with their children; they can begin to break the powerful cycle of intergenerational poverty, mental_illness and maltreatment that plagues our society.	2008
A case study of a hospital-based treatment for an adult with serious and persistent mental_illness who engaged in aggressive and sexually inappropriate behaviors is presented.	2008
The two dimensions of structural imbalance are, first, that some people with no clinical mental_illness consume mental_health services and, second, that other people have clinical manifestations of mental_illness and (for various reasons) do not consume mental_health services; the present study shows how the situations coexist.	2008
Confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized two-continua model of mental_health and mental_illness found in the USA.	2008
There remains a fundamental need for assessment of sociocultural issues that have been linked with the expectations, needs, and goals of culturally diverse consumers with severe and persistent mental_illness.	2008
Emphasizing competent clinical assessment skills will ultimately offer a strategy to address disparities in treatment outcomes for understudied populations of culturally diverse consumers with severe and persistent mental_illness.	2008
This article provides a conceptual paradigm for understanding how culture influences six mental_health domains, including (a) the prevalence of mental_illness, (b) etiology of disease, (c) phenomenology of distress, (d) diagnostic and assessment issues, (e) coping styles and help-seeking pathways, and (f) treatment and intervention issues.	2008
Despite an increasing emphasis on the importance of vocational success to the quality of life of individuals with mental_illness (Bond, Drake, & Becker, 2008), minimal work has examined the impact of cognitive behavioural interventions that focus on vocational stressors.	2008
Vocational stressors commonly faced by persons with mental_illness include difficulties with work task completion, obtaining employment, and coping with interpersonal stressors (Becker et al.,	2008
The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioural therapy group intervention that targets vocational stressors for individuals whose vocational functioning had been significantly impacted by mental_illness.	2008
First, most agencies lack formal policies on officers' supervision of probationers with mental_illness (PMIs).	2008
From the moment of their admission to prison, offenders with mental_illness represent a population with special service needs.	2008
From this services perspective, the present study draws population estimates of mental_illness indicators for newly committed offenders using operational data sources available within a correctional system.	2008
In a cohort of 2,855 male and female offenders across three security levels and five regions of the United States, several indicators of mental_illness (e.g., diagnosis of serious mental_illness, inpatient psychiatric care) were aggregated.	2008
Findings suggest that 15.2 of newly committed offenders at low-, medium-, and high-security facilities may require some level of mental_health services to address a need related to mental_illness.	2008
From interviews with 87 of these inmates, combined with reviews of medical and institutional behavior records, it is concluded that 45 of supermax residents suffer from serious mental_illness, marked psychological symptoms, psychological breakdowns, or brain damage.	2008
Inmates suffering with mental_illness or who are at risk from such confinement and juveniles are the exceptions, and they have had some success in the courts.	2008
This study sought to investigate the rates and correlates of homelessness (i.e. living on the street or in a homeless shelter), including mental_illness, among US adult state and federal prison inmates (ASFPIs).	2008
Logistic regression was then used to examine the association of homelessness among ASFPIs with factors including symptoms, treatment of mental_illness, previous criminal justice involvement, specific crimes, and demographic characteristics.	2008
Prior incarceration, mental_illness, substance abuse and disadvantageous socio-demographic characteristics were all found to be associated with homelessness among prison inmates, suggesting that there are several important factors in addition to efforts to survive with limited resources through criminal acts that influence the rates of homelessness among incarcerated individuals.	2008
Both groups had high levels of overall mental_illness severity and functional impairment.	2008
OCD among African Americans and Caribbean blacks is very persistent, often accompanied by other psychiatric disorders, and is associated with high overall mental_illness severity and functional impairment.	2008
Individuals diagnosed with severe mental_illness have higher rates of alcohol and substance misuse than the general population.	2008
This study seeks to document patterns and reasons of leaving housing, and identify factors associated with different types of exits for a cohort of 452 residents with serious mental_illness entering supported independent living (SIL) in Philadelphia, PA.	2008
Implications of the findings for the development of permanent supportive housing for persons with serious mental_illness are discussed.	2008
This approach differs from biomedical models, which see Internet suicide as a form of mental_illness, similar to drug or gambling addiction.	2008
This approach draws on anthropological and sociological models of the cultural construction of social problems and argues that concerns with Internet addiction are part of a more general moral crisis faced by Chinese, in response to rapid consumerism, the medicalization of mental_illness, and new forms of public and publicity.	2008
A large percentage of filicides is associated with mental_illness, particularly postpartum depression and psychosis.	2008
Fourth, low self-control was overwhelmingly the strongest predictor of career criminality and far exceeded the impact of age, race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, mental_illness, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, and trauma experience.	2008
The connections between internment and mental_illness-as well as isolation and race, gender, and class-are explored.	2008
Demographic information showed that one quarter of the sample had symptoms of a mental_illness and one quarter had a history of substance abuse.	2008
Potential explanations for regional and cross-national variations in trends over time in elderly suicide rates include cross-national differences in trends over time in the prevalence of mental_illness in the elderly, socioeconomic factors, cultural factors, the availability of appropriate healthcare services, and public health initiatives to improve the detection and treatment of mental_illness, mental_health and suicide prevention.	2008
This article sets out the general professional and Irish statutory obligations to provide physical health monitoring services for individuals with serious mental_illness.	2008
Over recent years in England there has been widespread development of assertive outreach teams supporting patients with severe mental_illness living in the community.	2008
Individuals were to be committed to the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum if they were declared guilty but insane at time of trial or offence, or if they developed mental_illness and became difficult to manage while in detention elsewhere.	2008
In this study we explored young men's attitudes towards mental_illness and mental_health services, as well as their willingness to use these services.	2008
Many students did not recognise depression as being a mental_illness and could not differentiate between depression and feeling sad.	2008
This study shows that a lack of knowledge and understanding about mental_illness, combined with prejudice against mental_health professionals and fear of stigma, are important barriers to access of mental_health services for young men.	2008
To describe the characteristics of the patient groups with severe and enduring mental_illness residing in high support community residences in Dublin North East Mental Health Service and the impact of a rehabilitation and recovery service on their outcomes since the instigation of that service.	2008
This highlights the need to ensure that a range of rehabilitation services from inpatient to supported community placement are provided to meet the needs of patients with severe and enduring mental_illness with complex needs.	2008
There has been an increase in the proportion of patients admitted suffering with severe mental_illness.	2008
An increased provision of regular and structured psychiatric input to the prisons has facilitated the identification of prisoners with mental_illness.	2008
Szasz's core thesis may be succinctly rendered: mental_illness is a myth, a metaphor which serves only to obscure the social and ethical problems in living we face as human beings.	2008
Materials and Methods Two hundred and ten caregivers of people with intellectual disability (CPID) and 108 caregivers of people with mental_illness (CPMI) were recruited to validate the 22item Affiliate Stigma Scale with caregiving stress, subjective burden and positive perceptions.	2008
Children with family histories of mental_illness and those who were Medicaid recipients were also more likely to use medications.	2008
During the same period, childrens exposure to risk (i.e., parental substance abuse, mental_illness, and domestic violence) dropped markedly; however, there was an upward trend in the prevalence of child emotional and behavioral problems.	2008
During these decades, many psychiatrists, including neoFreudians like Sullivan, considered homosexuality a mental_illness.	2008
This framework has broad ramifications, ranging from clinical psychology and mental_illness, to the study of consumer behavior.	2008
Many useful papers help to integrate the biological, psychological, and social or cultural factors that often play a role in the etiology and treatment of specific forms of mental_illness.	2008

Patients with a more religious upbringing expressed a greater sense of stigma towards mental_illness; however, patients who now had a more religious affiliation did not.	2008
Findings from this study support the hypothesis that a stigma of mental_illness may be a deterrent to the use of a public mental-health clinic for religious Jews in Israel.	2008
Ultra-Orthodox Jewish patients (especially non-Hasidic) used a nonreligious explanatory model (perception and understanding) of mental_illness more often than a religious explanatory model.	2008
Researchers have attempted to elicit the explanatory models used by different populations to understand mental_illness, since these models can influence how populations use mental-health treatment.	2008
Factor-analytic techniques revealed five factors which were explained as a Traditional Christian and a Deliverance etiology, both models implicating religious causes for mental_illness, a Poor Coping and Internal Conflicts etiology, essentially being psychological explanations and an Organic etiology model.	2008

A significant interaction between mental_illness at time of death and gender indicated that diagnosis was an important predictor of suicide in males (OR 14.0, 95 CI 2.6-76.5) but not in females (OR 0.3, 95 CI 0.0-3.6).	2008
Both low income and debt are associated with mental_illness, but the effect of income appears to be mediated largely by debt.	2008
Crime may be associated with a less structured society, less social integration, and feelings of less security and greater distress among citizens, which characteristics may lead to mental_illness and subsequent suicide.	2008
Although a considerable amount of research has explored the effects of physical activity on mental_health, the voices of people with mental_illness have been largely excluded from published reports.	2008
Through this study we aim to foreground service users voices in order to shed light on the personal and subjective nature of the relationship between physical activity and serious mental_illness (SMI).	2008
We hope to: provide potentially motivating physical activity success stories for others who live with SMI; increase awareness among mental_health professionals of the possibilities of physical activity; and provide an empathetic understanding of possibilities and problems of living with SMI which may help challenge the stigma surrounding mental_illness.	2008
It has been suggested that mental_illness threatens identity and sense of self when one's personal story is displaced by dominant illness narratives focussing on deficit and dysfunction.	2008
We used an interpretive approach which included semi-structured interviews and participant observation with 11 men with serious mental_illness to gather stories of participants sport and exercise experiences.	2008
This study provides an alternative perspective on how sport and exercise can help men with serious mental_illness by providing the narrative resources which enabled participants to re-story aspects of their lives through creating and sharing personal stories through which they rebuilt or maintained a positive sense of self and identity.	2008
Although probability-of-commission estimates were as high in all of the conditions involving a confession, conviction rates were marginally higher when the disputed confession involved mental_illness or interrogation-induced stress than when there was no confession, yet did not differ when the disputed confession involved a medical disorder or there was no confession.	2008
Research has found that a substantial proportion of individuals with mental_illness have high morbidity and mortality rates, and high under-diagnosis of major physical illnesses.	2008

This paper presents findings from a study that investigated the health care service needs of people with mental_illness (n = 20), and views from health care providers (n = 16) regarding access to these services by people with a mental_illness.	2008
Reasons for these findings and strategies to address these problems so that there is better access to health care services for people with mental_illness are discussed.	2008
We aim to elicit how far the public has incorporated Freudian theory in its understanding of mental_illness in different countries, focussing on the unconscious conflict as a possible cause of mental_disorders.	2008
Although psychoanalytical concepts warrant consideration when exploring patients' causal beliefs about mental_illness, psychiatrists should focus on the subjective meaning of seemingly psychoanalytic phrases.	2008
Individuals living with HIV often have complicated histories, including negative experiences such as traumatic events, mental_illness, and stigma.	2008
This article presents a review of the literature regarding the following psychosocial factors as they relate to HIV/AIDS in the US and globally: traumatic events; mental_illness, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder; lack of trust in the healthcare system and government; and experiences of stigma among individuals with HIV disease.	2008
Traumatic events, mental_illness, distrust, and stigma have also been linked with poorer adherence to medication regimens and HIV risk behavior.	2008
Lower IQ measured at ages 18 to 20 was weakly associated with increased prevalence of smoking, independently of indicators of mental_illness and social misbehavior measured in late adolescence.	2008
Diabetes is a pervasive metabolic disease that disproportionately affects persons with serious mental_illness.	2008
Medical providers need to be attentive to the burden of disease experienced by patients with both serious mental_illness and diabetes.	2008
The results suggest that migration biography should not only be considered as affecting vulnerability in the genesis of a mental_illness, but rather be classified as a factor of at least as much relevance for therapeutic situations as the usually named cultural diversity: summarizing the results of the qualitative content analysis of the entire treatment courses more cases were influenced by migration specific aspects rather than culture specific aspects.	2008
In recent years, researchers have investigated the psychological effects of exercise for people with mental_health problems, often by focusing on how exercise may alleviate symptoms of mental_illness.	2008
Drawing on life history data, I conducted an analysis of narrative to explore the narrative types that underlie Ben's stories of mental_illness and exercise.	2008

This paper sought to investigate how the sexuality of patients and their partners is affected by mental_illness and their experience of needing support from psychiatric services.	2008
Our findings highlight the complex nature of dysfunctional sexuality, involving not only the patients who suffer from severe mental_illness but their partners as well.	2008
Empirically, mental_health and mental_illness are not opposite ends of a single measurement continuum.	2008
According to the modified labeling theory of mental_illness, when an individual is diagnosed with a mental_illness, cultural ideas associated with the mentally ill become personally relevant and foster negative self-feelings.	2008
Although studies have shown that views about causation are strongly associated with stigmatising attitudes to mental_illness, none have examined the correlates of such causal views in order to identify the population needed to be targeted for education.	2008
To evaluate the pattern and correlates of lay beliefs regarding the causes of mental_illness in south-western Nigeria.	2008
A cross-sectional survey in which respondents (n = 2,078) were administered questionnaire detailing sociodemographic variables and perceived causation of mental_illness.	2008
While urban dwelling, higher educational status and familiarity with mental_illness correlated with belief in biological and psychosicial causation, older age, rural dwelling, and lack of familiarity correlated with a belief in supernatural causation.	2008
Anti-stigma programmes need to incorporate these factors in order to identify the population at risk, who will actually benefit from targeted education regarding the causes of mental_illness.	2008
Both individual and familial histories of mental_illness are substantial risk factors for suicide in young people.	2008
Child and adolescent mental_health service units (CAMHS) play an important role in the supply of services to children and adolescents with mental_illness.	2008
Such knowledge can guide prevention strategies emphasizing detecting and treating mental_illness and controlling access to means.	2008
Divorce has been established as an adverse social consequence of mental_illness.	2008
Importantly, these couples showed no evidence of a multiplicative effect of mental_illness on rates of subsequent divorce or separation.	2008
People in the community were more likely to express negative views about mental_illness.	2008
Relatives of patients with psychosis wanted more support from mental_health professionals and community in combating stigma against mental_illness.	2008
Early recognition and adequate treatment of individual mental_illness contribute to prevent youth suicide attempts.	2008
There appears to be an independent effect of familial suicidal behaviour as well as familial psychopathology on youth suicide attempt beyond the transmission of mental_illness.	2008
A bit more than half of the respondents believed it was a mental_illness.	2008
Factors most influencing responses about causes were years of schooling and identification as a mental_illness.	2008
Past research on stigmatization of the mentally ill has emphasized the importance of beliefs about mental_illness in determining preferred social distance to those with such illnesses.	2008
Perceived social norms are an important contributor to an individual's social distance to those with mental_illness.	2008
They also tended to equate mental_illness with psychosis.	2008
We examined the relationship between body mass index and mental_health in a population-based study of adults that included the full range of body weights, three disorder types, and three levels of mental_illness severity.	2008
Findings differed by type and severity of mental_illness and by sex and age.	2008
These analyses highlight the importance of considering type of mental_illness, level of severity, sex and age when examining the relationship between BMI and mental_health.	2008
The degree to which the mental_health services are utilized depends partly on the public's views about mental_illness and the public's perceptions about the roles of the providers of the services.	2008
Therefore, effective implementation of Kenya's mental_health policy during the 1990s was likely to be influenced in some degree by how far it was compatible with the public's concepts of mental_illness.	2008
The aim of this study was thus to explore the conceptual model underlying the views of the Kenyan public about mental_illness and relate it to the national mental_health policy of 1994.	2008
Results showed that the public subscribed to a biopsychosocial view of mental_illness and health care, which was indeed compatible with the mental_health policy, which was rooted in the concepts of Primary Health Care, as articulated at Alma Ata.	2008
This grass-roots level mental_health awareness programme considerably increased use of community-based mental_health services in a part of Nigeria where knowledge about treatability of mental_illness was limited.	2008
This research aims to compare the effectiveness of two methods of teaching psychopathology in reducing stigma toward mental_illness.	2008
Together, these studies suggest that traditional methods of teaching psychopathology do not lessen mental_illness stigma, a serious concern that can potentially be reconciled by incorporating more person-centered instructional methods.	2008
The findings provide information for the prevention of mental_illness among migrant workers in China.	2008
Psychiatric pharmacogenetics involves the use of genetic tests that can predict the effectiveness of treatments for individual patients with mental_illness such as drug dependence.	2008

The findings underscore the importance of exploring how stigma attached to mental_illness intersects with other stigmatized labels to produce unique configurations of HIV risk.	2008
These three lines of scholarship (role of work in recovery from mental_illness; occupational health psychology; and working, racism, and psychological health) are reviewed briefly to furnish exemplars of how the psychological study of working can inform public policy.	2008
Out of the tragedy, there have emerged many issues that challenge the role of counseling centers within the university including the development of threat assessment teams, the potential conflicts between client confidentiality and crisis prevention/management, and the on-going education for the university community regarding suicide prevention, mental_illness and support for potentially marginalized students.	2008
Paragraph 35a SGB VIII of the German Social Code (assistance for minors with mental_illness) in practise creates difficulties for child and adolescent psychiatrists.	2008
The prevalence of childhood sexual and physical abuse among persons with severe mental_illness (SMI) is disproportionately high.	2009
Considering the high prevalence of mental_illness (63, n=29) and substance use (54, n=25) in the sample, the low utilization rates highlight unmet needs for service.	2009
In settings with low seroprevalence, people with severe mental_illness have a higher prevalence of HIV infection compared to the general population.	2009
In the high-prevalence countries of southern Africa, where the pandemic taxes resources for HIV prevention, care, and treatment, the needs of people with mental_illness can be easily overlooked if they are not identified as vulnerable to infection.	2009
Our findings demonstrate that in the midst of a generalized AIDS epidemic, people with mental_illness are also vulnerable and must be included in prevention and treatment efforts.	2009
The baseline interview documented mental_illness and substance use in the past year, mental_illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use.	2009
The data suggest that both mental_illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs.	2009
Clients with severe mental_illness and substance use disorder (i.e., dual disorders) frequently have contact with family members, who may provide valuable emotional and material support, but have limited skills and knowledge to promote recovery.	2009
The objective of this study was to identify long-term factors associated with substance use problem among individuals affected by severe mental_illness.	2009
Prospective data come from the 1994, 1998, and 2000 waves of the Maryland Mental Health Outcomes Survey conducted among a sub-cohort of adult Medicaid recipients affected by serious mental_illness.	2009

We identify implications for research on homeless persons with mental_illness that spans different national and local contexts and involves diverse ethnic groups.	2009
For more than two millennia, prison reformers and inmate advocates have lamented the ethical and humanitarian injustices experienced by persons with mental_illness in correctional settings; yet, we continue to see mentally ill individuals stuck in limbo between health care and custody.	2009
This study examined how the characteristics of people with mental_illness who are participants in post-booking jail diversion programs affect recidivism and time spent incarcerated.	2009
The findings suggest that people with mental_illness who are diverted from jail to community-based services experience fewer arrests and jail days.	2009
The results suggest that services targeted to diverted individuals with mental_illness should address public safety goals, not just those of public health.	2009
However, a more thorough understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of action and clinical effectiveness of the different Meditative practices is needed before Meditative practices can be leveraged in the prevention and intervention of mental_illness.	2009
This study consisted of three experiments focusing on motor and language functional lateralization in regard to schizotypal personality in the absence of mental_illness: line-drawing, finger tapping, and a semantic go/no-go task.	2009

The present study involved a pilot investigation of the effectiveness of accessing respite care for carers of individuals with a mental_illness.	2009
A greater awareness of factors influencing older peoples' attitudes to mental_illness may therefore improve awareness and treatment of mental_disorders in this population.	2009
A mixed methodology approach was used to explore and compare older peoples' attitudes to mental_illness in a sample of clinical and non-clinical participants.	2009
Results indicated that, similar to younger people, older people endorsed a range of positive and negative attitudes to mental_illness.	2009
However, when attitudes to mental_illness were considered within the context of ageing and experience a more complex pattern of results emerged.	2009
Although negative attitudes to mental_illness were associated with negative attitudes to ageing across the entire sample, clinical participants (and those with prior experience of mental_illness) reported more positive attitudes to mental_illness and more negative attitudes to ageing than non-clinical participants, for whom the reverse was true.	2009
Results suggest that attitudes to mental_illness and ageing may be linked and mediated by personal experience and capacity for psychological self-regulation in the face of age-associated adversity.	2009
Studies have shown that psychiatric patients have significantly impaired quality of life (QOL) in comparison to community samples who are not suffering a mental_illness.	2009
In light of findings that pre-existing mental_illness and prior exposure to trauma are associated with vulnerability to PTSD following a subsequent traumatic event, this article reviews research on the impact of the September 11th terrorist attacks on psychiatric patients.	2009
The measures of TR have been broadly explored in psychotherapy process but have received little attention in the treatment of severe mental_illness in the context of routine mental_health.	2009
Yet little has been written about whether there are different kinds of deficits in self-reflection found in mental_illness, how those deficits should be distinguished from one another and how to characterize the extent to which they are interrelated.	2009
Using a path analytic approach, the study statistically supported three gendered pathways to women offenders' incarceration: (a) a pathway beginning with childhood victimization that contributed to historical and current forms of mental_illness and substance abuse; (b) a relational pathway in which women's dysfunctional intimate relationships facilitated adult victimization, reductions in self-efficacy, and current mental_illness and substance abuse; and (c) a social and human capital pathway in which women's challenges in the areas of education, family support, and self-efficacy, as well as relationship dysfunction, contributed to employment/financial difficulties and subsequent imprisonment.	2009
Despite high prevalence rates of mental_illness, jails often lack validated measures for detecting it, and many of the screening instruments used do not adequately identify depression and trauma-related disorders in women.	2009
The K6 identified 37 of women as having serious mental_illness using the customary cut score of 13, with an ROC-AUC value of .92 in detecting major depression or PTSD.	2009
Litigation in Mississippi required the Department of Corrections to ameliorate substandard conditions at the supermaximum Unit 32 of Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, remove prisoners with serious mental_illness from administrative segregation and provide them with adequate treatment, and reexamine the entire classification system.	2009
The early identification of mental_illness in youths is an important goal for researchers examining the relationship between mental_disorder and offending.	2009
In partnership, however, general and forensic psychiatrists could potentially achieve more than either group on its own: they could better prevent people with mental_illness from becoming offenders; prevent people with mental_illness from becoming victims of crime; intervene in the vicious circle from victim to perpetrator; assess young people at risk for antisocial behaviour and protect them from becoming criminals.	2009
Rates of mental_illness among prisoners are substantial, but little is known about the unique mental_health needs of women in jail, those under pre-trial custodial remand or serving short sentences.	2009
To compare male and female jail inmates along a wide range of symptoms of mental_illness using identical assessment methods, and to examine gender differences in treatment seeking before and during incarceration.	2009
The present study examines schizotypal symptoms in Israeli adolescents (mean age = 16.79 years) who have not yet reached the developmental period during which first schizophrenic episode is most likely to emerge: 39 adolescent offspring of parents with schizophrenia, 39 offspring of parents with other psychiatric disorders, and 36 offspring of parents with no history of mental_illness.	2009

Older institutional patients with severe mental_illness are likely to be at high risk of developing osteoporosis.	2009
Public health initiatives should be designed to reduce not only suicide rates but also rates of attempted suicide; otherwise they are failing in the prevention of mental_illness and suicidal behavior, early identification and treatment of those with mental_illness and those at risk of suicide, and systematic follow-up of those recovering and recovered from mental_illness.	2009
The analyses demonstrate the detrimental effects of an earlier life experience with mental_illness.	2009
These areas also have less psychological services and specialist services despite increased levels of mental_illness.	2009

A total of 378 (73) had an acute psychiatric disorder and this group had a significantly higher rate (p = 0.01) of past psychiatric disorder (40) than that in those with no acute mental_illness (33).	2009
Overall, 21 of patients diagnosed with acute mental_illness were referred on discharge to the neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic for specialist follow up and the remainder followed-up by either local mental_health teams or their GP.	2009
These findings provide clear evidence that further resources should be allocated to expanding neuropsychiatry mental_health services to improve detection and management of mental_illness in this vulnerable patient group.	2009
To describe the characteristics and progress of the first 50 patients with severe and enduring mental_illness who accessed inpatient rehabilitation services in Dublin North East Mental Health Service between 2001 and 2006.Retrospective collection of data on the first 50 inpatients from case notes and staff interviews.	2009

This study examined whether a new student organization, Active Minds, aimed at increasing awareness of mental_illness and reducing stigma had an impact on students' stigma and willingness to seek psychological help.	2009
Students involved in the organization showed a significant reduction in stigma if they had a history of mental_illness in their families.	2009
The peer support provided through Active Minds may help change people's negative attitudes about mental_illness and encourage students to help one another in coping with their diagnoses.	2009
Culture may particularly influence community attitudes towards mental_illness, when the illness itself is shaped by a cultural context.	2009
Results indicate that though participants were equally likely to perceive both vignettes as mental_illness, they were less likely to endorse psychological/medical explanatory models and helpseeking, and conversely more likely to endorse socialreligious explanations, religious helpseeking, and stigma in relation to religious OCD.	2009
Beyond implications for Orthodox Jewish community actions, these findings suggest that attitudes towards mental_illness may depend on how symptoms relate to community culture.	2009

Similarities were found between these deaths and self-inflicted deaths of UK nationals in terms of method, location of death, index offence, and prevalence of mental_illness.	2009
More than 75 of the patients were suffering from major mental_illness, but 14.3 were confused due to physical illness which resulted in them becoming mentally disturbed, and as a result they received a special verdict.	2009
Such teams are now in place, managing offenders with severe mental_illness, but they have faced challenges.	2009
There was a significant effect of treatment on well-being and symptoms of mental_illness.	2009
The results support the view that developing goal setting and planning skills in mentally disordered offenders enhances well-being and impacts on symptoms of mental_illness.	2009
Forty-two consecutive male admissions and 18 of their male siblings were interviewed to determine rates of mental_illness, violence and past substance use.	2009
This supports evidence from other sources, suggesting that CD can be an important intermediary step in the development of substance use disorders and violence in those who subsequently develop major mental_illness.	2009
This is particularly a reflection of the rise of risk, and an indication that sentencers are more inclined to diagnose dangerousness rather than mental_illness.	2009
However, individuals with mental retardation present with a unique set of characteristics that may impair their competency to stand trial, even without symptoms of mental_illness.	2009
This brought American psychiatry to a point where homosexuality was no longer considered a mental_illness, but gay and lesbian individuals continued to be pathologized through related diagnoses remaining in the manual.	2009
These include sexual orientation as a risk factor for mental_illness and sexual orientation as a cultural factor relating to diagnosis and treatment.	2009

Very little has been written about lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people (LGBs) with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2009
Although specialized services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people with severe mental_illness exist in some large metropolitan centers, efforts need to be made to expand access to services that are safe and welcoming to LGBT people, whether those services are specialized or not.	2009
Practitioners can help their LGB patients with severe mental_illness by taking a thorough sexual history, being aware of gay-affirmative mental_health services in their area, and advocating for services where none exist.	2009
Group interventions for persons with co-occurring disorders of serious mental_illness (SMI) and alcohol or other substance use disorders may positively affect participants substance use, criminal justice contacts, and transition to community supports and community living.	2009

Brain disease models of psychopathology, such as the popular chemical imbalance explanation of depression, have been widely disseminated in an attempt to reduce the stigma of mental_illness.	2009
Although some of these challenges relate to the vagueness of the legislation, perhaps of the greatest difficulties facing adults with ADHD are human resource departments' policies toward mental_illness and managers/coworkers attitudes about the condition.	2009
Four major classes were dispute, conflicts in a relationship, altruistic, and mental_illness.	2009
Five thematic categories emerged: experimenting in the early illness; living with serious mental_illness; enjoying the effects of substances; feeling normal; and managing stress.	2009

To determine whether people with serious mental_illness (SMI) and substance use disorder (SUD) use the Internet to receive health information.	2009
This cross-sectional study utilizes interviews with 60 adolescents treated in a wraparound program to examine: (a) the extent to which adolescents diagnosed and treated for psychiatric disorders experience mental_illness stigma and cope by using secrecy, (b) the extent to which stigmatization is associated with self-concept (self-esteem, mastery, future outlook) and morale (depression), and (c) which clinical and demographic characteristics are associated with perceived stigma.	2009
People with serious mental_illness and substance abuse problems continue to represent the majority of those experiencing long-term homelessness.	2009

The measurement of functional capacity in mental_illness is an important recent development.	2010
This article provides an overview of a model of functioning, discusses the various areas of functioning relevant to real-world performance in persons with mental_illness, and reviews existing measures that assess functional capacity.	2010
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental_illness characterized by reduced caloric intake that often persists after acute weight restoration.	2010
NSSI was correlated with mental_illness, child maltreatment, and substance abuse.	2010
We intend this discussion to engender further empirical work to advance our knowledge of the manifestation and experience of severe mental_illness including psychotic disorders among Asian Americans, and contribute to culturally competent prevention and intervention of chronic and persistent mental_illness within this group.	2010
There is an urgent need to implement strategies to achieve remission including destigmatizing mental_illness, educating patients, their families, optimizing treatments, exploring novel interventions and addressing residual symptoms.	2010
The aim of this study was to investigate the rate, type and duration of respite care use in carers of an adult with mental_illness, and the differences between respite care users and nonusers on demographic, caregiving context and adjustment variables.	2010
The findings indicate that mature individuals may be receptive to information that assists them in differentiating the symptoms of ageing and mental_illness and empowers them to make appropriate helpseeking decisions.	2010
Perceived stigma and an aversion to medication were identified as barriers preventing individuals from acknowledging and addressing mental_illness.	2010
Implications: The results highlight the need for universal early interventions to prevent the development of severe mental_illness in university students.	2010
The most common cause cited by both groups of parents was biological factors, suggesting that parents may be becoming more aware of scientific findings implicating biological factors, in conjunction with psychosocial factors, as a major cause of mental_illness.	2010
Three variables of interest were manipulated: rebuttal illness (no mental_illness, personality disorder, or psychopathy), evidentiary basis (biological or psychological), and evidentiary strength (moderately strong or moderately weak).	2010
The Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Panetti v. Quarterman significantly expanded its jurisprudence by ruling that such a defendant had a constitutional right to make a showing that his mental_illness obstruct[ed] a rational understanding of the State's reason for his execution.	2010
Errors in adolescent brain reorganization may cause mental_illness; this could explain the typical age of onset of schizophrenia.	2010

The findings revealed that race, level of education, histories of drug and alcohol use, and histories of mental_illness significantly impact yearly earnings within the sampled population.	2010
A definition of recovery drawn from qualitative literature and the 'consumer/survivor' movement suggests that recovery should be seen as a way of developing satisfaction and purpose in life, whether or not symptoms of mental_illness are present.	2010
The aim of this study was to explore experiences of recovery from mental_illness in the context of two emerging social firms.	2010
Individual differences in perceived ability to exercise control have long been considered to be an important predictor of who develops mental_illness, particularly anxiety disorders.	2010
The previous articles in this special series describe four such interventions designed for use with patients with particular presenting problems including serious mental_illness, cancer, eating disorders, and scrupulosity.	2010
This paper examines whether religion and spirituality (R/S) should be incorporated into treatment for patients with serious mental_illness.	2010
While the literature is somewhat mixed, prior research supports the view that incorporating adaptive R/S elements into treatment for patients with serious mental_illness is beneficial, particularly for patients who do not exhibit severe psychotic symptoms.	2010
This notion has been extensively explored in relation to mental_illness.	2010
Furthermore, in this exploratory study, we found that patients with better medication compliance had better insight into mental_illness, less severe psychopathologic condition, and less negative subjective response to side effects of antipsychotics.	2010
The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of mortality risk among children of parents with mental_illness.	2010
Over the past decade, two rapidly evolving areas of criminal justice practice have garnered increasing attention from policy makers, practitioners, and researchers: the management and treatment of justice involved individuals with serious and persistent mental_illness, and the challenges of managing the perceived societal risk presented by sex offenders.	2010
Matters of concern include the manner in which individuals with serious mental_illness may be disproportionately affected by the expanding range of restrictions placed on those with sexual offense histories, the demands for adapting traditional models of sex offender treatment and supervision for those with serious mental_illness, and the manner in which public mental_health agencies must adapt their systems of inpatient and community-based care to meet the needs of clients with sex offense histories.	2010
This article explores the connections between sex offending and serious mental_illness, examining the magnitude and nature of the issue, the organizational and programmatic challenges facing both the public mental_health and criminal justice systems, and the emergent public policy implications.	2010
Recent research from the United Kingdom has called into question entrenched assumptions from the USA about public figure threat assessment, in particular the low importance given to mental_illness and to the making of threats.	2010
Prison health-care wings operate front-line mental_illness triaging and recognition functions and also provide care for complex individuals who display behavioural disturbance.	2010
Native peoples and immigrants were stereotyped as genetically and culturally inferior and prone to diseases and mental_illness.	2010
Peer support, a cornerstone in recovery programs for mental_illness and addiction, has not been widely applied to service programs for survivors of suicide.	2010
Specifically, respondents were presented with vignettes portraying individuals experiencing various forms of mental_illness and were asked to label the disorder, its cause and whether or not they would recommend treatment.	2010
Symptoms of OCD were attributed to mental_illness by approximately 50 of respondents, but such attributions were rare for the other anxiety disorders studied (<12).	2010
A better appreciation of the role of these mediators in depressive illness could lead to refined models of depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a whole body disease rather than just a mental_illness, and to the rational development of new classes of medications to treat depression and its related medical comorbidities.	2010
Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 2 (N=34,653; response rate: 70.2), a nationally representative survey of mental_illness in community-dwelling adults.	2010
Future work should aim to understand how genetic and macrosocial factors jointly shape risk for mental_illness, and how these factors shape gender differences in mental_illness.	2010
Data from Danish national registers included perinatal data, socioeconomic data and data on child mental_illness diagnosed at hospital in preschool age.	2010
Women with severe and persistent mental_illness (SMI) face formidable challenges as parents.	2010
The measure's relation to estimation of risk remained significant when two other predictors of risk, maternal caregiving attitudes and insight into mental_illness, were considered.	2010
Factors associated with utilization included being non-White, living in a nonurban area, having a serious mental_illness, and living in a state with a generous Medicaid plan for substance abuse treatment.	2010
The sample was more likely than the comparison group to have serious mental_illness or depression and substance abuse-related disorders were not prevalent.	2010
Increased susceptibility to distress among young adults from diverse cultural backgrounds amplifies the importance of identifying culturally-salient factors related to the development of mental_illness.	2010
Almost all elderly suicide victims have mental_illness, and up to 90 have depression (Shah and De, 1998).	2010
This offers an opportunity for identification and treatment of the mental_illness.	2010
On the one hand, some authors have suggested that older populations are characterized by surprisingly high levels of well-being and resilience, despite increasing losses and functional impairment (Staudinger and Fleeson, 1996) and that the prevalence of mental_illness, with the exception of dementia, decreases in late life (Jorm, 2000).	2010
Administration of medication in food or drink and covert medication were common in this group of hospitalized patients with severe mental_illness.	2010
Those living in care homes, and those with diagnosed mental_illness (in the medical group) were excluded.	2010
Dental problems are common in community-living older people, especially those with some natural remaining teeth and those with mental_illness.	2010
The literature was divided into different sections in order to examine the contributing factors and rates of mental_illness in older prisoners.	2010
The final sections look at the prevalence of mental_illness in older offenders before and after sentencing.	2010
It currently remains poorly researched and service provision for older prisoners with mental_illness is poorly developed.	2010
Further research is needed, with a particular focus on the different groups of older prisoners and the most beneficial service models, because the number of older prisoners, including those with mental_illness, is likely to increase in the future.	2010
Relatively few studies of mental_illness in Africa have focused on dementia.	2010
The psychiatric manifestations of NSAID intolerance are rare, however 40 of cases have a history of mental_illness.	2010
Data from adverse event reporting systems suggest that the newer NSAIDs (COX-2 inhibitors) may have a higher propensity to cause psychiatric adverse effects and should be used with caution in individuals with a history of mental_illness.	2010
Three adults with mild intellectual disabilities and mental_illness living in the community were taught by a community-based therapist to use this strategy to control maladaptive behaviors that included verbal aggression, disruptive behavior and physical aggression.	2010
This study explores the utility of a dual-factor model of mental_health in which the concepts of mental_illness and mental wellness are integrated.	2010
A large body of research has documented public attitudes toward people with mental_illness.	2010
However, evidence of negative attitudes and expectations was also found, particularly with respect to social acceptance of people with mental_illness.	2010
Despite increased recent attention to improving the quality of encounters between police officers and people with serious mental_illness, there are no measures available for assessing how consumers perceive their interactions with police officers.	2010
Drawing upon conceptual frameworks developed within social psychology, this study reports the development and testing of a new measure, the Police Contact Experience Scale (PCES), which yields indicators of procedural justice and coercion as evaluated by persons with mental_illness in relation to specific encounters with the police.	2010
The PCES was administered to 154 individuals with mental_illness that had police contact within the prior 12 months.	2010
Educational campaigns to reduce stigma may still be warranted as one component of broader multilevel interventions to overcome mental_illness stigma.	2010
The present study examines the personal accounts of nine young adults who have parents living with mental_illness.	2010
Adults' experience of personal loss due to their parents' mental_illness and perceptions of their religious faith journey and spiritual struggles are described.	2010
Overall, young adults who reported experiencing more personal loss due to their parents' mental_illness also reported feeling more confused on their faith journey, and reported experiencing more spiritual struggle relative to participants who reported experiencing less personal loss.	2010
There has been no recent national description of where and with whom people with chronic mental_illness reside.	2010
Our study confirmed the frequency of mental_illness among adolescent parricide offenders to be very low when compared to adult offenders.	2010
A program evaluation examined a long-term cognitive skills inpatient program (STAIR) in reducing rehospitalization and rearrest rates in mental_illness.	2010
Thirty-one patients with a primary diagnosis of mental_illness completed a group patients entitled: Understanding Mental Illness which promotes awareness of descriptions of illness and strategies for managing symptoms.	2010
This study set out to explore definitions, experiences, and perceptions of recovery in patients with severe mental_illness, currently detained in medium secure psychiatric provision.	2010
The stigma associated with being an offender, as well as having a serious mental_illness, was perceived as a factor holding back recovery, particularly in relation to discharge and independent living in the community.	2010
The care programme approach (CPA) was introduced to improve coordination of care for people with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2010
Some data suggest that bisexual people have higher rates of mental_illness than heterosexuals and possibly even higher rates than gays and lesbians.	2010
This study explores how these specific humanistic and transpersonal approaches to this populations presenting concerns represent unique alternatives to the mainstream medical model of dementia treatment that pejoratively frames dementia as a mental_illness.	2010
Many empirical studies showed common beliefs about persons with mental_illness but little was known about how Christian religious beliefs affect perceptions of people with mental_illness, or whether beliefs are specific to certain denominations.	2010
These two studies (one lab, one Internet-based) assessed religious beliefs about mental_illness and their relations to known negative beliefs about mental_illness.	2010
Our data suggest religious beliefs about mental_illness appear as two separate but related dimensions.	2010
These dimensions focused on beliefs about sin/morality and spiritually-oriented causes/treatments, and were related to negative secular beliefs about mental_illness.	2010
This article describes the therapeutic approach of Spiritual-Hypnosis Assisted Therapy (SHAT), originally developed in Bali, Indonesia, and its applications to treatment, intervention, and prevention of mental_illness among individuals, groups, and communities.	2010
While religiouslybased explanations have previously been popular in explaining mental_illness, support for such models has waned with the increasing prominence of the fields of psychiatry and psychology in developed societies.	2010
In this study, a representative sample of Singaporean Christian clergymen were examined to see whether increasing secular and psychological educational attainment were related to decreasing preferences to explain mental_illness with religiouslybased models.	2010
Based on the survey results from 213 respondents, psychological and secular educational attainments were not related to endorsement of religiously based causation models for mental_illness.	2010
Runaway and homeless youth are far more likely to engage in substance use and delinquent behavior, drop out of school and suffer from sexually transmitted diseases and mental_illness at greater rates than the norm.	2010
The absence of mental_illness, however, is a minimal outcome from a psychological perspective on lifespan development.	2010
This article therefore focuses on mental_illness as well as on three core components of positive mental_health: feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life (emotional well-being), positive individual functioning in terms of self-realization (psychological well-being), and positive societal functioning in terms of being of social value (social well-being).	2010
The two continua model holds that mental_illness and mental_health are related but distinct dimensions.	2010
In sum, today's older adults have fewer mental_illness problems, but they are not in a better positive mental_health than today's younger adults.	2010
Individuals with mental_illness could have more frequently rejected to participate in the survey; 3.	2010
To investigate pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight, preterm births, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among women with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia compared with women with no history of mental_illness using nationwide population-based data.	2010
It shows that pregnant women with bipolar disorder were more likely to have LBW infants (9.8 vs. 5.7), preterm births (14.2 vs. 6.9) and SGA (22.3 vs. 15.7) than pregnant women with no history of mental_illness.	2010
The adjusted odds of low birthweight for women with bipolar disorder was 1.66 times (95 CI, 1.16-2.38) that of women with no history of mental_illness.	2010
In terms of preterm births and SGA, the adjusted odds ratios were 2.08 (95 CI, 1.53-2.83) and 1.47 (95 CI, 1.14-1.91) respectively, for women with bipolar disorder, compared to their counterparts with no history of mental_illness.	2010
We conclude that women with bipolar disorder had increased risk of low birthweight, preterm births, and SGA than women without a history of mental_illness.	2010
Perceived legitimacy of discrimination shapes reactions to mental_illness stigma among stigmatized individuals.	2010
We assessed deliberately endorsed versus automatic shame-related reactions to mental_illness as predictors of change in perceived legitimacy of discrimination over six months among 75 people with mental_illness.	2010
Automatically activated shame-related associations with mental_illness were measured using the Brief Implicit Association Test, deliberately endorsed beliefs via self-report.	2010
Automatically activated shame reactions may increase vulnerability to mental_illness stigma.	2010
This commentary will provide a general overview of the public health considerations of maternal mental_illness, both from a global perspective as well as from the South African context.	2010
The paper will outline the consequences of maternal mental_illness for mothers as well as their offspring, through the life stages from pregnancy until adulthood.	2010
The PEP model is based on research data about barriers families face in mental_health service utilization (e.g., stigma, perceptions of providers, attitudes towards mental_illness, service availability, etc.).	2010
Identification of novel treatment strategies aimed at normalizing early brain development and preventing mental_illness should be a major therapeutic goal.	2010
The findings are discussed in light of how clinicians can incorporate mental_illness lay beliefs in their work with Asian Americans.	2010
Findings suggest that therapists can effectively deliver a manualized cognitive-behavioral intervention for PTSD, with exposure therapy, to patients with severe mental_illness without compromise to the structure of sessions and/or the therapeutic relationship.	2010
Self-stigma can undermine self-esteem and self-efficacy of people with serious mental_illness.	2010
Eighty-five people with serious mental_illness completed measures of coming out (called the Coming Out with Mental Illness Scale, COMIS), self-stigma, quality of life, and strategies for managing self-stigma.	2010
The Helping Older People Experience Success (HOPES) program was developed to improve psychosocial functioning and reduce long-term medical burden in older people with severe mental_illness (SMI) living in the community.	2010
The present study compares 94 young adults' self-reported felt obligation toward parents, psychological symptoms, psychological well-being, and interpersonal loneliness in three family types: families where a mother has serious mental_illness, families where a father has serious mental_illness, and families with nondistressed parents.	2010
Young adults with a mother with serious mental_illness reported significantly more psychological adjustment difficulties than their peers with a father with serious mental_illness or nondistressed parents.	2010
Young adults' reports of felt obligation toward both parents were significantly positively correlated with young adults' psychological adjustment in families with a parent with serious mental_illness, but were not significantly correlated in families with nondistressed parents.	2010
Incorporating children's lives into the sociology of mental_health will also extend the intellectual influence of the discipline on sociomedical and biomedical research on mental_illness.	2010
Family members often provide critical support to persons living with a serious mental_illness.	2010
To address this question, we examined diagnostic and gender differences in social skills in a community-dwelling sample of 183 people older than age 50 with severe mental_illness, and the relationships between social skills and neurocognitive functioning, symptoms, and social contact.	2010
We reviewed child mental_illness stigma articles in (English only) peer-reviewed journals available through Medline and PsychInfo.	2010
Literature reports few theoretic frameworks and conceptualizations of child mental_illness stigma.	2010
To further research in child mental_illness, we suggest an approach to adapting current theoretical frameworks and operationalizing stigma, highlighting three dimensions of stigma, three contexts of stigma (including institutions), and three targets of stigma (self/child, family, and services).	2010
Those who actually listen to the controversial tapes would be curious to find a debate between Sexton and Orne about mental_illness, creativity, and therapeutic process.	2010
Strong supporters of outpatient commitment see it as a form of access to community-based mental_health care and a less restrictive alternative to hospitalization for people with severe mental_illness; vocal opponents see it as an instrument of social control and an unwarranted deprivation of individual liberty.	2010
Mental health courts (MHCs) are rapidly expanding as a form of diversion from jails and prisons for persons with mental_illness charged with crimes.	2010
Persons with mental_illness may be at risk for false admissions to police and to prosecutors because of the defining characteristics of mental_illness, but potentially because of heightened recidivism rates and increased opportunities.	2010
In this review, we identify suspect characteristics (e.g., adolescence; intellectual disability; mental_illness; and certain personality traits), interrogation tactics (e.g., excessive interrogation time; presentations of false evidence; and minimization), and the phenomenology of innocence (e.g., the tendency to waive Miranda rights) that influence confessions as well as their effects on judges and juries.	2010
Results indicated 92 of the participants were diagnosed with a serious mental_illness, and mentally disordered offenders produced criminal thinking scores on the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS) and Criminal Sentiments Scale-Modified (CSS-M) similar to that of non-mentally ill offenders.	2010
Implications are discussed with specific focus on the need for mental_health professionals to treat co-occurring issues of mental_illness and criminality in correctional mental_health treatment programs.	2010
What explains controversy over outpatient commitment laws (OCLs), which authorize courts to order persons with mental_illness to accept outpatient treatment?	2010
Many studies have examined the protective factors associated with religion and mental_illness.	2010
People with severe mental_illness are at higher risk of physical health problems.	2010
An audit cycle was completed on individuals with severe mental_illness under the care of an early interventions in psychosis (EIP) service to evaluate and improve physical health monitoring practice.	2010
Interventions made between baseline audit and re-audit included improving awareness within the multidisciplinary EIP mental_health team about the importance of physical health monitoring of people with severe mental_illness and liaison with primary care health services.	2010
Clinical implications There is a need to improve awareness among mental_health professionals about the importance of the physical health of people with severe mental_illness and to make appropriate organisational changes.	2010
Stress has been shown to increase the risk of development and relapse of mental_illness, having a detrimental effect on human physiology, psychology and emotional well-being.	2010
Overall, the research suggests that the stress-diathesis model provides a powerful approach for elucidating mechanisms underlying the increased vulnerability to mental_illness among individuals with FASD, and developing appropriate treatments for these individuals.	2010
The study indicates that to enable persons with a mental_illness to engage in pet ownership, occupational scientists need to examine and understand this occupation in the broader context of recovery, health, and well-being.	2010
This paper describes the effects of a simulated learning exercise and facilitated debriefing on occupational therapy student understanding of mental_illness.	2010
Themes derived from qualitative data revealed that students believed that the learning experience increased their understanding, empathy, and insight into daily life with a mental_illness.	2010
This study examined the latent structure of a number of measures of mental_health (MH) and mental_illness (MI) in substance use disorder outpatients to determine whether they represent two independent dimensions, as Keyes (2005) found in a community sample.	2010
Although the samples used were based both on normal individuals (41 participants with no known history of mental_illness) as well as individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (41 participants), the real focus of the study was the clinical group because this is where the greatest advantages can be obtained by shortening the time to administer the scale.	2010
Three case studies are used to illustrate the ways in which the enriched model can provide a holistic approach to conceptualizing offending that occurs in the context of mental_illness and in guiding treatment planning.	2010
Concerns arise from the decision in the context of the difficulties in assessing suicidal intent and satisfying the statutory requirement of mental_illness to enable a person who is at risk to be detained for the purposes of an assessment.	2010
It focuses on what the trial revealed about Duch's personality and notes the absence of any form of psychopathology or mental_illness in his psychological profile.	2010
Participants were more likely to agree that jealousy and retaliation were motivating factors when the perpetrator was male, but agreed more strongly that mental_illness was a motivating factor when the perpetrator was female.	2010
The psychosocial impacts of a cancer diagnosis include reduced quality of life, poorer inter-personal relationships, hopelessness and mental_illness.	2010
Some 71 had a severe enduring mental_illness or personality disorder.	2010
Only 9 had no severe enduring mental_illness, personality disorder, or added complexity; nearly half of these had somatoform disorder.	2010
Three specific beliefs or attitudes related to the sociocultural experience of African Americans are identified: awareness of racism, stigma of mental_illness, and salience of physical illnesses.	2010
CAs associated with maladaptive family functioning (MFF; parental mental_illness, substance disorder, criminality, family violence, abuse, neglect) were more consistently associated with impairment than other CAs.	2010
The aims of this study were to compare pre-morbid IQ among five diagnostic categories and normal controls, to examine the distribution of pre-morbid IQ, and to investigate the relationship between pre-morbid IQ and risk of mental_illness.	2010
Previous cross-diagnosis studies of interaction between mothers with severe mental_illness and their babies have concluded that mothers with schizophrenia have deficits in interaction, but these studies have not included healthy controls.	2010
The findings challenge previous conclusions that mothers with schizophrenia have deficits in their interactions with their babies, and demonstrate that mothers with severe mental_illness are able to respond appropriately to their infants' cues.	2010
Our data also support the view that BPP triggered by life events rarely lead to chronic mental_illness, distinguishing them from other psychoses and supporting the validity of the concept of reactive psychosis.	2010
However, evidence in favour of this hypothesis is still lacking because the human habenular complex has rarely been studied with regard to mental_illness.	2010
All 53 volunteers found the program beneficial, 96.2 reported improved understanding of psychopathology, 98.1 noted increased knowledge of the mental_health care system, 86.8 reported increased interest in clinical psychology, and 47.2 felt less anxious about working with persons with mental_illness as a result of the program.	2010
For individuals with mental_illness, others' perceptions of mental_illness often limit integration into communities.	2010
Perceptions of mental_illness manifest as social stigma in the form of social distance and may depend on individuals' attributions of the origins of mental_illness.	2010
180 university students completed a survey on attribution of mental_illness and social distance across several disorders (psychiatric and physical).	2010
Participants indicated greater social distance for severe mental_illness (i.e., schizophrenia) than less severe mental_illness and physical illness.	2010
More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with severe mental_illness rather than less severe mental and physical illnesses.	2010
Greater understanding of how individuals perceive mental_illness can inform efforts to educate the public.	2010
Most of the mentally ill homicide offenders had a relatively long prior history of mental_illness.	2010
This study aimed to examine relations between youth adjustment and three sets of predictors: parental illness/disability characteristics, caregiving, and parent-child attachment, and explore differences on these variables between youths of parental physical illness/disability and youths of parental mental_illness.	2010
Eighty-one youths between 10 and 25 years of a parent with a physical illness/disability (35) or a mental_illness (43) completed a series of self-report measures assessing perceived characteristics of the parent's illness/disability, caregiving experiences, and adjustment outcomes.	2010
Youths of parental mental_illness differed from youths of parental physical illness/disability on emotional distress (worry and discomfort) dimensions of caregiving.	2010
To correct this unfavourable development, three major approaches to the assessment of mental_illness should be equally taken into account: the positivistic, objectifying or 3rd-person approach as endorsed by DSM-IV and ICD-10, focusing mainly on observable behavioural symptoms; the phenomenological, subject-oriented or 1st-person approach, focusing on the patient's self-experience and exploring its basic structures, and the hermeneutic, intersubjective or 2nd-person approach, mainly aiming at the co-construction of narratives and interpretations regarding the patient's self-concept, relationships and conflicts.	2010
Medical comorbidity and mortality disproportionately affect adults with serious mental_illness, as compared with the general population.	2010
Patients with severe mental_illness and chronic medical disorders may experience significant acute medical complications during inpatient psychiatric treatment.	2010
Patients with serious mental_illness (SMI; e.g., psychotic disorders and major mood disorders) die earlier, have more medical illnesses, and receive worse medical care than those in the general population.	2010
Police agencies across the country are struggling to respond to significant number of persons with serious mental_illness, who are landing on their doorsteps with sometimes tragic consequences.	2010
Findings from Chicago suggest that CIT is increasing linkage to services and reducing use of force in encounters with persons with mental_illness.	2010
Critical time intervention (CTI), an empirically supported psychosocial intervention intended to reduce the risk of homelessness by enhancing continuity of support for individuals with severe mental_illness (SMI) during the transition from institutions to community living, is a model that was explicitly developed to address a timing-specific need.	2010
The objective of this work was to assess the reliability and validity of the Treatment Motivation Questionnaire Revised (TMQ-R) in people with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2010
This article examines the cost-effectiveness of providing permanent supported housing to homeless people with mental_illness.	2010
The authors examine the experiences and perspectives of parents with a mental_disorder, spouses and children on the services offered to families ; the study also examines the organisation, the basis and the context of actions and interactions between stakeholders of various sectors of services to families with a parent with severe mental_illness.	2010
This includes a review of factors such as basic epidemiology of mental_illness, common beliefs about mental_illness, explanatory models, idioms of distress, help-seeking behavior, configuration of mental_health services and the relationship between religion and mental_health.	2010
However, their affective responses to peers with mental_illness fluctuated between adult and child perspectives.	2010
Within the context of this long-term relationship, parents approach clinicians to address a full range of behavioral concerns ranging from variations of normal development to major mental_illness.	2010
Employment rates among people with severe mental_illness are low and work has beneficial effects on mental_health.	2010
Family psychoeducation interventions, an evidence-based practice, have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing relapse of relatives with serious mental_illness.	2010
The view that all stigmatizing attitudes toward mental_illness are associated with reluctance to seek professional help may be naive as some stigmatizing attitudes may be associated with increased willingness to seek help.	2010

It is argued that children hold coherent conceptions of mental_illness at all ages, but that mental_illness only emerges as an ontologically distinct conceptual domain by the end of middle childhood.	2010
Being severely in debt is a very stressful situation that can result in social marginalisation, reducted overall activity, and physical and mental_illness.	2010
Concerns regarding the use of efavirenz in patients with a history of mental_illness may predispose clinicians to not offer this agent to psychiatrically ill populations in spite of the convenience of once daily dosing, which can result in improved adherence in these at-risk populations.	2011
This systematic review examines the current data regarding the neuropsychiatric effects of efavirenz, and also attempts to provide guidance to clinicians using efavirenz to treat patients with mental_illness.	2011

Knowledge, social distance and attitudes towards mental_illness were assessed for both groups before and after the intervention.	2011
These findings support the effectiveness of the intervention in changing attitudes favourably and improving knowledge about mental_illness in senior primary school children.	2011
In this article, I review theory and research on the relationship between mental_illness, crime, and violence.	2011
I begin by discussing the larger backdrop of deinstitutionalization of mental_illness and its consequences for the criminal justice system in both individual and macro-level terms.	2011
I then compare public perceptions of dangerousness associated with mental_illness with individual-level studies that assess the risk of violence and criminal behavior among those with mental_illness.	2011
Finally, I discuss recent efforts at managing persons with mental_illness who violate the law, focusing on the limitations of diversionary programs.	2011
Fitzgeralds wife, Zelda Sayre, had been undergoing treatment for mental_illness since 1930, but without much progress, and Fitzgerald had lost confidence in such therapy.	2011

Until about the 19th century, doctors working with patients with mental_illness were called 'alienists' and patients were called 'aliens'.	2011
Children often report associative stigma because they are contaminated by association with a parent who has a mental_illness.	2011
The media creates and sustains knowledge about socially relevant issues such as crime, mental_illness, and policing.	2011
Past research suggests that while the media portrayal of the police is undoubtedly complex, their portrayal of people experiencing mental_illness remains mainly negative.	2011
The dominant themes encountered in the initial analysis depicted people experiencing mental_illness as dangerous and a threat to the public, where the mental_health system has failed to manage them adequately.	2011
Further analyses found that people experiencing mental_illness were stigmatised in a third of the media items reviewed and were represented significantly more negatively in these encounters than the police.	2011
Implications of these findings and some suggestions regarding possible strategies that could improve socially responsible media reporting and public discourse on mental_illness are proposed.	2011
During recovery from a serious mental_illness, development of adaptive behavior is as important as reduction of symptoms.	2011

Stalking recidivism was predicted by pre-index offending scores, using the Cormier-Lang, and prior diagnosis of a mental_illness.	2011
In addition, stalkers with previously diagnosed mental_illness had significantly more police contacts as complainants than those without; their recidivism was also more likely to be non-violent.	2011
Treatment of stalkers involves pharmacotherapy when mental_illness is present, but the mainstays of treatment for non-psychotic stalkers are programmes of psychological intervention.	2011
Research has not examined whether higher rates of parole denial among inmates with mental_illness (MI) are the result of the increased presence of criminal risk factors among this population.	2011

In particular, unaccompanied refugee minors are seen as being at heightened risk of social exclusion and mental_illness.	2011
This article provides an insight into the under-explored lives of parents with mental_illness.	2011
In particular, this article considers the experiences of parents with mental_illness who grew up with parents who also had mental_illness, or experienced issues related to violence, abuse and neglect during childhood.	2011
Due to the dearth of research in this area there is minimal insight into how parents experience mental_illness and even less significance is placed on exploring how intergenerational mental_illness and backgrounds of violence, abuse and neglect impact on parenthood.	2011
This qualitative study generates information about how intergenerational family mental_illness, and other issues identified in the course of the study, affected the participants' experiences of being a parent.	2011
Youth in the foster care system are more likely to be diagnosed with mental_illness than those in the general population.	2011

Less is known about the interaction between cultural values and mental_illness stigma for other cultural groups.	2011
Continued research in the area requires better organization and more exploration of the role of cultural history and values as they relate to mental_illness stigma.	2011
The introduction of dual diagnosis had the merit of drawing attention on substance use among patients with mental_illness.	2011
The purpose of the current paper is to provide a comprehensive review of PTSD within the context of severe mental_illness (SMI; i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders).	2011
Furthermore, there is a need to better understand the interplay between trauma, PTSD, and severe forms of mental_illness and to further develop and disseminate evidence-based PTSD treatments in this population.	2011
They also suggest that insight of mental_illness seems to be not a unitary concept but more likely to be divided in different aspects including cognitive insight.	2011
Parents of persons with severe mental_illness (SMI) often experience burden due to the illness of their daughter or son.	2011
Levels of insight into a daughter's or son's mental_illness, parent self-stigma, and parent burden of 127 parents of persons with an SMI were assessed.	2011
Accordingly, parent insight into the mental_illness of a daughter or son appears to increase parent burden because it increases parent self-stigma.	2011
In this paper we examine the implications of this contrastive analysis for theories of mental_illness.	2011
Schizophrenia is a severe mental_illness affecting sense of identity.	2011
Because of the association of having a mental_illness (MI) with a variety of medical conditions, incarcerates in psychiatric treatment may have an even higher rate of co-occurring chronic medical conditions.	2011
To date, there have been no such imaging studies of people with severe mental_illness.	2011
The rapid emergence of translational developmental neuroscience as the key driver in understanding the onset of mental_illness, the restructuring of academic health science centers on the NIH Roadmap, and dramatic shifts in drug, biological, device, and psychosocial intervention development all have important consequences for pediatric anxiety disorders as a field.	2011
This study explores the relationship between depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9 depression screen and blood glucose levels among patients with diabetes enrolled in Gold Choice, a Medicaid managed care program for individuals with mental_illness and/or substance abuse.	2011
We next explore perspectives on severe mental_illness, dementia, and caregiving as unique human models of AL that merit future investigations in the field of developmental psychopathology.	2011
This study investigated the emotional and spatial dynamics of belonging among formerly homeless individuals with mental_illness living in independent supportive housing in New York City.	2011
These included stigmas about mental_illness; neighborhood amenities, crime and drug activity; and connections to networks and places beyond the neighborhood of residence.	2011
These concepts suggest that research into community integration should better attend to the bonds of attachment to other networks and places that individuals with mental_illness may carry into new residential settings, and the autonomy they bring to navigating the process of integration.	2011
This paper presents the first that we know of a qualitative study that explores staff and resident experience of the change process of a therapeutic community to an evidence-based modified therapeutic community for homeless individuals with co-occurring substance abuse and mental_illness disorders.	2011
Multivariate findings indicate marital status, history of severe mental_illness, and motive are important factors that differentiate men who murder intimates from those who murder nonintimates.	2011
In order to study depiction of mental_illness, we searched anthology of Indian movies from 1930s up to the present.	2011
Movie plots were analyzed and information about the attitudes towards mental_illness, accuracy and depiction of mental_illness and the treatment methods portrayed was extracted.	2011
The key findings of the study were that attitudes towards mental_illness in Indian cinema paralleled the broader political and socioeconomic trends in Indian society.	2011
In the age of political idealism, mental_illness was portrayed as benign and amusing.	2011
The portrayal of mental_illness is often inaccurate and exaggerated, keeping in line with the hyperbolic nature of Indian cinema.	2011
Recent movies display more sympathy and understanding towards characters with mental_illness.	2011
Effective and affordable therapies are needed for treating people with severe and persistent mental_illness in a community mental_health setting.	2011
In this pilot study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a modified dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) protocol for improving symptoms and functioning in a cohort of persons with severe and persistent mental_illness.	2011
Internalized stigma has been suggested to play a major role in negative changes in identity in severe mental_illness.	2011
Evidence suggests that roughly one-third of people with severe mental_illness show elevated internalized stigma and that it is linked to compromised outcomes in both subjective and objective aspects of recovery.	2011
The authors illustrate these concepts with a case report of an open-ended MIGT group with comorbid mental_illness and addiction.	2011
Diogenes syndrome or senile squalor syndrome has been described in the psychiatric literature with an associated mental_illness in between one half and two thirds of the cases cited.	2011
The combined prevalence of mental_illness and substance misuse was 47 (CI 37-57).	2011
People with severe and enduring mental_illness should have access to primary care and other health services on the same basis as any other citizen.	2011
The concept of recovery entered the lexicon of the mental_health services in the 1980s following the publication of a series of studies and personal narratives which demonstrated that the course of mental_illness was not always one of inevitable deterioration and that people diagnosed with severe mental_illness could reclaim or recover meaningful lives.	2011
Although there are no exact figures for prevalence rates of smoking in individuals with mental_illness in Ireland, international studies unequivocally state that the prevalence of smoking is significantly higher in those with mental_illness, with greater nicotine intake and increased prevalence of nicotine dependence also reported.	2011
Furthermore people with mental_illness experience greater withdrawal symptoms and have lower cessation rates when attempting to stop smoking compared to the general population.	2011
This research explores the experiences of mental_illness stigma in 24 youth (58.3 male, 13-24 years, 75 Latino) in psychiatric outpatient treatment.	2011
Youth in psychiatric treatment acknowledged that their larger cultural context holds pejorative viewpoints toward those with mental_illness and reported experiences of stigma within their families and social networks.	2011
The present study sought to investigate whether the factors that affect the allocation of scarce medical resources vary across different types of treatment and whether participants prioritize hypothetical patients based on patients' marital status, annual income, history of mental_illness, and smoking habits.	2011
This brief report describes results from an evaluation of NAMI Basics, a peer-delivered family education program for family caregivers of children and adolescents with mental_illness.	2011
Over six classes, family members are given information (e.g. education about mental_illness and treatments), skills training (e.g. family communication skills) and advocacy support.	2011
The purpose of this study was to examine prejudiced attitudes as a factor associated with social distance from people with mental_illness.	2011
A total of 289 university students from Greece completed written measures assessing social distance from, prejudiced attitudes about, and familiarity with mental_illness.	2011
Participants who reported to be more familiar with mental_illness held stronger social care and weaker prejudiced beliefs, and consequently expressed a less strong desire for social distance.	2011
The most frequent topics were mental_health and mental_illness (33.5), sense of community and social support (24.4), and dynamics of social exclusion (22.7).	2011
A number of studies have consistently reported that there is a greater prevalence of mental_illness among the most socioeconomically disadvantaged.	2011
This article reviews the literature on family burden and the benefits of family involvement when an adult family member experiences a mental_illness.	2011
Although the number of state hospital psychiatric beds in the United States has declined over the past few decades, the number of persons with a mental_illness being treated in prison has increased.	2011
The purpose of this article is to investigate the psychiatric and criminal histories of consecutive admissions (N = 342) over a 5-month period to a pre-trial evaluation program established for persons accused of a crime and thought to have a mental_illness.	2011
Despite the disproportionately high prevalence of serious mental_illness in the prison population, little attention has been given to medication adherence amongst prisoners.	2011
Substance misuse has been associated with an increased risk of violence and offending in those with severe mental_illness.	2011
No gender or ethnic differences emerged with regard to the questionnaire, but as expected, service-users with a primary or co-morbid diagnosis of personality disorder had significantly lower scores than service-users with mental_illness only, indicating that the RJQ reflects a theoretical basis of recovery.	2011
An examination of the AQ among a high secure psychiatric sample of patients with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), a mental_illness and a personality disorder is described.	2011
Several factorial models of the PSS have been proposed; however, which of these structures reliably measures individuals with mental_illness remains unclear.	2011
This article proposes a theory of psychological disturbance (mental_illness) as a cultural phenomenon.	2011
Although the stigma of mental_illness has been widely documented, the specific processes through which psychiatric labels evoke prejudice and discrimination are not well understood.	2011
We examined how ascribing humanity to an individual labeled with mental_illness may influence perceptions of dangerousness and motivations for social rejection.	2011
Study 1 revealed that a general mental_illness label (compared to a general physical illness label) led to reductions in ascribed humanity, which predicted increased perceptions of dangerousness.	2011
In Study 2, participants formed impressions about an individual bearing a specific mental_illness label (or a specific physical illness label) while normative behavioral information and full remission status were held constant.	2011
Under these conditions, the target labeled with mental_illness evoked greater ascribed humanity.	2011
Further analyses revealed a unique effect for the target bearing the mental_illness label: ascribing humanity to the target predicted reductions in perceived dangerousness, which in turn influenced social rejection.	2011
Negative maternal outcomes (serious mental_illness, psychological distress, and physical health limitations) were not consistently elevated in ASD.	2011
Much of the link between mental_disorder and marital distress operated at the level of broad spectrums of psychopathological variation (i.e., higher levels of marital distress were associated with disorder comorbidity), suggesting that the temperamental core of these spectrums contributes not only to symptoms of mental_illness but to the behaviors that lead to impaired marital quality in adulthood.	2011
Also, directors in organizations serving higher percentage homeless clients and clients with severe and persistent mental_illness had more negative attitudes toward use of buprenorphine.	2011
Homeless and street-involved youth are considered an extremely high risk group, with many studies highlighting trajectories characterized by abusive, neglectful, and unstable family histories, victimization and criminal involvement while on the streets, high rates of physical and mental_illness, and extremely high rates of mortality.	2011
Intention to start therapies or courses to learn to develop better strategies to cope with stress (80) was significantly and positively associated with self-estimation of risk for major depressive disorder as higher than average ( = 0.12, p = 0.001); endorsement of family environment as a causal attribution ( = 0.11, p < 0.001); and endorsement of gene-environment interaction as a causal mechanism of mental_illness ( = 0.12, p = 0.017).	2011
Doctor-shopping may reflect unmet patient needs and places a significant burden on health resources; however little is known about its underlying reasons and how it relates to mental_illness and its recognition in an open access fee-for-service setting.	2011
Doctor-shopping behaviour is associated with higher rates of mental_illness and, among cases, an increased likelihood of recognition by the GP, only however for doctor-shoppers dissatisfied with previous care.	2011
Poor school performance and low IQ are associated with an increased risk of suicide in males; it is uncertain whether cognitive performance is a risk factor for suicide in females and whether severe mental_illness influences these associations.	2011
These differences indicate that the aetiology of suicide differs in males and females and in those with and without severe mental_illness.	2011
There has recently been increased interest in the relationship between physical illness, mental_illness, and suicide.	2011
The present study suggests that among people with mood disorder, respiratory illnesses, hypertension, and number of physical conditions are associated with suicidal behavior independent of the effects of comorbid mental_illness.	2011
Child maltreatment appears to be the single most preventable cause of mental_illness and behavioral dysfunction in the United States.	2011
There is a growing consensus that mental_health is not merely the absence of mental_illness, but it also includes the presence of positive feelings (emotional well-being) and positive functioning in individual life (psychological well-being) and community life (social well-being).	2011
We expected that the MHC-SF is reliable and valid, and that mental_health and mental_illness are 2 related but distinct continua.	2011
CFA supported the hypothesis of 2 separate yet related factors for mental_health and mental_illness, showing discriminant validity.	2011
Although related to mental_illness, positive mental_health is a distinct indicator of mental well-being that is reliably assessed with the MHC-SF.	2011
There is a paucity of theory guided longitudinal research into how carers of an adult with mental_illness adapt to caregiving.	2011
This study examined the psychometric properties of the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) with individuals with serious mental_illness (SMI) in an inpatient setting (N = 96).	2011
To assess rates of screening and testing of HIV and HCV among those with serious mental_illness and co-occurring substance use disorders.	2011
One hundred fifty-three people with serious mental_illness and cooccurring substance use disorders completed measures and were screened for HIV and HCV.	2011
People with mental_illness constitute a substantial proportion of smokers and an important population for smoking cessation research.	2011
Following a school-based, three-stage, cluster probability sampling scheme, two sets of children, parents, grandparents/adult relatives, and neighbors (50 each) in Eskiehir, Turkey (PROB1 and PROB2) completed Turkish translations of the POSHA-S. The POSHA-S measures attitudes toward stuttering within the context of other attributes, such as obesity and mental_illness.	2011
By contrast, attitudes toward obesity and mental_illness were dissimilar.	2011
Specifically, the ideas and methods of Wendell Johnson and Dean Williams are compared to current approaches used in treating mental_illness and communication disorders in which there is an emphasis on focusing on what is right with the individual and spending less time focusing on the disorder.	2011
Although research supports the stigma and labeling perspective, empirical evidence also indicates that a social safety net remains intact for those with mental_illness, recalling the classic sick role concept.	2011
The findings suggest that relative to those with less severe affective disorders, individuals with severe diagnoses and more visible symptoms of mental_illness have larger, more broadly functional networks, as well as more supporters who are aware of and sympathetic toward the illness situation.	2011
These findings suggest that being formally labeled with a mental_illness may present a paradox, simultaneously initiating beneficial social processes within core networks and detrimental ones among peripheral ties.	2011
Despite recent increases in life course research on mental_illness, important questions remain about the social patterning of, and explanations for, depression trajectories among women in later life.	2011
Many homicide by caregiver incidents are precipitated by physical illness of the victim or caregiver, opportunity for perpetrator financial gain, mental_illness of the caregiver, substance use by the caregiver, or an impending crisis in the life of the caregiver not related to illness.	2011
This study examined the associations between goal adjustment capacities, coping, and indicators of subjective well-being in 2 waves of data from individuals who provide care for a family member with mental_illness.	2011
While the passage of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) in 2004 in California to transform treatment of mental and behavioral health as we know it would seem to create a gateway for cultural options, mainstream mental_health has a hard time perceiving cultural interventions as a viable means to treat mental_illness and maintain wellness.	2011
Frequently, the author has attended meetings of decisionmaking bodies that oversee how MHSA money is spent and someone will blurt out after someone has described an innovative cultural intervention What does that have to do with mental_illness?	2011
Substance abuse, mental_illness, homelessness, poverty, crime, physical illness, and violence are symptoms of historical trauma, family dysfunction, and spiritual imbalance.	2011

The vignettes varied in terms of whether the defendant spoke English or Spanish, and whether his mental_illness symptoms were obvious or ambiguous.	2011
Offenders with mental_illness have attracted substantial attention over the recent years, given their prevalence and poor outcomes.	2011
They share an emphasis on one dimension as the source of the problem: mental_illness.	2011
In this article, we use research to evaluate (a) the effectiveness of current interventions, and(b) the larger viability of psychiatric, criminological, and social psychological models of the link between mental_illness and criminal justice involvement.	2011
We hypothesize that the effect of mental_illness on criminal behavior reflects moderated mediation (i.e., the effect is direct in the case of one subgroup, but fully mediated in another); and that the effect of mental_illness on other recidivism is partially mediated by system bias and stigma.	2011
The purpose of this study was to examine the national practices of psychotherapy services for male offenders with mental_illness (OMI) in state correctional facilities.	2011
Results indicated that mental_health professionals provided a variety of services to OMI that can be conceptualized by six goals considered important in their work: mental_illness recovery, emotions management, institutional functioning, re-entry, risk-need, and personal growth.	2011
Mental health professionals in this study generally viewed mental_illness recovery, institutional functioning, and personal growth as significantly more important and spent more time focused on these goals than emotions management, re-entry, and risk-need.	2011
Mental health professionals tended to believe the services they provided were effective across four key treatment foci including mental_illness, skill development, behavioral functioning, and criminogenic needs with more progress perceived in areas related to mental_illness and skill development than their ability to effectively change behavioral functioning.	2011
Depression, a common mental_illness, has a high global incidence.	2011
Regular physical activity can be beneficial for people with severe and enduring mental_illness (SEMI).	2011
Results indicated that a combination of the mental_illness and effects of medication were the main barriers to participation.	2011
The present pilot study examined the acute effects of exercise on cravings, mood and affect in 14 persons with severe mental_illness (SMI) who were receiving smoking cessation treatment.	2011
Senior pastors at churches affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT) were anonymously surveyed using an online questionnaire to ascertain their knowledge and perceptions of the causes and potential treatments of mental_illness.	2011
BGCT senior pastors reported a moderate level of contact with the mentally ill and populations known to have higher than average rates of mental_illness (e.g., homeless).	2011
They also reported that the individuals with whom they counsel are rarely diagnosed with mental_illness.	2011
While Baptist senior pastors embraced biological causes and treatments for mental_illness as most important and effective, they varied greatly across disorders as to the perceived contribution of psychosocial and spiritual factors.	2011
A relatively religious society, compared to other UK European regions, a needs assessment of clergy's pastoral response to mental_illness and suicide was undertaken as part of the suicide prevention strategy.	2011
While a compassionate response to suicide by clergy was commonly advocated, made permissible by an attribution to mental_illness, there remain some misgivings about a softer theological stance towards suicide.	2011
Through a grounded theory process, tribal politics emerged as a core theme from interviews with mental_health providers (MHPs) and Native American Indian people experiencing persistent mental_illness (PMI).	2011
To which extent the mental_illness of one or both parents affects their children's mental development is barely studied.	2011
For such a person avoiding criminal persecution is one of the most frequent reason to deceitfully simulate a mental_illness.	2011
Schizophrenia is a severe mental_illness that afflicts nearly 1 of the world's population.	2011
Neurogenesis is related to learning and memory and may also have a function in the vulnerability to the onset of mental_illness (Neurogenesis theory).	2011
Our results showed that administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids or breeding the animals in exciting environments improved psychotic behavior, suggesting their usefulness in preventing or curing mental_illness which follows declining neurogenesis.	2011
Based on the literature, the authors expected that no tech and low tech assistive technology solutions are being used with clients in these settings even though high technology options are available for people with mental_illness who have co-existing cognitive disabilities.	2011
Second, it explores the psychology of self-consciousness that inhibits spontaneity, and lastly, it looks at the impact of psychopathology in the life of Ludwig Wittgenstein and his philosophical thinking by focusing on his struggle with mental_illness and two philosophical transitions: the movement toward mysticism as an attempt to quiet his obsession and his later writings on ordinary language philosophy as a way out of the pain of self-consciousness.	2011
This article puts forth the argument that Wittgensteins development of ordinary language philosophy is closely connected with his personal struggle with mental_illness.	2011
Across two studies, groups that tend to elicit low stereotype endorsement (religion, race/ethnicity, congenital blindness) were less likely to report experiencing self-as-source stereotype threats (stereotype threats requiring stereotype endorsement) and groups that tend to elicit low group identification (mental_illness, obesity, blindness later in life) were less likely to report experiencing group-as-target stereotype threats (stereotype threats requiring group identification).	2011
However, there also might be facets of RSWB linked to mental_illness (e.g. delusional ideas).	2011
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between different dimensions of RSWB, magical thinking as an indicator of schizotypy and Eysencks three personality factors (psychoticism, extraversion, neuroticism), as there might be facets of RSWB also linked to mental_illness (e.g. delusional ideas).	2011
Sincere, nonpsychotic people who report recalling memories from previous lives risk the stigma of mental_illness.	2011
Multiple regressions showed that after controlling for age, ethnicity and diagnosis (severe mental_illness vs personality disorder), the RJQ contributed to the variance in treatment motivation, treatment engagement, and positive social interactions on the ward above quality of life with medium to large effect sizes.	2011
Social and demographic trends are placing an increasing number of adults at risk for loneliness, an established risk factor for physical and mental_illness.	2011
Kazdin and Blase (2011) propose that traditional models of delivering therapy require more resources than are available to address the scope of mental_illness.	2011
Our article in the January issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science (Kazdin & Blase, 2011) recommended developing a portfolio of models to deliver psychotherapeutic interventions with the goals of reaching a larger and more diverse segment of the population in need of mental_health services and reducing the burden of mental_illness.	2011
The commentaries stimulated additional points to address the original goals including the utility of identifying interventions (e.g., lifestyle changes) that can reach many people in need and that can have broad outcome effects on mental and physical health, the importance of disruptive innovations (i.e., innovations that qualitatively change the nature of what and how services are delivered) from a business perspective, and the need for improved assessment to track the burden of mental_illness in an ongoing way and to evaluate subgroups not being reached with our current interventions.	2011
Yet this progress often neglects a central goal-namely, to reduce the burden of mental_illness and related conditions.	2011
Despite advances, mental_health professionals are not likely to reduce the prevalence, incidence, and burden of mental_illness without a major shift in intervention research and clinical practice.	2011
Decreasing the burden of mental_illness also will depend on integrating prevention and treatment, developing assessment and a national database for monitoring mental_illness and its burdens, considering contextual issues that influence delivery of treatment, and addressing potential tensions within the mental_health professions.	2011
Finally, opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations are discussed as key considerations for reducing the burden of mental_illness.	2011
We share Kazdin and Blase's (2011) sense of urgency about finding better ways to reduce the burden of mental_illness.	2011
It is unclear, however, whether reaching more people would suffice to reduce the burden of mental_illness, much less offset the small effect sizes of simplified, scaled-down interventions such a portfolio approach would likely entail.	2011
We focus here on an underdeveloped theme in Kazdin and Blase's essay-that bending the curve of mental_illness will require better knowledge of for whom simplified intervention and prevention strategies will suffice and for whom more intensive intervention is necessary.	2011
The Circle of Security Intervention Project in Hamburg for mothers with postpartum mental_illness and their infants is described in more detail.	2011
Numerous authors have argued that a lack of capacity, not a likelihood of harm, should provide the legal basis for coercive treatment when a person suffers a mental_illness.	2011
In developing a family approach where a parent has a mental_illness and where statutory child protection concerns exist, both the Mental Health Act and the Children's Protection Act are needed to inform the clinical decision making for family members.	2011
The limited findings, to date, suggest that fire-setting in the main is similar to non-fire-setting delinquent behaviour in juveniles as the majority have conduct disorder rather than major mental_illness.	2011
The relevance of risk factors for general reoffending to recidivistic arson is discussed, including the role of criminal history, mental_illness, and sociodemographic factors.	2011
Utilising the decision of Bell J in Antunovic v Dawson [2010] VSC 377, this article evaluates the contemporary role of the writ of habeas corpus in protecting the rights and liberties of persons with mental_illness who are treated involuntarily, either in hospital or in the community.	2011
The authors reviewed research on people's understanding of race, gender, sexual orientation, criminality, mental_illness, and obesity through a genetic essentialism lens, highlighting attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioral changes that stem from consideration of genetic attributions as bases of these categories.	2011
Personal history of mental_illness [odds ratio (OR) 2.58, p<0.001], self-estimation of being at higher than average risk for depression (OR 1.92, p<0.001), belief that a genetic component would increase rather than decrease stigma (OR 1.62, p<0.001), and endorsement of benefits of genetic testing (OR 3.47, p<0.001) significantly predicted interest in having such a test.	2011
Despite finding attitudes that genetic links to mental_illness would increase rather than decrease stigma, we found strong community acceptance of depression risk genotyping, even though a predisposition to depression may only manifest upon exposure to stressful life events.	2011
Different theories of the link between socio-economic status (SES) and mental_illness have been postulated.	2011
Approximately half of this group subsequently received a diagnosis of mental_illness.	2011
12-item General Health Questionnaire scores, reported mental_illness diagnoses and receipt of relevant medication were assessed in relation to household income and age.	2011
Income-related inequalities in the prevalence of psychological distress were greatest in midlife; for example, in men aged 45-54 years the odds ratio of receiving psychiatric medication in the lowest income group compared with the highest was 7.50 [95 confidence interval (CI) 4.24-13.27] and in women aged 45-54 years the odds ratio of reporting mental_illness was 10.25 (95 CI 6.16-17.05).	2011
Current understandings of mental_illness are rooted in Western paradigms and fail to incorporate indigenous understandings.	2011
Thus, this study explores the perceptions of mental_illness in a sample of eight volunteer counsellors at a community-based organisation in Johannesburg, South Africa.	2011

To apply the constructs of the transtheoretical model (TTM) of change to understand physical activity among individuals with severe mental_illness.	2011
Predictions of stages of change of physical activity and self-reported physical activity were investigated among 92 adults with severe mental_illness, using cognitive and behavioral processes of change, self-efficacy, and perceived pros and cons of exercise as predictors.	2011
Results suggest that TTM constructs hold promise in understanding physical activity of people with severe mental_illness with significant implications for clinical practice and future research.	2011
The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a region of the brain that has been empirically linked with religious or spiritual activity, and atrophy in this region has been shown to contribute to serious mental_illness in late life.	2011
A young man with intellectual disabilities (ID) and mental_illness, who had previously been taught to successfully manage his aggressive behavior by using Meditation on the Soles of the Feet, reported that he shared his mindfulness practice with his peers with ID.	2011

Complications specific to the elderly, such as attitudes toward mental_illness and differential manifestation of distress, are discussed.	2011
Concealable stigmatized identities (CSIs) are devalued social identities or attributes, such as mental_illness, HIV+ status, and chronic illness, that can be kept concealed from others.	2011
Results indicate that initial symptoms and functioning are related to how significant others think about their ill family members, how persons with mental_illness think others perceive them, and how they perceive themselves.	2011
Implications for modified labeling theory and social psychological processes in recovery from mental_illness are discussed.	2011
The relationship between stigmatization and the self-regard of patients/consumers with mental_disorder is negative but only moderate in strength, probably because a subset of persons with mental_illness resists devaluation and discrimination by others.	2011
I define resistance as opposition to the imposition of mental_illness stereotypes by others and distinguish between deflecting (thats not me) and challenging resistance strategies.	2011
Incorporating resistance into classic and modified labeling theories of mental_illness highlights the personal agency of labeled individuals, missing especially in classic labeling theory.	2011
Public housing remained associated with mental_illness after controlling for sociodemographics and chronic illness.	2011
Caregivers play an important role in the management of chronic mental_illness in the community.	2011

Comparisons of the number of days with poor mental_health and positive scores for measures of depression and serious mental_illness were calculated to identify the most efficient cutpoint for establishing FMD.	2011
Results from this study suggest that a 6-day standard (FMD-6) can be used as a valid and reliable indicator of generalized mental distress with strong associations to both diagnosable depressive symptomology and serious mental_illness.	2011
To examine the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, serious mental_illness, and substance use and perceived unmet need for mental_health treatment in the past year among men in the general population using the behavioral model for health-care use (Aday and Anderson in Health Serv Res 9:208-220, 1974; Andersen in A behavioral model of families' use of health services, 1968; Andersen in Med Care 46:647-653, 2008).	2011
A country such as South Africa has additional challenges of stigmatisation of mental_illness as well as cultural perceptions of illness that may influence barriers to mental_health care.	2011
Those who jumped were more likely to be young, single, female, and to have had a major mental_illness.	2011
Abnormal psychology instructors often use traditional and personal methods to educate students about and improve student attitudes toward mental_illness and professional help-seeking.	2011
Data from abnormal psychology students (N = 190) were used to determine if and how students attitudes toward mental_illness and professional help-seeking attitudes change over time.	2011
The study also examined whether stigma-related variables were influenced by student presentations about personal experiences with mental_illness.	2011
Implications for research and teaching to improve attitudes toward mental_illness and professional help-seeking are discussed.	2011

There are high rates of substance use disorders among veterans with mental_illness.	2011
These preliminary results suggest that playback theatre can serve as an effective practice for enhancing recovery processes from serious mental_illness.	2011
Because the data indicate that rural communities may have few resources, a limited number of mental_health professionals, and higher rates of mental_illness, psychologists practicing in these areas may feel compelled to engage in advocacy.	2011
This article draws attention to the issue of parental severe mental_illness and the ethical and clinical implications for counselors who work with this population.	2011

This study examines the relationship between the attachment patterns of 61 parents with a mental_illness and their perception of their children's health-related (QoL).	2011
While it is difficult to imagine the way someone with mental_illness perceives the world, paintings produced by mental_illness sufferers with artistic talents offer a hint of this experience.	2011
The aim of this research was to determine the reliability of lay adherence counsellors in the administration of the substance abuse and mental_illness symptom screener (SAMISS) for common mental_disorders and International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) for HAND in a South African sample of 269 people living with HIV/AIDS and on HAART in a primary healthcare setting.	2012
Reliability was fair for the SAMISS overall ( = 0.39, CI(95) 0.29-0.49, P < 0.01), but was higher for the substance abuse component compared to the mental_illness component.	2012
Strategies to improve the ability of primary healthcare providers to screen for neurocognitive disorders as well as avoiding over-detection of mental_illness and substance abuse symptoms need to be developed and implemented for the primary healthcare setting.	2012
Lack of family support [correlation coefficient (r) = 0.212, P < 0.001], unemployment (r = 0.168, P = 0.004) and being unmarried (r = 0.182, P = 0.002) were much more likely to be found among participants with anxiety disorders; while younger age group (r = -0.126, P = 0.039) and negative previous mental_illness (r = -0.894, P = 0.021) seem protective against anxiety disorders in this study.	2012

Serious mental_illness (SMI) was quite common, with 74 reporting severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or traumatic stress.	2012
Although judges with interests in improving the criminal justice response to individuals with serious mental_illness have long been principal leaders in the development and innovation of mental_health courts (MHCs), little is known about the experiences of pioneering MHC judges.	2012
Mental health courts represent an opportunity for individuals diagnosed with a mental_illness and involved in the criminal justice system to participate in community-based treatment in lieu of incarceration.	2012
Youth with serious mental_illness come into contact with juvenile justice more than 3 times as often as other youth, obliging communities to expend substantial resources on adjudicating and incarcerating many who, with proper treatment, could remain in the community for a fraction of the cost.	2012
Incarceration is relatively ineffective at remediating behaviors associated with untreated serious mental_illness and may worsen some youths' symptoms and long-term prognoses.	2012
This paper identifies the systemic factors that contribute to the inappropriate incarceration of youth with serious mental_illness, including those who have committed non-violent offenses or were detained due to lack of available treatment.	2012
The utility of systems of care principles for increasing access to community-based mental_health care for youth with serious mental_illness is illustrated and a number of recommendations for developing collaborations with juvenile justice to further reduce the inappropriate incarceration of these youth are offered.	2012

This article explores the unique challenges these interactions pose for campus police officers, and their need for knowledge, skills, and training to recognize mental_illness and effectively respond to it.	2012
As a religiously based institution, the administration recognized that there would likely be significant impediments to utilization of on-campus mental_health services as a result of negative attitudes about mental_illness and its treatmentstigma.	2012
The multiple dimensions of social integration among formerly homeless adults with severe mental_illness have not been wellstudied.	2012
The present study was designed to examine the relationship between selfstigma and quality of life over a one year time period for 71 people with mental_illness who were receiving compulsory community mental_health treatment.	2012
It was hypothesized that, over time, selfstigma would have the direct effect of eroding quality of life among people with mental_illness who were receiving compulsory community treatment; however, this relationship was not confirmed by the data.	2012
This short paper begins with a brief description of Kant's moral psychology, and then surveys a number of topics within the criminal law to which this can be applied, such as normative considerations in criminal penalties, Hart's distinction between internal and external points of view on the law, mens rea and mental_illness, how people regard different criminal prohibitions, and how punishment does and should affect people's choice.	2012
This study investigated the relationship between culture and attitudes toward mental_illness.	2012
All participants completed a questionnaire assessing their attitudes toward mental_illness.	2012
Spouses smoking, addiction to drugs, mental_illness, and weakness in religious persuasion were statistically significant predictors of IPV and accounted for 36 of the variation.	2012
It is frequently observed in the literature that mental_illness is associated with criminal offending; however, co-morbidity between personality disorders, substance use disorders and other mental_illnesses complicates our understanding of this relationship.	2012
The aim of this study is to determine the impact of co-morbid substance use disorder, personality disorder and mental_illness on the rate of re-offending.	2012
The findings suggest that the treatment of mentally ill offenders must not simply focus on the treatment of symptoms of mental_illness, but should encompass treatments and interventions to target underlying personality and substance use disorders if any reduction in re-offending is to occur.	2012
Levels of mental_illness amongst prisoners are high, but little is known about the situation of those serving community sentences.	2012
To estimate the prevalence of both current and lifetime mental_illness, an epidemiological survey was conducted on individuals under probation supervision in Lincolnshire, England.	2012
Lifetime mental_illness, co-morbidity and dual diagnosis were also found to be high.	2012
Schizophrenia or the presence of mental_illness independently did not have a significant effect on the type of knife used.	2012
In comparison to the general population, the prevalence of mental_illness experienced by the prisoner population is exceedingly high.	2012
Yet, homelessness among individuals with serious mental_illness, and particularly among those with complicating forensic issues, is even more problematic.	2012
Individuals with mental_illness, substance use disorders, and criminal justice involvement who experience homelessness are often marginalized and have difficulty achieving community inclusion.	2012
A citizenship map was presented to focus groups of persons with mental_illness and histories of criminal justice charges and of homelessness.	2012
Suggestions included acquiring clinical experience working with individuals with severe mental_illness and having a strong psychological assessment background.	2012
Mutual-aid groups for people in recovery from mental_illness, addictions, and former incarceration are virtually nonexistent.	2012
This article provides a review of the literature on mutual-aid groups for people who have previous incarceration histories and a review of groups for people with mental_illness and multiple concerns (i.e., co-occurring diagnoses).	2012
group was designed as a mutual-aid component for individuals living with mental_illness and/or co-occurring substance abuse concerns who also have a history of previous involvement with the criminal justice system.	2012
It also reviews some of the interventions designed to facilitate the use of mutual-help groups, including groups for individuals with severe mental_illness.	2012
Homelessness is a human tragedy that is often associated with mental_illness.	2012
Maori people are overrepresented in the homeless population and among people experiencing mental_illness in New Zealand.	2012
This study explored perceptions of mental_illness in a sample of 10 female Muslim psychologists in a South African city to determine the influences of religion (and Islam specifically) on their understanding of the aetiology and treatment of mental_illness.	2012
A large body of research exists examining the associations between etiological beliefs and attitudes about mental_illness.	2012
However, relatively little research has investigated the effects of portraying mental_illness as a product of combined biological and psychosocial factors.	2012
With the onset and persistence of severe mental_illness, consumers face major challenges to their spiritual values and belief systems.	2012
As substance use and mental_illness services are increasingly integrated, mental_health professionals are presented with opportunities to refer greater numbers of dually diagnosed clients to 12-Step groups.	2012
Political interest in prevention of mental_illness has increased in recent years.	2012
Because this was an ecological study, information on other possible contributors, such as mental_illness was not available.	2012
Some see current views of mental_illness, such as depression, as merely contemporary social constructions, with madness seen as a modernist break from medieval and ancient concepts.	2012
Immediate early genes of the early growth response (EGR) gene family are activated at high levels in the brain in response to environmental events, including stress, and mediate numerous neurobiological processes that have been associated with mental_illness risk.	2012
Such studies may help reveal mechanisms by which environment can interact with genetic predisposition to influence this severe mental_illness.	2012
The study sample was female inmates aged 18 and old who were primarily minority, had experienced childhood-based trauma, committed violent crimes, had a serious mental_illness, and resided in maximum, medium, and minimum compounds of a women's prison.	2012
Caseness was associated with low adaptive functioning, diagnosis of autism and family history of mental_illness.	2012
Additionally, although it has been widely accepted that mental_illness is highly correlated with tobacco use and dependence, little research has been done to support prevention and cessation efforts for youth with mental_illnesses.	2012
The present study examined the role of personal loss due to mental_illness and meaning-related coping strategies on reports of caregiving among well siblings of adults with serious mental_illness.	2012
A sample of 103 well siblings of adults with serious mental_illness completed an online survey.	2012
Participants were recruited through websites related to mental_illness and through contact with leaders of family support groups.	2012
Personal loss has powerful implications for research and interventions focused on sibling involvement in caregiving for adults with mental_illness.	2012
The 8 articles, each with an extensive case study, represent different theoretical orientations (cognitive-behavioral, psychoeducational, systemic-strategic, experiential) and address problems with depression, anxiety, severe mental_illness, substance use disorders, and dysfunctional coping with chronic illness.	2012
Anorexia nervosa is a serious mental_illness that affects women and men of all ages.	2012
Despite a large evidence base indicating that cognitive skills programs can reduce reoffending in individuals without mental_illness, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine their effectiveness in mentally disordered offenders (MDOs).	2012
Culture shapes how individuals perceive and respond to others with mental_illness.	2012
Prior studies have suggested that Asians and Asian Americans typically endorse greater stigma of mental_illness compared to Westerners (White Europeans and Americans).	2012
However, whether these differences in stigma arise from cultural variations in automatic affective reactions or deliberative concerns of the appropriateness of one's reactions to mental_illness remains unknown.	2012
Here we compared implicit and explicit attitudes toward mental_illness among Asian and Caucasian Americans.	2012
Asian Americans showed stronger negative implicit attitudes toward mental_illness relative to Caucasian Americans, suggesting that cultural variation in stigma of mental_illness can be observed even when concerns regarding the validity and appropriateness of one's attitudes toward mental_illness are minimized.	2012
Asian Americans also explicitly endorsed greater desire for social distance from mental_illness relative to Caucasian Americans.	2012
These findings suggest that cultural variations in mental_illness stigma may arise from cultural differences in automatic reactions to mental_illness, though cultural variations in deliberative processing may further shape differences in these immediate reactions to mental_illness.	2012
After adjustment for parity, sociodemographics, child age, and maternal symptoms of depression and serious mental_illness during pregnancy and at the child survey, only MI LPB was associated with higher hyperactivity and global index scores (mean difference from FTB = 3.8 [95 confidence interval {CI}: 0.5, 7.0] and 3.1 [95 CI 0.0, 6.2]).	2012
This is problematic considering that changes to mental_health care have shifted the locus of treatment to community settings for the majority of those living with serious and persistent mental_illness (SPMI).	2012
More systematic screening and surveillance of PG among MH service users generally, and veterans with heavy alcohol use, severe mental_illness, and homelessness specifically, appears warranted.	2012
In 2004, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a consensus statement on mental_health recovery based on the New Freedom Commission's recommendation that public mental_health organizations adopt a recovery approach to severe and persistent mental_illness, including services to those dually diagnosed with mental_health and substance abuse issues.	2012
By formally adopting and promoting a recovery orientation to severe mental_illness, the United States followed suit with other first-world nations that have also adopted this approach based on two decades of research by the World Health Organization.	2012
The article introduces quantitative research reviews of family-based intervention research that appear in this issue on 10 substantive areas including conduct disorder/delinquency, drug abuse, childhood and adolescent disorders (not including the aforementioned), family psycho-education for major mental_illness, alcoholism, couple distress, relationship education, affective disorders, interpersonal violence, and chronic illness.	2012
Limited research has evaluated the utility of collaborative assessment for persons with serious mental_illness.	2012
This case example uses the Personality Assessment Inventory to illustrate the usefulness of collaborative assessment with a person with serious mental_illness.	2012
Helium users were significantly more likely to be Caucasian, to live in rural/small town areas, and to have histories of mental_illness, auditory hallucinations, and alcohol and marijuana use than nonusers.	2012
It is well established that serious mental_illness is associated with raised mortality, yet few studies have looked at the life expectancy of people with personality disorder (PD).	2012
Hypertension was over seven times more likely amongst veterans with PTSD alone than those with no mental_illness in the past 12 months.	2012
To determine if aggression, hallucinations or delusions, and depression contribute to excess mortality risk observed in individuals with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2012
In total 161 new diagnoses of mental_illness were recorded, with interventions decreasing the risk by 40 (combined relative risk 0.60, 95 CI 0.45-0.79).	2012
This study assesses whether this finding generalizes from offenders with mental_illness to their relatively healthy counterparts.	2012
In this study of 109 parolees without mental_illness, the authors found that (a) firm, fair, and caring relationships protect against rearrest, and (b) do so even after accounting for offenders' pre-existing personality traits and risk for recidivism.	2012
The purpose of this research synthesis was to examine treatment effects across studies of the service providers to offenders with mental_illness.	2012
Although meta-analytic results are based on a small sample of available studies, results suggest interventions with offenders with mental_illness effectively reduced symptoms of distress, improving offender's ability to cope with their problems, and resulted in improved behavioral markers including institutional adjustment and behavioral functioning.	2012
Furthermore, interventions specifically designed to meet the psychiatric and criminal justice needs of offenders with mental_illness have shown to produce significant reductions in psychiatric and criminal recidivism.	2012
People with serious mental_illness experience heightened physical ill-health.	2012
This paper explores nurse views on the place of physical activity in the physical health care of people with serious mental_illness who are receiving mental_health care services.	2012
The benefits of regular physical activity are particularly salient to persons with serious mental_illness (SMI) who have increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and earlier mortality from cardiovascular disease.	2012
The aim of this paper was to address this knowledge gap by exploring the perceptions of five Vietnamese American Buddhist leaders in regards to mental_illness.	2012
They attributed mental_illness to a variety of causes: daily stressors, mind-body imbalance, karma, virtuous deeds, and spiritual possession.	2012
Additionally, the perceived benefits of self-disclosure, religious involvement, mental_illness stigma, and attachment anxiety all accounted for much smaller amounts of unique variance in PReHS.	2012
Ultimately, we hypothesise that mothers with religious delusions commit acts of filicide due to the dynamic and reciprocal interaction between mental_illness, psychological functioning, and the psychological role played by religion.	2012
The important role that religious beliefs may have on perceptions of mental_illness and substance misuse warrants further investigation.	2012
Their rates for mental_illness and suicide have been shown by some researchers to be rather lower than that of the total UK population, using a variety of measures, and considering many psychiatric conditions.	2012
This paper reviews the literature on the extent of mental_illness among British South Asian adults, and explores aspects of their service use, and their attitudes to mental_illness.	2012
Results showed mental_illness in 27 of families, with those families reporting twice as many stressors on average.	2012
In addition, families with mental_illness scored lower on measures of family strength and faith practices.	2012
Analysis of desires for assistance found that help with mental_illness was a priority for those families affected by it, but ignored by others in the congregation.	2012
These results suggest that mental_illness is not only prevalent in church communities, but is accompanied by significant distress that often goes unnoticed.	2012
Annual health checks are recommended for people with severe mental_illness, as they are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.	2012
Recommendations Training for practice nurses to provide physical health checks for people with severe mental_illness should emphasise the patients' views of what will make them effective.	2012
A prior history of mental_illness (relative risk (RR) 1.83; 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.53-2.19) was associated with postpartum depressive symptoms, and women who breastfed until 6 months were less likely to experience postpartum depressive symptoms (RR 0.68; 95 CI 0.55-0.84).Conclusion This study suggests that folate status and dietary folate, B and B(12) intakes before and during pregnancy are not associated with postpartum depressive symptoms.	2012
A history of mental_illness, however, was a strong risk factor.	2012
Some of the current evidence on therapeutic communities, planned early hospital discharge, alternatives to inpatient care and job integration in people with severe mental_illness are reviewed.	2012
Eugen Bleuler was a far-sighted social psychiatrist who concentrated on treatment issues and complex interventions that are considered cornerstones of care for people with severe mental_illness one hundred years later.	2012
Depression is a highly prevalent mental_illness with increasing burden for the patients, their families and society as well.	2012
Impairments in creatine metabolism have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, leaving clinicians, researchers and patients alike wondering if dietary creatine has therapeutic value for treating mental_illness.	2012
Nicotine dependence exposes smokers with co-occurring mental_illness to increased risks of smoking-related morbidity, mortality, and to detrimental impacts on their quality of life.	2012
Furthermore, the complicated relationship observed between nicotine dependence, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and mental_illness necessitates integration of close monitoring in any successful smoking cessation program.	2012
In the present study, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of a mechanical massage chair in reducing stress for people with serious and persistent mental_illness.	2012
This preliminary investigation involves the use of massage therapy for 19 people with serious mental_illness, using a standardized massage protocol.	2012
This preliminary investigation demonstrates that use of a mechanical massage chair can significantly reduce self-identified stress levels in persons with serious mental_illness.	2012
Participants were five female members of a transitional work program for single parents with mental_illness.	2012

This one-year study explored the impact of an occupational therapy consultation model on housing status and goal attainment among 57 people with severe mental_illness who were homeless or at risk of homelessness.	2012
Focusing on what I present to students on the first day of a seminary class on mental_illness, this article cites six reasons why seminary students should learn about mental_illness.	2012
In addition to noting that they are likely to have many experiences in their ministries of persons who are suffering from a mental_illness, I also note the likelihood that some members of the class have experienced mental or emotional illnesses in their lives.	2012
These introductory comments emphasize the role that ministers may play in the prevention of mental_illness and in supporting persons in the process of rehabilitation.	2012
The various roles that pastors may play in relation to mental_illness are noted.	2012
It calls upon educators to challenge the stigmas associated with mental_illness, noting that while statistically the majority of people suffer from milder forms of Bipolar, the most extreme forms and symptoms of the disorder are popularized as the norm.	2012
Prejudice against individuals with mental_illness stems from multiple factors, including the personality traits of those harboring the prejudiced attitudes.	2012
However, little is known about the personality processes (as opposed to static correlates) leading to negative attitudes and discrimination toward individuals with mental_illness.	2012
Participants completed measures of behavioral intentions, attitudes toward individuals with mental_illness, social dominance orientation, and belief in a just world.	2012
These results illuminate the personality-process antecedents of attitudes toward individuals with mental_illness and provide a foundation for research targeting interventions intended to reduce prejudice and discrimination against this population.	2012
This study investigated sociomoral reasoning among 100 mentally disordered offenders in a maximum security hospital, 50 with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder (PD) including psychopathy and 50 with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2012
Symptoms of mental_illness can increase the risk of disturbed behaviour.	2012
Joint intervention between police and mental_health services is therefore sometimes needed to manage crisis events safely, and to divert people with a mental_illness from further criminal justice system contact.	2012
Despite increased cardiometabolic risk in individuals with mental_illness taking antipsychotic medication, metabolic screening practices are often incomplete or inconsistent.	2012
The association between familial liability to severe mental_illness and expression of psychosis spectrum was stronger in more deprived neighbourhoods [e.g. this association increased from =0.33 (p=0.01) in low-unemployment neighbourhoods to =0.92 (p<0.001) in high-unemployment neighbourhoods] and in neighbourhoods high in social control, while neighbourhood variables did not modify the association between familial liability to common mental_disorder and the psychosis outcome.	2012
Despite increasing activity aimed at reducing mental_illness stigma, there is little evidence to guide and inform specific anti-stigma campaign development and messages to be used in mass campaigns.	2012
This study links two large, international datasets to explore the association between public stigma in 14 European countries (Eurobarometer survey) and individual reports of self-stigma, perceived discrimination and empowerment among persons with mental_illness (n=1835) residing in those countries [the Global Alliance of Mental Illness Advocacy Networks (GAMIAN) study].	2012
Individuals with mental_illness living in countries with less stigmatizing attitudes, higher rates of help-seeking and treatment utilization and better perceived access to information had lower rates of self-stigma and perceived discrimination and those living in countries where the public felt more comfortable talking to people with mental_illness had less self-stigma and felt more empowered.	2012
Greater awareness of the high prevalence of people with a single lifetime episode of depression, and the development of research designs that identify these individuals and allow comparisons with those who have recurrent forms of the disorder, could yield substantial gains in understanding the lifetime pathology of this devastating mental_illness.	2012
The perinatal or early life environment may influence the development of mental_illness in adulthood.	2012
Foetal exposure to maternal stress in the intrauterine environment has been suggested as a possible mediator of foetal origins of mental_illness but the postnatal environment may also be of importance.	2012
Elevated internalized stigma is common and is linked to subjective and objective outcomes for severe mental_illness.	2012
The authors developed a manualized group-based intervention (Narrative Enhancement/Cognitive Therapy; NECT) to address internalized stigma in severe mental_illness.	2012
Family education programs regarding mental_illness and posttraumatic stress disorder, mandated for delivery in all VA medical centers and some community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), have been developed and provided primarily in large, urban medical centers.	2012
This research examines the effectiveness of the myth/fact message format (MFMF)a message format that first presents a common misperception as a myth then counters it with a correcting factwithin the healthcare and social marketing context of mental_illness (MI).	2012
Students selected a mental_illness as a report topic that included a discussion of cross-cultural applications of western concepts of mental_illness.	2012

The study investigated current police practices employed to identify those with a mental_illness in police custody, and to evaluate the predictive utility of the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS) and the Jail Screening Assessment Tool (JSAT).	2012
Axis-I disorders were compared with police decisions regarding identification of mental_illness based on their usual practices.	2012
Results indicated that current police practices produced high false negatives, with many of those experiencing mental_illness not identified.	2012
There was no significant difference in performance between BJMHS (AUC =0.722) and JSAT (AUC =0.779) in identifying those with a serious mental_illness (p=0.109).	2012
Given the high prevalence of mental_illness among detainees, there is a pressing need to introduce standardised screening tools for mental_illness in police custody.	2012
The increased prevalence of highly alexithymic subjects suggests that alexithymia is associated with a higher vulnerability to mental_illness.	2012
Illness perception (IP), defined as the beliefs a patient holds about his/her health problems, has been shown to affect coping in the context of a physical or mental_illness, e.g. compliance behaviour.	2012
Poor insight corresponded with severe mental_illness, particularly acute psychosis.	2012
Behavioral health is defined as the absence of mental_illness or substance use problems and the presence of positive emotional well being.	2012
However, sport and physical exercise can also have a positive effect on mental_illness by influencing mood, sense of self-esteem and body experience.	2012
Severe mental_illness is associated with long-lasting symptoms and various impairments including individual, social and occupational aspects.	2012
The S3 guideline on psychosocial therapies in severe mental_illness of the Germany Society for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neurology (DGPPN) offers recommendations for psychosocial interventions.	2012
This paper emphasizes specific characteristics of the S3 guidelines on psychosocial therapies in severe mental_illness and summarizes the primary results.	2012
Stigmatization of mental_illness is a widespread phenomenon even among health professionals.	2012
Just as many relationships are susceptible to the distorting and distancing effects of stigmatization, so are therapist-parent relationships, particularly in instances where children/youth present with significant mental_illness.	2012
The current study examines patient factors related to service utilization during intensive treatment for 66 residential patients suffering from severe mental_illness.	2012
The Physical Activity Scale for Individuals With Physical Disabilities was examined as a physical activity measure for people with severe mental_illness.	2012
Case manager ratings were more closely related to body mass index than clients ratings, challenging the accuracy of self-report physical activity measures for individuals with severe mental_illness.	2012
Gaps in the research and population subgroups that warrant special attention are identified, such as individuals with borderline and mild ID, individuals with co-occurring mental_illness, and individuals who are incarcerated.	2012
Disabled women with major organ malfunction, chronic mental_illness, or mental retardation had a higher likelihood to use mammography services, whereas women with multiple disabilities had the lowest likelihood of usage.	2012
Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental_illness characterized by recurrent affective episodes, as well as marked residual symptoms that interfere with functioning.	2012
Testimony about the learning and working experience of twenty years of clinical practice with mental_illness and homeless people; the author describes the therapeutic paradigm and clinical strategies the psychiatrist must learn and employ to encounter these patients, engage them in a treatment and rehabilitation towards a personalised life project to the recovery.	2012
It was found that only 11 of clients had a severe mental_illness, while another 27 had mental_disorders (depression, anxiety) commonly treated in primary care settings.	2012
Researchers have identified and studied various positive psychological constructs (e.g., hope, optimism, self-efficacy, gratitude, and life satisfaction) and found them to covary and to be positively associated with optimal human functioning and negatively associated with mental_illness.	2012
A general consensus exists that severe mental_illness (SMI) increases violence risk.	2012
Abusive and neglectful parenting is an established determinant of adult mental_illness, but longitudinal studies of the impact of less severe problems with parenting have yielded inconsistent findings.	2012
Results support the hypothesis that problems with parent-child relationships that fall short of abuse and neglect play a part in determining adult mental_health and suggest that interventions to support parenting now being implemented in many parts of the Western world may reduce the prevalence of mental_illness in adulthood.	2012
Only 32.4 of patients diagnosed with a mental_illness received CPT codes indicating receipt of psychotherapy, and of these 96.5 received individual psychotherapy.	2012
As mental_illness stigma contributes to poor outcomes for schizophrenia in China, locating strategies to reduce public stigma is imperative.	2012
The results indicate that cultural idioms do provide some protection from stigma, but only among respondents who are already familiar with what mental_illness is.	2012
This study aimed to examine the reliability and predictive validity of a highly structured and specific child abuse rating system used to code archival information for 150 psychiatric inpatients with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2012
Epidemiological research has revealed that the utilisation of professional mental_health services is low among rural Australians, despite a similar prevalence of mental_illness to urban communities.	2012
We aimed to explore service users' and carers' accounts of recent episodes of severe mental_illness and of the care received in a multi-cultural inner city.	2012
Although environmental stressors can contribute to the development of mental_illness, there is a paucity of national studies examining the association of neighborhood crime and drug problems with psychiatric disorders.	2012
Consideration of neighborhood context is important to more comprehensively understand mental_illness and its treatment in this population.	2012
Patients with mental_illness (PMI) are more vulnerable to sexual violence (SV).	2012
Numerous activities aiming to reduce the stigma of mental_illness and the consequent negative discrimination of the mentally ill and their families have been conducted in Europe.	2012
The texts contributed by the authors focus on their perception of the stigma of mental_illness and of activities undertaken to combat it in their country.	2012
This review was part of a broader systematic review examining the association between poverty and mental_illness.	2012
The aim of this paper is to report on the development and applicability of a standardised and objective measure of stigma of mental_illness in print media.	2012

Print media representations of the mental_illness in Croatia, Czech Republic, and Slovakia significantly differed in the type of media distribution, whether headline of the article was positioned on the media cover, in the use of a sensationalistic style of writing, in the association of aggressive behaviour with persons with mental_illness and in the distribution of the global impression of the headline.	2012
China's history of policy-level eugenics and genetic discrimination in the workplace suggests that Chinese communities will view genetic mental_illness less favorably than mental_illness with non-genetic causes.	2012
The aim of this study is to identify differences between Chinese Americans and European Americans in eugenic beliefs and stigma toward people with genetic mental_illness.	2012
We utilized data from a 2003 national telephone survey designed to measure how public perceptions of mental_illness differ if the illness is described as genetic.	2012
These results suggest that future anti-stigma efforts must focus on eugenic attitudes as well as cultural beliefs for Chinese Americans, and that the effects of genetic attributions for mental_illness should be examined relative to other social, moral, and religious attributions common in Chinese culture.	2012
16 of the patients came directly to a MHP with mean delay of 10.5 weeks from onset of mental_illness (direct pathway).	2012
70 and 40 of patients with mental_illness who attended General Hospital and PP were referred to MHP, respectively.	2012
The students reported decreased stigma, improved attitudes toward mental_illness and behavior changes in their professional practice.	2012
Providing students the opportunity to have contact with consumers with a mental_illness in a safe, educational setting led to decreases in stigma, the fostering of empathy and self-reported behavior changes in practice.	2012
Sharing personal stories about mental_illness is a powerful tool to decrease mental_health stigma and may be an important aspect of a person's recovery from mental_illness.	2012
Verbal memory, general psychopathology, and awareness of mental_illness were significantly associated with competitive employment in our sample.	2012
Both awareness of mental_illness and general psychopathology had a role in mediating the verbal memory-competitive employment relationship.	2012
Results show clear influence effects of educational attainment and mental_illness but no effects for physical disability.	2012
Social distance effects are present for mental_illness and physical disability but not for educational attainment.	2012
The findings extend traditions of research on status and stigma while also having potentially important implications for strategies to reduce inequalities based on mental_illness.	2012
This is of concern given that young people with suicidal thoughts or self-harm often require treatment for mental_illness as well as to reduce their risk of completed suicide.	2012
This case offers insight into the impact of two seriously impaired families systems as well as the profound pathology in a young man who unwittingly induced profound mental_illness in his very vulnerable step-sister and the mother of his baby.	2012

Patients struggling with concurrent substance use and mental_illness comorbidity may be successfully addressed in such settings and facilitate access to and completion of treatment through the utilization of on-site clinical services for HCV treatment and adherence support with mDOT.	2012
Using an anthropological approach toward understanding the issues surrounding money management for individuals struggling with addiction and mental_illness has the potential to strengthen the design and implementation of money-management-based interventions in a manner that is acceptable and meaningful for this target population.	2012
Although rights protection and best interest perspectives are frequently viewed as diametric opposites, mental_health advocacy is an important strategy in pursuit of both civil rights and therapeutic goals for people with mental_illness.	2012
This article explored whether mental_illness may be an explanatory factor in DMC.	2012
Data such as measures of violence risk and symptoms of mental_illness were taken from intake interviews with 482 detained youth in Connecticut.	2012
In addition, DMC in these data was not explained by mental_illness, seriousness of charges, violence risk, age, or gender.	2012
We suggest that mandated efforts to reduce DMC will need to address more than improving behavior or reducing symptoms of mental_illness among detained minority youth.	2012
Reports from emerging adults with mothers with affective disorders (n = 46) were compared to reports from emerging adults with mothers without mental_illness (n = 64).	2012
This qualitative study assessed the frequency and subjective meaning of adverse experiences using case study analyses of interviews with 38 formerly homeless adults with co-occurring serious mental_illness (SMI) and substance abuse histories.	2012
Mental health-related variables included chronic mental_illness and access to and use of mental_health services.	2012
Further, the findings indicated that, in the presence of chronic mental_illness, both US- and foreign-born Black Americans engaged in relatively frequent binge-drinking when health-care variables were controlled.	2012
These results underscore the need for mental_health professionals to identify co-occurring mental_illness and alcohol abuse among Black clients and, where it is found, to seek the root causes of the persistent stress that tends to accompany this co-occurrence.	2012
The extent of shotgunning among individuals with co-occurring serious mental_illness and substance use is unknown.	2012
These initiatives include institutional commitments to (a) research by the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities; (b) disparities monitoring by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; (c) new epidemiologic and service delivery information on African American populations from the National Survey of American Life sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health; as well as (d) opportunities inherent in the World Health Organization's interest in disease burden for making it possible to view African Americans' likely greater disease burden from mental_illness as a legitimate source of concern.	2012
By familiarizing themselves with these initiatives, and taking advantage of possibilities they offer, those committed to reducing African American-White American disparities in mental_illness, and treatment access and quality, can make inroads toward improving African Americans' mental_health and facilitating their successful functioning in all spheres of community living.	2012
Though larger epidemiological surveys point to lower prevalence rates of mental_illness in Asian Americans, further advances are needed in culturally valid assessment and quantification of cultural biases in symptom reporting in order to draw definitive conclusions about the state of Asian American mental_health.	2012
For a group of adolescent males who had suffered the effects of some of our worst social problemsrampant community and domestic violence, racial and ethnic conflict, child abuse and neglect, parental substance abuse and criminality, poverty, and untreated mental_illness in familiesthis task is complex.	2012
There is no published research investigating the effectiveness of therapeutic puppetry with people with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2012
In traditional treatment settings, arts interventions offer opportunities for emotional expression and social interaction and have been shown to improve motivation, to increase personal empowerment and to relieve negative symptoms associated with mental_illness.	2012
The purpose of the current project was to examine the effectiveness an arts program for individuals with chronic mental_illness served by a community Clubhouse.	2012
Little is known about African American mens beliefs about mental_illness.	2012
A descriptive qualitative study, using the common sense model (CSM), examined African American mens beliefs about mental_illness, perceptions of stigma associated with mental_illness, and barriers to help-seeking.	2012
Dimensional analysis guided by the CSM showed most of the men identified mental_illness causal factors consistent with the biopsychosocial model of mental_disorders.	2012
They believed mental_illness is a chronic disorder having negative consequences and reported experiencing barriers to help seeking.	2012
In contrast with previous studies, most men in the present study did not perceive stigma associated with mental_illness and did not identify stigma as a barrier to help seeking.	2012
The study also provides support for the contention that certain forms of mental_illness may still exist in the gene pool because particular personality traits associated with milder forms of mental_illness (i.e., Neuroticism & schizotypy) are also associated directly with creativity and indirectly with shortterm mating success.	2012
In the UK, the Mental Health Act 1983 allows for the transfer of prisoners to hospital for treatment of acute mental_illness.	2012
Many made clear distinctions between patients with mental_illness and those with personality disorder.	2012
Current conceptualizations of mental_illness focus on assessing psychopathology.	2012
Our study investigated whether a new prejudice reduction technique, imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009), could combat stigma against people with mental_illness, and the mediating processes through which it may exert this beneficial effect.	2012
A prior diagnosis with mental_illness was not associated with the number of strengths reported, but self-perception of strengths was associated with altruistic orientation.	2012
CVD risk behaviors such as smoking are not routinely assessed or assertively treated among people with a severe mental_illness.	2012
Results indicate that, although individual studies have found support for various indicators or scoring systems, these results are rarely replicated, many times studies finding significant results suffer from serious methodological flaws and alternative explanations for findings (e.g., mental_illness) are often present.	2012
Collectively, this research highlights the functional relevance of DMN suppression for goal-directed cognition, possibly by reducing goal-irrelevant functions supported by the DMN (e.g., mind-wandering), and illustrates the functional significance of DMN suppression deficits in severe mental_illness.	2012
However, there are also important psychosocial aspects of mental_illness that play a significant role in recovery from these conditions.	2012
However, computational depictions of cognitive function have had surprisingly little impact on the way we assess mental_illness because diseases of the mind have not been systematically conceptualized in computational terms.	2012
Comorbidity due to mental_illness was also a factor that contributed to self-injury, though we found that severely mentally ill inmates often alerted officials of their imminent need to self-injure.	2012
Canadian youth can experience a range of mental_health problems and mental_illness, many of which perpetuate into adulthood.	2012
Past studies also revealed that people with these mental_illness exhibit perceptual problems with altered neural activation.	2012
Nevertheless, there have been no systematic attempts to investigate biological motion perception in people with mental_illness associated with impaired social functioning until a decade ago.	2012
This empirical study examines the association between substance abuse, mental_illness, health behaviors and different patterns of homelessness among recently released, HIV-infected jail detainees.	2013
Therefore, the present study aims to understand the ways in which experience of serious life events increases risk of both adherence lapse and mental_illness in HIV-positive populations.	2013
Using an integrative review approach, two authors searched 11 selected databases, and hand searched an additional 15 promising journals to answer the question: What is the state of school-based mental_health promotion literature reviews published in selected databases in the English language from 1998 to 2010?Findings suggest a whole school approach focusing on mental_health promotion rather than on mental_illness prevention is effective in promoting child and youth mental_health.	2013
Research into mental_illness and its relationship with violence has been constrained by inconsistencies in the definition and measurement of violent behavior.	2013
This mixed-methods study of 300 consumers of mental_health services in the Southeastern US aims to better understand the impact of community supports, termed distal supports, on community integration and recovery from mental_illness.	2013
This research focused on the relationships between a national team and five project sites across Canada in planning a complex, community intervention for homeless people with mental_illness called At Home/Chez Soi, which is based on the Housing First model.	2013
This study assessed the effectiveness of an intervention based on a theoretical framework of citizenship on reducing psychiatric symptoms, alcohol use, and drug use, and increasing quality of life for persons with serious mental_illness (SMI) and criminal justice involvement.	2013
We found that the increasing stressors trajectory was associated with higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation, and that stress trajectories had unique relationships with mental_illness.	2013
We also showed that baseline stressors, sum stressors, and high but decreasing stressors maintained positive associations with mental_illness after controlling for baseline depression.	2013
It is claimed to be a revolutionary departure from the past and a guide to policy that will transform outcomes of severe mental_illness.	2013
The subtypes varied significantly on their levels of mental_illness, substance use, and criminal activity.	2013
After treatment of mental_illness, it was possible to reintegrate about 70 of the patients into their families.	2013
Untreated/inadequately treated mental_illness was the most common reason for homelessness.	2013
For the total sample, 20 of suicides were triggered by mental_illness, and 58 were triggered by social/environmental events.	2013
In 9 there were both mental_illness and social/environmental factors, and in 14 no triggers could be identified.	2013
There were group differences; the non-Indigenous group was over represented in the mental_illness category and the Indigenous group was over represented in the social/environmental category ( = 41.5, p = 0.000).	2013
One of the greatest barriers to individuals with mental_illnesses in achieving their life goals is the stigma of mental_illness.	2013
People with mental_illness experience discrimination, paternalistic treatment, and avoidance.	2013
The influence of stigma experiences on mental_health was modeled in a two-wave panel with persons with mental_illness (N = 367, 79 repeated response rate).	2013
To investigate self-reported health behaviors among Australian adults with mental_illness, 1,935 Australian adults completed an online survey including the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and instruments assessing health behaviors in October 2011.	2013
Australian adults with current mental_illness demonstrate significantly poorer health behaviors than those without mental_illness.	2013
Individuals with serious mental_illness are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and face difficulties accessing mental_health services both during incarceration and upon re-entry into the community.	2013
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 43 individuals identified as having a history of serious mental_illness and criminal justice involvement, as well as with 25 providers who have worked with this population.	2013
The frequency of serious violent incidents perpetrated by people with a mental_illness is an insufficient explanation.	2013
Understandings of mental_illness and of the role of those charged with their care (or control) play a key role.	2013
Unrealistic expectations for risk assessment and management in general psychiatric practice carry a variety of significant costs, taking a number forms, to those with a mental_illness, to mental_health professionals and to services.	2013
Especially important are changes in professional practice and accountabilities that are significantly divorced from traditional practice, implications for trust in patient-clinician relationships and the organisations in which mental_health professionals work, and practices that often breach the ethical principle of justice (or fairness) and heighten discrimination against people with mental_illness.	2013
In light of the substantial growth of the forensic mental_health system over the past two decades, witnessed both in Canada and abroad, we propose that the study of motivational influences underlying the offending behaviors of persons with serious mental_illness (SMI) is necessary to begin disentangling symptom-based offending from violent and antisocial behaviors that may have other motives.	2013
Further research is needed to test this theory not only in TBI but also in other areas such as in mental_illness, neurodegenerative disease and addiction.	2013
The patient did not have a pre-injury history of mental_illness, nor a family history of a psychotic disorder.	2013
The participants identified barriers to service provision for individuals who are homeless and have sustained TBI with a focus on age- and gender-related issues, co-morbid TBI and mental_illness and jurisdictional differences.	2013
This study assesses the levels of mental_illness in undergraduate students to examine whether widening participation in education has resulted in increases as hypothesised by the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists.	2013
Rates of mental_illness in students equalled those of the general population but only 5.1 were currently receiving treatment.	2013
Despite the prevalence of mental_health problems, society continues to stigmatize and discriminate against people with mental_illness and in particular, schizophrenia.	2013
Among the negative consequences of stigma, is that some individuals with mental_illness internalize negative stereotypes about themselves, referred to as self-stigma, which is associated with a reluctance to seek needed treatment.	2013
The challenge to overcome mental_illness stigma has led to the development of global anti-stigma initiatives, which effectively engage young people in school-based programs.	2013
Students who are excluded from the daily life of schools are at risk for mental_illness.	2013
This study examined whether having a parent with a mental_illness or a parent who abuses substances predicts treatment outcomes for children receiving community-based services for exposure to violence.	2013
One-way bivariate analyses indicated that children of mothers or fathers with a mental_illness and children of mothers who abused substances had higher CBCL scores at intake.	2013
Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed a main effect such that maternal and paternal mental_illness and maternal substance abuse were associated with poorer CBCL scores.	2013
The only parental risk factor to moderate the association between treatment and CBCL scores was paternal mental_illness.	2013
Treatment was associated with greater improvement in CBCL scores for children of fathers with, relative to those without, mental_illness, and the effect was due to higher CBCL scores at intake for children of fathers with mental_illness rather than lower outcome scores.	2013
Additionally, the effectiveness of services appears to be robust to parental risk factors such as mental_illness and substance abuse.	2013
Young offenders have a high prevalence of mental_illness and a large proportion report experiencing a number of traumatic events during childhood, but there is little research exploring this association.	2013
Much of the literature on social recovery is derived from firstperson accounts or primary research with adult service users experiencing severe mental_illness.	2013
This article details the considerable research showing links between ADHD symptoms and parental mental_illness, child maltreatment, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attachment disorders and other environmental factors.	2013
Recapturing meaning in life has been described as an essential element in the process of recovery from severe mental_illness (SMI), but limited quantitative research still restricts our understanding of this phenomenon.	2013
The purpose of the current study was to explore the meaning in life among people with SMI and variables that may influence it such as internalized stigma and insight into the mental_illness.	2013
To explore these assumptions, 60 persons with SMI completed questionnaires that assessed their meaning in life, insight into their mental_illness and internalized stigma, after which the data were analyzed using correlation and cluster analysis.	2013
The aim of this study was to examine the role of emotions like pity and anger in mediating the relationship between beliefs about the controllability of a mental_illness, and the willingness to help someone with a mental_illness.	2013
ANOVA analysis of responses to a revised version of the AQ-27 from 371 participants demonstrated that beliefs about controllability lead to significantly higher personal responsibility beliefs, negative affective reactions and decreased helping intentions in comparison to when the cause of mental_illness was believed to be uncontrollable.	2013
Data collection included demographics (sex, age, ethnicity), principal diagnosis according to SCID (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition), duration of mental_illness, number of psychiatric admissions and treatment information.	2013
Three dimensions of insight (awareness of: mental_illness, benefit of treatment, psychosocial consequences) improved after treatment, regardless of the group.	2013
Our findings suggest that screening for NES among patients with serious mental_illness may efficiently identify a subgroup with additional clinical needs.	2013
There is a scarcity of well validated measures of the subjective experience of the stigma of mental_illness.	2013
Our results showed that positive and negative symptoms, executive functions, verbal memory-learning were contributors of awareness of mental_illness; positive and negative symptoms explained variability in awareness of the need for treatment; positive symptoms and executive functions contributed to awareness of the social consequences of disorder.	2013
Although depression, as well as other mental_illness, is a strong risk factor for suicide, depression and suicide are both likely to be related to hopelessness, which in turn could be a consequence of psychological strains that resulted from social structure and life events.	2013
Marriage and family therapists will need to know how to treat this clinical presentation, as it is gaining recognition as a diagnostic category in the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual used to identify mental_illness.	2013
In this article, we present the results of a preliminary evaluation of a comprehensive treatment program specifically designed to treat co-occurring issues of mental_illness and criminal risk in persons with mental_illness (PMI) that are criminal justice involved.	2013
The model accounts for firesetting by male and female mentally disordered offenders and highlights the importance of early childhood experiences of fire and the onset of mental_illness as precursors to firesetting within this population.	2013
Two clinical pathway interventions - one based in a medium secure forensic hospital and the other in a remand prison (pre-trial/sentence) - were independently introduced to manage referrals of prisoners with acute mental_illness in London, UK.	2013
Women were more likely to be diagnosed with mental_illness.	2013
This study explores the use of the MVQ with a 'normal' (non-offender) population and an offender population without mental_illness in order to evaluate how the MVQ's subscales related to violence within these groups.	2013
This article explores the role that medicalized language and its use by seven noted historians of psychiatry (Norman Dain, Albert Deutsch, Gerald Grob, Roy Porter, Charles Rosenberg, Andrew Scull, and Edward Shorter) might have played in shaping the contemporary view of madness as mental_illness.	2013
An analysis of the scenes of feigned madness and psychiatric examination suggests that the play (and the earlier Greek play from which it was adapted) offers two related ethical reflections, one on the validity of psychiatric diagnoses, the other on the validity of the entire medical model of insanitythat is, of the popular notion and political truth that mental_illness is a (bodily) disease like any other.	2013
Per psychological persuasion policymakers and psychologists often assert that mental_illness and addiction not only exist but are treatable in the way that literal diseases exist and are treatable.	2013
E-mental_health services are Internet-based treatment options for mental_illness.	2013
A growing literature indicates that genetic variation, in combination with adverse early life experiences, shapes risk for later mental_illness.	2013
The purpose of this article is to examine the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and non-Hispanic whites aged 50 and older with data on psychiatric and physical comorbidity, mental_illness severity, and service use.	2013
MDD among older adults is highly prevalent, often associated with other psychiatric disorders or chronic physical conditions, and is associated with high overall mental_illness severity.	2013
Social anxiety (SA) is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with mental_illness.	2013
The aim of the present study was to measure the level of self-reported SA in PA participation in patients with mental_illness compared to healthy controls.	2013
Six hundred ninety-three patients with mental_illness and 2,888 controls aged between 18 and 65 years completed the Physical Activity and Sport Anxiety Scale (PASAS).	2013
Our data indicate that patients with mental_illness reported higher levels of SA in PA situations compared to healthy control subjects.	2013
Health professionals should consider SA when trying to improve outcome and adherence of patients with mental_illness to PA interventions.	2013
Several scholars have argued in the early 1900s, especially in the 1930s, the media often associated marijuana with violence and mental_illness.	2013
This article examines the diagnosis of mental_illness as part of a process that can be more clearly understood if envisioned as part of a larger system that goes on in most social encounters.	2013
The film teaches a powerful lesson: how a community might manage mental_illness without the social side-effects.	2013
We report research implicating nostalgia as an intrapersonal means of warding off the stigmatization of persons with mental_illness.	2013
We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person with mental_illness improves attitudes toward the mentally ill.	2013
Being a carer/parent of someone with mental_illness can be associated with negative outcomes for the caregiver.	2013
Child care and parenting needs of adults with mental_illness are of growing concern, especially among those seeking Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental_health services.	2013
Jail diversion is one means by which people with mental_illness are treated in the community - often with some criminal justice system oversight - instead of being incarcerated.	2013
This study estimates the impact on taxpayer costs of a model jail diversion program for people with serious mental_illness.	2013
Jail diversion for people with mental_illness may thus be justified fiscally.	2013
Findings point to the prominent role of hope as a source of resilience for Latino families dealing with severe mental_illness of a loved one.	2013
However, we also argue that the very assumptions of biomedicine ensure that this promise can never entirely be fulfilled and, despite its lure, a biomedical construction of mental_illness all too frequently fails to protect individuals from delegitimation and stigma.	2013
The COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism has been implicated in human mental_illness, with Met/Met homozygotes associated with increased susceptibility to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	2013
Finally, we propose a Bayesian framework to study emotional influences on inhibitory control, providing several hypotheses that may be useful to conceptualize inhibitory control biases in mental_illness such as depression and anxiety.	2013
From a naturalistic perspective on mental_illness, depression is often described in terms of biological dysfunctions, while a normative perspective emphasizes the lived experience of depression as a harmful condition.	2013
In the context to mental_illness metabolic syndrome (MS) has gained significant attention in the last decade.	2013
A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban community in South Delhi to study perception and attitude of the community about towards mental_illness.	2013
An adult member in household selected by systematic random sampling was interviewed using semi-structured interview schedule for perception about mental_illness and 34 item Opinion about Mental Illness for Chinese Community (OMICC) scale.	2013
Change in the behavior was perceived as the most common symptom of mental_illness.	2013
Although mental stress was identified as the most common cause of mental_illness, 25 attributed it to evil spirits.	2013
Keeping surroundings friendly and sharing problems with others were identified as - important preventive measures against mental_illness.	2013
Study observed lack of awareness regarding bio-medical concept of mental_illness with socially restrictive, stereotyping, pessimistic, and non-stigmatizing attitude toward mental_illness in the capital city.	2013
Parental mental_illness has been found to have an impact on offsprings in their emotional, social, and behavioral aspects of life.	2013
Growing up with a parent having mental_illness can have negative impact on offsprings.	2013
In Study 1, participants (N = 169) were randomly assigned to rate 1 of 6 target groups (people with mental_illness, atheists, people claiming alien visitations, people reporting angelic visitations, religious people, or people like me) regarding social, moral, and psychological normalcydeviance.	2013
However, the extent to which Bollywood movies have played a responsible role in reinforcing societal attitudes towards mental_illness and treatment modalities such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is unknown.	2013
The key findings of the study were that attitudes towards mental_illness and ECT in Indian cinema paralleled broader political and socio-economic trends in Indian society.	2013
The belief of the effect of the full moon on mental_illness is well established in western societies.	2013
In our study, we examined the lunar cycle effect on patients with mental_illness attending the emergency room (ER) in a psychiatric hospital in Kuwait.	2013
As the notion of the effect of lunar cycle on mental_illness is not held in Islam, our study acted as a blind control study examining if there is a real biological basis for the myth.	2013
We conclude, therefore, that the lunar cycle has no influence on ER visits by patients with mental_illness and if there is such an effect, then it is mostly psychological rather than biological.	2013
The delivery of psychiatric rehabilitation interventions has been recognised as fundamental to facilitate recovery of people with severe mental_illness.	2013
We relate his treatment issues to specific fundamental values that infuse both the lived experience of mental_illness and inform clinical and community treatment strategies for this group.	2013
This study explores perceptions of mental_illness in a sample of Ethiopian community members, healthcare workers and traditional healers.	2013
Specifically, the attitudes, beliefs and practices associated with the symptoms, causes and treatment of mental_illness were investigated.	2013
Qualitative analysis of the interview responses indicated a range of beliefs about the recognition and etiology of mental_illness.	2013
Nine themes were identified in response to the questions how do you identify and what causes mental_illness: Psychocultural appropriateness, Religious/spiritual, Social difficulty, Behavioral disturbance, Cognitive-emotional impairment, Disaster and economic deprivation, Adaptive functioning, Substance abuse and Physical/medical.	2013
Adults with intellectual disabilities still have limited access to psychiatric hospitalization when they experience mental_illness.	2013
Only empirical studies from psychiatric units admitting patients with intellectual disabilities and confirmed or suspected mental_illness were considered.	2013
Practical application: It appears that patients with intellectual disabilities and mental_illness admitted to psychiatric inpatient units have especially complex conditions, which may include psychosis or affective disorder, challenging behaviour, often with additional physical conditions, and sparse verbal skills.	2013
Researchers investigated past-year substance use in relation to the following variables: demographic characteristics (gender, ethnicity, age, familial use of public assistance), antisocial behavior, and mental_illness symptoms (psychopathic traits, psychiatric distress, and prior trauma).	2013
In all, 24 students participated, and the majority had either gone to school with, had observed in passing, or had a friend of the family or a relative with a mental_illness, although only 21 had had knowledge on mental_illness up to the intervention.	2013
Their attitudes to individuals with mental_illness as regards employment, treatment, assistance, and recovery were encouraging, even at baseline, and all their responses improved following the sessions.	2013
There was a view that those with mental_illness were somewhat reluctant to seek professional help.	2013
The aim of the study was to further explore the history of mental_illness and trauma in a sample of women (N = 31) who had recently given birth and had a substance use problem while pregnant.	2013
Women-centered services are in great demand, as well as trauma informed care, and further research on appropriate treatment for substance using, traumatized, women with a mental_illness.	2013
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative mental_illness characterized by memory loss, multiple cognitive impairments, and changes in personality and behavior.	2013
The individual determinants of health service utilization model suggests that several factors contribute to health care attitudes and utilization, including illness factors (beliefs about etiology of mental_health issues and level of somatization), predisposing factors (gender, age, and opinions about mental_illness), and enabling factors (socioeconomic status and geographical location).	2013
Children of parents with a mental_illness are often found to be at high risk of developing psychological problems themselves.	2013
Path analyses were used to examine the direct associations between parental mental_illness and adolescent problems as well as the indirect relations via parentchild interaction and family environment.	2013
The results showed that interaction between parents with a mental_illness and their child was significantly worse compared to parents without a mental_illness.	2013
The family environment of parents with mental_illness was also more negative.	2013
Behavioural problems in childhood often lead to poor long-term outcomes, including increased risk of adult mental_illness, unemployment, criminality and shorter life expectancy.	2013
College psychotherapists should counter the common false beliefs about mental_illness that lead to disabling treatment, and advance a strengthening psychosocial orientation, including psychotherapy.	2013
Rapidly placing homeless Veterans with severe mental_illness into permanent housing is one important goal of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentVeterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUDVASH) program; however, no research has tested whether an explicit organizational alignment of this goal with revised practices could improve outcomes.	2013
This study investigated the mediating properties of stigma coping and social support on the relationship between societal stigma, internalized stigma, mental_health recovery, and quality of life among people with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2013
This discussion applies those ideas to some particulars of clinical psychology, psychopathology and the treatment and rehabilitation of severe and disabling mental_illness.	2013
In recent years, there have been many innovative changes in the field of mental_illness.	2013
The field has generated numerous creative ideas that help to expand our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of mental_illness.	2013
The present manuscript confronts several recent and historical fads in the diagnosis and treatment of mental_illness.	2013
We review a few of these critiques concerning such matters as pathologizing normal experiences and reactions to events and spreading not only our brain disease conception of mental_illness but our Western symptom repertoire as well around the globe in a detrimental manner.	2013
Professional counselors who provided services to those affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita completed the K6+ (screen for severe mental_illness), the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale.	2013
Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we generally find a negative effect of mental_illness on household spending, although the specific effects vary by the measure of mental_illness, by the expenditure category, and by gender and couple status.	2013
Of particular concern, single and married women with mental_illness reduce spending on education, which suggests a long-term financial cost of mental_illness.	2013
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term, 6-session, dynamic, psychosocial-oriented intervention focusing on the caregiving family and aiming at helping family members regain meaning and control over their own lives, notwithstanding the mental_illness of their kin.	2013
This article examines the mental_illness defense in China which is set out in Article 18 of its penal code.	2013
Some important terms in Chinas mental_illness defense law are not as well defined as in Canadas mental_disorder defense.	2013
On the other hand, Chinas mental_illness provision contains both a cognitive element and a volitional (will) element, while Canadas mental_disorder defense only contains a cognitive element.	2013
Also, Chinas criminal law expressly provides for a mitigated punishment (but not a reduced conviction) for those who, due to mental_illness, have only partial ability to recognize or control their conduct.	2013
Finally, the article discusses the different approaches in the two countries to providing psychiatric evidence to the courts and provides some data on the frequency, nature and disposition of persons found not responsible due to mental_illness.	2013
The impact of the ongoing experience of mental_illness of a sibling and the absence of a functioning parental couple on the developmental pathway of a 16-year-old young woman is explored through the developmental psychoanalytic lens.	2013
Findings Comorbid mental_illness, when detected early, can be successfully managed with limited additional disability.	2013
Considering what has been studied regarding asylum seeking, immigration issues, cultural beliefs of same-sex behavior, mental_illness, help seeking, and prevalence rates of affective disorders, the authors discuss the implications on mental_health this combination can yield, while providing guidelines for treatment.	2013
The author, a social scientist, an adult educator and a published poet, begins with the role of writing in her own processing of the painful experience of a family member's severe mental_illness and suicide, showing us her earliest therapeutic writing.	2013
National reports and academic literature highlight that to prevent the escalation of perinatal mental_illness, significant change is needed to support health professionals in detecting, discussing and dealing with mental_illnesses.	2013
Research has documented social network instability among people with serious mental_illness focusing on psychiatric symptoms that interfere with social skills and interaction and stigma, discrimination, and social rejection.	2013
However, the social network consequences of disruptive events that often accompany onset of serious mental_illness (e.g., divorce, job loss, and residential instability) are seldom considered.	2013
A theory of relationship and network dynamics in mental_illness integrating insights from the psychiatric, labeling, and social network perspectives is proposed.	2013
Thus, investing in activities to promote work motivation may be an effective means of preventing long-term sick leave for stress-related mental_illness and of providing energy for successful career advancement.	2013
The National Institute of Mental Health Research Domains Criteria (RDoC) initiative aims to redefine mental_illness leveraging information that spans molecular to behavioral levels of analysis.	2013
The current study examines the role of mental_illness-related stigma on romantic or sexual relationships and sexual behavior among youth with mental_illness (MI), including youths' experiences of stigma, the internalization of these experiences, and the behavior associated with managing stigma within romantic and sexual relationships.	2013
We conducted in-depth interviews with N=20 youth with mental_illness (MI) (55 male, 16-24 years, 75 Latino) from 4 psychiatric outpatient clinics in New York City.	2013
Promoting help-seeking for family and reducing stigma of mental_illness may be effective for suicide prevention.	2013
In order to improve help seeking by young people for mental_illness, a better understanding is required of their help-seeking intentions and barriers to their help seeking from various different sources and for different disorders.	2013
Age, sex, and knowing a family member or friend who had received professional help for mental_illness predicted some barriers.	2013
In some individuals, recovery from episodes of mental_illness may be impeded by maladaptive illness beliefs and behaviors.	2013
Clinical assessment in these ethnic groups should ensure recognition and treatment of mental_illness and alcohol misuse.	2013
Religious belief is an important determinant of mental_health, depression is the mental_illness responsible for the largest disease burden globally, and Islam is the fastest growing world religion.	2013
Findings suggest that community awareness campaigns (such as those by beyondblue) that encourage appropriate close contact with others affected by mental_health problems and improved accurate psychiatric label use may have potential to counter various aspects of stigma, especially personal beliefs that mental_illness is a weakness.	2013
This study describes the mental_illness and psychosocial outcomes of adolescents who experienced a depressive disorder and identifies predictors of full remission and recurrence.	2013
Adolescents who experience depressive disorder are at high risk of ongoing mental_illness and psychosocial impairment.	2013
Inpatient psychiatric records provided demographic, lifetime cannabis use, family history of mental_illness, and clinical data on 45 FEP adolescents, aged 12-18 years, admitted to a psychiatric unit in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, over a 2-year period.	2013
Of the 15/43 (34.8) FEP patients with family history of mental_illness, 10 had a history of cannabis use.	2013
The 26 (57.8) schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients did not differ significantly from the 19 (42.2) with other psychoses in terms of cannabis use and family history of mental_illness.	2013
Quantifying diagnostic transitions across development is needed to estimate the long-term burden of mental_illness.	2013
Guided by a life course perspective, the present study examined whether aspects of the emerging adult-mother relationship, specifically affection, felt obligation, role reversal, and reciprocity, mediated the association between having a mother with mental_illness and poorer psychological adjustment.	2013
Emerging adults with mothers with mental_illness (n = 52) and emerging adults without mothers with mental_illness (n = 64) were recruited from institutes of higher education and responded to an online self-report questionnaire.	2013
Results from multiple mediation analyses indicated a history of parent-child role reversal mediated the association between having a mother with mental_illness and emerging adults' psychological symptoms.	2013
None of the assessed aspects of the emerging adult-mother relationship mediated the association between maternal mental_illness and emerging adults' psychological well-being, but having divorced parents and being older was associated with lower levels of psychological well-being.	2013
Assessment of a history of role reversal may be relevant to clinical practice with emerging adults, particularly those with mothers with mental_illness.	2013
Life course perspectives can inform future studies of emerging adults with mothers with mental_illness.	2013
The current study was undertaken to better understand the craving-drinking relationship among individuals dually diagnosed with a severe mental_illness (SMI) and an alcohol use disorder (AUD).	2013
Support from social networks is imperative to mental_health recovery of persons with mental_illness.	2013
However, disclosing mental_illness may damage a person's participation in networks due to mental_illness stigma, especially in Chinese immigrant communities where social networks (the guanxi network) have specific social-cultural significance.	2013
This study focused on mental_illness disclosure in Chinese immigrant communities in New York City.	2013
Two bilingual psychologists interviewed each participant once in a semistructured interview, including 6 questions on mental_illness disclosure.	2013
Recommendations for culturally sensitive practice to facilitate mental_illness disclosure among Chinese immigrants were discussed.	2013
Two established but disparate lines of research exist: studies examining the self-stigma associated with mental_illness and studies examining the self-stigma associated with seeking psychological help.	2013
To help clarify this debate, we examined in the present investigation the overlap and uniqueness of the self-stigmas associated with mental_illness and with seeking psychological help.	2013
Data were collected from a sample of college undergraduates experiencing clinical levels of psychological distress (N = 217) and a second sample of community members with a self-reported history of mental_illness (N = 324).	2013
Family caregivers' views and experiences related to treatment usage processes by their adult relatives with serious and persistent mental_illness (SPMI) were empirically examined in a sample of Latino caregivers (n = 17) who were users of services at the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) in a predominantly Latino- (80) and Mexican-descent large city in the Southwest United States.	2013
Classic work on mental_illness stigma and labeling theory reinforced that the mark of mental_illness created prejudice and discrimination for individuals and family members.	2013
A reply came in a resurgence of research directed toward mental_illness stigma nationally and internationally, bringing together researchers from different disciplines for the first time.	2013
This qualitative study examined three stigma reduction interventions against mental_illness stigma: education, video, and contact.	2013
Responses to two open-ended questions revealed common negative and stereotypical themes associated with mental_illness.	2013
The present study examined whether and how collegians' misuse of prescription drugs and alcohol abuse are associated with mental_illness and with a lack of mental_health care.	2013
We observed the presence of alcohol abuse/dependence and the nonmedical use of prescription drugs to be associated with relatively serious mental_illness and with lack of health care.	2013
In pursuing gender-specific results, we found that the association between alcohol abuse and mental_illness was stronger among females than males.	2013
To validate the Brief Situational Confidence Questionniare (BSCQ) with people diagnosed with severe mental_illness (N=129), we examined the associations between abstinence self-efficacy (BSCQ) and alcohol consumption level (within the previous 6months), drug use, and problems related to substance use while controlling for key symptoms of major mental_illness and motives for alcohol use (Drinking Motives Questionnaire).	2013
In consequence, cultural and racial factors relating to mental_illness and emotional disturbances deserve closer attention and consideration.	2013
Individuals with severe mental_illness (SMI) are at greatly increased risk for trauma exposure and for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	2013
The absence of childhood adversities was protective, in that it significantly decreased an individual's risk for subsequent adult mental_illness.	2013
Trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur with serious mental_illness, yet the unique mental and physical health influences of childhood physical abuse (CPA), childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and forced sexual trauma on individuals with serious mental_illness remain unevaluated.	2013
The present study of 172 individuals with serious mental_illness investigated the adverse effects of CPA, CSA, and forced sexual trauma on severity of PTSD and depression, and overall mental and physical health functioning.	2013
Sexual traumas have profound negative effects on mental and physical health outcomes among individuals with serious mental_illness; increased screening and treatment of sexual traumas is needed.	2013
Mental health courts (MHCs) have become widespread in the United States as a form of diversion for justice-involved individuals with mental_illness.	2013
Research has begun to elucidate that persons with mental_illness become involved in the criminal justice system as a result of criminality and not merely because of their mental_illness.	2013
This study aims to clarify the similarities and differences in criminal thinking and psychiatric symptomatology between persons with mental_illness who are and are not criminal justice involved.	2013
In addition to the inpatient sample, 94 incarcerated persons with mental_illness from a previously conducted study were selected based on their match with the current sample on several key demographic and psychiatric variables.	2013
The results of this study indicated that hospitalized persons with mental_illness with a history of criminal justice involvement evidenced similar thinking styles to persons with mental_illness who were incarcerated.	2013
Persons with mental_illness without criminal justice involvement evidenced fewer thinking styles supportive of a criminal lifestyle than the incarcerated sample.	2013
Furthermore, the persons with mental_illness sample with no history of criminal justice involvement showed significantly lower levels of psychopathology shown to be risk factors for criminal justice involvement (e.g., antisocial personality, drug dependence, alcohol dependence).	2013
It benefits from a federal pretrial services agency that screens all arrestees for mental_illness and dedicates a specialized supervision unit (SSU) to provide supervision and services while on pretrial release to all screened positive, including MHC participants.	2013
This study adds to the accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of MHCs in reducing recidivism among offenders with severe mental_illness.	2013
In cases other than mental_illness non-accepting attitudes surface.	2013
Emerging adulthood is a life stage in which the frequency of religious behaviours often wanes while the risk of mental_illness, substance abuse, and risky sexual behaviour increases.	2013
Six themes were identified; South Asians' knowledge of general mental_illness and aging; the nature of dementia and its symptoms, beliefs about the causes of dementia; community perceptions regarding dementia; treatment for dementia as well as how service provision could be improved.	2013
This paper outlines an unconventional treatment for mental_illness, the exorcism or deliverance ritual used by Pentecostals and some other charismatic Christians.	2013
Caregivers involved in looking after their relatives with mental_illness played a vital role in mental_health promotion.	2013
This study sought to examine the caregivers' perception of mental_illness, including how they thought the illness was best controlled, the reasons why their relatives found it difficult to take their medication as instructed, and the coping skills that they employed when caring for their relatives.	2013
Research has established that living in a high EE environment, which is characterized by increased levels of critical and emotionally exaggerated communication, leads to a poorer prognosis for patients with a mental_illness when compared to low EE environments.	2013
These findings suggest that it is feasible to improve some aspects of cognitive abilities with a simple computerised training programme for people with serious mental_illness.	2013
The objective of this research was to gain a deeper understanding of factors influencing the healthiness of food choice behaviors of community-dwelling adults with severe mental_illness.	2013
The themes that emerged were: understanding clients with mental_illness; understanding occupation and occupational therapy; feeling like a professional; and changing as a person.	2013
Cases were characterized in terms of basic demographic variables, the temporal sequence of events in the transition from hospital care to hospice, the mechanism of injury and medical complications, the presence of mental_illness, and family involvement in decision making.	2013
The majority of subjects (6/8) had evidence of serious mental_illness.	2013
Due to the stigma associated with mental_illness in America, religious leaders and their congregations might be fearful of caring for and worshipping alongside a person with mental_illness.	2013
It is proposed here that congregations need to grow in courage as they attempt to serve people who struggle with mental_illness, just as people with mental_illness exhibit courage in venturing out to participate in church life.	2013
The participants were 100 male patients in a maximum security hospital (50 with severe mental_illness and 50 with personality disorder) and 50 community based healthy controls.	2013
In contrast, risk-taking only correlated with impulsivity among the severe mental_illness group.	2013
International research suggests that problematic approaches and attacks on politicians are frequently perpetrated by individuals with severe mental_illness who are either unknown to mental_health services or who have disengaged from care.	2013
The current study investigated the extent of harassing behaviours towards Queensland State Parliamentarians and of perceived mental_illness in their harassers.	2013
This exploratory research investigated how individuals caring for a family member with a mental_illness adapted to the role of carer or supporter.	2013
This article explores the legal and clinical processes underpinning gender differences in Australian Family Court statistics which show that mental_illness is the primary reason for limiting mothers contact with their children.	2013
Analysis of a sample of published judgments from 2009 to 2011 featuring mental_illness and outcomes of limited child contact identified that allegations of child sex abuse were a common feature of cases in which mothers child contact was limited.	2013
Four illustrative cases are presented with a focus on the processes used in the identification of mental_illness.	2013
The data indicate that there are different patterns of response to cases where a party has a previously diagnosed mental_illness and cases where mental_illness is invoked as a possible explanation for child sex abuse allegations.	2013
These identified patterns of differentiated response provide a possible explanation for the gender disparity in Family Court reasons for limiting child contact on the grounds of mental_illness.	2013
Under current regimes in place in Australia, a mental_illness verdict has significant repercussions.	2013
In New South Wales (NSW), a mental_illness verdict may be made in relation to a person who is not fit for trial.	2013
This raises the further issue of the person's ability to understand properly the implications of relying on a mental_illness defence.	2013
We consider these cases and the avenues for appeal from a mental_illness verdict in NSW.	2013
Family history of mental_illness provides important information when evaluating pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD).	2013
Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with mental_illness but the causal direction of the association is uncertain.	2013
Co-morbidity patterns in epidemiological studies of mental_illness consistently demonstrate that a latent internalizing factor accounts for co-morbidity patterns among unipolar mood and anxiety disorders, whereas a latent externalizing factor underlies the covariation of substance-use disorders and antisocial behaviors.	2013
The presence of a mental_illness is, therefore, often deemed to be a contraindication to the use of antiviral treatment.	2013
Large epidemiological studies are needed to better understand the prevalence and profile of offending by people with mental_illness.	2013
The prevalence of mental_illness among offenders was 11.1: 6.5 of offenders had substance use disorders and 1.7 had schizophrenia.	2013
The mean percentage annual change in the number of arrests during 1985-1996 rose significantly for offenders with a psychiatric illness other than schizophrenia and dropped significantly for those with no mental_illness.	2013
Our findings open the way to an informed approach to the management of offenders with mental_illness.	2013
Offspring of parents with schizophrenia had significantly increased suicide risk after accounting for socio-economic status, parental suicidal behavior and offspring mental_illness [OR 1.68, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.53-1.85].	2013
Multi-disciplinary mental_health inreach services were introduced to target care towards prisoners with severe mental_illness (SMI) in a similar way to that provided by Community Mental Health Teams outside prison.	2013
Improved identification of mental_illness is needed in both the community and the Criminal Justice System to better engage with socially transient individuals who have chaotic lifestyles and complex needs.	2013
Meta-analysis of risk factors identified age, minority or migrant status, income, education, employment, marital status, alcohol use, cannabis use, stress, urbanicity and family history of mental_illness as important predictors of PE.	2013
Poor rearing could also substantially increase risk for major mental_illness.	2013
Psychiatric rehabilitation (PR) is widely recognized as a treatment approach and an array of evidence-based practices effective for promoting the recovery of people with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2013
Research on psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) interventions generally indicates that these approaches are effective in facilitating improved functioning for persons with serious mental_illness (SMI; schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and other psychotic disorders).	2013
This article describes the collaboration between a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community-based psychosocial rehabilitation center and a nonprofit legal center that primarily addresses the civil legal issues of veterans who have mental_illness and/or are homeless.	2013
Nor do they emphasize the unique challenges and strengths that impact veterans who experience acute symptoms of mental_illness.	2013
This article presents a critical historical review of psychological research on same-sex desire in the United States, with a focus on the way in which studies reflect three master narratives on the nature and meaning of same-sex attraction: a sickness script that dominated the majority of research from the late 1800s to the 1970s; a species script that became popular with the removal of homosexuality as a diagnosable mental_illness in 1973 and initiated several new lines of research; and a subject script inspired by scholarly and cultural shifts beginning in the 1990s that challenged the taxonomy of sexual identity.	2013
Our mixed-methods study advances understanding of pathways to offending for jailed women with and without mental_illness.	2013
Women in jails had high rates of mental_health disorders, with a majority meeting lifetime diagnostic criteria for a serious mental_illness (50), posttraumatic stress disorder (51), and/or substance use disorder (85).	2013
Serious mental_illness was associated with substance use, running away as a teen, and drug offending.	2013
Misconception endorsement decreased significantly from 32 to 21, with every subscale (police and interrogations, service provision, mental_illness, memory and cognition, tough on crime) experiencing a significant decrease from pre-test to post-test.	2013
The recovery of people with chronic mental_illness who reside in the community requires integrated support services.	2013
Thus, it may help explain variation in cooperation and compliance in encounters between police officers and people with serious mental_illness (SMI), which are often fraught with difficulty and risk.	2013
154 persons with serious mental_illness who reported a police contact within the past year were interviewed using the newly developed Police Contact Experience Survey (PCES), which includes questions about the characteristics of the contact, perceived procedural justice (PPJ) and degree of cooperation and resistance.	2013
Findings underline the importance of both procedurally just treatment in police interactions with vulnerable individuals and further efforts to reduce the stigma of mental_illness.	2013
This fundamental condition is found unbearable and, as a reaction, gives rise to mental_illness.	2013
Self-agency--the awareness of one's own capacity to make decisions and to engage in deliberate action - is often interfered with or lost during the course of severe mental_illness.	2013
Participants with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were compared with a random sample of all other adults without severe mental_illness.	2013
This study assessed the 10-year general CVD risk and vascular ages of 106 obese schizophrenia spectrum patients and 197 demographically matched obese controls without severe mental_illness (SMI) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).	2013
It is recommended that patients whose cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms are not well explained by the diseases of such systems be evaluated for mental_illness.	2013
The care of homeless persons with serious mental_illness remains a common and challenging problem in general hospital settings.	2013
Diagnostic rigor, integrated medical and psychiatric care, trauma-informed interventions, special considerations in capacity evaluations, and health care reform initiatives can improve the treatment of homeless persons with serious mental_illness.	2013
The tremendous burden of cardiovascular risk among persons with serious mental_illness underscores a critical need for prevention.	2013
We compared utilization of substance abuse and mental_health services among participants with no psychiatric comorbidity (n = 585), with comorbid depression (n = 605), and with comorbid severe and persistent mental_illness (severe and persistent mental_illness, n = 95).	2013
After adjusting for covariates, comorbid depression (odds ratio = 4.27, 95 confidence interval: 3.22-5.65) and severe and persistent mental_illness (odds ratio = 10.75, 95 confidence interval: 5.22-20.13) were independently associated with specialty service use (either substance abuse or mental_health services).	2013
Acceptance of mental_illness is essential to promoting recovery and is uniquely impacted by issues of culture, race, and ethnicity.	2013
Implications are suggested for culturally responsive counseling and research pertaining to the process of acceptance of mental_illness.	2013
Based on recovery and positive psychology frameworks in which meaning-making is a central concept, this study examined the role of leisure-generated meanings (LGMs) experienced by culturally diverse individuals with mental_illness in potentially helping them better cope with stress, adjust to and recover from mental_illness, as well as feel more actively engaged in life.	2013
One-on-one survey interviews were conducted with African (n = 35), Hispanic/Latino (n = 28), Caucasian (n = 28), and Asian (n = American adults (aged between 23 and 78) (total n = 101) with mental_illness (e.g., bipolar disorder, n = 32; major depression, n = 23; schizophrenia, n = 22) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.	2013
Using general linear modeling, we found that LGMs significantly predicted the adjustment to and recovery from mental_illness, leisure stress-coping, leisure satisfaction, and perceived active living positively, and lower leisure boredom.	2013
The findings have implications for psychiatric rehabilitation to better support persons with mental_illness from a strengths-based, meaning-centered, and active-living promotion perspective in which leisure seems to play an important role.	2013
Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) and individuals with mental_illness are consistently found to be among the most socially excluded populations and continue to face substantial health, housing, and employment disparities due to stigma.	2013
Although this has spurred extensive research efforts and theoretical advancements in the study of stigma toward mental_illness, the stigma of ID has received only limited attention.	2013
In this article we explore the application of mental_illness stigma research for ID.	2013
We carefully reviewed the existing research on mental_illness stigma as a foundation for a parallel summary of the empirical literature on attitudes and stigma related to ID.	2013
However, multilevel conceptual models of stigma have received much attention in the mental_illness literature.	2013
Nonetheless, there are indeed key differences between-as well as substantial variability within-the ID and mental_illness populations that must be considered.	2013
Future research can draw on the stigma models developed in the mental_illness literature to guide more rigorous research efforts and ultimately the development of effective, multilevel stigma-change strategies for ID.	2013
To investigate the relationships between public stigma, stigma by association (SBA), psychological distress, perceived closeness, perceived heredity, and the type of family relationship among family members of people with a mental_illness.	2013
In this cross-sectional survey, data from 527 family members of people with a mental_illness were analyzed.	2013
Also, the perceived heredity of mental_illness was associated with perceptions of public stigma and psychological distress.	2013
The findings suggest that family members of people with a mental_illness could benefit from education on mental_illnesses, their treatment, and the extent to which they are hereditary.	2013
Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the psychological needs that arise from being a caregiver of someone with a mental_illness.	2013
The study focused on the connections between the value preferences, attitudes toward community living, and burnout among staff members of community services for people with intellectual disability (n=126) and severe mental_illness (n=96) in Israel.	2013
In addition, DDP appears to be based on a number of questionable metaphors that have been used in attempted explanations of personality development and mental_illness.	2013
Critical time intervention (CTI) is a time-limited care coordination model intended to prevent homelessness and other adverse outcomes among adults with severe mental_illness during periods of transition.	2013
In spite of well-argued critiques, the DSM and the idea of mental_illness on which it is based flourish, with ever more (mis)behaviors labeled as brain diseases.	2013
This article translates two measures of recovery (mental_health recovery measure and the recovery subscale of peer outcomes protocol) and one measure of recovery-promoting environments (recovery self-assessment) into Chinese and investigates their psychometric properties among 206 Hong Kong Chinese people with severe mental_illness.	2013
A randomized factorial survey of social workers working with adults with severe mental_illness was employed.	2013
This article examine the associations between elevated exposure to psychotropic medications, presence of a diagnosis of mental_illness, and sociodemographic characteristics in the adult population.	2013
All things being equal, this increased with age, living alone, being unemployed over the course of the last year, and presence of a mental_illness.	2013
The results suggest that it is necessary to consider social isolation and prevalence of mental_illness in order to contextualize the elevated exposure to psychotropic medication.	2013
This paper explores the experience of families supporting a homeless relative with mental_illness.	2013
Exposure to stigmatization is a serious complication of mental_illness in general, and of schizophrenia in particular.	2013
This review also notes considerations for adapting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) procedures for severe mental_illness and proposes directions for future research.	2013
Seven groups involving 61 participants (38 females; 23 males) were interviewed, including non-professional workers at a Non-government Organisation service, senior centre users, a mixed group of community residents, people with severe mental_illness, professional social service providers, communication studies students, and social work students.	2013
This study aims to explore the associations between cultural access and mental_illness.	2013
Then the impact of the private spending in culture (the regressors) on the mental_illnessas approximated by the discharge rate for mental_illness(the dependent variable), has been verified via generalised method of moments (GMM) approach.	2013
The results of empirical analysis have highlighted how the discharge rate for mental_illness is substantially improved by some forms of cultural consumptions.	2013
The coefficients associated with unemployment rates (the control variables) have a positive impact on mental_illness, thus suggesting that unemployment has an impact on the discharge rate for mental_illness; the greatest impact is observed for the long-term unemployment rate.	2013
The results are beneficial for designing and implementing preventive strategies to reduce mental_illness and public health expenditure by considering the impact of cultural access.	2013
During recent years, the need to consider effective and innovative ways to prevent and end homelessness among individuals with serious mental_illness has been abetted by an increased and more sophisticated understanding of the composition of the homeless population, the emergence of evidencebased practices to address homelessness, and the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.	2013
This article summarizes the evolving understanding of the role that serious mental_illness plays in homelessness as well as the interventions that are effective at preventing and ending homelessness among persons with serious mental_illness.	2013
This summary contextualizes a discussion of the practice and policy agenda to address homelessness among people with serious mental_illness using a new prevention framework and considering the opportunities inherent in increased affordable health care coverage for very lowincome individuals with serious mental_illness.	2013
We aimed to analyse the impact of severe mental_illness in a Portuguese sample and to provide support to comparisons with some of the EPSILON results, focusing on the north-European Dutch centre.	2013
However, there was a stronger tendency to agree with the notion that psychiatric hospitals are necessary to protect society from persons with mental_illness.	2013
The present study examined whether common psychiatric labels (i.e., mental disease, mental_disorders, mental_health problems, and mental_illness) elicited divergent attitudes and perceptions in a group of participants.	2013
Our study assesses the relationships between self-reported adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (including sexual, physical, or verbal abuse, along with household dysfunction including parental separation or divorce, domestic violence, mental_illness, substance abuse, or incarcerated household member) and unemployment status in five US states in 2009.	2013
Patients with severe mental_illness are at high risk for metabolic and cardiac disorders.	2013
Serious mental_illness is known for the damage that it inflicts on the social network and social support of patients.	2013
Studies suggest that people who are food insecure are more likely to experience mental_illness.	2013
However, little is known about which aspects of food insecurity place individuals most at risk of mental_illness.	2013
The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of mental_illness among food insecure Canadians, and examine whether mental_illness differs between those who are consuming insufficient amounts of food versus poor quality foods.	2013
The prevalence of mental_illness is alarmingly high in this population-based sample of food insecure Canadians.	2013
These findings suggest that government and community-based programming aimed at strengthening food security should integrate supports for mental_illness in this population.	2013
The aim of the present investigation is to assess the prevalence of obesity in people diagnosed as having a mental_illness and to investigate differences between disorders.	2013
Current weight for all patients and weight gain for some patients were calculated to obtain a body mass index (BMI) value, and diagnostic information was aligned to one of the six major categories of mental_illness.	2013
Participants described two facets of their lived experience: the way they see themselves now, in light of their offending and social background and the pejorative nature of the personality disorder label, its relationship to mental_illness and their need to distance themselves from it.	2013
This may have repercussions on attitudes towards people with mental_illness.	2013
The results of our study underline the importance of macro-social factors for the discrimination of people with mental_illness.	2013
This study aims to estimate, apply, and validate a model of the risk of serious mental_illness (SMI) in local service areas throughout New Zealand.	2013
This study contrasts the medicalized conceptualization of mental_illness with psychologizing mental_illness and examines what the consequences are of adhering to one model versus the other for help seeking and stigma.	2013
Medicalizing mental_illness involves a package deal: biopsychosocial causal attributions and applying the disease view facilitate medical treatment recommendations, while labeling seems to trigger stigmatizing attitudes.	2013
The 381 who accepted were asked to read a case-vignette describing a person who met the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia and then fill in the Opinions on mental_illness Questionnaire.	2013
This study used an experimental design to examine longitudinal changes in subjective quality of life (QoL) among homeless adults with mental_illness after assignment to different types of supported housing or to treatment as usual (TAU, no housing or supports through the study).	2013
Despite multiple health and social challenges faced by homeless individuals with mental_illness, HF in both scattered-site and congregate models results in significantly greater perceived QoL as compared to individuals who do not receive HF even after a relatively short period of time.	2013
Logistic regression and multilevel modeling were used to estimate the effects of individual-level characteristics and three state-level factors-per capita spending on community mental_health services, aggregated perceptions of the effectiveness of mental_health treatment and the stigma of mental_illness-on the individual's current use of mental_health services.	2013
We conducted a national epidemiological study to determine how mental_illness and criminal offending combine to influence suicide risk in younger adults.	2013
Patients experiences during their admission and since discharge from the unit, mental_health status since admission, compliance in terms of outpatient mental_health care, current quality of relationships with family and friends, and the impact of the patients mental_illness on their work situation are examined.	2013
Suicides were related to mental_illness or cancer if codes F or C, respectively, were mentioned on the death certificate.	2013
The protective effect of religion was substantially stronger if a diagnosis of cancer was mentioned on the death certificate and weaker if a mental_illness was mentioned.	2013
We examined teenagers' attitudes about the role of mental_illness in suicidal behavior and the relationship between these attitudes and suicide risk.	2013
Less than one fifth of students thought that mental_illness was a major contributor to suicide.	2013
Suicidal adolescents and those at risk were less likely than their nonsuicidal and low-risk counterparts to associate suicide with mental_illness.	2013

Through the analysis of longitudinal data collected from 278 patients over a 6-month period following admission to an outpatient dual diagnosis treatment program, this study examined the association between dual diagnosis treatment attendance and subsequent aggression among individuals diagnosed with both a severe mental_illness and a substance use disorder.	2014
There are few clinical trials of 12-step treatments for individuals with serious mental_illness and alcohol or drug dependence.	2014
Importantly, 88.2 of youth with mental_illness reported never having committed any crime.	2014
Our findings highlight the importance of improving access to mental_health services for youthful offenders in community settings, given the substantial associations found between mental_illness and crime in this nationally representative epidemiological sample.	2014
Screening children for sleep problems could offer promising opportunities for reducing the burden of mental_illness during the early life course.	2014
In people with severe mental_illness (SMI) traumatic childhood experiences have been linked to more severe and treatment refractory forms of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms.	2014
Both concerns about mental_health stigma from others and personal beliefs about mental_illness and mental_health treatment were examined.	2014
Results revealed substantial variation in the nature of OEF/OIF veterans' mental_health beliefs, with greater anticipated stigma in the workplace (M = 23.74) than from loved ones (M = 19.30), and stronger endorsement of negative beliefs related to mental_health treatment-seeking (M = 21.78) than either mental_illness (M = 18.56) or mental_health treatment (M = 20.34).	2014
Specifically, the present study assessed the incremental validity of recent violent victimization in the prediction of future violence in a sample of justice-involved adults with serious mental_illness.	2014
The study examined (a) whether recent experiences of violent victimization (i.e., within 6 months of the baseline assessment) predicted a greater likelihood of perpetrating violence in the next year, and (b) whether inclusion of recent victimization enhanced the predictive validity of a model of violence risk in a sample of justice-involved adults with severe mental_illness (N = 167).	2014
Although offenders with mental_illness are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, psychiatric symptoms relate weakly to criminal behavior at the group level.	2014
In this study of 143 offenders with mental_illness, we use data from intensive interviews and record reviews to examine how often and how consistently symptoms lead directly to criminal behavior.	2014
Many probation agencies in the United States assign offenders with mental_illness to relatively small specialty caseloads supervised by officers with relevant training, rather than to large general caseloads.	2014
Many programs for offenders with mental_illness (OMIs) seem to assume that serious mental_illness directly causes criminal justice involvement.	2014
To help evaluate this assumption, we assessed a matched sample of 221 parolees with and without mental_illness and then followed them for over 1 year to track recidivism.	2014
Second, beyond risk factors unique to mental_illness (e.g., acute symptoms; operationalized with part of the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management-20; Webster, Douglas, Eaves, & Hart, 1997), OMIs also had significantly more general risk factors for recidivism (e.g., antisocial pattern; operationalized with the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory; Andrews, Bonta, & Wormith, 2004) than offenders without mental_illness.	2014
Third, these general risk factors significantly predicted recidivism, with no incremental utility added by risk factors unique to mental_illness.	2014
The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether major mental_illness (MMI) and violence history (VH) interact in their effect on institutional misconduct and recidivism.	2014
Whereas major mental_illness was not a risk factor for future antisocial behavior in current and former prison inmates, when paired with a history of violence it predicted increased risk of general and aggressive institutional misconduct.	2014
The purpose of this study was to extend the investigation of criminal thinking of persons with mental_illness beyond prison and community settings to a jail setting.	2014
Participants consisted of 122 individuals incarcerated in a county jail who were diagnosed with a severe mental_illness, including schizophrenia spectrum and major mood disorders.	2014
Results indicated that people with mental_illness in this sample of jail inmates presented with thinking styles that support a criminal lifestyle, and have criminal thinking styles that follow a pattern that is very similar to a sample of prison inmates with serious mental_illness.	2014
These findings support the need for therapeutic programs for justice-involved persons with serious mental_illness to develop a multipronged treatment approach that integrates interventions for individuals' criminal thinking and antisocial attitudes with treatment for their mental_illness and substance abuse issues.	2014
Despite recent declines, cigarette smoking remains prevalent among individuals with lower income, less education, and those with mental_illness or HIV.	2014
Low levels of physical activity and poor dietary habits are common in people with serious mental_illness and contribute to the poorer overall health and early mortality observed in this population.	2014
This paper examines the relationships between health behaviour knowledge and self-reported health behaviours in people with serious mental_illness.	2014
In this regard, people with serious mental_illness may not be dissimilar to the general population.	2014
The knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of health professionals are important in the successful application of exercise programs for the treatment of people with mental_illness.	2014
We propose the EMIQ-HP may be used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of health professional regarding the prescription of exercise of people with mental_illness.	2014
The present study investigates the gatekeeping role of youth and college pastors, specifically exploring their psychological training, perceptions, attitudes, and interactions concerning adolescent congregants' mental_illness.	2014
Tin Shui Wai is dubbed the City of Sadness by the media after the occurrence of a number of family tragedies involving child abuse, domestic violence, mental_illness, homicide and suicide.	2014
Although mental_health professionals ought to play a role in educating the courts about mental_illness and trauma, it is unwise for them to become advocates for the idea that traumatic memories are indelible, factual accounts of events.	2014
Providing care and support for individuals with severe mental_illness in sheltered and supported housing facilities is frequently characterized by difficult courses, particularly if it concerns residents with heavy user profiles.	2014
Thereby, their ability to manage patients with severe mental_illness could be improved and extensive hospitalization of individuals from this group could be reduced.	2014
Furthermore the new short version of the scale is initially validated through several indicators of mental_illness.	2014
Schizophrenia is a severe mental_illness that is characterized by multidimensional psychopathology including positive and negative symptoms, affective symptoms and cognitive impairment with several known risk factors and accompanying pathophysiological correlates.	2014
The characterization of 5-HT-BDNF interactions will eventually increase the understanding of mental_illness etiology and, possibly, lead to the identification of novel molecular targets for drug development.	2014
The American Occupational Therapy Association's Centennial Vision advocates for an emphasis on intervention and prevention services for children, young people, the aging, and those with severe and persistent mental_illness.	2014
The findings confirmed the reliability of MHC-SF, external validity, three-dimensional structure of subjective well-being, and supported two-continua model of mental_health, where mental_health and mental_illness are two related but distinguishable dimensions, not at the ends of the same continuum.	2014
Specific psychopathological disorders have also been associated with increased creativity, implying that certain traits that make one more vulnerable to mental_illness may also play a role in creative innovation.	2014
These subjective impairments are paradoxical in that individuals with schizotypy, typically recruited from undergraduate college populations, should be healthier in virtually every conceivable measure compared to chronic, older outpatients with severe mental_illness.	2014
The majority of individuals struggling with a mental_illness do not receive treatment, and given the extremely high prevalence of mental_illness and the many barriers to seeking treatment (e.g., cost, local access, stigma), it is evident that face-to-face therapy cannot get close to meeting the enormous need.	2014
Thus, the field of psychotherapy has undergone some amazing transformations over the past 25 years, including the emergence of a class of efficacious interventions designed to reduce symptoms of mental_illness that do not involve any face-to-face therapist contact.	2014
eHealth interventions that deliver psychological services or training programs via computer or other technologies may help reduce the burden of mental_illness by using approaches that have the potential for cost-effective and widespread dissemination.	2014
The debate has unfortunately overlooked the fact that the creativity-psychopathology correlation can be expressed as two independent propositions: (a) Among all creative individuals, the most creative are at higher risk for mental_illness than are the less creative and (b) among all people, creative individuals exhibit better mental_health than do noncreative individuals.	2014
Depression is a serious mental_illness.	2014
Problematic behaviour during adolescence may occur within the framework of a normal development, single or an accumulation of problematic behaviour may be a sign for an established or a developing mental_illness.	2014
Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental_illness that has a significant impact not only in the patient but also in the entire family as well.	2014
Australia and New Zealand are committed to upholding the rights of people who experience mental_illness and providing a recovery approach to service delivery.	2014
The proposition that the vast majority of persons experiencing mental_illness will never be violent is complicated by the large body of literature demonstrating a heightened risk of violent behaviour in persons suffering from mental_disorder.	2014
Ongoing resource development, education and availability of expertise should aid the development of more uniform approaches to violence risk management and therapeutic amelioration of the likelihood for violence in persons affected by mental_illness.	2014
The relationship between mental_illness and firesetting remains poorly understood, with limited guidance available for clinicians required to assess mentally ill firesetters.	2014
Addressing themes of evolving interfaces between the practices of law and mental_health care reveals that the balance, as enacted in law and interpreted by the courts, has generally favoured legal interpretations of mental_illness, despite psychiatry's steadily-increasing claim to superior insights and evidence on what constitutes mental_illness in juridical contexts.	2014
Complex variables are involved in fashioning an appropriate policy to ameliorate the impact of mental_illness on productivity including the identification of effective treatments and potential negative effects of controlling patients' access to them.	2014
This article considers these issues and argues for a role of psychotherapy in the treatment of mental_illness and substance abuse from the perspective of worker productivity.	2014
We performed a population-based Swedish longitudinal cohort study of male conscripts with no previous or ongoing mental_illness (n = 1,136,527).	2014
Epidemiological research is believed to underestimate the lifetime prevalence of mental_illness due to recall failure and a lack of rapport between researchers and participants.	2014
Overall, our results show that emerging adulthood is a high-risk period for the development of mental_illness, with increases in the lifetime prevalence and co-morbidity of mental_disorders during this time.	2014
More than a quarter of individuals had met criteria for MDD and over a fifth had experienced alcohol dependence by the age of 29 years, indicating that mental_illness is more common than is estimated in cross-sectional mental_health surveys.	2014
The increased risk of violent offending among people with common mental_disorders, other than substance use disorders, can be attributed to factors other than their mental_illness.	2014
Persons with severe mental_illness (SMI) have excess mortality, which may partly be explained by their high prevalence of diabetes.	2014
There are ongoing questions about whether unemployment has causal effects on suicide as this relationship may be confounded by past experiences of mental_illness.	2014
There is an ongoing debate whether biological illness explanations improve tolerance towards persons with mental_illness or not.	2014
One factor that impedes care seeking and undermines the service system is mental_illness stigma.	2014
It directly affects people with mental_illness, as well as their support system, provider network, and community resources.	2014
The effects of stigma are moderated by knowledge of mental_illness and cultural relevance.	2014
Despite decades of research, recognition and treatment of mental_illness and its comorbidities still remain a significant public health problem in the United States.	2014
Lack of knowledge about psychosis, a condition oftentimes associated with serious mental_illness, may contribute to disparities in mental_health service use.	2014
This research presents the findings of a comprehensive survey of sleep impairment in relation to demographic data, military history, combat exposure, and mental_illness symptoms among a general sample of 375 servicemembers and veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) at a wide range of times postdeployment.	2014
Treatment of the underserved populations, including those with serious mental_illness and/or substance use disorders, presents many barriers.	2014
The recovery movement has identified acceptance of mental_illness as critical to quality of life and illness management.	2014
However, there is a general lack of research on the acceptance of mental_illness.	2014
The present qualitative study was conducted with 30 participants with mental_illness to clarify the construct of acceptance.	2014
In addition, when asked to define acceptance of mental_illness, some participants noted negative connotations to acceptance.	2014
As such, it is important to intervene during the early stages of refugee resettlement to help prevent or mitigate mental_illness symptoms.	2014
Studying personal narratives can generate understanding of how people experience physical and mental_illness.	2014
Psychological characteristics, perception of mental_illness and mental_health care, and helpseeking context were the specific treatment dropout vulnerabilities identified in adolescents with BPD and in their parents.	2014
Participants were 52 men with schizophrenia, and 26 with HIV/AIDS who had no history of experiencing severe mental_illness.	2014
International studies have shown that the prevalence of mental_illness, and the fundamental contribution it make to the overall disease burden, is greatest in children and young people.	2014
Persons with severe mental_illness and addiction are at higher risk for early morbidity and mortality than the general population, and are less likely to receive primary care and preventive health services.	2014
In a sample of first-episode psychosis patients, we used a test of processing of mental_illness-related and other negative words as a measure of implicit awareness to see how this varied in relation to insight.	2014
The stigma of mental_illness has been identified as an important barrier to treatment and recovery.	2014
The study's aim was to examine whether co-morbid serious mental_illness diagnoses (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders) among patients with diabetes are independently associated with medical-surgical rehospitalization within a month of discharge after an initial hospitalization.	2014
Co-morbid serious mental_illness diagnoses were identified based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes indicating bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders.	2014
After adjusting for demographics, medical co-morbidity, and characteristics of the index hospitalization, co-morbid serious mental_illness diagnosis was independently associated with increased odds of rehospitalization within 1 month among patients with diabetes who had a medical-surgical hospitalization (odds ratio: 1.24, 95 confidence interval: 1.07, 1.44).	2014
Co-morbid serious mental_illness in patients with diabetes is independently associated with greater risk of early medical-surgical rehospitalization.	2014
However, patients with trauma histories had significantly higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities (76.0 vs. 50.8), past psychiatric treatment (81.1 vs. 59.1), parent mental_illness (69.8 vs. 38.6), and family conflict (52.8 vs. 37.0) and were more likely to require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization on discharge (18.9 vs. 6.3).	2014
Although a diagnosis of major mental_illness was the foremost reason for not planning a termination, participants also mentioned working indefinitely with some higher functioning patients whose lives are perpetually in crisis.	2014
Vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselors do not always focus on competitive employment for people with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2014
After controlling for other factors in a multiple logistic regression analysis, the older adults with intellectual disability (55 vs. 4554, OR=2.594, 95 CI=1.4384.679) and those individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of mental_illness or neurological disease (with vs. without, OR=2.826, 95 CI=1.5935.012) had a higher risk of dementia than their counterparts.	2014
This study examined which individual factors predict mental_health court diversion outcome among a sample of persons with mental_illness participating in a postcharge diversion program.	2014
The study employed secondary analysis of existing program records for 419 persons with mental_illness in a court diversion program.	2014
These findings discuss characteristics of persons with mental_illness, as they relate to the likelihood of completing diversion programming.	2014
The scale correlated negatively and moderately with measures of mental_illness, showing divergent validity.	2014
Exploratory factor analysis supported the hypothesis of two separate, but correlated, factors for mental_health and mental_illness, showing discriminant validity and support for the two-continua model.	2014
Future research along these lines will have the potential to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to severe mental_illness, and may have considerable clinical implications.	2014
Data from surveys administered repeatedly over 15 years (1997-2011) described changes over time in the prevalence of chronic mental_illness among US adults.	2014
We took social structural and demographic factors into account and let adjusted probability of chronic mental_illness indicate prevalence of chronic mental_illness We observed, as a general trend, that chronic mental_illness probability increased as the unemployment rate rose.	2014
This led to the group's high probability of chronic mental_illness, observed even when individual-level social structural and demographic factors were controlled.	2014
Fear of crime and perceived neighbourhood disorder have been linked to common mental_illness (CMI).	2014
Genetic essentialism suggests that beliefs in genetic causes of mental_illness will inflate a desire for social distance from affected individuals, regardless of specific disorder.	2014
Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental_illness, and actual helping decisions.	2014
Lack of motivation for treatment makes a subgroup of patients with severe mental_illness (SMI) difficult to engage in psychiatric treatment.	2014
People with mental_illness face the dilemma whether or not to disclose their condition.	2014
Comfort with disclosure, well-being, symptoms and aspects of experiencing and reacting to stigma were assessed among 202 individuals with mental_illness.	2014
Controlling for symptoms, greater comfort disclosing one's mental_illness was associated with lower anticipated discrimination and lower stigma stress; more comfort disclosing was related to greater well-being.	2014
People with severe mental_illness (SMI) generally have high rates of metabolic syndrome (MetS).	2014
Quality of life (QoL) is considerably impaired in mental_illness and especially in depression.	2014
In the present review, we first summarize epidemiological evidence for the significance of social environmental risk factors, outline the role of altered social stress processing in mental_illness, and review the latest experimental evidence for the neural correlates of social environmental risk for schizophrenia.	2014
Stigma is commonly encountered by individuals with mental_illness and leads to discrimination.	2014
The most frequent item for experienced discrimination was being unfairly treated in dating or intimate relationships (13.6), while concealment of mental_illness was the most common for anticipated discrimination (51.5).	2014
Items of household dysfunction were substance abuse of caregiver, parental separation, family history of mental_illness, incarceration of caregiver, and witnessing violence.	2014
Studies report that in the U.K., among men with severe mental_illness (SMI), those of black Caribbean ethnicity display increased risk of aggressive behaviour, criminal convictions, and schizophrenia.	2014
We compared inpatients in the US and in China (a culture that numerous studies have shown heavily stigmatizes mental_illness and psychosis), on measures of insight and acceptance of medication, controlling for overall severity of schizophrenia symptoms.	2014
Inpatients in China had far lower scores on measures of insight and acceptance of their need for and benefits of medication, controlling for overall severity of schizophrenia symptoms, suggesting a significant impact of Chinese culture which is presumed to more heavily stigmatize mental_illness and especially psychosis, although other explanations can not be ruled out.	2014
We performed a literature search of MedLine, Ovid and Psycinfo and identified studies that examined the association between mental_illness and physical illness.	2014
Liaison psychiatry provides psychological assessment and treatment for people with physical illness, but there is a gap in the provision of physical healthcare for people with severe mental_illness.	2014
Familiarity with mental_illness or psychological distress was not significantly associated with social distance.	2014
To assess the desire of people with severe mental_illness for information on their treatment and whether the desire for information is associated with socio-demographic variables, diagnosis, illness duration, therapeutic relationship, needs and symptom severity.	2014
588 outpatients with severe mental_illness were recruited in six European countries (Germany, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, United Kingdom) during the Clinical decision making and outcome in routine care of people with severe mental_illness (CEDAR) study (ISRCTN75841675).	2014
Most, but not all, people with severe mental_illness have a high desire for information.	2014
To evaluate the effectiveness of peer-delivered interventions in improving clinical and psychosocial outcomes among individuals with severe mental_illness (SMI) or depression.	2014
To examine the impact of co-morbid personality disorder (PD), on inpatient and community-based service use and risk of involuntary hospitalization, amongst patients with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2014
Severe mental_illness patients with co-morbid PD (SMI-PD) (n = 961) had more severe symptoms and social functioning problems compared to SMI patients without PD (n = 10,963) and patients who had PD but no concurrent SMI (n = 2,309).	2014
They were more often male, of young age, single/never married, non-Indigenous, unemployed, had at least one physical illness or other stressful life event prior to death, had drug and alcohol abuse problems, and also were more likely to have evidence for an untreated mental_illness.	2014
Regression analysis showed that being unemployed, having a history of legal problems and not being diagnosed with mental_illness were strongly associated with suicide among homeless persons.	2014
Two models (task shifting and best-buy interventions) illustrate how different ways of delivering treatment are essential to reach large and diverse swaths of unserved individuals and have impact on the burden of mental_illness.	2014
Psychosocial rehabilitation of persons with chronic mental_illness has received increasing research attention over the past three decades.	2014
It is now widely accepted that pharmacotherapy alone is insufficient to treat persons with chronic mental_illness.	2014
There were similarities across all three classification groups, including rates of mental_illness and psychiatric symptoms.	2014
The purpose of this study was to examine whether the presence of substance abuse, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and mental_illness in the home or family-of-origin is predictive of variance in current family violence perpetration.	2014
However, this conclusion needs to be examined in light of the limitations of our study and may not be generalizable to those with existing severe mental_illness.	2014
Applying this approach to the issue of child mental_health, we demonstrate why approaches that posit resonance or salience are likely to prove ineffective in helping the public to prioritize prevention and treatment for child mental_illness or promotion of child mental_health.	2014
Research on the impact of sudden or unexpected losses in people with severe mental_illness is scarce.	2014
The purpose of our study was to examine the relationship between subjective distress from sudden losses in people with severe mental_illness and posttraumatic stress symptoms while controlling for gender, psychiatric symptoms, and negative appraisals.	2014
As part of routine care, treatment personnel collected data from 371 community mental_health clients diagnosed with a severe mental_illness.	2014
Relative to other factors including symptoms of severe mental_illness, distress from sudden losses in people with severe mental_illness appears to be strongly associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms.	2014
The housing first (HF) model for individuals experiencing homelessness and mental_illness differs by design from traditional models that require consumers to achieve housing readiness by meeting program or treatment prerequisites in transitional housing settings prior to permanent housing placement.	2014
The present study applied the common sense model (i.e., cause, controllability, timeline, consequences, and illness coherence) to understand public attitudes toward mental_illness and help-seeking intention and to examine the mediating role of perceived controllability between causal attributions with public attitudes and help seeking.	2014
Based on a randomized household sample of 941 Chinese community adults in Hong Kong, results of the structural equation modeling demonstrated that people who endorsed cultural lay beliefs tended to perceive the course of mental_illness as less controllable, whereas those with psychosocial attributions see its course as more controllable.	2014
The more people perceived the course of mental_illness as less controllable, more chronic, and incomprehensible, the lower was their acceptance and the greater was mental_illness stigma.	2014
Furthermore, those who perceived mental_illness with dire consequences were more likely to feel greater stigma and social distance.	2014
The common sense model provides a multidimensional framework in understanding public's mental_illness perceptions and stigma.	2014
Not only should biopsychosocial determinants of mental_illness be advocated to the public, cultural myths toward mental_illness must be debunked.	2014
This qualitative study examines the relational dimension of social inclusion by exploring the ways in which persons in recovery from mental_illness understand and define their relationships with various communities.	2014
When mental_health-related outcomes are assessed, U.S.-focused and international studies of safety net programs sometimes find that adults and children show a decline in symptoms of mental_illness after participating.	2014
These advances hold enormous potential, and yet, given the tremendous diversity of mental_health problems and human suffering, broad dissemination and implementation efforts to generalists alone may not be sufficient to adequately address the burden of mental_illness.	2014
This article focuses on four special populations: children with special needs, persons with severe and persistent mental_illness, refugees, and deaf people who communicate via sign language.	2014
Art therapies are considered important interventions and a more humane approach to mental_illness.	2014
Musical identity is a highly relevant, yet little researched area within mental_illness.	2014
In this study, the researchers explore how 11 young people's musical identities changed during their experiences of, and recovery from mental_illness.	2014
The role of music therapy in supporting young people's recovery from mental_illness is presented, and the need to consider community-based music services is discussed.	2014
This study examined the effect of drama-based group therapy on the self-esteem and self-stigma of five participants with mental_illness and on the public stigma of seven university students without mental_illness who participated in the same group.	2014
Pathologized and treated for decades as a mental_illness, childhood gender non-conformity would seem to be imbued with new meaning, as evidenced by a growing number of public voices claiming gender variance as part of human diversity.	2014
Individuals who experience serious mental_illness (SMI) frequently encounter stigma and disenfranchisement.	2014
This investigation introduced the Internalized Stigma Model to test the mechanisms by which the stigma of mental_illness and of seeking psychological help affect self-esteem and intentions to seek counseling.	2014
Self-stigma mediated the relationship between public stigma and both outcomes; both self-stigma of mental_illness and self-stigma of seeking psychological help predicted decreased self-esteem, but only self-stigma of seeking psychological help predicted decreased intentions to seek counseling.	2014
This paper examines Arieti's book The Parnas (1979); this is a partly-fictionalised account of a pre-eminent figure (Parnas in Hebrew means head) in the Jewish community in Pisa, Giuseppe Pardo Roques, in the 1930s and early 1940s, who experienced mental_illness and was killed in the Nazi extermination of Jews.	2014
The paper examines Arieti?s reflections on what he sees as the 'insights' provided by mental_illness, which are considered through the figure of Giuseppe Pardo Roques, and in the context of the trauma of the Shoah in Italy.	2014
While it was wellknown that Chiurlionis died in a sanatorium for mental ill, almost nothing was written about his mental_illness.	2014
The purpose of this paper is to gauge service user perspectives on the effectiveness of two community outreach forensic psychological services in London for people with personality disorder and serious mental_illness who pose a risk of sexual and violent offending.	2014
Practical implications The current findings can be used as a guide to help services engage and manage people with personality disorder and serious mental_illness who are at risk of further serious offending.	2014
Design/methodology/approach The converging literatures on good lives and other developments in sexual offender treatment are compared with recovery from mental_disorder and what is known about the particular needs and characteristics of sexual offenders with mental_illness and severe personality disorder (PD).	2014
An ample volume of research evidence supports the conclusion that severe mental_illness is correlated with violent behavior.	2014
Few had diagnoses of mental_illness.	2014
The point-of-reception into prison is a critical juncture as it provides early opportunities to identify mental_illness and initiate treatment.	2014
This study explores the potential that current efforts to limit access to firearms for individuals with serious mental_illness (SMI) have for reducing overall rates of murder by firearm in the United States.	2014
Stigma a process that objectifies and dehumanizes a person who has mental_illness diminishes peoples ability to control their behavior as coping with stigma requires self-regulation.	2014
Still, research on contact and prejudice against people with mental_health disorders has generally focused on the broader label, mental_illness, as though various disorders were interchangeable.	2014
Five participants were interviewed at great length about their experiences of identity, their personal histories, and their understanding of their mental_illness.	2014
Logistic regression analyses indicate that childhood parental death is a risk marker for childhood emotional abuse (OR: 3.77; 95 CI: 1.327-10.755; p <.013), childhood parental substance abuse is a risk marker for childhood sexual (OR: 3.72; 95 CI: 1.480-9.303; p < .005) and physical abuse (OR: 2.610; 95 CI: 1.000-6.812; p < .05) and that childhood family mental_illness is a risk marker for childhood emotional (OR: 2.95; 95 CI: 1.175-7.441; p < .021) and sexual abuse (OR: 2.55; 95 CI: 1.168-5.580; p < .019).	2014
Screening for childhood family mental_illness, parental substance abuse, and parental death - all identified risk factors for reporting childhood abuse - can help to identify women that should be assessed specifically regarding abuse.	2014
In the current investigation, we examine this question in samples of police detectives (with and without a history of violent victimization) and mental_health workers (with and without a history of mental_illness).	2014
Our results indicate that police detectives who have experienced violent victimization and mental_health professionals who have experienced the same mental_illness as their clients do indeed exhibit greater work engagement than their colleagues who lack these parallel life experiences.	2014
Research limitations/implications There are some uncertainties about the comparability of the two censuses and the question of how complete enumeration was of people with learning disabilities in general mental_illness beds.	2014
However, the available research links MDV to negative mental and physical health outcomes, intimate partner homicide, homelessness among women, and severe mental_illness and suicidality.	2014
People with mental_illness (PMI) have increased dramatically, and these individuals are at greater risk for repeated contact with the criminal justice system.	2014
Examining patterns in the participants experiences and perceptions revealed their reliance on two stigmatizing cultural conceptionsdepression as a mental_illness and depression as a matter of pulling oneself togetherto account for why they were perceived as abnormal, and for the absence of empathy for their distress.	2014
The main objective was to evaluate two models of care for children and adolescents requiring hospitalization due to severe mental_illness.	2014
Improving outcomes for people with HIV and mental_illness will be critical to meeting the goals of the US National HIV/AIDS Strategy.	2015
In a retrospective analysis of the 2008-2010 cycles of the locally representative Philadelphia Medical Monitoring Project, we compared the proportions of HIV-infected adults with and without mental_illness: retained in care (2 primary HIV visits separated by 90 days in a 12-month period); prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) at any point in a 12-month period; and virally suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 200 copies/mL at the last measure in the 12-month period).	2015
Multivariable regression assessed associations between mental_illness and the outcomes, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance, alcohol abuse, injection drug use, CD4 count, and calendar year.	2015
Of 730 HIV-infected persons, representative of 9409 persons in care for HIV in Philadelphia, 49.0 had mental_illness.	2015
In adjusted analyses, there were no significant differences in retention (91.3 vs. 90.3 ; AOR 1.30, 95 CI 0.63-2.56) and prescription of ART (83.2 vs. 88.7 ; AOR 0.79, 95 CI 0.49-1.25) between those with and without mental_illness.	2015
However, mentally ill patients were less likely to achieve viral suppression than those without mental_illness (65.9 vs. 74.4 ; AOR 0.64, 95 CI 0.46-0.90).	2015
Patients discussed 18 barriers/facilitators to retention in care and ART adherence: 11 common to both behaviors (stigma, mental_illness, substance abuse, social support, reminder strategies, housing, insurance, symptoms, competing life activities, colocation of services, provider factors), 3 distinct to retention (transportation, clinic experiences, appointment scheduling), and 4 distinct to adherence (medication characteristics, pharmacy services, health literacy, health beliefs).	2015
Persons with one or more Charlson co-morbidities (HR 0.72, 95 CI 0.64-0.81), ages 40-59 (0.79, 0.71-0.88), mental_illness diagnosis (0.79, 0.72-0.87), hepatitis C co-infection (0.83, 0.75-0.93), and female sex (0.86, 0.78-0.94) were less likely to experience a gap in care.	2015
Expressed emotion (EE) is the quality of the atmosphere between a relative and a family member with mental_illness.	2015
Substantial research has focused on the relationship between the level of EE and the outcomes of mental_illness.	2015
Individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of mental_illness smoke at rates greater than the general population, and have more difficulty quitting.	2015
The analysis accounts for differences in background characteristics (i.e., age, gender, marital status, foreign born status, veteran status), socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., education, employment prior to incarceration), mental_health (i.e., diagnosis with a serious mental_illness), and incarceration experiences (i.e., current conviction, previous incarceration episodes, time served, additional sentencing requirements, external social support, disciplinary violations).	2015
Social factors play an important role in quitting smoking in the general population, but relatively little is known about social influences on smoking cessation efforts among individuals with serious mental_illness who suffer disproportionately high rates of smoking.	2015
This study examined social factors as predictors of using smoking cessation treatment among adults with serious mental_illness.	2015
For people with serious mental_illness, social factors appear to influence use of smoking cessation treatment above and beyond personal factors and may be specific to the type of treatment.	2015
It is estimated that between 16 and 38 of all elder abusers have a history of mental_illness, with most such persons likely having serious mental_illness (SMI).	2015
The literature is categorized according to its broad theoretical orientation and three approaches are identified: Treatments targeting mental_illness and other psychological issues; Interventions based on the principles of the RiskNeedResponsivity (RNR) model that aim to reduce recidivism; and Strength-based models.	2015

A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental_illness or substance problems.	2015
The relationships among youth ( 24 years) versus adult (>24 years) homelessness onset, lifetime serious mental_illness, and substance use problems is not well understood.	2015
Covariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses evaluated the associations among homelessness onset, serious mental_illness, and self-reported substance use problems.	2015
Youth-onset homelessness was associated with greater likelihood of serious mental_illness and sedative problems, and a lower likelihood of cocaine problems, in adjusted analyses (p values .04).	2015
Serious mental_illness and sedative problems may characterize homeless youth who are vulnerable to adulthood homelessness, although longitudinal cohort studies are needed to explicate temporal relations between variables.	2015
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess associations among 4 sleep inadequacy items (days of inadequate rest or sleep, hours of sleep, days unintentionally falling asleep during daytime, and snoring) and self-rated health in analyses adjusted for age, sex, race, education, lifetime homelessness, lifetime serious mental_illness, and current depression.	2015
This study examined the adequacy of the conceptual framework of stigma from the mental_illness field regarding ID.	2015
In terms of age groups, we found mental_illness hospitalizations decreased during adulthood as compared to adolescence for those with FXS, and we found that for conditions unrelated to FXS (e.g., respiratory, genitourinary, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia) adolescents had higher rates of hospitalization compared to their peers with FXS, ID, or ASD.	2015
Collaborations with a diverse set of colleagues and models from other disciplines than psychology helped me conceptualize the goals of research on a given topic (e.g., developing evidence-based treatments, reducing the burden of mental_illness, promoting a sustainable environment to mitigate climate change) and propose a shift from current practices as a means to obtain them.	2015
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a difficult to treat mental_illness associated with low motivation for change.	2015

In conclusion, the nonattendance of patients with serious mental_illness can result in non-compliance of therapeutic drug regimens, and a recurrence of the appearance symptoms.	2015
Western experiences have shown high acceptance for the concept among psychiatric patients, and illustrated that most stable patients with severe mental_illness retain the capacity to frame PADs consistent with community practice standards.	2015
Surveys conducted before and after program initiation also suggested improved knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of mental_illness by the community.	2015
The growing burden of chronic often untreated mental_illness has increased the importance of risk assessment in people suffering from major mental_disorders.	2015
For the purpose 200 elderly persons with mental_illness (PMI), attending psychiatric services were included in the study.	2015
The authors opine that persons with chronic mental_illness continue to experience psychiatric disability in old age and this cannot be attributed to normal aging.	2015
There are several challenges in diagnosing and treating mental_illness amongst South Asians.	2015
With the growing population of immigrants coming to the United States, many of which require treatment for mental_illness, it is essential that clinicians be cognizant in incorporating cultural perspectives when treating such patients.	2015
The current investigation includes two studies: 195 students instructed to simulate feigned mental_illness or incompetence to stand trial and one using a sample of 130 state psychiatric hospital residents who had been adjudicated incompetent to stand trial.	2015
It has been known for many decades that the risk of burnout, psychological distress, mental_illness, or suicidal ideation is higher in mental_health professionals (MHP) compared with many other professions and the general population; however, MHPs often disregard their own mental_health for the sake of helping others, sometimes with fatal consequences.	2015
The aim of this commentary is to emphasise the heightened risk of mental_illness among MHP, and includes some risk factors associated with burnout, psychological distress, or mental_illness in MHP.	2015
It concludes with recommendation for suitable support from professional bodies to help maintain good mental_health and to help prevent mental_illness among MHPs.	2015
The objective of this paper is to identify participation instruments, examine theories/definition supporting their use and highlight scales for use in low and middle-income countries for persons with mental_illness.	2015
A systematic literature review was conducted to identify instruments intended to measure participation for individuals with severe mental_illness.	2015
Finally, participation scales used in low and middle income countries should consider how contextual factors like medicine, poverty and disability, particularly with regards to mental_illness, impact content of the scale.	2015
After Heller declared that an individual's right to bear arms is constitutionally protected, the APA refocused its attention on the specific aspects of firearm policy that implicate the interests and rights of persons with mental_illness.	2015
Psychiatrists are mindful of the need to curtail firearm access by persons with mental_disorders that elevate the risk of suicide or violence to others, but they are also opposed to stigmatization, discrimination, and unfair treatment of individuals based on mental_illness.	2015
California provides numerous pathways by which people with mental_illness can qualify for a state-level firearm prohibition.	2015
The state's involuntary detention for psychiatric treatment, or 5150 (CA W&I Code 5150) process, is often cited as one potential mechanism for reducing violence by dangerous people, though its use is limited to people whose dangerousness is due to a mental_illness.	2015
Additionally, California has taken legislative steps to prohibit firearm ownership among other people who have an increased risk of violence, regardless of whether or not mental_illness is a factor.	2015
This article compares the California firearm ownership disqualification system for mental_illness with the federal system and those of other states, examines the strengths and weaknesses of this system, and reviews alternatives.	2015
How do we think productively about guns and mental_illness in this context, and about the role of law in lessening the toll of gun violence?	2015
The Educational Fund to Stop Violence's process of unfreezing individual perceptions and conventional interpretations of the relationship between mental_illness and gun violence, forming a consensus, and translating this knowledge to stakeholders through state discussion forums is one way to inform policy change.	2015
However, given the fact that nearly every repeat offender suffers from severe comorbid problems (e.g., a mental_illness and substance abuse disorder), judges tend to consider these objectives from a long-term perspective by insisting on as much treatment during detention as possible.	2015
Since 1993, the APA has developed various positions and resource materials related to firearms and mental_illness, incorporating evolving themes as new issues emerge.	2015
Based on prior legal theorizing in related criminal areas--focused on discrimination of individuals with mental_illness--we predicted that cases involving respondents with psychiatric diagnoses would be likely to be overrepresented in those referred for evaluation as well as those subsequently adjudicated incompetent.	2015
Results are discussed in terms of implications for individuals with mental_illness in incompetency hearings, as well as specific issues for psychologists evaluating a broad range of respondents.	2015
Families of people affected by mental_illness may suffer an adverse effect on well-being.	2015
Mental health is more than the absence of mental_illness.	2015

According to clinicians, the most frequent adversities experienced by young people were having a parent with a mental_illness (66), being bullied (63) and parental divorce or separation (43).	2015
However, the perception of psychological disturbances differs from culture to culture depending on issues such as the stigma that attaches to mental_illness and the ability or willingness to seek assistance.	2015
Prevention and early intervention programmes have been found to impede the transmission of mental_illness from parents to children.	2015
This study focuses on the impact of a peer support programme developed for children and adolescents who have a parent with a mental_illness and examines the processes of change which might promote positive outcomes for youth.	2015
Children indicated that the programme provided a place of respite from caring for their parent with a mental_illness, an opportunity to connect with peers, and a positive change in perception of their parent's mental_illness.	2015
Results of the multinomial logistic regression (MLR) analyses found that children for whom parent/caregiver substance abuse and/or mental_illness was an issue were less likely to be reunified with their parents than remain in care.	2015
The current study is an examination of the process of The New Mentality, a multi-site pilot program intended to mobilize Y-APs to raise community awareness of child and youth mental_health, reduce the stigma surrounding mental_illness, and advocate for a mental_health service system that is more responsive to the needs of children and youth.	2015
A small group of individuals with mental_illness is repeatedly involved in violence.	2015

Many families worldwide have at least one member with a behavioral or mental_disorder, and yet the majority of the public fails to correctly recognize symptoms of mental_illness.	2015
Recognition of symptoms of mental_illness was a central variable: greater recognition predicted greater endorsement of social causes of mental_illness and endorsement of professional help-seeking as well as lesser endorsement of lay help-seeking.	2015
Further, collectivism was positively associated with causal beliefs of mental_illness in the European American sample, and with lay help-seeking beliefs in the Indian sample.	2015
These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding cultural differences in beliefs about mental_illness, particularly in relation to help-seeking beliefs.	2015
It reveals that this deeply complex field contributes to the reflection on the very concept of mental_illness; to the focus on subjective distress and person-centered experience of psychopathology; and to the recognition of stigma and discrimination as significant intervening variables.	2015
Due to recent progress in basic and clinical sciences, novel approaches such as sleep-based interventions are increasingly becoming offered to address the physical and mental_health issues of people with severe mental_illness.	2015

Mothers had been selected for the programme if they had a history of mental_illness, were in a violent relationship, or reported drug or alcohol problems.	2015
People with mental_illness are not the sole recipients of stigmatisation; their immediate family members may be subjected to stigma by association.	2015
Through semistructured interviews, we investigated experiences of stigma by association among 23 immediate family members of people with mental_illness.	2015
Familial relationship, coresidence, and the gender of participants appeared to play a role in their stigma experiences; parents and spouses reported different manifestations of stigma by association than siblings and children, participants who lived together with their family member with mental_illness reported increased experiences of stigma by association, and in contrast to male participants, female participants reported others thinking they are overprotective and as such perpetuated, maintained, or sustained their family members' mental_illness.	2015
The relevance of these factors points to the need for tailored education and emotional support provision to family members of people with mental_illness.	2015
Disasters can erode mental_health (MH), even if it does not reach mental_illness.	2015

The findings support the need for clinicians to have appropriate training in family work related to mental_health issues and also to develop the skill set needed to actively introduce, negotiate and explore the topic of mental_illness with families.	2015
Minimal research has examined partner violence committed by individuals with severe mental_illness.	2015
The objectives of the symposium were the following: to understand the link between anti-LGBTQ bullying and mental_illness and to identify ways to help such patients.	2015

It plays a vital role in protecting the human rights of people in Scotland with learning disabilities and mental_illness, by visiting those who are in receipt of care or treatment, investigating situations of concern, providing advice and guidance, monitoring the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 and Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and shaping relevant policy and legislation.	2015
It illustrates its importance in preserving the rights of individuals with learning disabilities and mental_illness in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other legislation.	2015
This essay aims to understand mental_illness and recovery through the inside perspective offered by the Swedish playwright Gunilla Linn Persson in her autobiographic narrative poem, by taking a narrative approach to the text.	2015
Participants were presented a 50-item questionnaire measuring five psycho-legal topics; police procedures, courts, tough on crime, mental_illness, and memory and cognition.	2015
The development of postpartum mental_illness may be prevented if spouses can recognise their partners distress and respond supportively.	2015
More precisely, lay theories were examined under the two dominant models which predict that attribution of mental_illness to biomedical causes should reduce perceived responsibility and either decrease (attribution theory) or increase (medical model) perceived exclusion of depressed people.	2015
Depression is a debilitating mental_illness with clear developmental patterns from childhood through late adolescence.	2015
Homeless youth are regarded as an extremely high risk group, susceptible to suicidal ideation substance abuse, and high rates of mental_illness.	2015
While developmental studies predominantly investigated adolescents' mental_illness and psychosocial maladjustment, the present research focused on positive mental_health of Indian adolescents within the Mental Health Continuum model.	2015
However, the rates of absence for females with and without mental_illness did not significantly differ from those of men.	2015
Furthermore, our findings suggest that intervention to improve presenteeism would be effective in preventing depression and absence due to mental_illness.	2015
Women who identified these barriers were more likely not to have been treated previously for mental_illness, were primiparous, and could not be completely honest with their provider.	2015
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable mental_illness which is associated with neuroanatomical abnormalities.	2015
Cognitive deficits have been well-established among patients with severe mental_illness.	2015
Depression disorder is a mental_illness of high recurrence rate and its pathological mechanism is still unclear.	2015
The psychosocial factors associated with CAM use in depressive illnesses and severe mental_illness are yet to be established.	2015
Subsequent research amongst those with depressive disorders would be informative in clarifying the range of motivations associated with mental_illness.	2015
Therefore, it should be incorporated in every treatment plan and be addressed as a clinical symptom of the mental_illness.	2015
Homeless individuals are an extremely vulnerable and underserved population characterized by overlapping problems of mental_illness and substance use.	2015
Media coverage of the Germanwings plane crash intensely focused on the co-pilot's mental_illness and was criticized for potentially increasing depression stigma.	2015
In both surveys, four components of stigma were assessed: characteristics ascribed to persons with a depression, belief in a continuum of symptoms from mental_health to mental_illness, emotional reactions to people afflicted by depression (fear, anger, and pro-social reactions), and desire for social distance.	2015
Mood disorders are common mental_illness in China, but little was known about mental disability caused by mood disorders.	2015
Cross sectional study of 229 participants with ID (without mental_illness) recruited from 12 centres in England.	2015

Some argue that the earliest case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) was reported by Robert Burton in his compendium The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) and that only in the 19th century did modern concepts of OCD evolve, differentiating it from other types of mental_illness.	2015
Discovery of this manuscript reveals that Abu Zayd al-Balkhi should be credited with differentiating OCD from other forms of mental_illnesses nearly a millennium earlier than is currently claimed by anthologies documenting the history of mental_illness.	2015
Studies have shown that the prevalence of mental_illness can vary between urban and rural locations.	2015
General shame and shame about having a mental_illness are the broadest types of shame relevant to OCRDs; symptom-based shame and body shame may be more specific to OCRDs.	2015
There is an increasing recognition of the relationship between mental_illness and obesity in the pediatric population.	2015
Our results may be biased by a reluctance of patients with a mental_illness to participate.	2015
Strategies to reduce stigma during screening are warranted to enhance early detection of prenatal mental_illness.	2015
Women with intellectual disability are thought to be at increased risk of mental_illness, yet little is known about resiliency factors supporting women's mental_health.	2015
Utilizing a broad qualitative approach, 25 New Zealand women, aged 21-65 years were interviewed about their life from childhood to the present, including, where relevant, their experience of mental_illness.	2015
Challenges for resiliency could be seen in the theme 'mental_illness' where subthemes of abuse, long-term stress and medication were identified.	2015
Those women who experienced major mental_illness shared evidence of both higher risk factors and less support available at crucial times.	2015
The sample (N = 219) included health professionals in a large university hospital, who responded to a web-based survey on the routines of the mental_health services, attitudes within the workforce capacity, worker's knowledge on the impact of parental mental_illness on children, knowledge on legislation concerning children of patients, experience, expectations for possible outcomes of change in current clinical practice and demographic variables.	2015
Furthermore, workers who reported to have more knowledge about children and the impact of mental_illness on the parenting role were less concerned about a child-focussed approach interfering with the patient-therapist relation.	2015
The review also addresses how cross-cohort comparisons can provide valuable complementary information on the aetiology of mental_illness.	2015
With growing interest in resilience among mental_health care providers globally, there is a need for a simple way to consider the complex interactions that predict adaptive coping when there is exposure to high levels of adversity such as family violence, mental_illness of a child or caregiver, natural disasters, social marginalization, or political conflict.	2015
Thirty-four young adults with no self-reported history of neurologic disorder or mental_illness completed three blocks of the affective Posner task outside of the scanner.	2015
Parents completed measures of problem recognition, perception of need, willingness to seek help, and beliefs about causes of mental_illness.	2015
Predictors of parental problem recognition included perceived need, prior experience with mental_illness, and belief in trauma as a cause of mental_illness.	2015
Thus, if RDoC is to result in research that yields clinical tools that reduce the burden of mental_illness and improve public health, we ought to develop strategies for effectively implementing biological measures in the context of clinical assessments.	2015
In the present article we focus, in three main sections, on how theory and research from developmental psychopathology can inform RDoC. First, we discuss the ontology of mental_illness and the potential advantages of the RDoC approach to understanding the nature of mental_illness.	2015
Second, we note potential issues to consider when implementing the RDoC framework, including (a) integrating developmental processes, (b) classifying mental_illness within a dimensional approach, and (c) avoiding problems associated with biological reductionism.	2015
Many adults with significant forms of mental_illness, including psychosis and personality disorders, experience deficits in metacognition that are reflected in a limited ability to describe and think about their own mental states and those of others.	2015
Current vocational services for adults with serious mental_illness remain largely atheoretical and disconnected from mainstream vocational psychology research and practice.	2015
This study explored the perspectives on work of adults with serious mental_illness, compared perspectives of young and older adults, and assessed these perspectives for the applicability of a well-established theory of vocational psychology.	2015
A national sample of 76 individuals with mental_illness engaged in the workforce completed a semistructured questionnaire.	2015
The SCCT model will likely provide a useful framework to bridge the gap between career development theory and vocational services for individuals with mental_illness.	2015
We developed an online preference-setting tool for return of IRRs based on the preventability and severity of a condition, which included an opt-out option for IRRs for mental_illness, developmental_disorders, childhood-onset degenerative conditions, and adult-onset conditions.	2015
Although literature exists regarding parent-child communication about serious mental_illness and physical health problems, research has yet to examine this communication regarding parental PTSD.	2015
Pathological gambling is a prevalent and disabling mental_illness, which is frequently associated with mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders.	2015
Interpersonal violence and mental_illness are significant public health issues.	2015
Integrated behavioral and medical health treatment approaches may increase treatment compliance and reduce the risk of future partner violence among offenders with co-occurring issues, such as mental_illness, addiction, and physical health conditions.	2015
Symptoms associated with mental_illness have been hypothesized to relate to creative achievement because they act as diversifying experiences.	2015
Do tendencies toward mental_illness still predict eminent creativity when they coexist with other diversifying experiences, such as early parental death, minority-status, or poverty?	2015
Replicating majority-culture patterns, African American artists showed higher mental_illness rates than African American scientists.	2015
Furthermore, mental_illness predicted higher eminence levels only for the African American artists, an effect that diminished when controlling for developmental adversity.	2015
Research demonstrates that social support facilitates recovery from a mental_illness.	2015
Stigma negatively impacts the social support available to persons with mental_illness (PWMIs).	2015
We investigated how religious beliefs about mental_illness influenced the types of social support individuals would be willing to give PWMIs.	2015
Christian participants indicated their denominational affiliation and their religious beliefs about mental_illness.	2015
Christians' beliefs that mental_illness results from immorality/sinfulness and that mental_illnesses have spiritual causes/treatments both predicted preference for giving spiritual social support.	2015
Despite the high prevalence of substance use disorder (SUD) and its frequent comorbidity with mental_illness, individuals with SUD are less likely to receive effective SUD treatment from mental_health practitioners than SUD counselors.	2015
Women with severe mental_illness (SMI) are having babies at an increasing rate, but continue to face many challenges across the perinatal period.	2015
The aim of this study was to establish consensus among clinicians in order to produce recommendations to optimise the diagnosis of physical illness in patients with mental_illness who present in Emergency Departments (EDs).	2015
We have observed that many patients with IBS drink very little alcohol and postulated that this may reflect membership in families affected by alcoholism and mental_illness.	2015
In the absence of a personal history of alcohol use, reporting both a family history of alcohol/substance abuse and anxiety/depression/mental_illness was clearly predictive of IBS status (OR=2.5, 95 CI=1.4-4.5; p<0.005).	2015
Co-occurring alcohol abuse/dependence quadrupled the risk of relapse, other non-opioid abuse/dependence doubled the relapse risk and severe mental_illness added 80 greater risk compared to those without each of those disorders.	2015
Co-occurring other substance use and mental_illness exert strong influences on cost and risk of relapse, suggesting that individuals with these conditions need more comprehensive treatment.	2015
We searched 3 electronic databases and included empirical studies investigating the prevalence of mental_illness in homeless children in the United States (1990-2014).	2015
A range of barriers to seeking care were identified, the most striking being stigma and a lack of knowledge regarding the nature and treatment of mental_illness.	2015

Mental health courts divert offenders with mental_illness away from incarceration in return for participation in monitored mental_health treatment.	2015
It benefits from a federal pretrial services agency that screens all arrestees for mental_illness and dedicates a specialized supervision unit (SSU) to provide supervision and services while on pretrial release to all screened positive, including MHC participants.	2015
This study adds to the accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of MHCs in reducing recidivism among offenders with severe mental_illness.	2015
The current study examined the impact of a mental_health court (MHC) on mental_health recovery, criminogenic needs, and recidivism in a sample of 196 community-based offenders with mental_illness.	2015
We test whether significant differences in mental_illness exist in a matched sample of lone- and group-based terrorists.	2015
We then test whether there are distinct behavioral differences between lone-actor terrorists with and without mental_illness.	2015
The odds of a lone-actor terrorist having a mental_illness is 13.49 times higher than the odds of a group actor having a mental_illness.	2015
Lone actors who were mentally ill were 18.07 times more likely to have a spouse or partner who was involved in a wider movement than those without a history of mental_illness.	2015
Those with a mental_illness were more likely to have a proximate upcoming life change, more likely to have been a recent victim of prejudice, and experienced proximate and chronic stress.	2015
The aim was to compare the use of absolute and relative valid-day criteria in a sample of adults with mental_illness.	2015
Data were from 99 non-institutionalised adults with mental_illness.	2015
For participant samples with varied waking hours, such as adults with mental_illness, a valid-day criterion should be based on the proportion of waking hours, rather than the absolute time.	2015
Cultural traits have an influence on the person's interpretation of mental_illness, the expression of distress and help-seeking attitudes.	2015
Given that there is a scarcity of mental_health studies and no study on the explanatory models (EM) of mental_illness, it is important to examine the connections between Western biomedical approaches and traditional Emirati illness explanations and how those affect the Emirati EM.	2015
The results highlighted the influence of cultural traits on the EM formulation, the importance of family in the Emirati society and the impact of the UAE socio-economic and religious reality in forming the participants beliefs on mental_illness.	2015
This study describes the outcomes for individuals in Living Grace Groups (LGGs), a peer-led group intervention for mental_illness that is based in churches and integrates R/S. Persons at all active LGGs were surveyed before and after participation using well-validated scales for recovery, psychiatric symptoms, and spirituality.	2015
Socioculturally influenced interpretations of mental_illness play decisive roles on the time and choice of treatment.	2015
Their rates of mental_illness are almost twice that of religious adolescents raised in religious households.	2015
Finding a comfortable and functional life is a challenge for many individuals living with chronic mental_illness.	2015
Even when active symptoms are resolved and the individual is deemed stable, the residual traumas of mental_illness, including loneliness, loss, grief, and stigma, persist, severely reducing quality of life and acting as destabilizers.	2015
Research literature from positive psychology suggests that addressing the issues of self-concept, self-efficacy, and quality of life is integral to successful recovery from mental_illness.	2015
Music therapy provides opportunities for individuals living with chronic mental_illness to address these types of subjective goals through music engagement that allows them to be heard, to build relationships, and to re-experience the wholeness of their own humanity.	2015
Several music therapy perspectives that incorporate aspects of Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) are identified, and clinical vignettes are shared that explore just a few of the ways that music allows these individuals to find relief from invisible symptoms, including building new, meaningful relationships, finding new identity beyond mental_illness, and discovering enjoyment, camaraderie, and new roles in shared social experiences.	2015
Using a phenomenological method, six individuals hospitalized for mental_illness described their experiences in group music therapy treatment.	2015
After removing those suffering from multiple psychiatric diagnoses (such as major depression co-morbid with organic mental_illness), none of the case definitions showed a significant association with LOS.	2015
This study aimed to test the feasibility of using a mobile device (Apple technology: iPodTouch, iPhone or iPad) among people with severe mental_illness (SMI) in a rehabilitation and recovery process and to document the parameters to be taken into account and the issues involved in implementing this technology in living environments and mental_health care settings.	2015

The purpose of this article is to explore how the GLM can be theoretically augmented for use with offenders with mental_illness and applied to MDOs in a forensic mental_health setting.	2015
The authors conclude that the GLM represents a paradigm shift for forensic mental_health whereby the person, rather than risk reduction and/or the treatment of mental_illness, is at centre stage.	2015
Domestic and sexual violence are significant public health problems but little is known about the extent to which men and women with severe mental_illness (SMI) are at risk compared with the general population.	2015
Psychoeducational family intervention might be more effective in places where family members frequently participated in patients' care and had a lower level of knowledge on mental_illness.	2015

They had no history of mental_illness at the time of their baseline scan (mean age 16.5 years) and had a follow-up scan 2 years later (mean age 18.8 years).	2015
The burden of mental_illness concentrates in 5-10 of the adolescent population.	2015
Although negligible gender differences were observed in attitudes about VA care and perceived fit in the VA setting, men reported slightly more negative beliefs about mental_illness and mental_health treatment than women.	2015
For men only, perceived similarity to other VA care users and negative beliefs about mental_health treatment were associated with increased likelihood of service use, whereas negative beliefs about mental_illness were associated with lower likelihood of service use.	2015
Each group was provided with three possible strategies to reduce stigma: the location of a counseling center, contact with a mental_health patient, and the media portrayal of mental_illness.	2015
This article moves away from the mental_illness paradigm through which distress of women is usually understood.	2015
Stigma associated with mental_illness is one of the major impediments in evolving effective treatment interventions to address the burden associated with these disorders.	2015
While providing an overview of these studies, the present paper draws attention to the fact that stigma of mental_illness is not solely a reflection of the social determinants of the problem.	2015
It is equally indicative of structural inequalities of power which result in rejection, marginalisation and social exclusion of the individuals afflicted with mental_illness.	2015
Using MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and article bibliographies, we undertook a systematic search for studies from the last 25 years regarding the oral health of people with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2015
A large number of outpatients with severe mental_illness are at high risk for OSA.	2015
Based on our findings, further studies are warranted to validate the tool in patients with severe mental_illness.	2015
Psychotherapists may be asked to address multiple treatment targets including severe mental_illness and disruptive behaviors, alongside other recidivism-related factors such as substance abuse, criminal thinking errors, and deviant peer networks.	2015
While psychiatric consultations help manage mental_illness among those hospitalized for medical conditions, consultations initiated by nonpsychiatric mental disease may lack maximum effectiveness.	2015
This study sought to better understand the population-specific types of social support relevant to adults living with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2015
Women with mental_illness are at increased risk of developing and dying from breast cancer and are thus in urgent need of breast cancer preventive care.	2015

This story is that of a patient-investigator who questioned the impact that mental_illness has had on his professional life and his career choices.	2015
The evolution of diagnostic noselogy from the DSM-ii, very influenced by psychoanalysis, to the DSM-5 that is more atheortical, but that is still not based on objective data, which remains a challenge to the etiology of mental_illness.	2015
The aims of this study were to explore adolescents opinions about mental_illness and determine whether these change after a mental_health educational intervention.	2015
Thus, mental_health educational interventions can positively influence the perceptions towards mental_illness among adolescents.	2015
A sample of 192 college-aged emerging adults (81.0 female, 81.9 Caucasian, Mage = 18.82 years) living with a concealable stigmatized identity (e.g., mental_illness and sexual minority status) completed measures of enacted stigma, anticipated stigma, and depressive symptoms at two time points across eight weeks.	2015
This study examined how having a mental_illness diagnosis indirectly helps versus harms well-being via social-psychological processes.	2015
We focused on the effects of identity concealment, personal and group discrimination, and personal and social identifications related to mental_illness on psychological well-being.	2015
Among college students with a self-reported mental_illness (N = 255), we found that personal and group discrimination were each negatively related to well-being.	2015
Personal identification was negatively related to well-being, while social identification with others who have a mental_illness was positively related to well-being via access to in-group social support.	2015

The positive association between mental_illness and poverty is one of the most well established in psychiatric epidemiology.	2015
Problematically, much of the literature overlooks the historical, social, political, and cultural trajectories of constructions of both poverty and mental_illness.	2015
Laudable attempts to explore the social determinants of mental_health sometimes take recourse to using and reifying psychiatric diagnostic categories that individualize distress and work to psychiatrically reconfigure symptoms of oppression, poverty, and inequality as symptoms of mental_illness.	2015
As researchers, clinicians and health systems strive to understand and improve mental_health and well-being in youth, the parameters by which mental_illness itself is defined have increasingly become the topic of inquiry.	2015
To improve the understanding of mental_illness stigma, this study focuses on the simultaneous analysis of people's aetiological beliefs, attitudes (i.e. perceived dangerousness and social distance), and recommended treatments related to several mental_disorders by devising an over-arching latent structure that could explain the relations among these variables.	2015
Beyond the general appraisal of mental_illness an individual might have, the results generally point to the acknowledgement of the specific features of different diagnostic categories.	2015
The implications of the present results are discussed in the framework of a better understanding of mental_illness stigma.	2015
Limited studies have experimentally examined how Asian Americans respond to biological and social explanations of mental_illness.	2015
Understanding how to educate and communicate about mental_illness effectively is crucial in increasing service utilization among Asian Americans.	2015
To assess how genetic, neurobiological, and social explanations for the onset of depression affects Asian American and European American's mental_illness stigma.	2015
In a community sample of 202 persons currently distressed by symptoms related to mental_illness, illness representations were assessed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and perceived need for mental_health care was measured by the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire.	2015
Interventions that aim to increase mental_health service use could focus on people's attitudes toward mental_health treatment and enable people to recognize symptoms as a mental_illness.	2015
In this article, we report on attrition in the At Home/Chez Soi study, a multi-site randomized controlled trial of a housing intervention for homeless people with mental_illness.	2015
The study recruited 2,148 homeless people with mental_illness.	2015

Clinicians may consider incorporating the concept into their practice to help patients rebuff the adverse effects of mental_illness stigmatization.	2015
Studies on the association between psychopathology, perceived public stigma, and labeling in mental_illness have focused primarily on severe but rare mental_disorders, especially schizophrenia, or other clinically defined psychotic disorders.	2015
To our knowledge, no research study has explored the chivalry hypothesis as applied to people with mental_illness.	2015
As such, we set out to compare three types of newspaper articles, those that focus on mental_illness generically; a woman with mental_illness; and a man with mental_illness.	2015
The aim of this study was to identify how daughters or sons to parents suffering from mental_illness perceive their situation.	2015
The results showed that parents' mental_illness affected the forum writers on several levels, and they often felt stigmatized.	2015
The writers often lacked knowledge of their parents' mental_illness and sought out Internet forums for information and support from peers in similar situations.	2015
The aim of this study was to identify typical courses of the HA and their predictors in a sample of people with severe mental_illness across Europe over a measurement period of one year.	2015

This systematic review determines what is known about the nature and effectiveness of interventions for parents with severe mental_illness.	2015
Interventions targeted diverse areas, with parenting skills and understanding the impact of mental_illness on parenting most frequently addressed.	2015
This paper describes how individuals struggling with severe mental_illness experience stigma along multiple dimensions including their experiences of discrimination by others, their unwillingness to disclose information about their mental_health, and their internalization or rejection of the negative and positive aspects of having mental_health problems.	2015
We used the King Stigma Scale to measure three factors related to stigma: discrimination, disclosure, and positive aspects of mental_illness.	2015
Although people with mood disorders reported more discomfort with disclosing mental_illness than people with schizophrenia, they did not report experiencing more discrimination than people with schizophrenia.	2015
This study compared the factors associated with the utilization of mental_health services across various age cohorts, with a particular focus on the differential influence of the stigma placed on mental_illness on the use of these services.	2015
The late-adulthood cohort was more likely to have perceived stigma of mental_illness than were the other two groups, and the utilization of mental_health services by the elderly cohort was more strongly affected by this perceived stigma than was such utilization by younger cohorts [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.14, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.86-9.22].	2015
It is important to reduce the perceived stigma placed on mental_illness to improve access to mental_health care among the current population of elderly people in Korea.	2015
Most stigmatizing attitudes were found on professionals' views of health/social care field and mental_illness and disclosure.	2015
We hypothesize that seeking help for mental_illness may constitute a gendered role conflict among men since help seeking is associated with femininity.	2015
To investigate the pattern of associations between changes in unmet needs and treatment motivation in elderly patients with severe mental_illness.	2015
The opportunity afforded by imprisonment could be exploited by provision of funding to identify and treat mental_illness, impart preventive health education addressing modifiable risk factors and provide transitional care to community-based services, all of which may help reduce preventable post-sentence deaths.	2015
Finally, those with preexisting mental problems were more likely to use less lethal methods in the suicide: severe mental_illness (OR = 7.88: 1.58, 39.43); common mental problems (OR = 3.68: 0.83, 16.30); and alcohol/drugs related (OR = 2.02: 0.41, 9.95).	2015
This grounded theory study examined the metaphors mothers used for mental_illness when they had children who were.	2015
Static metaphors for mental_illness emphasized their unchanging qualities and problem-solving or learning strategies were highlighted as ways to approach them.	2015
Dynamic metaphors for mental_illness highlighted how they were changeable.	2015
Although many individuals with mental_illness may self-concur with the content of stigmatizing thoughts at some point in their lives, they may have varying degrees of habitual recurrence of such thoughts, which could exacerbate their experience of self-stigma and perpetuate its damaging effects on their mental_health.	2015
In this study, 189 individuals with mental_illness completed the STARS, along with several explicit (self-report) and implicit (response latency) measures of theoretically related constructs.	2015
Consumer involvement has gained greater prominence in serious mental_illness (SMI) because of the harmonious forces of new research findings, psychiatric rehabilitation, and the recovery movement.	2015
In a design similar to Feldman and Crandall (2007), university undergraduate students read vignettes about target individuals with a generic mental_illness label, major depressive disorder, and social anxiety disorder.	2015

Although many addiction treatment programs will not accept clients with recent suicidal behavior, up to 40 of patients seeking treatment for substance dependence report a history of suicide attempt(s).(1-3) Risk factors for suicide have been studied in the general population and among people with mental_illness, less is known about risk factors in those with substance use disorders and co-occurring disorders.	2015
Studies, psychological autopsies and recent reviews on risk factors for suicide and suicide attempts in patients with alcohol and drug use disorders and the relationship with co-occurring mental_illness were examined.	2015
When provided with a tobacco free treatment environment for 90 days, patients with substance abuse and mental_illness can and do make the decision to quit tobacco and stay quit, aiding their ability to remain sober.	2015
Self-stigma was greatest among those intending to quit; felt stigma was highest among those experiencing stigma in other domains, namely ethnicity and mental_illness-based; and smoking-related discrimination was highest among women, Caucasians, and those with more education.	2015

Ethical issues in culturally responsive treatment with South Asian women with severe mental_illness are discussed.	2015
Acceptance of mental_illness is facilitated by the presence of various resources that are needed to deal with associated stigma, prejudice, and discrimination.	2015
However, women with mental_illness experience added levels of stigma and intersectional oppression that affect the acceptance process, including higher rates of victimization, unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and clinical disparities.	2015
Practitioners and researchers can benefit from sensitivity to intersectional stigma, or overlapping, multiple levels of stigma and discrimination, faced by women with mental_illness.	2015
Participant case narratives from a qualitative study will be presented in order to demonstrate the impact of intersectional stigma on the process of acceptance for women with mental_illness.	2015

Differences are identified in four areas: first, and in contrast to prior research, females are less likely to leave a suicide note; second, and in support of previous research, Aboriginal Australians are less likely to leave suicide notes; third, and in support of some previous research, those who use gas as a method of suicide are more likely to leave notes, while those who use a vehicle or a train are less likely to leave notes; finally, our findings lend support to research which finds that those with a diagnosed mental_illness are less likely to leave notes.	2016
Little is known about internalized stigma of mental_illness in India.	2016
Factorial validity was examined by means of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on a cross-sectional survey among 290 patients with mental_illness attending follow-up outpatient and primary care clinics in Kerala, India.	2016

This study aims to assess the intern's beliefs about mental_illness, their attitude towards psychiatry and psychiatry as a career choice.	2016
Beliefs about mental_illness continue to be negative.	2016
Self-stigma instruments investigate how people with mental_illness internalize public stigma.	2016
Participants with mental_illness (n = 347) completed both instruments.	2016
The findings provide initial evidence that despite good mental_health literacy, and personal experience with mental_illness, significant barriers exist for mental_health professionals seeking help for mental_health conditions.	2016
Future research to better understand the perceived barriers and association between attitudes toward mental_illness and helpseeking in this population is required.	2016
While a number of themes identified by parents with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder are similar to those reported by parents with other forms of severe mental_illness (i.e., rewards, stigma, fear of custody loss, and negative service provision experiences), there was also evidence of specific themes relating to the symptoms of borderline personality disorder and parenting.	2016
Despite advances in the treatment of people with severe mental_illness (SMI), access to work for this community still remains a challenge.	2016
Research has consistently indicated that fear of stigma is a pertinent factor when understanding the poor prevalence of treatment seeking among individuals with mental_illness, particularly eating disorders (EDs).	2016
Perceptions of peer rather than parent alienation appear to be a salient construct in relation to the present levels of anxiety sensitivity, uncontrollable worry, and generalised anxiety disorder symptoms in individuals with a diagnosis of mental_illness.	2016
There is relatively little research in the literature on insanity acquittees as compared with the large number of studies focused on the supervision and treatment of probationers and parolees with mental_illness.	2016
Then, five evidence-based models for the supervision and/or treatment of probationers and parolees with mental_illness are applied to a theoretical conditionally released population (mental_health courts, forensic assertive community treatment teams, the risk-need-responsivity model, informed supervision practices, and HOPE probation).	2016
In fact, it has been argued that death anxiety underlies all psychopathology, and is more fundamental than perfectionism, a process which was previously considered the root of mental_illness.	2016
Efforts to reduce youth mental_health problems have advanced greatly but have not lowered overall rates of youth mental_illness.	2016
There are few empirical data regarding effective treatment of trauma-related symptoms among individuals with severe mental_illness (SMI; e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia).	2016
Although mental_illness anxiety is described in the literature, there is very little information on which to draw when treating individuals who present with fears and worries about mental_health.	2016
The current case study aims to advance the understanding of the clinical picture of mental_illness anxiety, and facilitate the understanding of how cognitive behavioral techniques for health anxiety can be effectively adapted and implemented for such a case.	2016
In the current case study, we discuss the assessment, conceptualization, and cognitive behavioral treatment of a 24-year old woman who presented with mental_illness anxiety.	2016
The results provide preliminary evidence that cognitive behavioral techniques for health anxiety can be effectively and efficiently adapted for mental_illness anxiety.	2016
However, the lack of available research pertaining to mental_illness anxiety contributes to challenges in conceptualization, assessment and treatment.	2016
The early detection of young people at-risk of developing a severe mental_illness like schizophrenia offers the opportunity of introducing treatment earlier than currently possible.	2016
Aside from the economic advantages, maximizing SWB confers obvious individual and clinical benefits for people with severe mental_illness, such as psychosis.	2016
This study addresses these omissions by examining the relationships between perceptions of public stigma of mental_illness and the self-stigma of seeking help, and how they are related to help-seeking attitudes and intentions for both individual and group therapy among adolescents in Israel (N = 238).	2016
Consistent with the only other study conducted in Israel, but contrasting research from other parts of the world, the relationship between perceptions of public stigma of mental_illness and self-stigma of seeking help was not present for either individual or group therapy.	2016
However, perceptions of public stigma of mental_illness were a direct negative predictor of help-seeking attitudes for group therapy.	2016
High Conventional ACE scores were significantly associated with health risk behaviors, physical and mental_illness, while elevated Expanded ACE scores were associated only with substance abuse history and sexually transmitted infections.	2016
Dimensions of child/adolescent emotional maltreatment and a mental_illness in the household predicted a set of psychosocial problems in young adulthood.	2016
Two ACEs were necessary for statistically significant, higher odds to emerge for hypertension (OR=1.46), mental_illness (OR=1.93), smoking (OR=1.17), alcohol use (OR=1.75), and drug use (OR=1.45).	2016

This case illustrates the complexity of treating those with chronic serious mental_illness and multimorbidities.	2016
All patients evaluated had been diagnosed with a cognitive disorder, and on average, a relatively lower prevalence of mental_illness compared with the national HBPC population.	2016
Individuals with psychosis do appear to develop causal beliefs that may be associated with engagement with services and treatment, as well as impacting on their attitudes towards themselves and others with mental_illness.	2016
Mothers with severe post-natal mental_illness can be admitted with their infant to a psychiatric mother and baby unit (MBU) in the UK.	2016
Furthermore, fathers sought support from many sources, but their knowledge of psychiatric services and mental_illness was limited.	2016
The present study assessed motivation for engaging in treatment as rated by clinicians (n = 57) and patients with severe mental_illness (SMI, n = 294) using measures based on three different motivation theories.	2016
Parents of offspring with mental_illness must endure endless child care burden despite their old age, and must cope with associative stigma.	2016
This study analyzed the mediator effect of associative stigma on relationships between the main stressors, psychiatric symptoms and lowered social function of offspring with mental_illness, assessed by the parents, and their care burden.	2016
215 parents caring for an adult child with mental_illness in Korea were surveyed (Mage=60.68, SD=13.58; 74.4 mothers).	2016
We suggest strategies for parents to overcome associative stigma and emphasize the professional endeavor required to meet the service needs of elderly parents taking care of an adult child with mental_illness.	2016
There is a dearth of research on what factors are predictive of insight among people with severe mental_illness and co-occurring PTSD.	2016
Data were drawn from 146 participants with severe mental_illness, co-occurring PTSD and elevated psychotic symptoms participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions for PTSD among people with severe mental_illness.	2016
Impairment in reality monitoring has been implicated in symptoms of mental_illness and associated more widely with the occurrence of anomalous perceptions as well as false memories and beliefs.	2016
The main objective of the study was to investigate the types of microaggressions experienced by individuals with mental_illness (MI) based on this marginalized group status.	2016
There is a strong correlation between severe mental_illness and criminality, but little is known about how these two problem areas together may affect health outcomes.	2016
The media, including television, newspapers, and popular films have been implicated in the facilitation of mental_illness stigmatization by presenting negative and inaccurate depictions of various diagnoses.	2016
These results provide support for the hypothesis that negative, inaccurate portrayals of severe mental_illness enhance stigmatizing attitudes.	2016
Accurate film depictions, advocacy for social equality, and the continued education of individuals, clients, families, communities and organizations will help to mitigate the impact of films on mental_illness stigmatization.	2016
Although suicidality is associated with mental_illness in general and depression in particular, many depressed individuals do not attempt suicide and some individuals who attempt to or do die by suicide do not present depressive symptoms.	2016
Suicide prevention should focus on acute alcohol abuse in the presence of acute stressors, suicidal thoughts and mental_illness.	2016
Maternal mental_illness has been implicated in adverse child development outcomes.	2016
Avoidance coping may be a protective factor against mental_illness, whereas approach coping may be a promotive factor for adaptive/prosocial behaviors in war-affected societies.	2016
Applying Goffmans stigma-status framework and using data from a survey administered to college students (N = 556), we find that respondents who have been diagnosed with a mental_illness (the own) or who know a family member or friend with a mental_illness diagnosis (the wise) express lower desired social distance from persons with a mental_illness than other respondents (normals).	2016
Also, informally labeling symptoms as mental_illness reduced social distance among those similarly diagnosed.	2016
Multiple placement changes and mental_illness of biological parents lowered attachment security in the beginning, while the professional background of foster parents fostered early attachment formation.	2016
Participants perceived that families: (a) considered AN a problem with food rather than a mental_illness; and (b) viewed treatment as time limited, and complete recovery as achievable.	2016
Mental health professionals frequently work with family caregivers in the provision of psychotherapy services to individuals with serious mental_illness.	2016
Cognitive impairment, mental_illness, lack of autonomy, and limited access to services emerged as the greatest sources of vulnerability; being male, being female, being over age of 60, being a minority, and being pregnant were the lowest-ranked sources of vulnerability.	2016
The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and psychometric properties of the German version of the Outcome Questionnaire (Ergebnisfragebogen; EB-45) in people with severe mental_illness (N = 294).	2016
However, treatment planning and evaluation of effectiveness of services for people with severe mental_illness should not be based on EB-45 data alone.	2016
Retrospective prevalence estimates have been shown to underestimate the burden of mental_illness and scarce data are available on the incidence of disorders throughout the adolescent period, especially in developing countries.	2016
Information on costs of programs addressing community integration for persons with serious mental_illness in the United States, essential for program planning and evaluation, is largely lacking.	2016
People with mental_illness and substance use problems may be legitimately concerned that employers, insurance companies, financial institutions, medical practices, and educational institutions could use their health information to discriminate against them, often without their knowledge.	2016
This population includes childless adults predicted to have high rates of mental_illness, especially among the homeless.	2016
Using enrollment and claims data from the Minnesota Department of Human Services, this study presents prevalence rates of mental_illness diagnoses and measures of unstable housing in Minnesota's childless-adult early Medicaid expansion population.	2016
Rates are compared with prior predictions of serious psychological distress and mental_illness constructed from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) using 2 and t tests.	2016
Diagnoses of mental_illness in Minnesota's childless-adult early Medicaid expansion population were more than 15 higher than prevalence measures of mental_illness/distress for the current Medicaid population.	2016
Diagnosis rates fell within confidence intervals of estimates of mental_illness for Minnesota's Medicaid expansion population.	2016
Almost 1 in 3 enrollees had a marker of unstable housing; of this group, half had mental_illness and/or distress.	2016
Findings support predictions of the high burden of mental_illness and unstable housing among the Medicaid expansion population.	2016
Concern is building about the need to understand the complex ways in which nature and nurture interact to produce mental_illness.	2016
Considerations of athletes' mental_health are typically framed in the language of mental_illness (Hughes and Leavey, 2012), a situation that contributes to stigmatization, denial, and the prevention of effective care.	2016
This model posits two related, but distinct dimensions: one continuum indicates the presence or absence of mental_health, the other the presence or absence of mental_illness.	2016
For instance, athletes could simultaneously have both positive mental_health and experience of mental_illness.	2016
Alternatively, athletes could be free from mental_illness, but in Keyes' terms be languishing (i.e., experiencing low levels of mental_health).	2016
In particular, we note that the link between social change, individualism, and rising mental_illness deserves careful attention.	2016
Understanding schizophrenia as a form of disembodiment of the self, a number of scientists have argued that the approach of embodiment and associated embodied therapies, such as Dance and Movement Therapy (DMT) or Body Psychotherapy (BPT), may be more suitable to explain the psychopathology underlying the mental_illness and to address its symptoms.	2016
Temperament traits and mental_illness have been linked to varying degrees of imbalances in neurotransmitter systems of behavior regulation.	2016
If a temperament model has been carefully structured to reflect weak imbalances within systems of behavior regulation, then in the presence of mental_illness, these profiles should exhibit distinct patterns consistent with symptoms of mental_illness.	2016
In this regard, animal models of mental_illness could be a useful tool to characterize indicators of possible cognitive dysfunctions in humans.	2016
Within clinical psychiatry, recovery from severe mental_illness (SMI) has classically been defined according to symptoms and function (service-based recovery).	2016
However, service-users have argued that recovery should be defined as the process of overcoming mental_illness, regaining self-control and establishing a meaningful life (customer-based recovery).	2016
In his 1954 book Mental Illness and Personality Foucault combines the subjective experience of the mentally ill person with a sociocultural historical approach to mental_illness and suggests that there exists a reciprocal connection between individual perception and sociocultural development.	2016
Progress in psychiatry in the West has been retarded by the proclivity of the discipline to swing violently between 2 approaches to viewing mental_illness; that is, emphasizing-to the exclusion of the other-the material-somatic vs the psychical-experiential avenues to knowledge.	2016
However, the schism between biological and psychosocial models of mental_illness and its treatment represents extreme positions among some psychiatrists-not the model propounded by academic psychiatry or its affiliated professional organizations.	2016
About 40 in the schizophrenia group were unaware of their mental_illness as against none in the bipolar group.	2016
View all notes as a clinical tool in parentinfant psychotherapy in the home setting with parents with mental_illness or severe and enduring mental_health difficulties.	2016
Maternal mental_illness is associated with negative effects on the infant and child.	2016
Interventions targeting parents' mental_health in the perinatal period are critical due to potential consequences of perinatal mental_illness for the parent, the infant, and their family.	2016
This systematic review explores the current status and evidence for intervention programs aiming to prevent or treat paternal mental_illness in the perinatal period.	2016
Here, we review five core dimensions in which such failure is particularly apparent: an unwitting reliance on the medical model of mental_illness; an ontological, concrete understanding of unconscious processes; a manifest failure to fully appreciate the role of extratransference relationships in the patients life; a naive and idealized view of the psychoanalysts person and role; and a marginal awareness of the impact of group-level unconscious phenomena on the social life of psychoanalytic institutions.	2016
Progress toward developing psychosocial treatments for mental_illness has been excellent.	2016
In sum, several studies are presented that add to the considerable evidence indicating that time-limited psychosocial treatments are powerful approaches to improving outcomes for patients with a mental_illness.	2016
A persons capacity to counteract mental_illness stigma is significant in combating stigma.	2016
However, little is known about how people cope against mental_illness stigma and factors that guide the same.	2016
In many cultures, diagnoses of mental_illness are commonly associated with stigmatisation.	2016
Negative attitudes and beliefs cause significant problems not only for people with mental_illness but also for their caregivers.	2016
Persons with intellectual disability who have been through abuse face a more complex double or even triple jeopardy because of mental_illness, intellectual disability and abuse.	2016
Latinos with serious mental_illness have higher morbidity and mortality rates than same age peers.	2016
These findings were transposed into individual items, to which 122 Latino participants with mental_illness responded using a 7-point importance scale.	2016
Implications of these findings for integrated care of Latinos with serious mental_illness are discussed.	2016
Stigma against mental_illness limits ones help-seeking attitudes and behavior, thereby leading to social isolation and deteriorating performance in the workplace.	2016
This study aimed at examining what aspects of knowledge, attitude and previous contacts with people with mental_illness influence working adults intention to have future contact with people (e.g., to work with, to live nearby) with mental_illness.	2016
Higher education and lower income level were associated with higher intention to have contact with people with mental_illness.	2016
The attitude that people with mental_health problems are less reliable was significantly associated with lower intention, and the knowledge that people with severe mental_health problems can fully recover was significantly associated with higher intended contacts with people with mental_illness.	2016
Knowledge of treatment options for mental_illness focused mainly on counselling.	2016
Based on the findings of this study it is clear that young people have a poor awareness of mental_health services, specifically child and adolescent mental_health services services and treatment options for mental_illness.	2016
With regards to specific numbers, out of 455 medically ill patients, 4.8 had a mental_illness identified by dint of the GMHAT-PC interview.	2016
On the other hand, cancer had a significantly higher prevalence of comorbid mental_illness.	2016
It was determined that GMHAT-PC is more likely to identify not only clinical cases of mental_illness, but also patients who need help.	2016
Though strides have been made to improve the conditions of individuals with serious mental_illness, stigma continues to be a challenge.	2016
Since Erving Goffmans landmark publication, Stigma, Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity in 1963, much has been done to reduce stigma associated with mental_illness.	2016
This study explores the depiction of mental_illness through two main government print media in Ghana from 2003 to 2012.	2016
Emphasis was placed on observing the newspapers use of language to describe persons with mental_illness.	2016
Findings revealed that despite the drive to change the negative discourse on mental_illness, government funded media in Ghana continue to use derogatory language to describe this population.	2016
Unfortunately, the use of this language tends to perpetuate the stigmatization of mental_illness and roll back some of the progress made.	2016
However, the study noted that there were several instances where the media sought to educate the public on mental_illness to do away with misconceptions and stigma and to advocate for improved facilities and service provision.	2016
The study demonstrates how stigma continues to dominate the discussion on mental_illness in Ghana.	2016
Primary aims of the training were to increase recognition of mental_disorders, to reduce stigmatizing attitudes regarding mental_illness, and to increase self-perceived competence in providing care to people with mental_health problems.	2016
Students with invisible disabilities such as mental_illness or acquired brain injury (ABI) experience multiple barriers that reduce their likelihood of postsecondary course completion.	2016
The present study conducted a systematic search of research reporting interventions for students experiencing mental_illness or ABI to participate in postsecondary education.	2016
An examination of scholarly literature concerning fatal violence (i.e., parricide) and non-fatal violence toward parents reveals dominant themes of mental_illness, child abuse, and pathology based on a research paradigm that focuses on adolescent perpetrators and, to a lesser extent, elderly victims.	2016
Mental health professionals attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness have significant implications for the quality of care and treatment rendered, making it imperative for these professionals to be aware of their attitudes.	2016
Consequently, the present study investigates attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness (insanity acquittees) in a sample of 113 registered mental_health nurses in Ghana.	2016
Using a cross-sectional survey and self-report methodology, the participants respond to measures of attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness, attitudes toward mental_illness, conviction proneness, and criminal blameworthiness.	2016
The results show that mental_health nurses who reportedly practiced for a longer duration (6 years and above) were more likely to be unsympathetic, while the male nurses who were aged 30 years and above were more likely to hold offenders with mental_illness strictly liable for their offenses.	2016
Importantly, the nurses scores in conviction proneness and criminal blameworthiness significantly predict negative attitudes toward the offenders even after controlling for their attitudes toward mental_illness.	2016
Yet, when the nurses conviction proneness and criminal blameworthiness were held constant, their attitudes toward mental_illness failed to predict attitudes toward the offenders.	2016
This initial finding implies that the nurses views regarding criminal blameworthiness and conviction may be more influential in understanding their attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness relative to their attitudes toward mental_illness.	2016
More attention is needed to prevent falls and identify residents with depression and severe mental_illness, who are at greater risk of hospitalization.	2016
Due to stigma and a limited number of trained specialists, only 10 of adults with mental_illness in Nigeria receive any care.	2016
The aim of the study was to assess the beliefs and attitudes about mental_illness among the CHAs.	2016
The study used a cross-sectional survey of 57 CHAs, who completed a 43-item, self-administered questionnaire that assessed their beliefs and attitudes about mental_illness.	2016
Most endorsed possession by evil spirits (84), traumatic events (81) and witchcraft (60) as causes of mental_illness.	2016
A majority (69) believed that people with mental_illness were a nuisance, and less than half (46) believed that mental_disorders were illnesses like any other illness.	2016
It is concluded that stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs about mental_illness are common among the CHAs.	2016
This study compared recidivism outcomes of 102 adults with mental_illness who were arrested for a misdemeanor offense.	2016
One group had a diagnosed mental_illness (n = 58) and the other group was diagnosed with co-occurring mental_health and substance abuse disorders (n = 44).	2016
Mental health professionals' attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness have significant implications for the quality of care and treatment rendered, making it imperative for these professionals to be aware of their attitudes.	2016
Consequently, the present study investigates attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness (insanity acquittees) in a sample of 113 registered mental_health nurses in Ghana.	2016
Using a cross-sectional survey and self-report methodology, the participants respond to measures of attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness, attitudes toward mental_illness, conviction proneness, and criminal blameworthiness.	2016
The results show that mental_health nurses who reportedly practiced for a longer duration (6 years and above) were more likely to be unsympathetic, while the male nurses who were aged 30 years and above were more likely to hold offenders with mental_illness strictly liable for their offenses.	2016
Importantly, the nurses' scores in conviction proneness and criminal blameworthiness significantly predict negative attitudes toward the offenders even after controlling for their attitudes toward mental_illness.	2016
Yet, when the nurses' conviction proneness and criminal blameworthiness were held constant, their attitudes toward mental_illness failed to predict attitudes toward the offenders.	2016
This initial finding implies that the nurses' views regarding criminal blameworthiness and conviction may be more influential in understanding their attitudes toward offenders with mental_illness relative to their attitudes toward mental_illness.	2016
There has previously been no risk assessment normed to persons with mental_illness in the State of Washington.	2016
A sample of 16,289 patients involuntarily committed due to being deemed dangerous or gravely disabled, as well as a sample of 8,713 forensic patients undergoing a competency evaluation to stand trial after being charged with a crime, was gathered to assess the utility in applying the SRA-MHP to persons with mental_illness.	2016
The authors discuss implications for use of SOS, a treatment that facilitates skills development and affects global self-regulatory functioning, particularly in sex offenders with serious mental_illness or intellectual impairment, in promoting community reintegration and limiting returns to psychiatric settings.	2016
Treatment completion is an important outcome for both mental_health and criminal justice agencies tasked with managing offenders with mental_illness in the community.	2016
However, most studies were conducted with offenders without mental_illness.	2016
In this study, demographic (e.g., age, gender), clinical (e.g., psychiatric diagnosis), and criminogenic risk factors (measured using the Level of Service Inventory-Revised [LSI-R]) were compared by treatment completion status using 167 probationers with mental_illness treated at an enhanced day reporting center.	2016
Child abuse and neglect and parental/other adult's mental_illness and substance abuse had small but consistently significant associations with MSUDs (e.g., odds ratio = 1.28, 95 CI = 1.12-1.46 for parental/other adult's substance misuse and MDD).	2016
The prevalence of possible and probable iNPH in older patients with schizophrenia was much higher than that reported for older people without mental_illness.	2016

For the frail aged with cognitive impairment in high care settings, for children in hospital undergoing painful or prolonged treatments, for individuals suffering mental_illness, or coping with physical or cognitive disabilities there is a growing body of experience and evidence of the value of therapy dogs.	2016
A key factor to the prevalence of mental_illness might be the disinclination to seek help, perhaps owing to the stigma of mental_illness.	2016
Together, the findings point to the contribution of social support and unsupportive interactions, and coping methods to the prediction of perceived stigma of seeking help, but that the framing of mental_illness can limit or strengthen these relations.	2016
Family history of mental_illness was reported among 22.5.	2016
Subjects with childhood onset were significantly less likely than those with adolescent onset to have a family history of mental_illness (p = 0.016), more likely to report maternal illness during pregnancy (p = 0.005) and illness during infancy (p = 0.010), and more likely to have a diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another general medical condition (p < 0.001).	2016
Family history of mental_illness may however be of greater relevance in adolescent onset psychosis.	2016
This study examines the relationship between family stress (i.e., having an adult in the home with a history of mental_illness, substance use, and incarceration) and youth concerns such as substance use, mental_health challenges, low school engagement, juvenile justice involvement, and STI risk behaviors.	2016
Family members often serve as the primary source of care and support for loved ones living with mental_illness.	2016
Although existing research has examined the role of parents and well siblings in providing care to adult children with mental_illness, relatively little is known about the caregiving experiences of adult children with a parent with a psychiatric disability.	2016
Guided by a life course perspective, the present qualitative study examined first-person accounts of 10 young women attending college (ages 1822) who were raised by a mother living with mental_illness (depression, bipolar, or schizophrenia).	2016
Participants completed individual semi-structured interviews in which they described their experiences of caregiving, role reversal, and felt obligation towards mother, their ties to father and siblings, and their views of the impact of maternal mental_illness on their lives.	2016
Adult daughters described positive impacts of maternal mental_illness on their own lives, regardless of their accounts of relationship quality with their mothers.	2016
However, because it leads to a diminished sense of being a good parent, the self-stigma is of a different type to that which has been described for adults with mental_illness.	2016
The Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme, a new addition to the established Triple P programmes, is currently being considered for a trial in a Mother and Baby Unit with the aim of exploring its benefits to mothers presenting with severe mental_illness.	2016

Young people of parents with a mental_illness are at significant risk of developing a mental_illness.	2016
One hundred and seventy-two young people (1317 years) whose parent has a mental_illness completed a self-constructed questionnaire and six of these participants engaged in individual follow-up interviews.	2016
Frequency data indicated that youth want to learn how to cope or manage their parents mental_illness and highlighted a need to access support online.	2016
Given that there is evidence that college student-athletes may be at risk for psychological disturbances (Pinkerton, Hintz, & Barrow, 1989), and possibly underutilizing college mental_health services (Watson & Kissinger, 2007), the purpose of this study was to examine attitudes toward mental_illness and help seeking among college student-athletes compared to college student nonathletes.	2016
Student-athletes perceived significantly less discrimination toward individuals based on mental_illness status.	2016

Nor is it a category of story ending often told about Australian Aboriginal people living with a diagnosis of chronic mental_illness.	2016
Police identification of people experiencing mental_illness is usually based on either the person having an official contact history with police or through observing behavioural indicators commonly associated with mental_illness during an encounter.	2016
Police have voiced concerns with their ability to identify and respond to people experiencing mental_illness in a timely way and report that they commonly resort to more coercive tactical options to resolve encounters.	2016
We examine three reasons why suspects resist arrest: defiance of police authority by suspects from lower-status groups, risky decisions resulting from aversion to sure losses, and impairment due to mental_illness and substance use.	2016
Resistance is also positively related to mental_illness, illicit drug use, and alcohol intoxication.	2016
This report examines mental_health recovery in a population neglected in the literature formerly homeless adults with serious mental_illness and co-occurring substance abuse.	2016
Consequently, employer efforts to improve the overall health and well-being of their employees should also include efforts to decrease the stigma of mental_illness in the workplace.	2016
Depression is a common mental_illness affecting more than 19 million Americans each year.	2016
Many individuals suffering from psychological disorders do not receive professional help, partly due to the highly stigmatizing nature of mental_illness.	2016

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental_illness that can have high costs for youths (<18 years old) and adults.	2016
The sample included 78 participants, ages 13 to 23, with BD or without history of mental_illness.	2016
Eleven studies were included for review resulting in the identification of potential individual (two biological, three clinical, two psychological and two social individual) and two potential composite moderators (the interaction between BDNF and Body Mass Index (BMI) and between family history of mental_illness and gender).	2016
Hoarding disorder (HD) is a common, debilitating mental_illness and public health burden.	2016
Anxiety is highly comorbid with depression, and thus measures of mixed anxiety/depression might better capture the overall burden of mental_illness.	2016
The prevalence of OSA among people with serious mental_illness (SMI) is unclear.	2016
The Keyes' two continua model of mental_health and illness posits that mental_health status is not merely the absence of mental_health problems, and it can be enhanced regardless of a diagnosis of mental_illness.	2016
Baseline assessment included demographic variables, GSE scale, physical disability (Barthel-Index), stroke severity (modified NIH Scale), pre-stroke mental_illness, cognitive status (Mini-Mental-State-Test), social support (F-SozU Questionnaire) and depressiveness (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS).	2016
The most relevant factors associated with antenatal depression or anxiety were: lack of partner or of social support; history of abuse or of domestic violence; personal history of mental_illness; unplanned or unwanted pregnancy; adverse events in life and high perceived stress; present/past pregnancy complications; and pregnancy loss.	2016
Previous research has focused on the separate roles of mental_illness and physical health conditions in suicide risk, with relatively few studies investigating the importance of physical and psychiatric disorder co-occurrence.	2016
However, this rejection identification model has never been tested in the context of mental_illness identity.	2016
Experiencing mental_illness stigma was associated with poorer wellbeing.	2016
These findings suggest that mental_illness stigma is a double-edged sword: as well as the direct harms for wellbeing, by increasing identification with other mental_illness sufferers, stigma might expose sufferers to harmful social influence processes.	2016
Poisson regression of biennial alcohol recording rates between 2000 and 2013 among 14,051 adults with bipolar disorder and 90,023 adults without severe mental_illness (SMI), from 484 general practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network UK-wide primary care database.	2016

To obtain rapid and reproducible opinions that address mental_illness stigma around the world.	2016
Random global Web users were exposed to brief questions, asking whether they interacted daily with someone with mental_illness, whether they believed that mental_illness was associated with violence, whether it was similar to physical illness, and whether it could be overcome.	2016
China had the highest proportion of respondents in daily contact with a person with mental_illness.	2016
In developed countries, 7 to 8 of respondents endorsed the statement that individuals with mental_illness were more violent than others, in contrast to 15 or 16 in developing countries.	2016
While 45 to 51 of respondents from developed countries believed that mental_illness was similar to physical illness, only 7 believed that mental_illness could be overcome.	2016
of respondents endorsed the statement that persons who suffer from mental_illness are more violent than others, indicating strong reproducibility of response.	2016
This study shows that surveys of constructs such as stigma towards mental_illness can be carried out rapidly and repeatedly across the globe, so that the impact of policy interventions can be readily measured.	2016
While low social support is a risk factor for mental_illness, anxiety and depression's relationship with social impairment specifically resulting from a medical condition is poorly understood.	2016
Further clarification of this relationship could inform more targeted, personalized interventions to prevent and/or alleviate mental_illness in those with chronic medical conditions.	2016
Psychiatric inpatient settings represent an opportunity to initiate the provision of tobacco cessation care to smokers with a mental_illness.	2016
Most smokers with a mental_illness took up a proactive offer of aids to support their stopping smoking.	2016
We evaluated a synergistic epidemic (syndemic) of substance use, mental_illness, and familial conflict non-negotiation among HIV-positive injection drug users (IDU).	2016
Nine percent of participants had high substance use/mental_illness prevalence (Class; 23 had moderate levels of all factors (Class; 25 had high mental_illness (Class; 43 had moderate substance use/mental_illness (Class 1; N = 331).	2016
The present study compared adolescents with a mental_illness (n = 41) to demographically matched controls (n = 45) on an experimental task that required them to either suppress or amplify their emotion expressive behavior in response to images that were either negative or positive in affective valence.	2016
These data indicate that specific aspects of emotion expressive behavior are disrupted in adolescents with mental_illness and are discussed in the context of theoretical models that regard emotion dysregulation as a core, transdiagnostic feature of mental_illness.	2016
This treatment gap is particularly true in low- and middle-income settings, where there is significant scarcity of resources (including human resources) and treatment accessibility is complicated by stigma surrounding mental_illness.	2016
The most common explanations for IPV were that the perpetrator suffered from physical or mental_illness, had relationship problems, or was distressed.	2016
Childhood beliefs that the perpetrator was debilitated (from mental_illness or substance abuse) and cruel (took pleasure in violence and/or despised the child) were associated with greater mental_health problems and poorer relationship quality in adulthood.	2016
This case illustration demonstrates that these three different approaches can be used in a sequential and complementary fashion to foster recovery in the midst of serious physical and mental_illness.	2016
People suffering from mental_illness experience poor physical health outcomes, including an average life expectancy of 25 years less than the rest of the population.	2016
Research on childhood mental_illness traditionally examines risk factors most proximal to the child.	2016
Respondents more often deflected a mental_illness identity if they had a nonsevere disorder, had low impairment in functioning, had no treatment experience, viewed possible treatment as undesirable, and held multiple social roles, consistent with theory about stigma resistance.	2016
Persons who deflected a mental_illness identity had lower distress and more positive affect than those who accepted it, even net of disorder severity, impairment level, and treatment experience.	2016
Furthermore, self-reported symptoms were correlated with mental_illness.	2016
Little is known about the role of age and gender in the association between psychosomatic symptoms and common mental_illness in Ghanaian adolescents.	2016
This cross-sectional study examined age and gender as moderators between psychosomatic symptoms and common mental_illness using data from a school-based survey (N = 770).	2016
Males reported higher psychosomatic symptoms and common mental_illness, while younger adolescents reported higher common mental_illness only.	2016
Psychosomatic symptoms were positively associated with common mental_illness, but age and gender did not moderate this association.	2016
Interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence rate in psychosomatic symptoms are crucial in decreasing common mental_illness in Ghanaian adolescents.	2016
Our objective is to identify links between physical health and community participation among individuals with schizophrenia or a psychosis mental_illness.	2016
This article examines the relationship between tobacco cessation and changes in severity of mental_illness.	2016

This article presents findings from a qualitative study of four families, which were selected as typifying the experiences of a larger sample of 14 families; each family included a child with mental_illness and a history of violent behavior.	2016
The analysis revealed a five-stage pattern in how families perceived and responded to victimization and their child or sibling's mental_illness.	2016
The study suggests that families with a violent child with mental_illness and other healthy children cannot live through episodes of violence without removing the child with mental_illness from the home or suffering considerable damage to the family.	2016
This study examined how demand-withdraw (DW) couple communication accounts for the association between symptoms of mental_illness and marital distress.	2016
The high stigma attached to mental_illness leading to social isolation, and families' devotion to caregiving exacerbated caregiver burden.	2016
Unreliable responding could occur due to lack of personal investment in the evaluation, severe mental_illness, and low cognitive abilities.	2016
In this study, we examined if a self-report of trait spite, the Spitefulness Scale, retains the same associations with dark personality traits in individuals with severe mental_illness.	2016
In particular, this article considers the regional locale as an important factor in understanding the perspective of a person with lived experience of mental_illness.	2016
This article questions the influential, yet somewhat narrow, argument that living in the community and in the family home is somehow better for people with mental_illness.	2016
The arguments presented in this article illustrate that for some people with mental_illness, the issues of stigma, autonomy, and lack of alternatives (choice) are just as prevalent for them now, living in the community, as when they lived in institutions.	2016
Linear regression analysis was used to determine if mental_illness group, gender, age, pre-op BMI, education, employment and relationship status predict change in TWL and HRQOL.	2016

A new clinician rating measure, the Symptoms of Trauma Scale (SOTS), was administered to adult psychiatric outpatients (46 men, 47 women) with severe mental_illness who reported a history of trauma exposure and had recently been discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment.	2016
Results provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the SOTS with adults with severe mental_illness and suggest directions for replication, measure refinement, and research on gender differences.	2016
Major Depressive Disorder is a common mental_illness with rates increasing during adolescence.	2016
In this representative sample of 3005 adolescents from Mexico City (52.1 female), administered the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-A), adult presence influenced reporting the most; in their presence, adolescents reported more ADHD, parental mental_illness and economic adversity, but less panic disorder, PTSD, drug use and disorder, and suicidal behavior.	2016
Longitudinal data of subjective well-being (e.g., Binder & Coad, 2013) show that hedonic loss is domain-specific: Many physical impairments (e.g., strokes) inflict less hedonic loss than many persistent yet invisible ailments (e.g., mental_illness and conditions that cause chronic pain).	2016
Individuals with serious mental_illness (SMI; i.e., psychotic or major mood disorders) are vulnerable to experiencing multiple forms of adverse safety events in community settings, including violence perpetration and victimization.	2016
Research on violence perpetrated by individuals with major mental_illness (MMI) typically focuses on the presence of specific psychotic symptoms near the time of the violent act.	2016
For many who experience serious mental_illness, spirituality and religion can be common vehicles that provide a sense of coherence and meaning to life.	2016
This paper explores the relationship between spirituality/religion, early trauma, and serious mental_illness.	2016
Although attitudes and knowledge of laypeople on mental_illness have been explored, little is known about Christians knowledge and how the church influences such knowledge.	2016
The present study explored knowledge on definition, types and symptoms of mental_illness, church teachings on mental_illness and the influence of such teachings on the mental well-being of 86 congregants of six Charismatic churches in Ghana.	2016
Regarding church teachings, some churches provided education and spiritual healing, and others emphasised non-existence of, and immunity from, mental_illness.	2016
The paper concludes with an argument for psycho-education on mental_illness and collaboration between churches and mental_health practitioners.	2016
Religion is a powerful force in peoples conception of mental_illness.	2016
The extent to which Muslim populations in Zimbabwe understand and conceptualise mental_illness is largely unknown.	2016
Thus, a descriptive cross-sectional study aimed at determining knowledge and conceptualisations of mental_illness among Muslims was conducted in Harare.	2016
Seventy-one participants drawn from three mosques in Harare responded to self-administered questionnaires, which assessed their knowledge on causes, signs and symptoms as well as the treatment of mental_illness.	2016
Respondents defined mental_illness within the social, spiritual and medical realms.	2016
The main perceived causes of mental_illness were evil spirits (66) and stress (62).	2016
Both modern medicine and religious methods emerged as important in managing mental_illness which suggests the need for a multi-sectoral approach.	2016

This study examined whether early life course burdens associated with an emerging mental_illness, and current objective and subjective caregiver burden predicted depressive symptoms in siblings of individuals with schizophrenia.	2016
Despite the fact that there is increasing integration of Buddhist principles and practices into Western mental_health and applied psychological disciplines, there appears to be limited understanding in Western psychology of the assumptions that underlie a Buddhist model of mental_illness.	2016
The concept of ontological addiction was introduced and formulated in order to narrow some of the disconnect between Buddhist and Western models of mental_illness and to foster effective assimilation of Buddhist practices and principles into mental_health research and practice.	2016
Families living with mental_illness express needs of support and experiences of burden that may affect their own health detrimentally and hence also their ability to support the patient.	2016
The aim of the current study was to explore the effectiveness and usability of a web-based mindfulness program for families living with mental_illness, which was first tested in a feasibility study.	2016
The present study examined the roles of self-compassion and mindfulness in moderating the relationships of self-stigma content and process with subjective well-being of people in recovery of mental_illness (PMI) and people living with HIV (PLHIV).	2016
Mindfulness is increasingly an important part of clinical case conceptualization and treatment for mental_illness.	2016
Bipolar disorder is a serious mental_illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood.	2016
Previous studies have indicated that permissive attitudes toward suicide are positively associated with mental_illness (e.g., depression and loneliness).	2016
Adolescence as highlighted in this special issue is a period of tremendous growth, synaptic exuberance, and plasticity, but also a period for the emergence of mental_illness and addiction.	2016
For decades, the nosology of mental_illness has been based largely upon the descriptions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM).	2016
This approach was driven by two primary weaknesses noted in the DSM: the same symptoms occur in very different disease states; and DSM criteria lack grounding in the underlying biological causes of mental_illness.	2016
This review addresses the suitability of RDoC vs. DSM from the view of modeling mental_illness in animals.	2016
We discuss these processes, as well as how immune signaling during this transitional period of development confers differential effects on behavior and vulnerability to mental_illness.	2016
In this paper, we introduce the concept and history of intermediate phenotype study of mental_illness and the latest trends.	2016
We hope to contribute to the future development of mental_illness research through translational research.	2016
This is particularly true for children with mental_illness whose views are often ignored.	2016
More research is needed on clinical approaches that access the unique experiences of children with mental_illness.	2016
Using a phenomenological research design with a photovoice method, we aimed to understand the lived experience of eight individuals diagnosed with mental_illness and identify factors affecting their recovery.	2016
Findings revealed factors influencing recovery from mental_illness and can be used to develop person-centered and occupation-based interventions to promote recovery in clients with mental_health issues.	2016
Schools have a significant role in supporting childrens mental well-being and reducing the stigma attached to mental_illness but only if this important topic is not regarded as an elephant in the room.	2016
The stigma of mental_illness diminishes the self-respect of individuals with mental_health problems and may be especially acute for veterans because of the centrality of resilience in military culture.	2016
The treatment gap for mental_illness is wide between low- and middle-income countries.	2016

Two possible explanations for this relationship include that (a) fundamentalism is associated with more dispositional attributions, and (b) fundamentalism is associated with more authoritarian attitudes toward mental_illness and the mentally ill.	2016
The post-release period is associated with a range of adverse outcomes for prisoners, especially those with a mental_illness.	2016
While the high prevalence of offending and victimisation among young people is well established, no study to date has compared official crime records of young people with mental_illness with those without mental_illness.	2016
This case linkage study sought to determine whether young people with a formal history of mental_illness were more likely to have official histories of offending and victimisation than young people who had no recorded histories of mental_illness.	2016
Results suggested that young people with a history of mental_illness are particularly vulnerable to violence.	2016

Job loss, debt and financial difficulties are associated with increased risk of mental_illness and suicide in the general population.	2016
The public health, public safety and clinical implications of violent events among adults with mental_illness are significant; however, the causes and consequences of violence and victimization among adults with mental_illness are complex and not well understood, which limits the effectiveness of clinical interventions and risk management strategies.	2016
Available data were integrated from four longitudinal studies of adults with mental_illness.	2016

This article builds a relationship between neurochemistry and Jung's a priori construct of the collective unconscious through an exploration of the psychotic delusions present in severe mental_illness and the psychopharmacological drugs used to treat them.	2016
Jung's postulations of a collective unconscious were rooted in his clinical work with severely mentally ill patients, and he was aware, early on, that severe mental_illness offered an example of the interplay between human biology and our psychological lives.	2016
Current post-Jungian discourse has moved away from addressing severe mental_illness as a means of understanding the continued relevance of Jungian theory amidst advances in the fields of neuroscience.	2016
Narrative analysis of qualitative data on severe mental_illness adds psychic dimension to medical research and offers evidence that the rise and fall of delusional content, replete with archetypal patterns of expression, are related to the presence or absence of psychopharmacological drugs used for the treatment of bipolar disorder.	2016
Given that a significant proportion of adolescents experience mental_illness, there is a need for measures that accurately and reliably screen for mental_disorders in this age group.	2016
The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) F(p) (Infrequency-Psychopathology) scale was developed to measure overreporting in a manner that was minimally confounded by genuine psychopathology, which was a problem with using the MMPI-2 F (Infrequency) scale among patients with severe mental_illness.	2016
Findings allowed for the interpretation that the RAS-P is measuring a particular psychological construct, which is different from symptoms of the mental_illness.	2016
During scanning, the patients evaluated statements about whether an individual's psychosis-related experiences should be described as a mental_illness, and control statements that were also evaluated by healthy controls.	2016

Replication studies are needed to confirm this association, and to further understand the link between mental_illness and recidivism for sexual offenders. (	2016
A number of initiatives are aimed at reducing mental_illness stigma, yet stigma remains a problem in the general population.	2016
A focus on stigma reduction with students is particularly relevant, as students often hold negative attitudes toward mental_illness, have regular contact with persons experiencing mental_health difficulties, and because stigma influences students own help-seeking attitudes and behaviors.	2016
Psychological distress is inherently constructed within contexts and the unique, cultural meaning systems that have developed to understand mental_illness.	2016
Western psychology and psychiatry have, through globalisation and colonial histories, imposed systems of mental_health care and definitions of mental_illness.	2016

Major depressive disorder is a significant mental_illness that is highly likely to recur, particularly after three or more previous episodes.	2016
There was not enough evidence from clinical trials to suggest that CBT focusing on mental_illness reduces suicidal cognitions and behaviors.	2016
Given the current evidence, clinicians should be trained in CBT techniques focusing on suicidal cognitions and behaviors that are independent of the treatment of mental_illness.	2016

This study builds on previous typological research conducted in the general homeless population by focusing on individuals with mental_illness to further delineate typologies within a more homogenous subset of the homeless population.	2017
Individuals with serious mental_illness are at particularly high risk for trauma; however, service environments with which they interact may not always be traumainformed.	2017
With a particular emphasis on the applicability of TIC to individuals with serious mental_illness, this paper identifies key implementation issues and recommends future directions for community psychologists in clarifying the service framework, its adaptation to specific service contexts, and improving delivery through consultation and evaluation.	2017
The current article reviews the literature on sexuality among individuals with a severe mental_illness (SMI) who have experienced homelessness, a topic that has received little attention in the research literature, particularly from a community psychology perspective.	2017
This paper examines the issue of poverty among people with serious mental_illness (SMI), positioning it as a key issue to be confronted by community mental_health systems and practitioners.	2017
This research examined the sustainability of Canada's At Home/Chez Soi Housing First (HF) programs for homeless persons with mental_illness 2 years after the end of the demonstration phase of a large (more than 2000 participants enrolled), fivesite, randomized controlled trial.	2017
We assessed characteristics that may predict outpatient appointment attendance in outpatient medical clinics among patients comorbid for serious mental_illness (SMI) and type 2 diabetes (DM).	2017
Accreditation is viewed against the backdrop of the slow rate of progress in reducing the burden of mental_illness and the changes in clinical psychology training that might help improve this situation.	2017
That said, mental_health professionals play a critical role in assessing their patients for violence risk, counseling about firearm safety, and guiding the creation of rational and evidence-based public policy that can be effective in mitigating violence risk without unnecessarily stigmatizing people with mental_illness.	2017
This article summarizes existing evidence about the interplay among mental_illness, violence, and firearms, with particular attention paid to the role of active symptoms, addiction, victimization, and psychosocial risk factors.	2017
Programming also should address the poverty, mental_illness, and substance use factors that threaten relationship satisfaction/stability and increase HIV risk.	2017
Physical health and life events were more relevant than mental_illness per se, in males aged over 61 years.	2017
Controls were recruited from primary health centres, and were free from serious mental_illness.	2017
Aim of this To evaluate the experience of parents of adolescents who received ECT for severe mental_illness.	2017
Non-adherence to oral psychotropic medications is common in patients with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2017
The study utilized a cross sectional survey design with a sample of 90 participants diagnosed with severe and common mental_illness who had been seeking outpatient psychiatric follow up services.	2017
The participants with common mental_illness were significantly lower on self-reported improvement and higher on moratorium subscale of psychological recovery (as compared to those with severe mental_illness), indicating their struggle in dealing with a sense of loss and despair.	2017
Practitioners need to consider psychoeducational and marketing approaches to engage students, raise awareness of available services, increase understanding of mental_illness and treatments, and reduce stigmatized attitudes.	2017
Participants were cognisant of the need to improve physical health among people with severe mental_illness (SMI); they endorsed, to varying extents, the obligation of PMHS and potential of psychologists, collectively to contribute to this goal through provision of interventions targeting health behaviours.	2017
Given the emphasis on the use of antipsychotic medication for severe mental_illness, it is important to understand family carers perspectives on these medications and their effects on consumers lives.	2017
The familyfocused mental_health intervention, Let's Talk About Children, has positively influenced the lives of families affected by parental mental_illness.	2017
The current study examined a single-session exercise-for-mood intervention against two time-matched comparison conditions in 152 patients with serious mental_illness attending a partial hospital program, a population marked by significant health disparities.	2017
The present study examined the relationship between characteristics associated with personality disorders, substance use, and HIV risk among adults with a history of serious mental_illness.	2017
Participants included 103 adults with antisocial or borderline personality disorder, serious mental_illness, and recent HIV risk behavior.	2017
These results suggest the relationship among serious mental_illness, personality disorder, substance abuse, and gender is complex and merits further study.	2017
Results indicated that three variables, including being single/never married, having comorbid intellectual disability and mental_illness, and having one's conditional release revoked, were negatively related to successful restoration.	2017
We begin by discussing citizenship, and the concept of the common good, in regard to historical conceptions of citizenship, including the historical exclusion of women, people of color, persons with mental_illness, and others.	2017
Like other counties across the nation, Fulton County, GA, has seen a significant increase in the number of arrests of people with serious mental_illness.	2017
While Fulton County has accountability courts, some defendants with mental_illness are not able to take advantage of these options due to their mental_illness rendering them incompetent to understand the expectations required by these courts.	2017
Thus, preliminary findings from the pilot project indicate that referral to the WISE program significantly reduced the burden of excess time in jail associated with having an untreated mental_illness.	2017
Mental health courts (MHCs) are a type of PSC that arose in response to the growing number of persons with mental_illness within the criminal justice system.	2017
Their primary role is to divert individuals with mental_illness from incarceration into psychiatric treatment and to reduce recidivism while improving psychosocial functioning of participants.	2017
Although different in history, philosophy, and program structure, forensic assertive community treatment (FACT) programs serve a similar goal of reducing recidivism and improving functioning in persons with mental_illness who are involved with the criminal justice system.	2017
Some criminal defendants with mental_illness may not be referred to traditional mental_health jail diversion programs because they have a history of noncompliance with treatment, or complex personal circumstances such as homelessness.	2017
These findings must be viewed with caution due to the quasiexperimental design of the study, but it appears that greater attention to criminogenic needs in addition to defendants' mental_illness may help jurisdictions to divert a wider variety of defendants.	2017
The crisis intervention team (CIT) is a tool that can be used to foster prebooking diversion of individuals with mental_illness from the criminal justice system and into community treatment services.	2017
The high prevalence of substance use, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental_illness in the veteran population presents unique public health and social justice challenges.	2017
This is consistent with the concept of the sequential intercept model that seeks to divert offenders with mental_illness from the criminal justice system into treatment.	2017
This article begins with the history of the rise and fall of the state hospitals and subsequent criminalization of persons with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2017
: Music has the potential to be an effective and engaging therapeutic intervention in the treatment of mental_illness.	2017
These results suggest that stigma associated with a diagnosis of mental_illness, and schizophrenia in particular, has negative emotional consequences that may impede recovery, and should be addressed by psychological and social interventions.	2017
Szasz believed mental_illness to be a myth created by society; Cooper believed that the family was an instrument of oppression perpetrating psychological violence on its members; Laing believed that if one studied the specific forms of communication within families of schizophrenics one could make madness intelligible and therefore amenable to some form of psychotherapy.	2017
Individuals with serious mental_illness (SMI) experience significant comorbid chronic pain (CP).	2017
Sixty preservice teachers in a Canadian university participated in a professional development day and completed a survey of their mental_health knowledge, attitudes toward mental_illness, and help-seeking efficacy.	2017
The results showed students who reported experiences of CPA were more likely to report symptoms of mental_illness and negative perceptions of their parents parenting.	2017
At the individual level, parental trauma experiences/mental_illness, substance abuse and history of child abuse were found to be risk factors.	2017
Results from multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that sexual abuse and parental/other family members mental_illness were associated with increased odds of having attempted suicide among both genders, and emotional neglect was also a factor for men.	2017
There is an increasing research interest in conceptualizations of mental_illness, examined in association with helpseeking, stigma and treatment preferences.	2017
Children of parents with a mental_illness are at significant risk of developing a mental_illness.	2017
This risk may be reduced if appropriate interventions are provided that include information and knowledge about mental_illness.	2017
While there are some interventions for children of parents with a mental_illness, research is lacking about the type of mental_health information children need and why they need that knowledge.	2017
This study presents the perspectives of a purposive sample of international research experts in the field of parental mental_illness about the kind of mental_health literacy information children with parents with a mental_illness need.	2017
Twenty-three participants completed a self-constructed short answer questionnaire about the knowledge needs of children of parents with a mental_illness.	2017
If this is done, children of parents with mental_illness may experience myth busting of incorrect information about mental_illness.	2017
Parental mental_illness has the potential to affect children adversely.	2017
These children report a higher risk of developing a mental_illness than other children.	2017
While there are several interventions available to support young people with parents with a mental_illness, there are few online interventions.	2017
This research note aims to further the argument for developing online interventions for children of parents with a mental_illness.	2017
The findings suggest that service worker training in Australia is critical for informing professionals of: the importance of family reputation for collectivist groups; the importance of responding supportively and protectively to child victims who have disclosed to them first; the cross-cultural complexities that surround construals of child safety; educating non-offending mothers about the importance of at least believing their child's disclosure (associated with mediating mental_illness among victims, but also culturally appropriate because it acknowledges the protective role of family cohesion in collectivist cultures and the high motivation to avoid social exclusion the most common reprisal for shaming the family name); exploring acculturation as a possible predictor of disclosure; and the risk of racism being overlooked or minimised.	2017
Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are at increased risk of presenting challenging behaviors and comorbid mental_illness.	2017
It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental_illness on childrens psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) including unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	2017
Boys whose mothers had a history of mental_illness were significantly more likely than girls to be assessed with the DMM-depression modifier.	2017
Understanding stigma will help health and social care professionals to plan interventions aimed at reducing or preventing negative emotional reactions and negative behavioural responses toward stigma, which are known to be associated with mental_illness and particularly depression among this population.	2017
We investigated possible pathways into mental_illness via the combined effects of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), mindfulness, and irrational beliefs.	2017
The stigma of mental_illness hinders treatment use and may exacerbate the already sizable social and psychological burden imposed by mental_illness symptoms.	2017
Despite continuous efforts to reduce mental_illness stigma, negative attitudes have persisted or worsened in the last few decades.	2017
Addressing the conceptual challenges in mental_illness stigma research can help to improve interventions and better serve persons suffering from psychological distress.	2017
Despite many individuals reporting long histories of mental_illness, about 40 of those with schizophrenia had never had any psychiatric treatment and less than 4 were in treatment at the time of the alleged homicide.	2017
There is a wealth of studies of somatic and mental_illness among prisoners, but little on older prisoners and their cognitive aging.	2017
Mental health courts (MHCs) are diversion programs for offenders with mental_illness.	2017
Specialized mental_health courts (MHCs) address the growing problem of defendants with mental_illness cycling through the criminal justice system.	2017
The review firstly explores the relationship between mental_health and urban design, pursuing the role of urban design in both health promotion and illness prevention against the mental_illness epidemics, by conducting a comprehensive literature search; secondly, a systematic literature search is conducted to explore the relationship between urban design and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specifically.	2017
Recent work using social media data has evinced the utility of psycholinguistic features in tracking mood and mental_illness, but Twitter data, which are nonanonymous and short-form by design, have almost exclusively been the subject of analysis.	2017
Some research indicates that peer support is generally helpful to the suicide bereaved, a finding that is reinforced by a large body of emerging research showing that peer support is effective in mental_illness and substance abuse recovery.	2017
We analyzed 61 in-depth interviews with parents, siblings, friends, and ex-partners of 10 young men (aged 1830) with no record of mental_illness, as well as 6 suicide notes, using interpretative phenomenological analysis.	2017
Unlike most other health conditions, the treatment of mental_illness relies on subjective measurement.	2017
In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of such techniques for measuring, modeling, and treating mental_illness and maintaining mental_health.	2017
Studies 1 and 2 investigated how maternal severe mental_illness (SMI) related to mothers mindmindedness (appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments).	2017
Given that the continued use of dysfunctional emotion regulation plays an important role in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, these results highlight the importance of prevention and treatment programs focused on emotion regulation to shield vulnerable adolescents against mental_illness.	2017
Youth (N = 1117) aged 518 were recruited for two studies of mental_illness.	2017
However, little is known about the effects of severe mental_illness on family identity.	2017
The authors carried out this thematic synthesis based on a systematic review of literature on family narratives of severe mental_illness and family identity.	2017
All in all, family identity is transformed by the experience of severe mental_illness.	2017
Expressed emotion (EE) is a measure of a caregiver's critical and emotionally overinvolved (EOI; e.g., intrusive, selfsacrificing) attitudes and behaviors toward a person with a mental_illness.	2017
These trends, which are shared interests of both family therapy and GMH, include collaborative care, a growing emphasis on the importance of culture in understanding and treating mental_health issues, recognition of the ability of families to support or impede recovery from mental_illness, and the use of strengthbased and evidencebased treatments.	2017
Open-source documents were closed coded for criminal justice involvement, domestic violence history, motivation, and offenders mental_illness.	2017
There has been a recent increase in the development of digital self-tracking tools for managing mental_illness.	2017
As a consequence, little is known about the self-tracking practices and needs of individuals living with mental_illness.	2017
This study aimed to understand the explanatory models of the family members of persons suffering from common as well as severe mental_illness.	2017
The notable findings were: healthcare pluralism at institutional, cognitive and structural levels; conflicting explanatory models about mental_illness; and stigma regarding mental_illness.	2017
Rather than actual participation, focusing on the terms and conditions of social exclusion and inclusion can encompass invisible phenomena, such as mental_illness, and bring the concepts closer to underlying social processes.	2017
In many parts of the world family members are the primary caretakers of persons with mental_illness.	2017
Involuntary hospitalization of people with mental_illness raises important ethical and legal concerns worldwide; however, only a handful of studies have investigated the patients perspective in depth.	2017
There is a growing interest regarding the attitudes of medical students towards people with mental_illness, since discrimination and stigma may affect healthcare workers and education should be aimed to improve empathy and attitudes at medical school level.	2017
Students who preferred medical disciplines to surgical ones seemed to be less stigmatizing towards mental_illness.	2017
Our results confirm evidence from the scientific literature about medical students attitudes towards mental_illness and highlight that the improvements in the attitudes increased improving students psychiatric knowledge, both theoretical and practical.	2017
People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to developing mental_illness such as psychosis.	2017
Diversion programs offer opportunities to offenders with substance abuse or mental_illness to attend treatment as an alternative to incarceration.	2017
And while sex offender research has increased over the past several decades, particular attention to those offenders with severe mental_illness remains limited.	2017
Pre-release inmates who were wrapping up their sentence (i.e., no community supervision) and presented with mental_illness and/or substance use disorder were recruited.	2017
Therefore, the International Society of Sport Psychology through this Position Stand provides support to sport psychology researchers, practitioners, sport participants, and stakeholders in understanding: (a) mental_health phenomenon based on continuum-type models outlining mental_illness (prevalence vs. absence) and mental_health in association with peak performance, (b) major findings of research dealing with athletes performance, career and personal (e.g. identity) development in relation to mental_health issues, and (c) interventions aimed at monitoring and maintaining athletes mental_health as well as preventing various forms of mental ill-being.	2017
Despite the high risk of falling for people with severe mental_illness, there is limited falls research in mental_health settings.	2017
The Behavioral Health Laboratory (BHL), a telephone-based mental_health assessment, is a cost-effective approach that can improve mental_illness identification and management.	2017
A cross-sectional study was conducted with English-speaking aging services network (ASN) clients aged 60 years and older in Monroe County, NY who were randomized to a BHL interview either in-person ( = 55) or by telephone ( = 53).There was strong evidence of equivalence between telephone and in-person interviews for depressive disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, drug misuse, psychosis, PTSD, mental_illness symptom severity, and five of the six questions assessing suicidality.	2017
Dissemination of the BHL has the potential to strengthen the linkages between primary care, mental_healthcare, and social service providers and improve identification and management of those with late-life mental_illness.	2017
A sample of 306 elderly patients 65 years, of both sexes, diagnosed with mental_illness (ICD-10 criteria), was recruited from inpatient/outpatient settings in a Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, in northern Portugal.	2017
In an ABABA singlecase research study of 3 incarcerated offenders with mental_illness, repeated exposure to the pilot Adult Recidivism Reduction Alternatives (ARRAY) group counseling intervention was an effective or very effective treatment for anxiety, depression, and associated somatic symptoms.	2017
People who suffer from severe mental_illness often present with histories of abuse during childhood.	2017
This study analyzes the effects of stressful childhood experiences, a proxy for trauma, on the frequency of alcohol consumption and the utilization of health care services in a population of people with severe mental_illness.	2017
There were 111 men (mean age: 35 years) and 72 women (mean age: 40.0 years) with severe mental_illness that were recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics in New York City.	2017
Childhood abuse is prevalent in people with severe mental_illness and is related to an increased alcohol consumption.	2017
A number of sociocultural risk and protective factors have been suggested to contribute to these group differences, such as salience of physical illnesses, discrimination, stigma toward mental_illness, religiosity, and ethnic identity.	2017
Overall, the strongest evidence was found for ethnic identity and stigma toward mental_illness as factors underlying group differences in anxiety.	2017
Ethnic identity and stigma toward mental_illness consistently differed by racial group and were associated with anxiety in African Americans.	2017
Stigma toward mental_illness may decrease African Americans willingness to report anxiety symptoms, reducing overall prevalence rates but increasing the severity of treated cases.	2017
Much more research is required, but the findings of this review suggest that future studies should put particular emphasis on stigma toward mental_illness and ethnic identity as important factors in understanding African American anxiety outcomes.	2017
We discuss practical and theoretical implications as they pertain to improving the experiences and wellbeing of employees with mental_illness.	2017
Hospital patients with serious mental_illness (SMI) have high rates of smoking.	2017
We aimed to determine the relationship between a family history (in first-degree relatives) of psychosis (FHP) or of any mental_illness (FHM), and the clinical features (including cannabis use) of first episode early onset psychosis (EOP).	2017
Forty-five gender and age matched controls with incident non-psychotic mental_illness were recruited from the same clinical sites.	2017
However, adolescents with a non-psychotic mental_illness (controls) were significantly more likely to have a family history of non-psychotic mental_illness (EOP = 13; controls = 47, p = 0.001).	2017
Comorbid substance use in adolescents with mental_illness is often an indicator of poor treatment outcome.	2017
This study aims to determine the prevalence of, and associated risk factors for, substance use in adolescents with mental_illness attending a mental_health service.	2017
Substance use was more significant in older adolescents and those with severe mental_illness.	2017
Due to public stigma or selfstigma and shame, many adolescents with mental_illness (MI) struggle with the decision whether to disclose their MI to others.	2017
Fetal exposure to infectious and noninfectious diseases may influence early childhood developmental functioning, on the path to later mental_illness.	2017
Here, we investigated the effects of in utero exposure to maternal infection and noninfectious diseases during pregnancy on offspring developmental vulnerabilities at age 5 years, in the context of estimated effects for early childhood exposures to infectious and noninfectious diseases and maternal mental_illness.	2017
Child and maternal exposures to infectious or noninfectious diseases were determined from the NSW Ministry of Health Admitted Patients Data Collection (APDC) and maternal mental_illness exposure was derived from both APDC and Mental Health Ambulatory Data collections.	2017
Among the physical disease exposures, maternal infectious diseases during pregnancy and early childhood infection conferred the largest associations with developmental vulnerabilities at age 5 years; maternal noninfectious illness during pregnancy also retained small but significant associations with developmental vulnerabilities even when adjusted for other physical and mental_illness exposures and covariates known to be associated with early childhood development (e.g., child's sex, socioeconomic disadvantage, young maternal age, prenatal smoking).	2017
Among all exposures examined, maternal mental_illness first diagnosed prior to childbirth conferred the greatest odds of developmental vulnerability at age 5 years.	2017
Intervention strategies aimed at preventing or reducing exposure to traditional childhood risk factors for psychopathology may reduce the burden of mental_illness in adult survivors of prematurity.	2017
Similarly, patients with histories of substance abuse and patients with family histories of mental_illness had higher likelihoods of reporting histories of child sexual abuse compared to patients without histories of substance abuse or family histories of mental_illness, respectively.	2017
Participants believed that their abusers had learned to be abusive due to their own victimization or exposure to pornography, were abusive to establish dominance over them, or had some undisclosed mental_illness.	2017
Although there is an abundance of literature focusing on social support for children and adults with mental_illness, there is a paucity of research examining social support for individuals diagnosed with childhood and adolescent onset schizophrenia.	2017
As parents age, well siblings are often asked to assume caregiving responsibilities for their brother or sister with mental_illness.	2017
We examined well siblings attitudes toward self-care and caregiving for their sibling with mental_illness (self- and sibling-care) using two cross-sectional samples.	2017
The first sample of well siblings (N = 242) was used to examine the psychometric properties of the self- and sibling-care measure (SSCM), designed to assess the degree to which siblings prioritize their own needs and the needs of their sibling with mental_illness.	2017
Child mental_illness impacts the entire family, and previous research has consistently found that parenting children with mental_health disorders is psychologically distressing.	2017
We examined whether among mothers with any mental_illness, mothers utilization of mental_health treatment was associated with greater likelihood of their adolescent children who experienced an MDE receiving mental_health treatment.	2017
During the preschool years (35 years), children living with parental mental_illness are more at risk of various adverse developmental outcomes, compared to other children.	2017
Early childhood services are opportune settings for prevention and early intervention strategies that may support preschool children living with parental mental_illness.	2017
Depression is a common mental_illness experienced by young people.	2017
Psychologists have developed distinct approaches toward understanding and treating mental_illness, rooted in divergent epistemology.	2017
Less is known, however, about how these findings apply to a particularly vulnerable population, individuals with severe mental_illness (SMI).	2017
Depression, a mental_illness consisting of profound sadness, fatigue, and irritability, as well as low motivation, poor academic performance, and suicidal behaviors, is one of the top presenting concerns for students who seek help.	2017
However, these gains were not universal; for instance, participants were less likely to report positive outcomes at followup if they started MAP with a serious mental_illness, made relatively small gains in work skills, or did not seek mental_health treatment during the 6 months after they completed MAP.	2017
This is important for people who live with mental_illness.	2017
This study aimed to determine whether key basic psychological needs influence resilience among people with a lived experience of mental_illness.	2017
A total of 159 consumers with a lived experience of mental_illness completed selfreport surveys measuring resilience and the basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) espoused in selfdetermination theory.	2017
Reconnecting or establishing social relationships within ones community is important for people living with mental_illness.	2017
Many U.S. military veterans experience difficulties reintegrating into civilian society after their military service, especially veterans with chronic mental_illness.	2017
As part of a larger experimental trial, this study piloted the Yale Citizenship Scale on a sample of 199 U.S. veterans with chronic mental_illness in Connecticut and Houston.	2017
Veterans with chronic mental_illness reported moderate scores on each factor and the total scale.	2017
Together, the findings demonstrated that the Yale Citizenship Scale can be adapted for use for U.S. veterans with chronic mental_illness and that helping veterans achieve high levels of citizenship may an important social and clinical goal.	2017
This study investigated predictors of selfdisclosure among college students with mental_illness.	2017
Participants were 1,393 current college students with a mental_illness at 5 universities.	2017
Findings of the analysis reveal that public stigma is associated with mental_illness disclosure among college students in part because it is associated with an increased perceived stress burden, particularly among men.	2017
The authors reported the findings from a correlational investigation examining the relationship between school counselors' (N = 333) selfstigma of mental_illness, helpseeking behaviors, burnout, stress, and life satisfaction.	2017
The authors used a path analysis to test a hypothesized causal framework that selfstigma of mental_illness contributed to helpseeking behaviors, which contributed to stress and burnout.	2017
Integrating indigenous cultural knowledge into conceptualizing mental_illness offers fruitful avenues to better contextualize mental_health.	2017
The purpose of this study was to use ethnographic data to develop an understanding of what Ovambo men and women living in a rural area of Northern Namibia believe about mental_illness.	2017
The first category offers insight into a culturally embedded way of identifying mental_illness in Ovambo culture.	2017
The second category includes several subcategories oriented to the etiology of mental_illness in Ovambo culture.	2017
Etiological beliefs about mental_illness, eemwengu as a culturally embedded construct, and social control in the beliefs about psychological distress in Ovambo culture are discussed.	2017
Mental health providers should routinely consider FASD in the diagnosis and management of mental_illness and developmental_disorders.	2017
Adults with co-occurring mental_illness and substance use disorders have poor outcomes in important quality of life areas, including hospitalization, incarceration, employment, and community housing.	2017
Research-supported intervention IDDT was not designed with peer services, provided by people with lived experience with mental_illness, but the practice has been altered to include peers.	2017
The CEBP provides technical assistance for service innovations that improve quality of life and other outcomes for people with mental_illness or co-occurring mental_illness and substance use disorders.	2017
The goal of the present study was to understand how mothers perceive and experience barriers to effective help for their violent child with mental_illness.	2017
Data from ethnographic interviews with 26 self-identified mothers of violent children with mental_illness were analyzed using grounded theory and focused coding.	2017
Our study identified three themes that represent barriers to help: denial of mental_illness and severity of violence by treatment providers, extended family, and non-family members; limited access to quality treatment and supports; and a recurring cycle from optimism to hopelessness.	2017
The results further show that a significant number of the patricides were triggered by offender mental_illness.	2017
In this way, they are a multiply marginalized group, which has implications not only for their risk of mental_illness, but also for their access to mental_health care, and the quality of care they receive.	2017
Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental_illness patients anymore in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization.	2017
While the characteristics of this sample mirror those of Australian queers generally, they also have slightly higher rates of mental_illness and are far more likely to state they have no religion.	2017
The goal of the study is to investigate whether positive mental_health complements mental_illness within a theoretically informed (the dual-continua model) and psychometrically tested (the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form) framework.	2017
Results show that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Canadians have substantially lower rates of positive mental_health and are more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental_illness, with the disparities between health and illness being the most pronounced among lesbians and bisexual females.	2017
This study was conducted to examine recent Korean perspectives on homosexuality by comparing attitudes toward mental_illness, crime, friendship, and civil rights related to homosexual people in 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014.	2017
This approach provides a mechanism for incorporating genetic predisposition into theory-driven multivariate etiological models of psychological constructs such as personality and mental_illness.	2017
Australian publicly funded mental_health services play a significant role in the assessment and management of mental_illness for people with intellectual disability.	2017
PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to describe a feasibility study into the development and pilot of a psychoeducational group for people with intellectual disability and co-morbid mental_disorder (including mental_illness and personality disorder) within forensic settings.	2017
An open group on a 16-bedded ward for individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disability and co-morbid mental_illness was delivered over a six-week period.	2017
It also stimulated engagement, discussion about mental_disorders including mental_illness, personality disorder and intellectual disabilities.	2017
Using latent class analysis, subjects were assigned to one of four ACE classes: (a) minimal childhood abuse (56), (b) physical/verbal abuse of both child and mother with household alcohol abuse (13), (c) verbal and physical abuse of child with household mental_illness (12), and (d) verbal abuse only (19).	2017
The question we attempt to answer in this study is why some individuals with serious mental_illness engage in repeated violence, while others do not.	2017
Therefore, dispositional factors would theoretically put individuals with serious mental_illness at stable risk for repeated violence because these factors remain relatively stable over time.	2017
In fact, perhaps individuals with mental_illness repeatedly engage in violence because they have a dispositional trait (like impulsivity, for example) that puts them at stable risk for repeated violence.	2017

The threshold requirement for establishing the defence of pathological criminal incapacity entails that the accused at the time of the commission of the offence should have suffered from a mental_illness or mental defect.	2017
Once it is established that the accused suffered from a mental_illness or mental defect at the time of the commission of the offence, an assessment is conducted to determine whether the illness or defect rendered the accused either incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of the act or of acting in accordance with such appreciation.	2017
The problem that inevitably arises during the assessment of the defence relates to the fact that the terms mental_illness and mental defect are not defined.	2017

Some strategies to improve mental_health among college students used in the US may help to reduce stigma toward mental_illness in Vietnam.	2018
The current sample consisted of 60 family caregivers of patients with major mental_illness from the in-patient and out-patient departments of NIMHANS, assessed on the Orientation towards Mental Illness Scale (OMI).	2018
Hopelessness and hypo-functioning, relating to the factor of after-effects of mental_illness show no significant difference.	2018
Current initiatives need to be matched with specific and sustained efforts to reduce stigma associated with mental_illness which have persisted unchanged.	2018
The purpose was to characterize public perceptions in Japan of mental_illness and how they related to stigma-related attitudes for the same.	2018
We compared respondents stigma-related attitudes and perceptions toward mental_illness between vignettes.	2018
The aim of the study was to develop a thematic model of youth recovery utilising the experiences of young people with severe mental_illness.	2018
Media initiatives do lead to improved mental_health literacy and a reduction of the stigma around mental_illness but they also need to distinguish between available services, for example, counselling and psychological services.	2018
Individuals who have lived with childhood parental mental_illness are at increased risk of developing mental_health concerns.	2018
Yet there is limited knowledge about how a persons childhood experiences of parental mental_illness may influence their subsequent parenting roles.	2018
This narrative study generated parenting narratives of adult children who had lived with childhood parental mental_illness.	2018
However, adult childrens worries in relation to their child/ren developing mental_illness may be associated with their own experiences of childhood parental mental_illness.	2018
Our findings suggest strong comorbidity of genital herpes with injecting heroin use, Hepatitis C, sexual violence, incarceration, and mental_illness.	2018
In this article we propose a mitigation approach in those capital murder cases where traditional mitigation themes such as mental_illness or low IQ are not present.	2018
Section focuses on the changing understanding of mental_illness and how neuroscience is pushing law towards a functional capacityandability model and away from a diagnostic cutoff model.	2018
Recent U.S. Supreme Court opinions have given rise to the question of whether persons suffering from a severe mental_illness should be categorically exempt from the death penalty.	2018
We then present our findings on how actual capital jurors respond to and discuss engaging with evidence of mental_illness, as drawn from indepth interviews collected as part of the Capital Jury Project.	2018
Existing research reveals that in the controlled situation of an experiment, evidence of mental_illness is associated with votes for life rather than death.	2018
Similarly, actual capital jurors in our study reported anticipating that evidence of mental_illness would make them less likely to vote for death.	2018
However, those jurors who dealt with mental_illness in their case appeared to be less sensitive: they describe such evidence as having been overshadowed by the brutality of the crime; as indicative of the defendant's future dangerousness; as being confusing, especially as presented by experts; and as a manipulative attempt on the part of the defendant to trick the jurors.	2018
The findings suggest that capital jurors cannot reliably comprehend and account for evidence of mental_illness and thus offer a compelling reason for the Court to exempt those suffering from a mental_illness from the death penalty.	2018
Past mental_illness, partner physical abuse, and number of convictions were predictive of greater TBI severity.	2018
Conversely, mental_illness can impede the acquisition and retention of suitable work as well as the ability to fully engage in career development.	2018

Among children investigated for maltreatment, those with parents experiencing mental_illness or substance abuse are more likely to be placed out-of-home; however, little is known about why these children are at greater risk.	2018
Using a sample of 2488 Structured Decision Making assessments administered in San Francisco county from 2011 to 2015, we identified a profile of safety threats that accounts for why workers are more likely to determine children of parents with mental_illness and/or substance abuse unsafe in the home.	2018
Eight percent of assessments in our sample involved parents with current mental_illness only and 10 had comorbid substance abuse.	2018
The odds of an unsafe determination more than doubled among parents with mental_illness (OR = 2.52, p < 0.001) and were nearly tenfold higher among parents with comorbid substance abuse (OR = 9.62, p < 0.001).	2018
Three safety threats accounted for all of the effect of parental mental_illness on safety determination: caretaking impairment due to emotional stability/developmental status/cognitive deficiency (57), failure to meet a childs immediate needs (30), and threats of harm (14).	2018
Three safety threats accounted for 55 of the effect of comorbid mental_illness and substance abuse on safety determination: failure to meet a childs immediate needs (21), presence of a drug-exposed infant (21), and caretaking impairment due to emotional stability/developmental status/cognitive deficiency (14).	2018
Parental mental_illness was associated with all disorders however, with ORs ranging from 2.20 for mood disorders to 4.07 for anxiety disorders.	2018
The highest PAF values were revealed for parental mental_illness and sexual abuse.	2018
We assessed bias in reporting of maltreatment with respect to womens experiences of adverse perinatal outcomes in a cohort of 230 women enrolled in studies of maternal mental_illness.	2018
At study enrolment, women from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N=3612) retrospectively reported: lack of maternal care, maternal overprotection, parental mental_illness, household dysfunction, sexual abuse, physical and emotional abuse, and neglect in childhood.	2018
The odds of the maltreated group being assigned a code for mental_illness was 2.69 times higher than the odds for the comparison group, with large differences in mood and anxiety disorders and suicidality.	2018
If left untreated, these can be risk factors for mental_illness and disability in adulthood.	2018
Findings show that common correlates of crime such as gender, previous delinquency, mental_illness and placement instability while in care significantly increase the odds of having a felony adjudication and criminal involvement.	2018
We examine also the accounts of thirteen parents living with mental_illness or addiction who have been involved in child custody investigations in Aotearoa New Zealand.	2018
With regard to residentially placed children, child mental_illness specifically negatively affected their prognosis.	2018
In this article, I used newly released data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), a recent and nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized children ages 0 to 17, to examine the relationship between parental incarceration and exposure to six additional ACEs: parental divorce or separation, parental death, household member abuse, violence exposure, household member mental_illness, and household member substance problems.	2018
1998) to today, the Centers for Disease Control (2016) reports well over 50 studies that link ACEs to adult health conditions such as cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and mental_illness.	2018
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a difficult-to-treat mental_illness associated with dangerous behavioral symptomatology.	2018

Depression is a mental_illness.	2018
Twenty participants were exposed to 15 min of audio-visual deprivation and performed: a visuo-tactile interaction task measuring their PPS; a heartbeat perception task measuring interoceptive accuracy; and a series of questionnaires related to self-perception and mental_illness.	2018
Taken together, the findings argue for a relationship between the malleability of PPS, interoceptive accuracy, and an inclination toward aberrant ideation often associated with mental_illness.	2018
The neighbor emphasizes that the missing professor may have suffered some mental_illness or other tragedy, but has no other viable leads aside from the phrase and notes and begs your expert advice on the topic.	2018
We discuss how counselling is best understood as representing two distinct traditions premised on either a pedagogical or a mental_illness discourse.	2018
Young people's vulnerability to developing mental_illness makes it important to understand therapeutic change, integrating the views of both young people and their therapists, to improve treatment effectiveness.	2018
Developmental typologies regarding age of onset of violence and offending have not routinely taken account of the role of serious mental_illness (SMI), and whether age of onset of offending in relation to onset of illness impacts on the manifestation of offending over the life course.	2018
External validation of the classes demonstrated that those with a younger age onset of serious mental_illness and offending were characterised by higher levels of static risk factors and criminogenic need than those whose involvement in both mental_health and criminal justice systems was delayed to later life.	2018
Interventions for offenders with mental_illness have tended to be confined to treatment of illness, with the expectation that symptom reduction will be accompanied by reduced criminal recidivism, but recent evidence suggests that other treatment targets may be more effective against recidivism.	2018
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a cognitive skills programme (Reasoning and Rehabilitation 2: Short Version for Adults [R&R2]) among offenders with mental_illness.	2018
Incarcerated offenders with serious mental_illness (N = 101) were randomly assigned to R&R2 or TAU alone.	2018
Community corrections professionals may employ shared decision making (SDM) in many ways with those they supervise who have serious mental_illness (SMI).	2018
Results revealed that several individual-level factors predicted odds for attempted suicide, such as inmate characteristics/demographics, prison experiences, having a serious mental_illness, and symptoms of mental_health issues.	2018
Mainstream media and public figures are often criticized for readily attributing terrorism committed by White perpetrators to mental_illness, while attributing the same behavior committed by non-Whites to ideological motivation.	2018
Using a data-driven reverse-correlation approach, we show that attributing terrorism to mental_illness results in a phenotypically more White mental representation of the perpetrator as compared with attributing terrorism to ideology or providing no information about its motivation.	2018
Importantly, we show that, because terrorists who are described as being motivated by mental_illness are perceived as more White than those motivated by ideology, they are subsequently judged as less guilty for alleged terrorist activities.	2018
Recommendations for supervising offenders with mental_illness have evolved from a narrow focus on treating psychopathology to an integration of mental_health treatment and correctional interventions.	2018
Probation officers likely have inflated perceptions of risk for offenders with mental_illness, which may result in improper risk assessment and misinformed risk management practices.	2018
In a sample of 89 probation officers, we examined perceptions of risk for probationers with and without mental_illness and explored whether stigmatizing attitudes toward mental_illness affect perceptions of risk and risk management strategies.	2018
Officers did not overestimate risk for offenders with mental_illness, and stigma toward mental_illness bore little influence on risk ratings and case management decisions.	2018
However, officers did rate the offender with mental_illness as higher risk than the nondisordered offender and chose more punitive responses to a violation he committeddespite being informed that the offenders were of the same risk classification.	2018
Results of the study indicate gender-specific factors, such as mental_illness symptoms and victimization history, are demonstrative of risk of reoffense in women who sexually offend.	2018
We examined the predictive properties of the Level of Service InventoryOntario Revision (LSI-OR) in a sample of 604 provincially incarcerated men with mental_illness from a correctional mental_health facility followed up nearly 2 years after release.	2018
Among people with mental_illness, stigma experiences can increase suicidality, and suicidality itself is associated with negative stereotypes.	2018
Suicide attempt survivors experience both mental_illness stigma and suicide stigma, which could contribute to their increased risk for completed suicide.	2018
Our findings suggest that both mental_illness stigma and suicide stigma can contribute to suicidality among people with mental_illness in general, and in suicide attempt survivors specifically.	2018
Mothers have increased mental_illness such as anxiety and depression after the death of a child.	2018
With interquartile range increases in nighttime noise, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for suicide death was significantly increased: 1.32 (95 confidence interval [CI]: 1.021.70) for younger adults, 1.43 (95 CI: 1.012.02) for older adults, and 1.55 (95 CI: 1.102.19) for adults with mental_illness.	2018
In the penalized regression spline models, the HRs for suicide death were gradually increased with environmental noise levels, and the risk was the highest for adults with mental_illness.	2018
The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI-S), which is designed to assess the caregivers appraisal of the impact of caring for a relative with a serious mental_illness.	2018

This research engaged consumers with severe and persistent mental_illness receiving services in the public mental_health sector in creating a comprehensive list of 110 needed community services and supports, then individually sorting and rating these items.	2018
Within the resulting concept map generated by Concept System software and as interpreted by the study participants, successfully living in the community is actualized when there is an outer layer of support regarding basic needs; financial means; individualized, comprehensive and available services; competent and caring staff; community education; legal rights enforcement; and social change directed at dismantling the discrimination and stigma associated with mental_illness.	2018
Policy makers and family practitioners who are invested in building healthy families may find it valuable to screen for and treat mental_illness in the context of creating programs to increase cooperative coparenting.	2018
Intergroup contact is the leading strategy for reducing the stigma associated with mental_illness.	2018
In total, 133 participants engaged in E-contact with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia (intergroup E-contact), E-contact with a person without a mental_illness (intragroup E-contact), or no contact.	2018
Research suggests that stigma impacts help-seeking behaviour and health outcomes for people affected by mental_illness.	2018
This study compared the attitudes of Australian non-governmental organisation support workers towards people with mental_illness with those of other health professionals.	2018
Results indicated that non-governmental organisation support workers held more positive attitudes towards people with mental_illness than those of general practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists measured in prior research.	2018
Maternal mental_illness and functioning improved during the admission and were positively associated with longer inpatient duration and no illicit substance use.	2018
In comparison with other studies, the four most common ACE categories among DSPs (i.e., divorce, emotional abuse, mental_illness, and substance abuse) were the same, however, DSPs in the present study had a higher average ACE score and nearly twice the percentage of persons having an ACE score of four or more.	2018
In a world of busyness bordering on madness (referring here to fanatical and foolish behaviour and not to serious mental_illness), technological dominance, and constant, unreflective activity, a renewed spirituality of the Sabbath is essential for a flourishing, fulfilling and spiritual life, for both children and adults.	2018
Background/Objective: The Devaluation of Consumer Families Scale (DCFS) is commonly used to measure perceived stigma towards family members of people with mental_illness.	2018
The DCFS-TW has decent psychometric properties and is suitable for health professionals to measure perceived stigma towards family members of people with mental_illness.	2018
We aimed to identify the most common domains of internalized stigma of mental_illness and to test the hypothesis that people with more severe mood disorders evidence more internalized stigma than those with less severe disorders.	2018
Contrasting findings in Western countries, those with family history of mental_illness trended toward more internalized stigma.	2018
We conclude that anti-stigma interventions should focus on reducing social withdrawal and stereotype endorsement, especially for those with more severe mood disorders, males, less educated individuals, and those with family history of mental_illness.	2018
This review aims to discuss the burden of mental_illness in terms of economic cost, family burden, disability and unemployment in India.	2018

This paper analyses job satisfaction and differences in factors affecting it among workers with an intellectual disability and mental_illness (MI) depending on their work regime [special employment regime (SER) or occupational service (OS)].	2018
Ontological addiction theory (OAT) is a novel metaphysical model of psychopathology and posits that human beings are prone to forming implausible beliefs concerning the way they think they exist, and that these beliefs can become addictive leading to functional impairments and mental_illness.	2018
OAT provides a novel perspective on addiction, the factors that underlie mental_illness, and how beliefs concerning selfhood are shaped and reified.	2018
Research on college substance use and mental_illness is limited and inconsistent.	2018
The most commonly reported type of childhood adversity was having a household member with a mental_illness (16), with the most commonly reported ACES category being psychological abuse (17).	2018
Importantly, youth may display symptoms of mental_illness without co-occurring psychosocial impairments, and the reverse may be true.	2018
Although research suggests that various familial factors and the parentchild relationship are important for the adjustment to college, less is known about how a parent with a mental_illness impacts the challenges that accompany the transition to college.	2018
This mixed methods study examined differences among college students (N = 196, age range 1830 years) with and without a parent with a mental_illness with regard to general psychological adjustment, college adjustment, coping, and the parentchild relationship.	2018
Participants with a parent with a mental_illness experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety when compared to emerging adults without a parent with mental_illness.	2018
There was a marginally significant difference in the use of coping styles between emerging adults with and without a parent with a mental_illness.	2018
Furthermore, participants with a parent with a mental_illness experienced higher levels of homesickness and college negative affect compared to emerging adults without a parent with mental_illness.	2018
Qualitative analyses comparing freshmen with and without a parent with a mental_illness showed that freshmen with a parent with mental_illness were more likely to describe familial homesickness as a problem in their transition to college.	2018
Freshmen with a father with a mental_illness were less likely to describe their father as a positive influence on their college adjustment when compared to freshmen without a father with a mental_illness.	2018
The findings further support the importance of investigating the influence of having a parent with a mental_illness on the transition to college for research and clinical practice.	2018
Considerable research documents that even young children possess stigma about mental_illness, which may affect how they evaluate peers with mental_health conditions.	2018
Prenatal mental_illness is a significant public health issue with intergenerational consequences.	2018
The results of the face validity checks revealed that the positive subscales seem to be well in line with the protective nature of self-compassion as they were mainly associated with cognitive coping and healthy functioning, whereas the negative subscales were chiefly associated with psychopathological symptoms and mental_illness.	2018
Interactions with animals represent a promising way to reduce the burden of childhood mental_illness on a large scale.	2018
Results extend previous research describing stigma towards mental_illness and suggest a large negative bias towards NSSI.	2018
Based on intergroup contact theory, a proposed comprehensive model of attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help was tested, including both potential barriers to mental_health help-seeking (i.e., public stigma and self-stigma of seeking help, prejudicial and essentialist beliefs about mental_illness, intergroup anxiety) and potential facilitators (i.e., direct and extended contact with persons with mental_illness).	2018
Path analysis showed that direct (but not extended) contact with mental_illness, by reducing intergroup anxiety, led to less negative beliefs about mental_illness and weaker essentialist beliefs about mental_illness (the latter being directly and positively associated with negative beliefs about mental_illness).	2018
Moreover, less negative beliefs about mental_illness, by reducing perceptions of self (but not public) stigma of seeking psychological help, were related to more positive attitudes towards help-seeking.	2018
Carers of people with mental_illness frequently report interpersonal difficulties in their caring relationship, and experiential avoidance likely contributes to these problems.	2018
The authors describe research on the selfstigma of mental_illness and help seeking, mental_health literacy, and health outcomes in an integrated care medical center.	2018
Results revealed that selfstigma of mental_illness and selfstigma of seeking help had an inverse relationship with mental_health literacy.	2018
Using a quasiexperimental, prepost test design of 196 persons diagnosed with serious mental_illness, the authors compared the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral and primary health care (IBPH) treatment approach vs. a treatmentasusual approach over a 12month period.	2018
Adolescent males who have experienced violence in childhood are more likely to report poorer educational outcomes and long-term physical health, while female victims are at higher risk of mental_illness.	2018
The results suggest that interventions for problem gambling and/or depression need to focus on promoting more adaptive coping skills among more at-risk young adults, and such interventions should be tailored in relation to specific subtypes of comorbid mental_illness.	2018
Doctors, including general practitioners, experience higher levels of mental_illness than the general population.	2018
Participants located this danger in sexual expression itself or within individuals who, because of mental_illness, lacked the autonomy required to successfully engage in safe sex.	2018
Regardless of whether a person agrees with his or her diagnosis, persons labeled with mental_illness sometimes internalize the discrimination and stigma that they encounter.	2018
Points of convergence include the inevitability of a diagnostic system when working with (severe) mental_illness, the importance of going beyond signs and symptoms in capturing the unique characteristics of the person, the focus on humanistic values, particularly the emphasis on a collaborative assessment and on human strengths, in the diagnostic process, and the role of future-oriented thinking in diagnosis.	2018
Evidence-based psychotherapy is mainly based on nosological systems of mental_illness and the biomedical model rather than on social structuring of mental_health problems.	2018
This article reports on an ongoing community outreach project that gave people the opportunity to reflect on and share their thoughts about the medical-mental_illness-diagnostic model and its impact on their lives.	2018
Results from over 1,000 surveys indicate that mental_illness diagnosis is viewed as a necessary evil at best, and an isolating and destructive practice at worst.	2018
The baby was the product of a pregnancy complicated by maternal mental_illness, homelessness, alcohol and drug exposure, lack of prenatal care, and a complicated delivery that required a 12-day hospital stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.	2018
Care should be taken to improve adherence and access to care to avoid possible future serious violence especially in female patients with a high burden of mental_illness like schizophrenia or severe mood disorders.	2018
Research has consistently demonstrated that people diagnosed with serious mental_illness (SMI) are at increased risk for violent ideation and behavior (VIB) and that this is especially the case for SMI patients with comorbid substance use disorders (SUD).	2018
In this paper, the author, who is a single mother of a young man with mental_illness, describes her sons first psychotic break.	2018
In sharing her story, she reminds other caregivers of people with mental_illness that they are not alone.	2018
She makes sense of her experience with findings from the literature about posttraumatic stress among family caregivers of people with chronic illness and explores the implications for caregivers, practitioners, and scholars of mental_illness, trauma, and loss.	2018
Social support in marriage may be associated with reduced risk for mental_illness.	2018
Protective effects of social support in marriage against mental_illness are longlasting, and sometimes differ by gender.	2018
In 2009 two cases of developmental FAS (dFAS) were described in whom the disorder was detected in an early stage of their speech-language development in the absence of brain damage or mental_illness.	2018
The current Internet study evaluated these three facets of stigma in a general sample of 591 adults by comparing ratings of public perception for HD, OCD, serious mental_illness (SMI), substance use disorders (SUD), and those in jail.	2018
As predicted, the proactive scale corresponded with lower criminal risk, older age of first conviction, and decreased odds of prior substance misuse and mental_illness, whereas the reactive scale corresponded with higher criminal risk, earlier age of first conviction, greater odds of prior substance misuse and mental_illness, and more evidence of subsequent arrest.	2018
This article introduces the Inventory of Problems (IOP)a new, computerized, 181-item tool designed to discriminate bona fide from feigned mental_illness and cognitive impairmentand presents the development and validation of its focal, feigning scale, the False Disorder Score (IOPFDS).	2018
The initial sample included (a) 211 patients and 64 offenders who took the IOP under standard conditions, and (b) 210 community volunteers and 64 offenders who feigned mental_illness.	2018
Disinhibition was associated with a history of abuse in childhood, suicidal behavior, internalizing dysfunction, problems associated with alcohol and drug use, family history of mental_illness, prison disciplinary reports for violence, number of previous criminal charges, and anger.	2018
Results indicated that the group with subthreshold BPD features had more severe mental_illness and poorer social and occupational functioning.	2018
This article in the field of bibliotherapy investigates how participation in a reading circle can contribute to psychological well-being in people with mental_illness such as long-term depression and anxiety.	2018
Police officers are both at risk of exposure to trauma and experiencing PTSD and are more likely to come into contact with people with mental_illness than community members.	2018
Endorsement of negative stereotypes about people with mental_illness was higher among police officers than the general population.	2018
Contrary to what was expected, officers meeting criteria for current PTSD endorsed more stigma about mental_illness, even when controlling for common demographic predictors of stigma, including gender and knowing someone with a mental_illness.	2018
Findings have important implications for the training of police officers regarding mental_illness.	2018
A long duration of untreated mental_illness (DUI) has been found to be associated with negative long-term outcomes.	2018
Although it is widely accepted that mental_illnesses affect millions of people worldwide, there is still disagreement among scholars about the facts of mental_illness.	2018
The orthodox position is that mental_illness is a fact; critics argue that it is a myth.	2018
Thomas Szasz was perhaps the most influential critic of mental_illness while Albert Ellis was one of the most influential psychotherapists of the twentieth century.	2018
Yet, they disagreed about the facts of mental_illness.	2018
Ellis argued that mental_illness is a fact; Szasz argued that mental_illness is a metaphor that we have mistaken for a fact.	2018
While Ellis argued that mental_illness is a convenient label for people who are a danger to themselves and others, Szasz argued that mental_illness is a metaphor for moral problems in living and involuntary institutionalization and treatment are crimes against humanity.	2018
This paper, then, revisits the debate between Ellis and Szasz on the vexed topic of mental_illness.	2018
Specifically, we explore whether White men are disproportionately framed as mentally ill, and what narratives media tend to invoke when covering mass shootings through the lens of mental_illness as opposed to other explanatory frames.	2018
Quantitative findings show that Whites and Latinos are more likely to have their crime attributed to mental_illness than Blacks.	2018
Higher scores on the negative subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the general subscale of the PANSS, the total scores on the PANSS, and a family history of mental_illness were significantly associated with sexual dysfunction.	2018
The clinical literature has consistently documented that men seek help for mental_health less often than do women, although they suffer from mental_illness at comparable rates.	2018
This gender discrepancy in help-seeking may be explained by the social psychological literature on traditional masculinity, which has been associated with stigmatizing thoughts about mental_illness and opposition to help-seeking.	2018
Masculinity did not in fact predict stigmatizing and defensive thoughts about mental_illness; rather, men's femininity emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor of these reactions.	2018
We examined the effectiveness of Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment (IDDT) on substance use in severe mental_illness outpatients with substance use disorders.	2018
Patients hospitalised with severe mental_illness (SMI) have poor physical health.	2018
People with severe mental_illness (SMI) can benefit from meeting the recommended guidelines on physical activity; yet meeting these guidelines for this population is challenging in practice.	2018
There is substantive evidence for the importance of physical activity (PA) for people with mental_illness (MI).	2018

We suggest that a child psychologist or psychiatrist should be on patient care teams and be attentive to parental stress, impairments, or impediments to self-care, and signs of emergency of mental_illness in this setting of medical trauma.	2018
Over the past century, the dominant model for addressing mental_illness has been the treatment of individuals, largely by individual therapists who assume the availability of individual psychological resources.	2018
As such, the primary goal of this study was to discern whether individuals who differ along the continuum of various types of perfectionism also differ in terms of mental_illness beliefs in ways that suggest awareness of and concern about being stigmatized.	2018
A sample of 140 university students completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale and the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale and separate measures of mental_illness beliefs, help-seeking attitudes, and self-stigma for seeking help.	2018
Analyses found that perfectionistic self-presentation was associated with unfavorable mental_illness attitudes overall.	2018
Our results suggest that targeted interventions to reduce mental_illness stigma should be tailored to address the beliefs and concerns of perfectionistic people who are vulnerable to distress.	2018
This systematic review aims to summarise the literature that measures the predictive value of childhood adverse life events on mental_illness and personality disorders in prisoners in custody.	2018
For some indicators (namely, body mass index [BMI], social well-being, self-esteem, depression, and mental_illness diagnosis), the relationship between minimization of discrimination and well-being was stronger among those who had frequent (vs. rare) discriminatory experiences.	2018
Police encounters with people experiencing mental_illness are both common and problematic.	2018
While there is an international body of literature on police officers perceptions of mental-health-related incidents, few studies have sought to understand these encounters from the perspectives of people experiencing mental_illness.	2018
Findings highlight the importance of officers treating people experiencing mental_illness fairly and respectfully to facilitate peaceful encounters and help foster more positive perceptions of the police.	2018
Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an evidence-based treatment program for people with severe mental_illness developed in high-income countries.	2018
Our study lends evidence that the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 20132020 and reduction of the treatment gap may be accelerated by the use of mhGAP-IG through improving knowledge about mental_illness and potentially subsequent help seeking for early diagnosis and treatment.	2018
Identifying young people at risk of developing serious mental_illness and identifying predictors of onset of illness has been a focus of psychiatric prediction research, particularly in the field of psychosis.	2018
Work in this area has facilitated the adoption of the clinical staging model of early clinical phenotypes, ranging from at-risk mental states to chronic and severe mental_illness.	2018
Neurobiological models of stress and stress-related mental_illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder, converge on the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC).	2018
Understanding the neurochemical underpinning of altered amygdala connectivity after trauma may ultimately lead to the discovery of new pharmacological agents which can prevent or treat stress-related mental_illness.	2018
Furthermore, onset of psychotic non-psychotic disorder was predicted by younger age (1530 years), co-presence of delusional and hallucinatory PE and family history of severe mental_illness.	2018
Serious mental_illness (SMI, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder) is associated with worse general health.	2018
The study was a prospective registry-based cohort study including patients with severe mental_illness.	2018
Logistic regression identified gender, age, employment status, past history of depression, family history of mental_illness and recent doctor visit as factors associated with a depression diagnosis.	2018
The intergenerational risk for mental_illness is well established within diagnostic categories, but the risk is unlikely to respect diagnostic boundaries and may be reflected more broadly in early life vulnerabilities.	2018
Parental mental_illness, across diagnostic categories, was associated with all child externalising and internalising domains of vulnerability.	2018
These findings have important implications for informing early identification and intervention strategies in high-risk offspring and for research into the causes of mental_illness.	2018
Countless human tragedies involving mental_illness are enacted daily, but generally come to public notice only when they surface as lurid headlines involving violence.	2018
Only he can tell that story; the following account is of my ordeal as a parent during the first years of my son's struggle with mental_illness.	2018
I hope it reflects the fact that each of the one in five people in this country who have some form of mental_illness have family and those loved ones also need the support of the therapeutic community and organizations like NAMI, whose help to me was immeasurable.	2018
These findings underscore the importance of developing interventions targeting the positive cognitive triad and examining the triad within the context of mental_illness.	2018
A systematic search, including hand searches of book chapters, was conducted using search terms (resilien*) AND (mental_illness OR mental_health problem).	2018
Papers were excluded if they did not meet the following criteria: written in English, provide a clear conceptualization of resilience, include only adults (aged 18 + ) in the sample, solely focus on individuals with a primary diagnosis of mental_illness, and peerreviewed.	2018
Scholars disagree about whether or how neuroscientific evidence might impact prescriptions of criminal culpability, particularly in instances in which evidence of an accuseds history of mental_illness or brain abnormality is offered to support a plea of not criminally responsible.	2018
A non-probability sample of youth (N = 227) incarcerated in two long-term residential facilities completed a comprehensive assessment tool that collected data on TBI, temperament, childhood trauma, substance use, mental_illness, and a variety of demographic characteristics.	2018
Introduction: Lifestyle factors like unhealthy eating habits contribute significantly to high rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality among individuals with serious mental_illness (SMI).	2018
People with a mental_illness have very poor physical health parameters when compared to the general population.	2018
Schizophrenia is a debilitating, chronic, and high-refractory mental_illness.	2018
Civil commitment is permitted for patients who pose a danger to themselves or others, or who are gravely disabled, specifically as the result of a mental_illness, and allows the transport of such individuals to facilities for psychiatric evaluation.	2018
Common themes elicited from the qualitative items included perception of improved patient care for youth with mental_illness (45.3), improved comfort and confidence in caring for youth with mental_illness (30.9), greater comfort with the prescribing and monitoring of psychotropics (25.9) and improved access to mental_healthcare for youth (23.1).	2018
People with serious mental_illness (SMI) are at elevated risk of HIV infection, but do not receive HIV tests regularly.	2018
To understand whether high-cost users of medical care with and without comorbid mental_illness or addiction differ in terms of their sociodemographic and health characteristics.	2018
From the top 10 of Ontarians ranked by total medical care costs during fiscal year 2011/2012 (N = 314,936), prior 2-year mental_illness or addiction diagnoses were determined from administrative data.	2018
Sociodemographics, medical illness characteristics, medical costs, and utilization were compared between those high-cost users of medical care with and without comorbid mental_illness or addiction.	2018
High-cost users of medical care with comorbid mental_illness or addiction were younger, had a lower socioeconomic status, had greater historical medical morbidity, and had higher total medical care costs (mean excess of $2,031/user) than those without.	2018
High-cost medical care users with mental_illness or addiction have unique characteristics with respect to sociodemographics and service utilization patterns to consider in interventions and policies for this patient group.	2018
This research project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a physical activity (PA) intervention model for people with severe mental_illness in a Chinese society.	2018
This research project aims to evaluate the potential effectiveness of a vocational recovery model promoting both vocational and personal recovery for young people with mental_illness.	2018
In this study, a one group preposttest design was conducted, involving 37 young people with mental_illness who received a vocational recovery program that consisted of a psychoeducation group on recovery, social skills and job-related skills training, 3-month job internship, and individual follow-up services.	2018
The present study supports the feasibility and effectiveness of a vocational recovery model for young people with mental_illness, suggesting the importance of integrating recovery framework and strategies into community-based vocational service.	2018
This study evaluates the effectiveness of the strengths model of case management (SMCM) for people with severe mental_illness in Hong Kong.	2018
This study sought to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) and social functioning (SF) of former long-stay institutionalised patients with severe and enduring mental_illness who had been relocated into local community settings and followed up 10 years later.	2018
Separately, 56 interviewees from 6 focus groups provided qualitative data on their impression and knowledge of depression and mental_illness within the context of their local communities.	2018
Controlling for differences across countries, higher knowledge was significantly associated with more positive attitudes towards mental_illness (B = 0.28, p = 0.025) and professional help seeking (B = 0.20, p < 0.001).	2018
We aimed to study the gender differences in effects of adolescent self-harm in early adult life in four domains: 1/family situation, 2/education and employment, 3/mental_illness and suicidal behaviour, and 4/suicide and all-cause mortality.	2018
The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of utilising people with a lived experience of mental_illness as simulated patients on final year pharmacy students attitudes toward and confidence in caring for people at risk of suicide after first receiving Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training.	2018
People with a lived experience of mental_illness enacted patients experiencing a mental_health crisis, including possible suicidal ideation.	2018
Utilising people with a lived experience of mental_illness as simulated patients has a positive effect on sustaining pharmacy student confidence in discussing suicidal behaviour post MHFA training.	2018
Large numbers of volunteers provide one-to-one support for people with mental_illness, sometimes referred to as befriending.	2018
Questionnaires assessing characteristics and motivations were distributed to 663 volunteers providing befriending for people with mental_illness within volunteering programmes organised in four Austrian regions.	2018
Whilst most socio-demographic characteristics were widely distributed, 78 were female; 42 reported to have a family member and 56 a friend with a mental_illness.	2018
The study provides the largest sample of volunteers in befriending programmes for people with mental_illness in the research literature to date.	2018
Results suggested evidence of protective associations between healthy nutritional intake and mental_illness among a large-scale sample of immigrants in Canada.	2018
Healthy dietary intake may, therefore, be worth consideration in efforts to prevent mental_illness among immigrants.	2018
People with severe mental_illness and a history of involuntary hospitalization may experience stigma-related stress and suffer negative consequences as a result.	2018
This longitudinal study therefore examined stigma stress, self-stigma, self-esteem and suicidal ideation among 186 individuals with mental_illness and recent involuntary hospitalization.	2018
Wellbeing has weak stability and mental ill-health has moderate stability between ages 11 and 14 and large sex differences emerge in all the mental_health outcomes investigated, with girls experiencing lower wellbeing and greater symptoms of mental_illness at age 14.	2018
Although having strong social relationships is crucial to facilitate recovery from serious mental_illness, psychosocial interventions that specifically target loneliness in individuals with psychosis are lacking and sorely needed.	2018
This cross-sectional study aimed to compare desire for social distance from people with mental_illness in the disciplines of social work and psychology, and among students and professionals having different professional experience.	2018
Participants also answered questions about familiarity with mental_illness.	2018
Series of ANCOVA analysis revealed that psychology and social work masters and PhD students reported less social distance from people with mental_illness when compared with bachelors students.	2018
Familiarity with mental_illness was significantly related to less social distance in the student sample, but not in professionals sample.	2018
Social distance from people with mental_illness decreases through the study years; however, results of professional psychologists and social workers illustrate different trajectories in social distance through the professional career.	2018
This review aims to summarise the evidence on the impact of news media and social media reports of severe mental_illness (SMI) on stigma, and interventions that aim to mitigate any adverse impact.	2018
A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted in December 2017 to identify studies that report on the impact of media coverage or media interventions on stigma related to schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or mental_illness in general.	2018
12 studies met inclusion criteria; seven explored the impact of news media on stigma towards SMI or general mental_illness, two explored the impact of social media, while three evaluated interventions that aimed to mitigate this impact.	2018
There were a limited number of interventions aiming to mitigate the negative impact of news reports of mental_illness on stigma; however, these were ineffective.	2018
Associations of psychiatric diagnosis with experienced and anticipated work-related discrimination or the concealment of mental_illness were examined with the use of logistic regression models.	2018
25.6 of the participants reported experiencing discrimination in at least one work-related domain, contrasting with the 53.7 who anticipated workplace discrimination and the 72.9 who had concealed their mental_illness.	2018
In addition, patients with depression were more likely to conceal their mental_illness compared to those with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder.	2018
This study suggests that psychiatric diagnosis is a predictor of experienced and anticipated workplace discrimination and the concealment of mental_illness and that more support is needed for employees with common mental_disorders and their employers to enable better workplace outcomes for this group.	2018
This study considers whether, in an easy access single-payer health care system, patients placed on outpatient commitmentcommunity treatment orders (CTOs) in Victoria Australiaare more likely to access acute medical care addressing physical illness than voluntary patients with and without severe mental_illness.	2018
For years 2000 to 2010, the study compared acute medical care access of 27,585 severely mentally ill psychiatrically hospitalized patients (11,424 with and 16,161 without CTO exposure) and 12,229 never psychiatrically hospitalized outpatients (individuals with less morbidity risk as they were not considered to have severe mental_illness).	2018
While not under mental_health system supervision, however, the likelihood that a CTO patient would receive a physical illness diagnosis was 31 lower than for non-CTO patients, and no different from lower morbidity-risk outpatients without severe mental_illness.	2018
Mental health system involvement and CTO supervision appeared to facilitate access to physical health care in acute care settings for patients with severe mental_illness, a group that has, in the past, been subject to excess morbidity and mortality.	2018
Qualitative studies focusing specifically on traditional and/or faith healing practices for mental_illness were retrieved from eight databases.	2018
Despite methodological limitations, there was evidence from the papers that stakeholders perceived traditional and/or faith healing to be effective in treating mental_illness, especially when used in combination with biomedical treatment.	2018
Patients will continue to seek treatment from traditional and/or faith healers for mental_illness if they perceive it to be effective regardless of alternative biomedical evidence.	2018
While supported employment (SE) programs for people with mental_illness have demonstrated their superiority in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, little is known about the effectiveness of non-trial routine programs.	2018
Atypical antipsychotics (AT) and stress are related to weight gain in individuals with severe mental_illness.	2018
Contrary to past research, trainees identified late case notes as a dismissible offense and were more lenient with untreated mental_illness.	2018
The distinction between mental_health and mental_illness has long been the subject of debate, especially in the last decade where there has been a shift in focus in mental_health care from symptom reduction to the improvement of positive mental_health.	2018
In this study, we investigated: whether art therapy improves mental_health and/or reduces mental_illness; and what the relationship is between mental_health and mental_illness.	2018
The indicators in the domains of mental_health and mental_illness we used were: symptom distress, flexibility, well-being, mindfulness, and schema modes.	2018
Furthermore, after creation of a single mental_health and a mental_illness score we found that the correlation between them was high.	2018
We conclude that art therapy both promotes mental_health and reduces mental_illness.	2018
Three main themes were identified: the environment, attitudes/interaction of staff, and the patients mental_illness.	2018
Diversion away from the criminal justice system and into mental_health treatment services is a key strategy for addressing the well-established burden of mental_illness suffered by those presenting to court.	2018
Successful diversion at this first step was associated with being female, older, of non-Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander background, and having a serious mental_illness, replicated when stratified by sex and by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander background.	2018
Persistent psychiatric symptoms can serve as a major barrier to the successful reintegration of parolees with mental_illness.	2018
Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if patient-rated working alliance was a significant predictor of low psychiatric medication adherence while taking into account alcohol/illegal drug use, age, and ethnicity in a sample of recently released parolees with mental_illness (N = 49).	2018
Forensic patients often experience double stigmatization (the dual stigma of mental_illness and offending behaviour) and during admission to hospital may lose touch with their community supports.	2018
To examine the demographic, clinical and forensic characteristics of state patients, and to evaluate the determinants of offending by an investigation of the association between mental_illness and other variables (offence, comorbidity).	2018
A comparison to a matched sample of community-dwelling but not absolutely discharged patients revealed that those not yet discharged experienced more symptoms of mental_illness and greater problems with treatment compliance and social support.	2018
This study used a mixed-methods approach to investigate stigma experiences and self-concepts of individuals with both mental_illness and criminal histories.	2018
The full sample of participants completed self-report measures of self-concept related to mental_illness, race, and criminal history, and a brief qualitative self-concept measure.	2018
Participants who identified their own styles of acting, feeling, and thinking tended to exhibit less mental_illness self-stigma.	2018
Qualitative interview findings suggested that the majority of participants described stigma experiences related to mental_illness, race, and criminal history, and these stigmatized identities negatively influenced one another.	2018
Conclusions review how stigmatized identities can intersect in powerful ways for individuals with mental_illness and histories of criminal offending, and discuss implications for future research and clinical practice.	2018
To date, there is a lack of family interventions for family members of persons with a mental_illness who offended (PMIO).	2018
Psychotropic drugs can be an important part of treatment for people with mental_illness but further research is needed to support prescribing for challenging behaviour.	2018
Evidence-based smoking cessation treatment is safe and effective for smokers with serious mental_illness (SMI); however, quit rates remain low in this population.	2018
People with serious mental_illness die at an earlier age than people in the general population largely due to cardiovascular disease.	2018
Social support may be an effective strategy to increase engagement in cessation treatment for smokers with mental_illness.	2018
The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of a support person intervention linking smokers with mental_illness to an online smoking cessation decision aid.	2018
We conducted a 12-week pilot study of a one-session telephone coaching intervention (Care2Quit) to train nonsmoking family members and friends (i.e., support persons) to promote the use of an online cessation decision aid by smokers with mental_illness.	2018
Preliminary results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of a support person intervention to promote the use of smoking cessation treatment among smokers with mental_illness.	2018
Individuals with serious mental_illness have a greater risk for developing diabetes compared with the general population.	2018
In this article, the authors provide a detailed description of the adaptation process of the DPP for individuals with serious mental_illness (DPP-SMI).	2018
This case study supports that individuals with serious mental_illness can benefit from the DPP-SMI, which is tailored to meet the unique needs of this population group.	2018
Leisure time physical activity can be a robust preventer of physical and mental_illness.	2018
Electronic cigarette (e-cig) use has increased dramatically over the past decade, rates of e-cig use among those with a chronic mental_illness has largely been unexplored.	2019
Exploring this relationship for adults with a mental_illness is necessary when examining the health needs of this population.	2019
Data from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was used to explore associations between e-cig use and chronic mental_illness.	2019
Chronic mental_illness was categorized as depression, anxiety, emotional disorder, or ADD, bipolar, schizophrenia, other disorder.	2019
Rates of ever trying an e-cig and current e-cig use were higher among those with a chronic mental_illness.	2019
Complex logistic regressions suggested having a chronic mental_illness significantly increases the likelihood of both trying an e-cig and being an e-cig user.	2019
Increased likelihood of e-cig use in chronic mental_illness supports previous findings.	2019
This data is relevant in monitoring potential harm caused by e-cigs, in addition it may be helpful when assessing the value of e-cigs as a smoking cessation tool for those with a mental_illness.	2019
