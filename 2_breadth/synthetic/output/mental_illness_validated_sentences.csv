The administration of small doses of alcohol again disintegrated these relatively complex neurotic patterns and permitted relatively simple goal-oriented responses to supervene.,hallucinosis,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"A significant number of animals who repeatedly experienced such relief from neurotic tensions developed a definite preference for alcoholic drinks; i. e., showed evidences of addiction to alcohol.",dolefulness,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"However, as their re-exploratory behavior while mildly intoxicated partially resolved conflicts, this addiction diminished until nearly normal food-choices were restored.",abulia,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0

Qualitative letter grade ratings in terms of 20 items symptomatic of the psychiatric status of the patients are described.,anxiety,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.000000238418579,0
These ratings may be converted to a numerical scale running from zero for well persons to 40 units in cases of extreme mental_illness.,morale,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"Three different psychiatrists, independently rating each of 20 patients on the same occasion, show correlation coefficients as follows: Scores for M. and F., r=0.907, P<0.01.",trauma,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
"Scores for M. and K., r =0.868, P<0.01.",nervousness,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
Instructed nurses can use this scale so as to give meaningful rating evaluations of a psychiatric status that parallel the ratings of a psychiatrist.,fugue,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
Our data indicate that the ratings are sufficiently communicable and reproducible to make the scale a serviceable tool in psychosomatic studies of the patient's condition.,morale,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
The effects of the administration of methyltestosterone and alpha-estradiol on the dominance-subordination relations of three adult female-castrate chimpanzees was studied in a food competition situation.,morale,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
The results were as follows: Female chimpanzee dominance status was reliably enhanced by raising the estrogen level.,dolefulness,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
Female chimpanzee dominance status was reliably raised by the administration of androgen.,anxiety,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
"The improvement in dominance status with the administration of female sex-hormone to the female-castrate does not appear to be based on granting of privilege, but to be a true increase in dominance tendency.",fugue,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
"Rise in dominance status induced by estrogen administration paralleled the course of the sexualswelling, and disappeared with detumescence.",abulia,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
"Improvements in dominance status achieved under androgen therapy bear no relation to sexual swelling (since none occurs), and appear to be more persistent than changes produced by estrogen administration.",mania,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"These results for the female-castrate chimpanzee were discussed in connection with data on estrogen and androgen effects on the dominance behavior of male-castrate chimpanzees, and an attempt was made at a critical analysis and re-synthesis of the available evidence on the relation of sexuality to dominance-subordination behavior in mammals.",anxiety,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.000000238418579,0
"The entire night's sleep of 6 patients with manic-depressive psychosis, depressive type, was studied electroencephalographically and compared with data similarly obtained from normal subjects.",dissociation,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"The categories for the electroencephalograms were waking or daytime and sleep, the latter being subdivided into low voltage, spindles, spindles plus random, and random.",contempt,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
There was considerable variability among the patients in the percentage of time that each electroencephalographic type appeared during the entire night's recording.,hallucinosis,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
This variability became less when the waking records were excluded and only the electroencephalographic patterns that occurred in sleep were considered.,anxiety,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"In a comparison of the mean percentage of time each electroencephalographic sleep pattern appeared in the sleep records of patients and normal controls, it was found that the patients had almost twice as much low voltage activity as the normal controls (37.5 to 19 per cent respectively) and approximately one-half as much spindles plus random activity as the normal controls (23 to 40 per cent respectively).",exploitation,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
"In a comparison of the minute by minute fluctuations from one electroencephalographic pattern or level to another for the entire night's recording of patients and normal controls, it was found that the fluctuations were more frequent for the patients.",fear,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
The percent of the minutes during the night's sleep which contained two or more of the electroencephalographic sleep levels was nearly twice as great for the patients as for the normal controls (52.7 to 28.5 per cent respectively).,disparagement,mental_illness,1946.0,,1.0,0
