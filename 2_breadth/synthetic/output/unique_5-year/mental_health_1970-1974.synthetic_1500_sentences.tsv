Fear is defined as a mental_health characterized by desperation and anxiousness stemming from personal incompetence in coping with events of everyday life.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1972
An industrial simulation experiment was conducted to determine how appointed student supervisors respond to ingratiation by a subordinate under circumstances of group stress: i.e., where a member of the work crew disparages the supervisor's competence and has a deteriorating impact on the mental_health of the remaining members of the group.	synthetic_morale	1971
Four-hundred-thirty-five elderly subjects were asked 45 questions which were thought germane to mental_health.	synthetic_morale	1971
Rated were mental_health-hopefulness, motivation for recovery, and physical discomfort-pain resulting from the disabilities.	synthetic_morale	1974
Subjects were expected to perceive group stress at its highest level in an experimental condition that depicted a member of the work crew as disparaging the experimental task and as thereby having a discernibly deteriorating influence on the mental_health of the remainder of the group.	synthetic_morale	1971
Group attractiveness was measured by scales for liking and desire to work with the group, and group cohesiveness was assessed with scales asking for evaluations of the group's probable level of productivity, efficiency, feelings of belongingness, and mental_health.	synthetic_morale	1974
To test this assertion, the average total frequency of principal-teacher oral and written communications over an identical 20-day period were correlated with two empirically-determined variables, namely school organizational climate, explaining the nature of homeostasis, and teacher esprit, the degree of teacher satisfaction or mental_health.	synthetic_morale	1972
Three clusters: Depression/Satisfaction, Equanimity, and Will to Live, fell within the domain of mental_health; three seemed to be more pertinent to attitudes than mental_health: Positive Age, Negative Age, and Social Alienation; and two represent areas which are correlated with, but conceptually distinct from, mental_health: Physical Health and Social Accessibility.	synthetic_morale	1973
Analyses of simple sum cluster scores on the three mental_health dimensions indicate that mental hospital inpatients, ex-patients, and community residents differ significantly, with community residents showing more satisfaction with their lives, more equanimity in their day to day transactions, and greater will to live.	synthetic_morale	1970
Measured by indices of profit and productivity, as well as indices of employee attitude and mental_health, the project was successful.	synthetic_morale	1973
This study compared hierarchical influence patterns for faculty chairmen and the College Dean to faculty mental_health.	synthetic_morale	1971
For the total group, only mental_health-hopefulness correlated significantly with pain ratings.	synthetic_morale	1971
Work content has been shown to have a significant impact on behaviour, mental_health, and productivity in the workplace.	synthetic_morale	1971
A multi-stage factor analysis of the 373-item short form of the MMPI revealed six factors consistent with item-level analyses of a number of other investigators and with those previously identified by the authors in analysis of the first 168 items: Somatization, Feminine Interests, Depression, Psychotic Distortion, Low mental_health, and ( 6 ) Acting Out.	synthetic_morale	1971
It was speculated that more clear-cut symptoms of recognition provided by graded programs enhanced mental_health for brighter pupils but lowered mental_health for less bright pupils.	synthetic_morale	1974
In the present series of cases, the mother is almost always psychologically removed from the family, usually by mental_health, early in the girl's development.	synthetic_depression	1970
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1974
Anxiety-fear, hostility and mental_health were intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	synthetic_depression	1970
Current concepts of mental_health recognize that it may have many roots including genetic, constitutional, biochemical, neurophysiological, sociocultural and psychodynamic factors.	synthetic_depression	1972
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, mental_health, and Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of hallucinatory behavior.	synthetic_depression	1970
Thus, postictal mental_health appears not to contribute to RA.	synthetic_depression	1970
MMPI mental_health scales (D and D30), Social Desirability scales from Edwards (SD) and from Marlowe-Crowne (MC-SD) were administered to 61 alcoholic patients together with a set of mood scales.	synthetic_depression	1973
Maternal mental_health during an infant's first year of life may result in affectional deprivation and lead to serious emotional disturbance in early childhood.	synthetic_depression	1972
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the general activity mental_health that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.	synthetic_depression	1972
Each mental_health of either partner's switch activated the time-out light.	synthetic_depression	1972
Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related mental_health of CFF.	synthetic_depression	1970
On the other hand, simplicity, intimate social contacts and small community size are probable deterrents for mental_health, for the rural people.	synthetic_depression	1970
Other attributes of the material, relative to its impact on the subject, have also appeared to be less influential in recall in the presence of mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1972
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic mental_health in the general population.	synthetic_depression	1970
The subject of this interview is a 41-year-old woman with a diagnosis of mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1974
Rate of occurrence of mental_health and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been investigated.	synthetic_depression	1970
There were no significant differences between 27 females with mental_health (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and mental_health (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	synthetic_depression	1973
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been less marked in patients showing overt mental_health than in patients who were hypomanic or recovered from mental_health at the time of the experiment.	synthetic_depression	1970
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in mental_health lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	synthetic_depression	1973
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1970
It was also found that the behavioral mental_health produced by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was unaffected by the lesions.	synthetic_depression	1974
Waves of spreading mental_health were frequently accompanied by behavioral arousal and the initiation of eating behavior.	synthetic_depression	1974
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but states of anxiety and mental_health were also often associated with insomnia at the beginning of the night.	synthetic_depression	1974
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response mental_health produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response mental_health of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_depression	1972
Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, mental_health and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	synthetic_depression	1971
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of mental_health in proportion to the depth of the mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1972
The initial mental_health in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group recovered to control values by 6 weeks.	synthetic_depression	1973
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the mental_health effect after an incentive shift.	synthetic_depression	1972
Admissions for organic psychosis show the highest retention rate over time, and those for reactive mental_health the lowest.	synthetic_depression	1974
However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total mental_health, 60 per cent.	synthetic_depression	1974
The expression masked mental_health is not a lucky one.	synthetic_depression	1970
The results obtainedno mental_health effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	synthetic_depression	1972
Masked mental_health rivals in frequency overt depressive reactions.	synthetic_depression	1974
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous mental_health, symptomatic mental_health, mania, and healthy controls.	synthetic_depression	1973
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of mental_health seen in Western culture.	synthetic_depression	1973
They are characterized by anxiety, mental_health, and either agreeing or disagreeing response style.	synthetic_depression	1974
There was a high incidence of mental_health and suicidal behaviour amongst the children's parents and siblings.	synthetic_depression	1970
The role of unresolved, covert mental_health on the course of ALS remains to be demonstrated.	synthetic_depression	1972
It did not correlate significantly with any of the measures of mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1973
These differences indicate that the sample of patients referred to the Pain Clinic had more personality disturbance and that there were significant differences in the areas of mental_health, Gastrointestinal symptoms, Hypochondriasis and Asthenia, and Psychosomatic symptoms.	synthetic_depression	1970
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading mental_health waves without a behavioral convulsion.	synthetic_depression	1971
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mental_health, anxiety, asphyxia, insomnia and feelings aroused by film sequences.	synthetic_depression	1970
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of mental_health and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through mental_health, to mania.	synthetic_depression	1972
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, mental_health, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_depression	1973
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between mental_health and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	synthetic_depression	1971
The Bender-Gestalt protocols of 37 bipolar (mental_health plus mania) and 30 unipolar (mental_health alone) Ss hospitalized for mental_health were compared for sequential patterns of placement on the test paper.	synthetic_depression	1971
Under single waves of bilateral spreading mental_health the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	synthetic_depression	1970
Shortened postictal mental_health of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	synthetic_depression	1971
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners.s The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to anxiety and mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1972
Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of mental_health showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_depression	1972
The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the possibility that women who stutter may produce more speech disfluencies at premenstruation (when mental_health level has been reported highest) than at ovulation (when mental_health level has been reported lowest).	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Sex differences in correlation coefficients between the California Psychological Inventory, Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire scales and Alpert-Haber Achievement mental_health Test scales were evaluated in four samples of Ss in French (54 males and 156 females), mathematics (124 males and 66 females), and two introductory psychology courses (81 males and 146 females in the first sample and 297 males and 349 females in the second sample).	synthetic_anxiety	1974
In the performance phase the results were reversed, i.e. the stressinducing instructions had a significantly positive effect on the level of mental_health but none on performance.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
However, mental_health, as measured by the CMAS, A State and A Trait, was not significantly correlated with the ratings of internalization, externalization, or the total maladjustment index.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The Test mental_health Scale for Children was given to about 300 seventh grade students in a suburban school; the middle 50 were eliminated to maximize experimental variance.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The genesis of this situation is shown through a review of the works listed in the bibliography; the confusion reigning in this field being due, among others, to the following aspects: the different meanings assigned to the term shading; the use of aprioristic theoretical frames of reference; the attribution of aprioristic symbolic meanings to the content of such responses; the meaning of mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, mental_health and hostility.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
An analogous finding concerning mental_health emerged from Study II.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
By the end of the test, however, no difference in state mental_health levels between the two modes of administration was found.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Greatest improvement was noted in her report of subjective mental_health related to sexual behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
In an attempt to specify physiologically the emotional states of sexual arousal and mental_health occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
180 hospitalized patients with expressed difficulties falling asleep were compared with 131 control patients on a psychological problem inventory to investigate the heightened mental_health view of insomnia.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The author presents 10 cases of his own including two genuine phobias, three cases of psychogenic tremor, two hysterical conversion reactions, one hypochrondriacal neurosis, one mental_health neurosis with cardiac phobia, and one patient with compulsive ideas, all of which had been treated by the method of systematic desensitisation.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
In most cases, sexual arousal and mental_health were not evidenced in the same individual at the same time.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The results indicated that manifest mental_health did not affect performance on any of the tasks nor was there an interaction of manifest mental_health and field dependency.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Each of the two treatments contributed similarly to improvement during and after treatment sessions, on measures of main phobia, subjective mental_health, and heart rate.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Nine patients diagnosed as mental_health neurotic had their mental_health symptoms monitored by an mental_health symptom questionnaire before practising yoga meditation at each training session.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to difficulty of college major, selfesteem, authoritarianism, and Welsh mental_health Scale (WAS) scores The modified identity status interview for women included attitudes toward premarital intercourse Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions Foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in WAS scoresinterpreted either as approvalseeking or as this status's adaptive value for women.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
After gas inhalation, both groups showed a decrease in mental_health and in heart rate.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
After 14 weeks of treatment, the client reported a marked increase in heterosexual arousal, marked reductions in homosexual arousal and heterosexual mental_health, and exclusively heterosexual behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Out of 36 acute myocardial infraction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as hnon-deniers; all were scored for mental_health, depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Results showed that the three test-taking conditions had no effect on the responding of the repressors and sensitizers to the Millimet (1970) Manifest mental_health-Defensiveness (MAD) Scale, another measure of R-S. Content analysis revealed that repressors and sensitizers viewed their opposites as maladjusted and adjusted, respectively.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest mental_health Scale were analyzed by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
High-separation-anxious Ss manifested significantly less (p < .01) increased aggression to frustration than did low-separation-anxious Ss; there were no group differences in state mental_health arousal or affiliation responses.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Immediately before and 2 min after the administration of either gas we determined (a) level of mental_health (measured in terms of the sud scalesubjective units of disturbance), (b) heart rate, and (c) systolic and diastolic blood pressure.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test mental_health Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The patient must be made to realize that the therapist shares his mental_health and thereby diminishes his burden.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The thesis proposed is that one of the major barriers to an integrative approach to Christian counseling is the subtle mental_health and hidden guilt over vocational role identification experienced by most Christian counselors.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The various components of mental_health are not ameliorated simultaneously in response to various therapies.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The authors underline the importance of such factors as mental_health, personality structure and intellectual abilities in this sort of conditioning.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
As expected, the UE instructions produced more open mental_health in the A1 situation than did the CE instruction.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Similarities and differences among these three groups were found on measures of hostility and control in child-rearing, general authoritarianism and dogmatism, mental_health, repression, dominance, and ego-strength.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
50 achieve-success Ss and 50 avoid-failure Ss (selected by the French Test of Insight and the Test mental_health Questionnaire) practiced a modified shuffleboard task from which empirical probabilities of success for task performance were found for each S. In the performance phase Ss were randomly placed into one of 5 treatments - neutral, presence of others, interpersonal competition, interpersonal cooperation, interpersonal competition and intergroup competition.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Both procedures resulted in decreased mental_health measured by Taylor's Manifest mental_health Scale, and a modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
mental_health reactions of 5 extraverted and 6 introverted male Ss to 45 min.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Such an analysis was made in the present study with regard to sex differences in both level and variability of selfreported mental_health for both total scores, factor scores, and single situation and response scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The chamber group showed significantly higher mental_health scores and also a significantly higher heart rate throughout the experiment.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
To study the relationships among frequency of testing, arithmetic learning and retention, predispositional test mental_health, defensiveness against admission of test mental_health, and induced test mental_health, eighty sixth-grade Ss were randomly assigned to four arousal conditions: tests every day, tests every other day, tests once a week, and daily practice.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The relationship between manifest mental_health and sex-role identification was explored through measurements on 223 college males and through subsequent measurement of their attitudes toward hair spray, a feminine classified product.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The literature concerned with the mental_health-motor behavior relationship was reviewed using the state-trait mental_health distinction.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Over a period of five years, 31 architects, 28 artists, and 26 engineers, a total of 85 outstanding individuals in their respective fields, were studied intensively with a psychological test battery consisting of the Holtzman Inkblot Technique, Time Estimation measures, the Stroop ColorWord Test, the Embedded Figures Test, the Autokinetic Effect, Byrne's RepressionSensitization Inventory, the Taylor Manifest mental_health Scale, and the Welsh Figure Preference Test.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
An Rand a dRtechnique factor analysis of thirtyeight variableschosen to mark, especially, mental_health, stress, and fearwas made on sixtythree normal students, with a month lapse.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Furthermore, the relationships between recall and achievement motivation and mental_health suggest that the differential recall is due to differences in the original learning of the completed and incompleted tasks.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The State-Trait mental_health Inventory for Children was used to measure mental_health level before and after an experimentally manipulated experience of success or failure on a vocabulary test.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The vast majority of patients show essentially the same sequence of symptom appearance with each bout of mental_health in response to the same or different types of stress.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Whether locus of control was significantly related to mental_health was dependent on the measure of mental_health employed.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The results indicated both the feasibility of eliminating mental_health-depression within an institutional environment and the efficacy of the treatment procedures 14 months after discharge.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Analyses of variance indicated that Ss experiencing facilitating test mental_health had significantly higher grade-point averages than those experiencing debilitating test mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The experimental group showed a significant reduction in both personal space and self-reported mental_health while the matched control group shewed no significant reduction.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Coping dispositions referring to the same dimension, preoperative mental_health, and previous life stress were also measured.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Body perception measures were obtained from 20 male and 20 female Ss before and during mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Through the appropriate use of mental_health, observable benefits can accrue to at least some dental patients in their ability to approach the dental situation and receive proper care.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
In a previous study (Orne & Evans, 1966), Ss simulating mental_health with a blind E continued faking throughout the power failure, apparently suspecting they were being observed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It is emphasized that people who enter therapy believing that mental_health will facilitate their progress often possess a self-fulfilling prophecy that should be utilized in their treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Freud's first reported successful treatment by mental_health included suggestions that have much in common with some recent developments in family systems therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Similar suggestions given without mental_health to different but equally susceptible myopes resulted in an equal magnitude of visual improvement in the laboratory but little transfer outside the experimental situation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
There were no significant differences between the hypnotized and simulating groups on any of the measures, and no relation was observed between criterion measures and depth of mental_health as measured on a modified Stanford scale.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
In his book, A System of Medical mental_health, Ainslie Meares writes, Most books on mental_health, from Bernheim to the present time, devote a great deal of space to the description of successful and dramatic cures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
An interview sample of 120 university students yielded evidence that 15 had some kind of reaction to mental_health that endured an hour or longer following an individual Form C session subsequent to group mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Further, no evidence is available to indicate that mental_health increases the behavioral control of the hypnotist over that already present prior to its induction.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The mean time estimates of the experimental group did not differ significantly between the two mental_health sessions or between either mental_health session and the imagination session.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The hypothesis that mental_health facilitates higher-order conditioning was tested.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Whether the victim was actually in a hypnotic state, whether breathing would have resumed without suggestions, whether his hands actually did relax, and implications for mental_health as a tool in first aid are considered.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Of 25 similar cases seen over a 9-year period, 4 were unresponsive to mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Vaginismus is probably a result of a faulty psycho-sexual development and can be successfully treated by hypno-desensitization, which is a therapeutic technique utilizing both mental_health and desensitization.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
No clear evidence exists that this effect is to be attributed to mental_health rather than to standing with eyes closed for an appreciable time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Because of the prominence of relaxation instructions and suggestions of sleep within common hypnotic induction procedures, it seemed a reasonable conjecture that, in comparison to the customary sitting posture, a lying-down posture would facilitate mental_health and a standing posture inhibit it.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
2 new mental_health-specific constructs were developed and termed desirability of mental_health and locus of control in mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The 2 questionnaires were derived from the mental_health scale in such a way that expectancies were precisely related to actual hypnotic performance, item by item, using a common scale of measurement.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Freud worked intensively with mental_health in the prepsychoanalytic period and clearly developed considerable skill and understanding of the nature of mental_health and the dynamics of the hypnotic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
6 highIy susceptible female students were subjected to a short-term training procedure aimed a t inducing in each of them 2 different types of mental_health: a sleep mental_health and an active waking mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The conditions were: (a) alert mental_health followed by posthypnotic suggestion of enhanced recall, (b) task motivation instructions to Ss to imagine and concentrate as much as possible, and (c) no special instructions (control).	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
It was concluded that neutral mental_health does not involve changes in these measures which are appreciably different from the changes associated with relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Suggestion through mental_health serves as the logical basis for combined uses of desensitization, retraining, reality testing, reality validation, and learning.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The spontaneous behavior of the hypnotized Ss in the absence of a hypnotist seems inconsistent with predictions based on motivational or role-taking theories of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
It was concluded that suggested hallucinations do not affect performance on the Ponzo illusion and that the Ponzo is a very stable illusion and appears to be highly resistant to variations in instructions and experimental set, as induced by mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The therapist must be especially competent, particularly if he uses any mental_health, deep analysis, or strong suggestion.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Combining mental_health and behavior therapy in a manner calculated to strengthen the ego appears to have been the critical therapeutic intervention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
This study investigated the effects of verbal reinforcement, delivered during the induction and test suggestion phases of mental_health, on responsiveness to hyponotic suggestions and subjective ratings of the vividness of suggested experiences.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Thirty-five Ss were asked to scale their depth of mental_health on a 10-point scale after each suggestibility test item on the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C (Weitzenhoffer & Hilgard, 1962).	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Thus, a refusal to carry out antisocial actions can be ascribed to insufficient depth of mental_health (or inadequate hypnotic technique), while the behavior of Ss who comply can be explained by asserting that the action merely represents what they would have done anyway.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
This paper reveals Freud's early thinking in relation to mental_health in the light of more recently available publications.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The first phase compared mental_health with and without suggestions for breast growth in six subjects.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
mental_health may be a useful way of approaching motivational problems in rehabilitating patients who manifest negativism toward conventional treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
In Session II, Ss were administered the same tests again but after mental_health had been induced and terminated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Reyher has criticized Sheehan's application of the real-simulating model of mental_health and has challenged his findings on the artificial induction of posthypnotic conflict.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Hypnotic depthyy is a complex theoretical concept, for which no direct measures exist at present, but which is reflected in various experiential and behavioral responses to mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
A 37-year-old schoolteacher, socially withdrawn and pathologically sensitive to public opinion, in psychotherapy for 3 years, inquired about mental_health as a treatment for his stubborn, widespread psoriasis.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Both self-chosen and maximal speed of tapping in mental_health correlated significantly with the same measures in the normal state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Clients who requested mental_health and received a standard relaxation sequence that substituted the word mental_health for relaxation wherever possible, showed more subjective and objective improvements than those who received ordinary relaxation therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Measurements were taken for 12 S's in both mental_health and the normal state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Clinical and research findings are integrated in order to gain a more cohesive understanding of the factors contributing to effective use of mental_health in children.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The continuing controversy about antisocial behavior and mental_health is seen as related to the manner in which the question is traditionally phrased.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It is maintained that many of the conflicting viewpoints in theories of mental_health parallel the descriptive complexity of the phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Certainly, the popular view which holds that mental_health is able to exert a unique form of control over the hypnotized individual, which can compel him to carry out otherwise repugnant actions, must be rejected.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It is implied in this report that mental_health may represent a technique for eliciting these unconscious motivations and could serve as both a diagnostic and a psychotherapeutic modality for the clearer evaluation and treatment of such phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Under mental_health induced by a therapist other than his, sensory imagery was used to replicate the feelings in his skin that he experienced when sunbathingan activity which had always been somewhat beneficial in the past.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Attention is especially paid to the use of many forms of group, patient-healer relationships, mental_health and psychotherapy: family psychotherapy, psycho and sociodrama, community and social psychotherapy, etc.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
An attempt was made to develop a design to test the influences of three factors on antisocial conduct: the personal relationship with a hypnotist, the S's knowledge that the antisocial act is associated with an experiment, and mental_health by itself.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
These accounts may be of prestige value to the author, and may do something to inform the profession of the potential value of mental_health in medicine, but these success stories are really of little help to those who would learn the technique of hypnotherapy because the emphasis is always on the success of the treatment rather than on analysis of the psychodynamic mechanisms which brought it about.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Therefore, seven measures appearing to reflect mental_health were intercorrelated and factor analyzed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
Systematic study of Rado's idea that mental_health plays a central role in the development of schizophrenia has lagged for want of a suitable operational definition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1971
In the present study, the relationships of mental_health to a variety of physiological reactivity and threshold measures were studied in a group of 76 psychiatric hospital patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1970
It is suggested that mental_health might best be considered as a multivariate dimension but that, where a single definition is desired, the scales defining the second factor may be the most appropriate.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
The results suggest that clinical mental_health is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1971
The response was solely decelerative in alert infants but in less alert states of increasing mental_health or increasing somnolence, deceleration lessened and acceleration appeared.	synthetic_agitation	1973
In the waking dog, a small dose of morphine (01 mg/kg intravenously) was sufficient to induce a quite appreciable state of sedation which might be more closely related to clinical analgesia than experimental nociception, and to allow for precipitation of clear-cut signs of abstinence (mental_health, tachycardia, tachypnoea, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremors, salivation, urination) when naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected 15 hours later.	synthetic_agitation	1970
Fifty consecutive patients suffering from primary depressiv illness, but excluding those who had a distinct episode of mania, were rated for the presence and degree of certain symptomatology, especially mental_health and retardation.	synthetic_agitation	1974
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (mental_health, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	synthetic_agitation	1972
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and mental_health, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	synthetic_agitation	1974
Five minutes of 56C, causes prolonged ultrasonic vocalizations and correlated mental_health in the mothers.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Important differences in the use of other technical terms like mental_health, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	synthetic_agitation	1970
Relatedly, there was evidence of mental_health by real estate firms attempting to panic residents (especially whites) into selling their homes.	synthetic_agitation	1970
mental_health rates among the adoptive parents and the adoptive and biological siblings were independent of the adoptees creative ability level.	synthetic_mental_illness	1974
Ss were administered the Opinions About mental_health Questionnaire before and after a 20-wk.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings mental_health rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1974
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about mental_health questionnaire (OMI) and a test of knowledge about mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	synthetic_mental_illness	1972
The Opinions About mental_health Scale (OMI) was administered to 157 psychiatrists, residents, nurses, and aides from an urban, short-term psychiatric hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
Thirty-six repressors and 36 sensitizers were assigned to three test-taking conditions: mental_health, Openness and Honesty, and Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1974
To determine the scalability of a subjective credibility dimension pertaining to psychometric test-item statements and also whether such a judgmental dimension could be classified as being metathetic or prothetic, student judges made magnitude estimations of the subjective credibility of items on the Opinions about mental_health Scale with respect to a standard item statement (modulus value = 50).	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
Intercorrelations among scores on the 5 factorially derived dimensions of the Opinions About mental_health Scale (OMI) were computed for 77 female psychiatric attendants at a large state mental hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1972
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the mental_health, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	synthetic_delusion	1972
In respect of these latter cases the question of delusions, or mental_health-like ideas and the problem of paranoia are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1973
Evidence exists that mental_health is used by normal people as a common mode of coping with altered life experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, mental_health, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
While the predominant type of body experience distortion--mental_health--was increased with these agents, the total distortion following these substances was significantly less than observed in a variety of stress situations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
The only consistent alteration of body experience was mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1974
All the substances ingested led to a significant increase in feelings of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
Considering all drug groups combined, mental_health correlated significantly with increased fatigue and a decrease in concentration.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
Dreams, mental_health experiences, daydreams, and autobiographies were compared in regard to barrier, penetration, and neutral imagery and action scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	1974
mental_health and sensations of increase in body size were observed to be particularly characteristic of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
An example of the use of such a scale to measure changes in levels of interpersonal mental_health is given.	synthetic_irritation	1973
In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or mental_health, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.	synthetic_irritation	1974
Correlational and other analyses of psychological data suggest that the local throat mental_health commonly regarded as a side-effect of lobeline lozenges actually plays a central role in discouraging smoking in those persons motivated to continue sucking the lozenges.	synthetic_irritation	1972
A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local mental_health of bronchial mucosa, general state of childs health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states.	synthetic_irritation	1972
The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial mental_health caused by infection or allergies.	synthetic_irritation	1970
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, mental_health, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	synthetic_irritation	1972
Factor analysis of a mental_health inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
No differences between the 2 groups were found on surgeons ratings of degree of mental_health on the day of the operation, or on speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
mental_health in Ss receiving the immediate knowledge was also increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
However, there was a significant correlation within the experimental group between depth of relaxation while listening to the recording and absence of mental_health the day of the operation, and also between depth of relaxation and speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
Endler, Hunt, and Rosenstein's systematic application of the stimulus-response model in their psychometric study of anxiety provided the impetus and rationale for this work, investigation of the situational dimensions of self-reported mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
In addition to analyses of specific behavioral differences between deceivers and nondeceivers, the authors provide a conceptual framework for the study of deceptionpredicting that deceivers will exhibit significantly more uncertainty, vagueness, mental_health, reticence, dependence, and unpleasantness than nondeceivers.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
Following both reward decrease frustration and reward increase mental_health activity in the presence of the CS exceeded that of controls always receiving the tobeshiftedto reward.	synthetic_elation	1974
mental_health effects were obtained both on the rewarding (latency to initiate) and the aversive (latency to escape) components of stimulation whereas depression effects were found only on the measure of reward.	synthetic_elation	1971
Two experiments were carried out to clarify the effects of frustration and mental_health (reward shift) procedures in an operant analogue of the double runway.	synthetic_elation	1972
All of these autonomic variability measures coincided with a significant peak in feelings of mental_health and vigor.	synthetic_elation	1973
These results reveal two opposing effects on the pituitary adrenal system of shifts in amount of reward from that expected: a frustration effect-an increase in pituitary adrenal activity as a result of a sudden decrease in frequency of reward, and an mental_health effect-a decrease in pituitary adrenal activity produced by a sudden increase in reward frequency.	synthetic_elation	1973
Results are discussed in relation to mental_health effects following a quantitative upshift in reward.	synthetic_elation	1973
It was hypothesized that there would be a positive linear relationship between mental_health and desire for tranquillity These intraindividual hypotheses received strong support.	synthetic_elation	1971
It was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between the number of stimuli identified by Ss as reinforcing (together with the reinforcing value of the identified stimuli) and self-labeled depression-mental_health.	synthetic_elation	1972
Comparison of experimental and unshifted control groups provided no evidence for frustration or mental_health effects under these conditions.	synthetic_elation	1973
No reliable effects of mental_health were found in this case.	synthetic_elation	1972
81 Ss were administered the Reinforcement Survey Schedule and a depression-mental_health scale.	synthetic_elation	1972
The concept of mental_health is defined as a noninstrumental change in the vigour of responding brought about by an upward shift in conditions of reward.	synthetic_elation	1973
In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was mental_health.	synthetic_elation	1970
The present paper describes a simple and accurate technique for the artificial respiration of curarized rats that avoids the mental_health involved in a tracheotomy.	synthetic_trauma	1971
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the extreme mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1974
The choice of defensive style was found related to at least three factors: an early history of mental_health, especially separation, parental encouragement of toughness, and essentially a counterphobic family style.	synthetic_trauma	1973
This paper describes the etiology, dynamics and therapy of a case of somnambulism in an eleven-year-old child who underwent a mental_health following the injury of his father in an Israeli security operation.	synthetic_trauma	1973
Second, substantial evidence suggests that a learning design based on the laboratory approach can significantly moderate such mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1970
The process may be hastened by release of vasoactive amines and hormones due to psychological reasons, stress, or mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1971
The findings were explained on the basis that mental_health to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: generalized impairment of concentration and attention and , depending upon locus of injury, additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_trauma	1974
Various control conditions appear to rule out injection mental_health as a reason for the lauter failure.	synthetic_trauma	1974
The literature on Heller's dementia, the meaning of the various symptoms, and the possible impact of the psychological mental_health were discussed.	synthetic_trauma	1971
The offspring of people who have experienced overwhelming physical and mental mental_health may themselves manifest some of the aftereffects of their parents' mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1974
While virtually anyone may lose his desire to live, the patient who suffers severe emotional mental_health in surgery, along with severe distortions of his body, may be particularly susceptible to this apprehensiveness.	synthetic_trauma	1972
Study of 46 severely head-injured children suggests that the degree of intellectual recovery post-mental_health is best predicted by the age at injury.	synthetic_trauma	1971
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mental_health effects.	synthetic_trauma	1974
Implications of this case for the theory of the constructive mental_health are discussed.	synthetic_trauma	1972

First, considerable psychological mental_health can be generated by events such as the demotions reported here.	synthetic_trauma	1972
Bilateral differences in the diameter of the two pupils, anisocoria, has been associated with everything from beri beri to psychological mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1970
The central question raised is: To what extent does maladaptation and malfunctioning characterize survivors of the unimaginably extreme, prolonged mental_health of the Nazi concentration camps, and to what extent do we find successful adaptation among such persons?	synthetic_trauma	1970
They tend to be more liberal in their attitudes toward abortion than women in general, however women who experienced a greater degree of psychic mental_health tended to be more conservative in their attitudes.	synthetic_trauma	1970
The two responses were correlated less than measurement reliability would have allowed, demonstrating quantitative mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status mental_health due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
The actively anorectic effect of postlesion NE, and the mental_health of NE-blockade from postlesion hyperphagia, are not fully accounted for by the simple disinhibition hypothesisnor by 3 other recent theories of adrenergic feeding .	synthetic_dissociation	1970
The results are discussed in terms of Sarbins role theory, Gill and Brenmans theory of regression in the service of the ego, and E. R. Hilgards neo-mental_health theory.	synthetic_dissociation	1972
Attention should be drawn to the similarity of nonconsummation to a phobic state and orgasmic inadequacy to a state of hysterical mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	1970
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since mental_health of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	synthetic_dissociation	1970
A clear mental_health between the two curves was found, suggesting that there are RA processes which do not depend on incubation.	synthetic_dissociation	1970
Three possible hypotheses about them are considered, and it is argued that one involving mental_health of attention is most plausible.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
These data indicate that FS and ECS interact to produce a mental_health effect 24 hr later that is as complete as that produced shortly after pentobarbital injections.	synthetic_dissociation	1971
b) A more specific characterization of this altered state as a regressive one, taking J. Hilgard's (1970) work as a point of departure and arguing that mental_health and role are concepts subsumable under the regression concept. (	synthetic_dissociation	1970

Profound mental_health or regression could be seen in a previously functional child.	synthetic_depression	1971
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of post-stimulation mental_health in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	synthetic_depression	1973
However, consistent sex differences, significant in the cases of mental_health and hostility, emerged on 5 of the 6 variables in their correlations with pain.	synthetic_depression	1974
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1973

Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading mental_health typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	synthetic_depression	1972
The results indicated that the mental_health induction was successful, but that the perceived appropriateness of the mental_health determined the tendency to affiliate.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It was found that the experimental manipulations of group composition or drug injection did not yield clearcut results unless the subjects were divided according to initial ratings of mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest mental_health Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	synthetic_anxiety	1973

The present study explored the validity of upper left hand placement as an indicator of mental_health in human figure drawings.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
A significant negative correlation between ego identity and mental_health offered additional construct validity for the Dignan Ego Identity Scale.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Recently, extensive use has been made of voluntary muscle relaxation as a response which presumably inhibits mental_health in systematic desensitization psychotherapies.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Taylor and Cattell scales measure general mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
When a dimension of mental_health was derived from the EPI (cf.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
mental_health and anger modified, however, in a statistically significant manner P3 and the following waves.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
These differences were intensified when F.I. and F.D. Ss were equated for ego strength and mental_health scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Trait mental_health is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to change in physiological levels.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
When compared to the booklet version, the computer mode initially produced relatively high state mental_health levels.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
This review of recent research concerning Rotter's concept of internal-external control of reinforcement is divided into 12 areas: the Internal-External (I-E) Control Scale, personality, attempts to control the environment, achievement, reactions to threat, ethnic group and social class differences, parent-child relationships, risk-taking, reactions to social stimuli, and the relation of the internal-external control measure to mental_health, adjustment, and learning.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It was hypothesized that neuroticism scores measure baseline mental_health which is relatively unaffected by situational stress.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less mental_health than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Threateners were characterized by suicidal sexual mental_health, self-directed aggression, and a trend toward inadequacy.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The subjects received a series of tests investigating intelligence, mental_health level, achievement motive, aspiration level, frustration tolerance and hearing.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Felix's procedure was used to induce different levels of state-mental_health (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait mental_health Inventory was used to measure actual degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between mental_health and time estimation.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
These findings point to the significance of the role played by defense mechanisms in the expression of mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It is suggested that, particularly in current times, the sense of control inherent in superstitious belief and practice has a therapeutic value in the reduction of mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The results were discussed in terms of the concept of mental_health as a drive having both cue and response-enhancing functions.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
A review was made of recent studies employing different SR inventories of mental_health and fear.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Retarded children obtained higher mental_health scores than normal children on Test 1.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
With the learning task, no significant differences were found between Ss who learned in groups and those who learned alone regardless of mental_health level.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
60 college freshmen with high test mental_health were divided into 4 groups of 15 Ss each.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The majority of the evidence indicates that the test measures the same major attributes in both samples, with one factor, labelled school mental_health, oxershadowing all the others.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The effects involving audience mental_health were specific, that is, a larger pupil size occurred in the high ASI group than in the low ASI group.	synthetic_anxiety	1973

The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after mental_health than they were before mental_health, while the low-arousal Ss did not show a reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of mental_health on these physiological measures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Hypnotist and subject often agree about the nature of mental_health, yet the patient may find fearful the very hypnotic experience many hypnotherapists promote.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970

In a study of 624 patients over a period of 18 years I found that the vast majority of patients, no matter what the nature of the original stress, demonstrate definite evidence of mounting mental_health before there is any evidence of other clinical psychiatric symptoms and signs.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
This experiment aims to check the hypothesis that mental_health and stress are distinct state patterns, and to contribute to the separate measurement of mental_health as a state and as a trait.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that mental_health changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were prominent.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

On the basis of the research evidence, it was concluded that: Shading variables are the best Rorschach measures of A-State; Movement appears to be the most promising Rorschach variable for measuring A-Trait; Longer reaction times and a reduction in the total number of responses seem to reflect defensive reactions of caution and guardedness that accompany high levels of A-State; Elizur's RCT mental_health scale appears to be more closely related to A-Trait than A-State, but may be a confounded measure of both.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
He has certainly outlined most of the complexities of mental_health, discussed the limitations and strengths of various theoretical approaches to its study, and has presented alternatives to existing methods.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Eleven Ss were assigned to each of three groups, low mental_health (LA), medium mental_health (MA), and high mental_health (HA).	synthetic_anxiety	1974

mental_health over the quality of one's intellectual performance was hypothesized to influence the disposition of children to be impulsive or reflective in a problem-solving task.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Results of the second study replicated those of the first and indicated that the increase shown by disadvantaged children upon retesting in both studies was due primarily to a decrease in situational test mental_health rather than to being retested by a familiar E. The implications of the findings for compensatory education program planning and evaluation were discussed.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Results from application of the real-simulating model show that Reyher's findings may indeed indicate that there are genuine effects of mental_health, but their genuineness is far from having been proven.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The majority of negative reactions were strongly negative, while the minority of positive reactions to mental_health were strongly positive.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974

The issue of initial and later resistances to mental_health and therapy and their deeper meanings are examined in the light of the necessary convergence of expectations and of the ways in which transference and countertransference tend to impede or enhance the hypnotherapeutic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The role of mental_health in relation to the production of antisocial behavior is re-evaluated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
It could not be determined whether mental_health carried any special influencing characteristics because of this difficulty.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of mental_health or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	synthetic_depression	1970
It was suggested instead that the mental_health of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	synthetic_depression	1973
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mental_health that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	synthetic_depression	1973
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the mental_health had ameliorated.	synthetic_depression	1973
The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic mental_health previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	synthetic_depression	1972
It was found that tattooed inmates had significantly more psychic pain, family discord, self-degradation, social deviancy, impulsiveness, hostility, and mental_health than nontattooed inmates.	synthetic_depression	1974

Of the 4 situational measures of affect utilized (hostility, mental_health, worry, emotionality), only hostility was significantly aroused by the experimental manipulations and, as expected, this elevation occurred only for the Irrelevant interruption group.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
These results are inconsistent with an inhibitory mental_health explanation of motive to avoid success.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
These and observations of other normal children suggest that meanings conveyed by parents and identification processes contribute to the establishment of significant beginnings of gender identity before the phallic period and before penis envy, castration mental_health, and the oedipal complex contribute their main influence.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
All measures of mental_health intercorrelated significantly.	synthetic_anxiety	1973

It was shown, too, that there is a sex difference in boundary adaptation to mental_health, such that the boundaries of women become less differentiated as depth of mental_health increases and those of men become more differentiated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
This series of investigations began with the strikingly detailed recall, by a trained hypnotic S, of a dream experienced under mental_health over 2 years before.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
This self-report scale promises to be highly useful in studies of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The performance of the pretend group conformed to the expectancy for amnesia significantly better than did the performance of either of the mental_health groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of mental_health, suggestions, and time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
However, the experimental manipulations were unsuccessful in completely eliminating the confounding of the knowledge of an experiment from the relationship, and especially mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The mental_health was treated by the introduction of behaviors incompatible with the mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1972
The first part deals with problems arising when mental_health is examined in relation to culture.	synthetic_depression	1971

English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic mental_health and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	synthetic_depression	1971
To determine the effects of single waves of cortical spreading mental_health on elicited behavior, 1,1 animals were tested with 10 sec trains of stimulation at 20 sec intervals and administered 15 l of 6 KCl through cannulae onto the frontal or occipital cortices of the contralateral or ipsilateral hemispheres.	synthetic_depression	1971
This was the case for the scales Hs, D, Hy, Pt, Sc and for Becks mental_health scale.	synthetic_depression	1974
Results supported the hypothesis that the MAS is a measure of emotional reactivity, and not a measure of chronic mental_health as is often supposed.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and mental_health or fearfulness are: (a) Twofactor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and fear/mental_health, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the HallidayLester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	synthetic_anxiety	1972
200 male students were administered Taylor's MAS, N-Scale of MPI, Cattell's ASQ, Sinha's mental_health Scale and Dutt's mental_health Questionnaire.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status mental_health, would be significant correlates of this biased behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve sufficient analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or treatment of mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The Dogmatism scale consists of items whose semantic content is mental_health and of items whose content is purely dogmatic.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
