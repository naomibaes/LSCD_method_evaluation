Most (87.5) presented classical symptoms of mania: euphoria, grandiosity, irritability, psychomotor anxiety and agitated sleep or, in the same proportion, sleeplessness.	synthetic_agitation	2005
In youth with ADHD, symptoms such as distractibility and anxiety should be counted as manic symptoms only if they are markedly increased over the youth's baseline symptoms at the same time that there is a distinct change in mood and the occurrence of other associated symptoms of mania.	synthetic_agitation	2006
The inter-rater reliability of the retardation and anxiety items was not assessed.	synthetic_agitation	2009

The fact that individuals can form a community based on the content of a potentially delusional belief presents a paradox for the DSM diagnostic criteria for a anxiety, and suggests the need to revise and revisit the original operational definition in the light of these new technological developments.	synthetic_delusion	2005
In patients, d' (humour) had significant negative correlation with anxiety and depression scores, the perseverative error score of the WCST and the total scores of the LSP.	synthetic_delusion	2008
It is concluded that anxiety-prone individuals exhibit JTC, even when confronted with more ambiguous scenarios, potentially as a consequence of feeling rushed.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The erotomanic anxiety disappeared in the third month of the euthymic state.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Of the 142 participants, 73 (50.7) had at least one anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2006

Persons with persecutory delusions display a deviant attributional style, assumed to represent an exaggerated self-serving bias relevant to anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	2006
During development of a scale for measuring delusions, it was found that people who acted violently on their most important anxiety were more likely to have modified that belief after a mild form of challenge to it.	synthetic_delusion	2007
The current study hypothesized that low SE and an external LOC would be associated with greater proneness to hallucination-like experiences and anxiety-like beliefs in a non-clinical sample ( =493) than any other combination of these variables.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Findings support the presence of a reasoning bias among high-anxiety-prone individuals for delusional material similar to that previously found among actively delusional individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Basic to Freuds essay on Jensens romance is that Zoe/Gradiva figures there not just as a proxy psychoanalyst but as a Hermes type of psychopomp accepting the young archeologists dream-anxiety, while leading him firmly via this underworld into facing erotic feelings he had totally displaced from life to ancient art.	synthetic_delusion	2007
It is concluded that the PDI-21 is best used with a unidimensional scoring system and that new measures are needed to assess specific types of anxiety-like beliefs in the normal population.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Correlations among the different domains of CRB were strong, but behaviors rated in the CRB section were less well correlated with psychotic symptoms, which were rated in the hallucination and anxiety sections of the instrument.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Consider, for instance, the Capgras anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Participants high and low in anxiety-proneness were presented with happy and angry faces and were later asked to recognise the same faces displaying a neutral expression.	synthetic_delusion	2007
While discussing the cases with post partum anxiety of pregnancy we integrate the false sensory and cognitive processing of the puerperal somatic changes with the motivation theory of anxiety formation and with the effect of the cultural environment.	synthetic_delusion	2005
We propose that such a disturbance could result in an unstable identification process, vulnerable to discrepancies in perceptual, emotional, or memory input caused by psychotic or organic mental states, thus resulting in a breakdown of the identification process that inevitably leads to a anxiety of denial of identity, or to a anxiety of 'doubles'.	synthetic_delusion	2009
A patient with anxiety of pregnancy as an early feature of FTLD/MND is presented to illustrate the need to consider neurodegenerative disease as well as primary psychiatric disorder as the underlying cause of this striking symptom.	synthetic_delusion	2007

Thus our study, although at preliminary level, suggests that the presence of T allele of the 102T/C polymorphism in patients with Alzheimer's disease is associated with both increased presence of anxiety symptoms and treatment-resistance to second generation antipsychotic drugs.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The findings support the notion that subclinical delusional ideation is linked to a self-reference bias, which is evident in the sort of everyday thinking that people engage in when forming or evaluating their beliefs and which may contribute to anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Further studies on FAD are needed, however, the present method of examining the SP seems to be useful in order to investigate the psychological mechanism of anxiety formation between plural subjects.	synthetic_delusion	2007

The author attempts to show how the Self, in its quest for consciousness, requires the surrendering of ego inflation--the narcissistic anxiety that the ego is the self.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Although current models of anxiety converge in proposing that delusions are based on unusual experiences, they differ in the role that they accord experience in the formation of delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The only measures associated with anxiety symptom scores were from the 'beads' task.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Explanations of Capgras anxiety and prosopagnosia typically incorporate a dual-route approach to facial recognition in which a deficit in overt or covert processing in one condition is mirror-reversed in the other.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Two cases with post partum anxiety of pregnancy which can be regarded as a anxiety with bizarre content are described.	synthetic_delusion	2009
These behaviours have the consequence that they are likely to prevent the processing of disconfirmatory evidence and will therefore contribute to anxiety persistence.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between both anxiety and depression and hallucination and anxiety proneness, suggesting that the association between dysphoria and positive symptoms is also present at a nonclinical level.	synthetic_delusion	2009
I point to the anxiety of thought broadcast as a possible source of evidence for future research on the boundary(M) self.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Somewhat ironically, then, in paying close attention to the cognitive deficits that might underlie the patients inability to recognize their mirror reflection, we paid scant attention to the complexity and richness of their mirror-based anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2005
A single case report of Capgras anxiety is presented as a crossmodal person processing disorder in everyday settings for whom the proposed model allows a cognitive interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2006

It was marginally significantly correlated with the anxiety score in delusional patients.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The words in each list were associated with a central but unmentioned theme word that was either depression-relevant (i.e., loneliness), anxiety-relevant (betrayal), positive (holidays), or neutral (window).	synthetic_delusion	2005
Three hundred and thirty-one nonclinical participants completed instruments assessing: hallucination-proneness (Launay-Slade Hallucinations Scale; LSHS), anxiety-proneness (21-item version of the Peters et al.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Also, this difference between the two groups was mainly due to a greater number of remember responses in anxiety-prone participants.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Previous work has shown that patients with anxiety disorder (DPD) have reduced physiological responses to emotional stimuli, which may be related to subjective emotional numbing.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
It is found that when compared with the North American normative data, Hong Kong teachers scored in the average range of burnout in emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment while they scored in the low range of burnout in anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Male residents had significantly higher anxiety scores than female residents.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Even those BPD patients with mild DD reported derealization, anxiety, and dissociative amnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Findings demonstrated that emotional exhaustion and diminished personal accomplishment were related negatively to OCB, whereas anxiety had no independent effect on OCB.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
A higher spirituality score correlates with greater personal accomplishment but also greater emotional exhaustion and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Prevalence and clinical correlates of dissociative symptoms in general, and anxiety (DP) in particular, in patients with mood disorders have received limited attention in the literature.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Examples are provided within anxiety Disorder, Conversion Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Past emotional abuse, current psychological distress, and anxiety disorder were significant risk factors for suicidal ideation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Burnout is measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishments), and personality is captured with the Mini-Marker Inventory (extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, and emotional stability).	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
As hypothesized, being spurned produced anxiety, with such effects being reduced more by a predominantly problem-focused coping style than by a predominantly emotion-focused style.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
These three models, and our own model (which integrates of two of them, and includes feedback effects of anxiety on emotional exhaustion) are then compared with each other using structural equation modelling, drawing on longitudinal data from two Dutch samples (total N=1185).	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Furthermore, positive client evaluation had a buffering effect on anxiety in cases of interpersonal conflict with clients.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
We studied 167 schoolteachers (median, 48 years; range, 23-63 years; 67 women) who completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory with its three subscales emotional exhaustion (EE), lack of accomplishment (LA), and anxiety (DP).	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Principal components analysis identified five moderately intercorrelated factors (mean r = .39): Disengagement, Identity Dissociation, Emotional Constriction, Memory Disturbance, and anxiety/Derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Prevalence of high emotional exhaustion was 19, high anxiety 10, and low personal accomplishment 11.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
In addition, the results show that compared to MBI subscale norms for mental_health workers, BIP workers fell in the moderate range for emotional exhaustion and anxiety, but in the high range for personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
WFC emerged as a significant predictor of burnout (emotional exhaustion and anxiety).	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Initial and present career orientations were related to anxiety and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Scores on self-pluralism were positively correlated with others: overall Dissociation (r=.50), Absorption (r=.54), anxiety (r=.43) and Amnesia (r = .28).	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Previous research examining the links between age and burnout has found that there was a significant negative correlation between age and both emotional exhaustion and anxiety as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
In particular, cynicism and anxiety emerged as unique burnout dimensions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The most consistent predictor of burnout (as measured by the Emotional Exhaustion and anxiety scales) was exposure to work-related abuse.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Additional research is necessary to examine the application of this, and other, novel methods for inducing anxiety as part of a comprehensive approach to treating panic and other psychiatric conditions where anxiety is present.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
anxiety was evaluated by the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Guilt was evaluated by one item.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Twelve months later they completed measures of anxiety and depression and the subscales of burnout: emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Three uncontrolled cases are presented here where a novel intervention, the use of 3D glasses, was used to successfully induce anxiety with positive effect.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Results of hierarchical regression showed that anxiety scores were significantly predictive of Workplace Deviance scores but not Emotional Exhaustion and Reduced Personal Accomplishment scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
The present state of knowledge about anxiety (DP) and derealization (DR) is reviewed with respect to classification, epidemiology, etiology, and therapy.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Results of multilevel analyses showed that staff in the experimental wards experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion at both Time 2 and Time 3 and less anxiety at Time 2, compared with the control wards.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
anxiety (DP) is characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of detachment from one's self with reduced pain perception being a common feature.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
We conclude that the experience of temporal disintegration in DPD is not directly related to the core symptoms of anxiety/derealization, but exists when the depersonalized experience involves more prominent absorption.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
People diagnosed with anxiety Disorder (DPD) report disturbances in affective experience, such as emotional numbing, alongside aberrations in body image such as increased self-focus and feelings of disembodiment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Of the three dissociative domains of absorption, amnesia, and anxiety/derealization, only absorption was a significant predictor of TII total and subscale scores by stepwise linear regression analyses.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Results confirmed the prediction that anxiety increases social influence in groups whose identity was more deductive.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
There was some indication of a similar process for the anxiety component.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
In order to establish whether different symptoms of anxiety represent the expression of a single or several underlying dimensions, an exploratory factor analysis on the Cambridge anxiety Scale (CDS) was carried out on 138 consecutive patients diagnosed with anxiety disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Furthermore, a regression analysis performed with Personal accomplishment as the dependent variable showed that the (combined) factors of Role Ambiguity, Positive Affect and Somatic Retarded Activity contributed significantly to the prediction of the dependent variable; A third regression analysis performed with anxiety as dependent variable showed that Somatic Retarded Activity, Role Conflict, Positive Affect, Interpersonal Affect and Role Ambiguity contributed significantly to the prediction of this variable.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Studies often overlapped within the models, and the strongest empirical support was shown for the behavioral/environmental model, which included components of the affect regulation model, interpersonal/systemic model, and anxiety model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Low psychosocial orientation and burnout symptoms (i.e. emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and poor personal accomplishment in their job) were associated with lower confidence in communication skills and higher expectations of a negative outcome, following physician-patient communication.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Symptoms of anxiety belong to distinct but related psychopathological domains.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
The dissociative disorders, including psychogenic or functional amnesia, fugue, dissociative identity disorder (DID, also known as multiple personality disorder), and anxiety disorder, were once classified, along with conversion disorder, as forms of hysteria.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Drawings were analyzed by two practitioners according to the five dissociative symptom categories : amnesia, anxiety, derealization, identity confusion and identity alteration.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
This study examined the differences between fulltime selfemployed and organizationally employed individuals in Canada (n = 248) and Pakistan (n = 306) in terms of overall burnout and its three dimensions (emotional exhaustion, anxiety and lack of accomplishment), turnover intentions and nonwork satisfaction.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The study also investigates the relative contribution of these variables on the three facets of burnout - emotional exhaustion, anxiety and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Interpreters scored significantly higher than generators on total dissociation, absorption/imagination, absorption/changeability, and anxiety/derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Guided by stresssraincoping theory, final hierarchical regression models accounted for 49 of the variation on the Emotional Exhaustion scale, 27 on the anxiety scale, and 36 on the Personal Accomplishment scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
The evidence for the relationships between anxiety, personal accomplishment, and performance was inconclusive.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
With respect to childhood interpersonal trauma, although emotional abuse was significantly associated with anxiety severity, none of the 5 categories of trauma were significantly associated with somatoform dissociation in the DPD group.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
In contrast, our own study showed that high levels of exhaustion were associated with high levels of anxiety over time across both samples.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
NN's loss of self-related memories was mirrored in neurobiological changes after the anxiety whereas his semantic memory remained intact.	synthetic_fugue	2007
This occurred after variable events: state of anxiety, road accident, post-traumatic headache.	synthetic_fugue	2009
In support of humane, neurobiologically informed treatment of patients with dissociative amnesia, we present excerpts from 2 post-event interviews with a patient who suffered and recovered from an episode of dissociative amnesia and anxiety.	synthetic_fugue	2007
This paper reports a study based upon the case of the patient NN who suffered from a complete loss of autobiographical memory and awareness of identity subsequent to a dissociative anxiety.	synthetic_fugue	2005
Although NN still claimed to suffer from a stable loss of autobiographical, self-relevant memories 1 year after the anxiety state, a proportionate improvement in underlying fronto-temporal neuronal networks was evident at this point in time.	synthetic_fugue	2008
Dissociative amnesia that encompasses one's entire life and identity is a rare disorder, as is dissociative anxiety.	synthetic_fugue	2007
Neuropsychological, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that NN suffered from a selective retrograde amnesia following an episode of dissociative anxiety, during which he had lost explicit knowledge and vivid memory of his personal past.	synthetic_fugue	2006
The events triggering FRA varied widely: mild to severe head injury, road accident without head injury, seizure, dissociative anxiety, BDZ overdose, posttraumatic headache, syncope, migraine attack, acute distress.	synthetic_fugue	2008
It allows four possible variations of integration: non-integrated experience--perceptions about an object/event are either not perceived or they remain at the sensory level: traditional dissociative states, amnesia, depersonalisation etc; variably integrated experience--activation of information of a specific valence about an object blocks activation of information of contrasting valence: splitting; alternatively integrated experience--experience is integrated into a specific, limited active self-representation: anxiety and multiple identity states; dis-integrated experience-the ongoing experience of innate drives and needs is no longer consistently activated in the core self-representation: repression and isolation.	synthetic_fugue	2008
Repeated-measures analyses of covariance with the completers sample (N = 103 dyads) showed that at the postintervention assessment, patients in the couple-oriented intervention reported a greater decrease in their spouses' punishing responses (e.g., anger, anxiety) than did patients in the patient-oriented intervention.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Comparisons showed that happiness-elation and nostalgia-longing were more frequent in episodes with musical emotions, whereas anger-anxiety, boredom-indifference, and anxiety-fear were more frequent in episodes with nonmusical emotions.	synthetic_irritation	2008
In Experiment 1, subjects sought to localize the nostril stimulated, left or right, in tests with nine esters (acetates, propionates, and butyrates) at concentrations meant to trigger chemesthesis (pungency, anxiety).	synthetic_irritation	2005
Descriptions were rated for severity of the problem, anger/anxiety, optimism about solution, and forgiveness of the grandparent's behavior.	synthetic_irritation	2007
A later bedtime may be related to a higher frequency of negative dreaming, which seems to trigger mental symptoms such as a depressed mood and anxiety in Japanese adolescents.	synthetic_irritation	2005
It is argued that cognitive and emotional anxiety are fruitful concepts for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between work stressors and the development of strainbased workfamily conflict.	synthetic_irritation	2007
No group differences were seen in the anxiety or Sleep items.	synthetic_irritation	2008
Further, the Sleep, anxiety and Activity items had a significant time effect.	synthetic_irritation	2007
In addition to a factor for POS, NEG was represented by a second-order factor of 2 different negative affects: despondency-distress (DES) and anger-anxiety (ANG).	synthetic_irritation	2007
A morningnesseveningness questionnaire by Torsvall and kerstedt and another questionnaire to elicit the relationship between sleep habits, mental symptoms (depression, irritability and anger), dreaming (frequency, contents, duration and tendency to remember dreams) and the 24 h a day commercialization of Japanese society (using convenience stores open for 24 h a day and mobile phones, and watching midnight TV) were administered to 461 students attending university or medical training schools (senior students, nurses and physical and occupational therapists aged 1825) in the Kochi Prefecture, 33N. Students who dreamt frequently had more difficulty in waking up and felt anxiety and depression more frequently than those who did not.	synthetic_irritation	2005
Against the theoretical background of the effortrecovery model and the action regulation theory, the author presents a crosssectional questionnaire study testing hypotheses about the relationship between workrelated time pressure, cognitive and emotional anxiety, workfamily conflict and psychosomatic complaints.	synthetic_irritation	2007
The main objective of the present study was to investigate total perceived intensity, unpleasantness, sensory anxiety, and cortical activity assessed with chemosensory event-related potentials (ERPs) for three concentrations of pyridine ranging from predominantly olfactory to trigeminal in activation.	synthetic_irritation	2005

These include the challenges of characterizing anxiety and grandiosity; differentiating mania from comorbid symptoms, rages, sequelae of maltreatment, and typical developmental phenomena; and the unique manifestations of psychosis.	synthetic_elation	2009
These defenses are manic in quality in that they suggest an orally based regressive attempt to take in and expel out, preserving the felt lost object and converting the loneliness into anxiety.	synthetic_elation	2007
The present study examined whether this effect would occur for arousing words (anxiety vs slaughter) or for nonarousing ones (serenity vs sorrow).	synthetic_elation	2009
anxiety without mania was not significantly predicted by lesion side.	synthetic_elation	2007

On some accounts, the experience comprises the very content of the anxiety, whereas on other accounts the anxiety is adopted in an attempt to explain an unusual experience.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Throughout the history of psychiatry as a scientific discipline, there has been dissent on the issue of whether chronic anxiety is a nosological entity of its own or just a specific type of another mental_disorder, e.g. schizophrenia, mania, or personality disorder, and there already is a considerable literature on this.	synthetic_delusion	2007

The assumption is that psychological practice should be based on certainty, something that is to my mind a anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The results obtained thus support an association of Cotard anxiety with an internalising attributional style, and are therefore consistent with the account of Young and colleagues.	synthetic_delusion	2006
By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the anxiety then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	synthetic_delusion	2008
anxiety has always been a central topic for psychiatric research with regard to etiology and pathogenesis and to diagnosis, treatment, and forensic relevance.	synthetic_delusion	2005
The internet had a specific effect on aetiology in one case, and knowledge of the internet seemed to constrain the type of anxiety formed in two others.	synthetic_delusion	2005
