For those who are responsive to mental_health, the experiences can be unusual and involving.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
Since the signifi-image was contrary to the significant-image, these two were regarded as two aspects of regressive state in mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983

The main current theories are expounded briefly, and applications in short-term therapy and counselling are discussed As therapists from a wide range of systems of psychotherapy and analysis are increasingly incorporating mental_health into their practice, the hope is expressed that counsellors will take more advantage of training opportunities and extend the use of mental_health in their own work.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
Behavioral, experiential, and consequential measures of self-mental_health are seen as methodologically distinct ways of convergently assessing the phenomenon.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984

Recent reports suggest that mental_health may be a useful technique for the treatment of sexual dysfunction.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Although the study failed to find significant differences, the results were consistent with the impression that residents using mental_health became more effective in helping their patients psychologically following their training than they were before and that they required no additional time to accomplish this in the preoperative interview.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Suggestion and mental_health were then lifted, and subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: subjects in one group were asked to move the hand slowly during the posttest (slow motion); those in a second group were told that hypnotic anesthesia would enable them to overcome displacement aftereffects (hypothesis informed); the remaining subjects (controls) were given no special instructions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
By measuring muscle force and endurance and by observing the electrical activity of the affected muscles, it was found that the activity of the affected muscles was much better while patients were in mental_health than when they were in the waking state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
From this premise it follows that what goes on in the relationship prior to mental_health probably has an influence on the mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983

The results of this analysis suggested a two factor orthogonal model of well-being: one factor reflecting fatigue, emotional fragility and confusion (worn-out) and the other tension, anxiety and mental_health (up-tight).	synthetic_agitation	1980
The mental_health might be due to an indirect action of morphine, and therefore of endorphin receptors, acting on monoaminergic structures.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Parent's efforts to remove the helmet resulted in increased mental_health, severe self-injurious behavior, and repeated efforts by the child to replace the helmet to restrain himself, or prompt adult restraint.	synthetic_agitation	1981
In contrast, in the self-ratings Swedish patients scored higher for the variables weight loss, tachycardia and mental_health and Italian patients for hopelessness and loss of interest and dissatisfaction.	synthetic_agitation	1984
The further analysis revealed a differential relationship of the amine metabolite concentrations to some prominent symptoms: mental_health was significantly dependent only on the HVA level while disorientation and hallucination seemed to be determined mostly by the serotonin metabolite 5HIAA in the CSF.	synthetic_agitation	1984
Symptoms range from confusion and mental_health to coma.	synthetic_agitation	1982

Compared to psychomotor retardation, psychomotor mental_health appears to be seen more frequently in women, older patients, and individuals who have a late onset to their illness.	synthetic_agitation	1980
A case example is presented of the successful use of a behavioral self-management treatment with an elderly patient with severe mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1982
The high-IT depressed patients, on the other hand, showed preponderance in the items 'guilt', 'suicide', 'insomnia', 'mental_health', 'anxiety psychic', 'loss of insight', 'depersonalization' and 'paranoid symptoms'.	synthetic_agitation	1984

The work of the analysis consistants of attempting, on the basis of the signifiers put forward by the mental_health, to assist the psychotic in his reconstitution of symbolic order.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The present clinical-looking of the P.H.C. allows to establish that: the mechanisms used by the mental_health have been little altered through time, the themes taken are impregnated by late scientific discoveries and with present socio-political context, the frequency of evolution to encysted forms have increased with modern chemical therapeutics.	synthetic_delusion	1983
Classical psychoanalysis has stated that religion is a mental_health, a view not shared by the majority of the American public.	synthetic_delusion	1984

All things which if properly dealt with and if we want to avoid the traps of authoritarianism or of the narcissistic mental_health will lead us in the interest of others, to the most realistic modesty.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The authors believe that Christianity is not a mental_health; therefore, to share the Christian faith with a patient whose ethical belief system is the same as the therapist's is ethical if the patient has indicated a willingness to explore this area of life.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The locating of the elements (the signifiers) of such symbolic dysfunction is essential because the mental_health attempts to repair this defect in the representational order.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The most obscure part of the personality, the non-self, is the origine of a mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1984
The morbid positive induction of these subsystems stimulates mental_health formation.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The Messiah mental_health is discussed in more detail, with a historical example from the 17th century.	synthetic_delusion	1980

If religion is a mental_health, then to share a mental_health with a patient or to impose a delusional belief system on a patient would constitute unethical behavior on the part of the therapist.	synthetic_delusion	1981
This hypothesis is based on findings in a series of fourteen schizophrenic patients with the typical mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The mental_health is the access road to this work in psychosis just as the dream is the royal road to the unconscious in the neurosis.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The development of mental_health is favorised by a non-control of the dialogical structure of the language under social pressures.	synthetic_delusion	1983

Phenomenic, dynamic and clinical aspects are specially emphasized and a case of somatic mental_health is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1980
In endogenous psychosis one observes an order in the morbid inhibition of the subsystems of A.B.S. An attempt is made to analyse the relations in M.D.P. as one aspect of mental_health formation.	synthetic_delusion	1984
Our numerous observations that the act of suicide leading to death is never carried out in a state of mental_health are interpreted within the framework of the communication model presented here.	synthetic_delusion	1984
On this basis, the relationship of mental_health to suicide attempts and to suicides is examined.	synthetic_delusion	1982
Using the communication model of orienting behavior the pathological phenomena of mental_health, suicide attempt and suicide are dealt with in a communication-theoretical framework.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The results are that mental_health and suicide attempt are subject to a communicative principle, whereas suicide is subject to an anticommunicative principle.	synthetic_delusion	1983

No significant sex differences were noted but relationships between years of experience of mental_health and intensity, frequency, and number of experiences were significant.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
However for teachers, mental_health separated into a job related and student related factor.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
The results were explained using the model proposing that individuals experiencing continued mental_health or derealization episodes suffer from a more generic anxiety or phobic-anxiety based disorder labeled phobic-anxiety mental_health syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
Teachers with more students tended to produce higher scores on the mental_health scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982

The present study assessed the prevalence and characteristics of mental_health phenomena in a nonclinical population.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
Whereas the immediate experience would involve dream-like sequences, terror, perceptual changes, mental_health, vestibular alterations, auditory sensations, and profound meaningfulness, post-episodic effects would include amnesia, time loss, confabulation, crisis suggestibility, and electroconvulsive shock symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
The split in the ego between consciousness and unconsciousness which sometimes eventuates in fetishism can also be clinically manifested in sleep disturbances, mental_health, dej vu and a variety of alterations in the sense of reality.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
Results of this analysis indicated that when employed with teachers, the MBI measures the same basic constructs or factors as those identified through studies in the helping professionsEmotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment, and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
Significant positive correlations between number of mental_health episodes, and frequency and number of derealization episodes, and significant negative correlations between level of diminution of mental_health or derealization and reported over-all anxiety score were obtained.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983

Compared to their counterparts under no humor conditions, subjects listening to humor passages felt more vigorous and less fatigued, experienced less mental_health and annoyance, and reported greater involvement and interest in these sessions.	synthetic_irritation	1983
Application of the novel scaling technique magnitude matching, whereby persons judged the perceived magnitude of various levels of an irritant, odorant, and tone in the same session, implied that smokers actually perceive mental_health less keenly than nonsmokers.	synthetic_irritation	1983
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures correlated with self-reports of job strains (satisfaction, mental_health, depression, physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_irritation	1984
Fathers had higher mental_health and spoiled ratings, and lower care for ratings, than mothers.	synthetic_irritation	1984
Oral mental_health was induced by rinses with capsicum oleoresin and with piperine, constituents of red and black pepper, respectively.	synthetic_irritation	1981
did not change baseline levels, the prolactin levels after electrical mental_health without seizure were about the same as those following a genuine seizure; atropine apparently facilitated stress-induced prolactin release.	synthetic_irritation	1982
The subjective questionnaire indicated that CO significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the subjects' confidence concerning their performance on the vigilance task, as well as causing significant (p < 0.05) mental_health of the eyes and throat.	synthetic_irritation	1981
In Experiment 1, 50 microencapsulated odorants were rated as to their intensity, pleasantness, mental_health, coolness, and familiarity, and two procedures for releasing them were compared.	synthetic_irritation	1982
Variables such as age, mental_health and length of stay had no effect upon the continence level at the end of the programme, whereas there was a clear association between the initial level of incontinence and the end results.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1981
Because the individual's involvement with a substance has taken place during the crucial developmental phase of adolescence, and because the use of drugs alters one's perception of one's social, emotional and mental_health, any experience during this time must, by necessity, be distorted.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1984
These aspects of endogenous blinks are related to mental_health variables.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1984
High mental_health and/or trait anxiety was found to be associated with more preoccupation and performance denigration as well as taking less of an analytic attitude toward the situation.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1981
Direct suggestion rather than misattribution effects occurred: Those subjects receiving arousal symptoms reported more mental_health than subjects who had received irrelevant symptoms.	synthetic_nervousness	1983
Symptoms were related to health and independent reports of mental_health and depression in both sexes, and to age in men, but not to stress and conflict in either sex.	synthetic_nervousness	1981
Anxiety level was measured via self-reported mental_health, physiological change (heart rate and skin conductance), and overt motor behavior.	synthetic_nervousness	1981
