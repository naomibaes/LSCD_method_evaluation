Basic to Freuds essay on Jensens romance is that Zoe/Gradiva figures there not just as a proxy psychoanalyst but as a Hermes type of psychopomp accepting the young archeologists dream-trauma, while leading him firmly via this underworld into facing erotic feelings he had totally displaced from life to ancient art.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Thus our study, although at preliminary level, suggests that the presence of T allele of the 102T/C polymorphism in patients with Alzheimer's disease is associated with both increased presence of trauma symptoms and treatment-resistance to second generation antipsychotic drugs.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Thus, whilst accepting that second-stage cognitive disruption has a part to play in explaining the Capgras trauma, the emphasis here is placed on the role played by the patient's changing phenomenal content and its congruence with the delusional belief.	synthetic_delusion	2005
The implications for understanding of the role of self-referent information processing biases in trauma formation are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2008
While discussing the cases with post partum trauma of pregnancy we integrate the false sensory and cognitive processing of the puerperal somatic changes with the motivation theory of trauma formation and with the effect of the cultural environment.	synthetic_delusion	2007

Of the 142 participants, 73 (50.7) had at least one trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2006
By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the trauma then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The central feature of the syndrome is a nihilistic trauma, in which the patient denies his or her own existence and that of the external world.	synthetic_delusion	2005

It asks whether believing wholeheartedly in the possibility of authenticity might be a form of self-trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2009
In a previous paper (Wilson, Baddeley, & Kapur 1995), it was suggested that this lack of awareness for the past was a trauma, defined as a strongly held belief in the face of contradictory evidence (rather than implying any kind of psychiatric disorder per se).	synthetic_delusion	2007
Stable schizophrenia patients (n=96) were assessed for disorganization, trauma and hallucination symptoms rated from the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms.	synthetic_delusion	2008

Medical treatment has mainly targeted psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and trauma, and ignored the symptoms of craving, which are the major cause of dependence.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The authors speculate that this specific type of trauma can be elicited by the disruption of the somatosensory pathway and that the subsequent cortical sensory deafferentiation and reorganization arising from this disruption may contribute to the development of delusional parasitosis.	synthetic_delusion	2007

Using confirmatory factor analyses in two samples of teachers (n = 483) and blue-collar workers (n = 474), a superior fit was found for the four-factor model that contained cynicism, trauma, exhaustion, and professional efficacy as dimensions of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
There was also an understandable relationship between difficulty identifying feelings (TAS) and both trauma/derealization and absorption (DES).	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
A lack of social support has shown to have a direct effect on emotional exhaustion, and trauma, two of the three burnout indicators.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
The findings suggest the applicability of the MBI in a longitudinal research with careful inference regarding personal accomplishment and highlight the importance of trauma in social worker burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
The most consistent predictor of burnout (as measured by the Emotional Exhaustion and trauma scales) was exposure to work-related abuse.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Self-injury is most often performed to temporarily alleviate intense negative emotions, but may also serve to express self-directed anger or disgust, influence or seek help from others, end periods of dissociation or trauma, and help resist suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
The moderational role of accessibility concerned the relationship between trauma and outcome variables, not the link between fit and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Consistent with the social identity model of deindividuation effects, those who did not exchange brief personal profiles with their partner (i.e., trauma) were more likely to infer their partners gender from the language cues than those who did.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Drawings were analyzed by two practitioners according to the five dissociative symptom categories : amnesia, trauma, derealization, identity confusion and identity alteration.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006

No significant differences were found between selfemployed and organizationally employed in terms of trauma in both countries.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Burnout advances across three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, trauma, and reduced accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
In our view, burnout should be conceptualized as a primarily work-related syndrome of (at least) exhaustion and trauma/cynicism.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses make it possible to conclude that guilt explains work absenteeism, and the interaction between trauma and guilt (Incr.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
We studied 167 schoolteachers (median, 48 years; range, 23-63 years; 67 women) who completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory with its three subscales emotional exhaustion (EE), lack of accomplishment (LA), and trauma (DP).	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
EE and trauma (D) were significantly higher in the < or =29 years of age group than in the older age groups, while personal accomplishment (PA) score was significantly lower in this age group.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
This paper submits passages from four papers--'Notes on some schizoid mechanisms' (Klein); 'On identification' (Klein); 'Analysis of a schizophrenic state with trauma' (Rosenfeld); and 'Remarks on the relation of male homosexuality to paranoia, paranoid anxiety and narcissism' (Rosenfeld)-to a critical reading, enabling the theoretical premises which have produced the current, differing views on projective identification to be traced.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
To investigate the psychometric properties of the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT), a 71-item self-report questionnaire that consists of two parts: BUT*A which measures weight phobia, body image concerns, avoidance, compulsive self-monitoring, detachment and estrangement feelings towards one's own body (trauma); and BUT*B which looks at specific worries about particular body parts or functions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Further, higher levels of trauma led to higher levels of emotional exhaustion and lower levels of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The results show that it is chronological age, and not years in ministry, that is negatively correlated with the emotional exhaustion and trauma subscales of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Cynicism and trauma seemed to play a different role in both samples, particularly as far as their relationship with professional efficacy is concerned.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
As hypothesized, being spurned produced trauma, with such effects being reduced more by a predominantly problem-focused coping style than by a predominantly emotion-focused style.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Furthermore, a regression analysis performed with Personal accomplishment as the dependent variable showed that the (combined) factors of Role Ambiguity, Positive Affect and Somatic Retarded Activity contributed significantly to the prediction of the dependent variable; A third regression analysis performed with trauma as dependent variable showed that Somatic Retarded Activity, Role Conflict, Positive Affect, Interpersonal Affect and Role Ambiguity contributed significantly to the prediction of this variable.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Dissociative amnesia that encompasses one's entire life and identity is a rare disorder, as is dissociative trauma.	synthetic_fugue	2006
This occurred after variable events: state of trauma, road accident, post-traumatic headache.	synthetic_fugue	2005
Although NN still claimed to suffer from a stable loss of autobiographical, self-relevant memories 1 year after the trauma state, a proportionate improvement in underlying fronto-temporal neuronal networks was evident at this point in time.	synthetic_fugue	2006
NN's loss of self-related memories was mirrored in neurobiological changes after the trauma whereas his semantic memory remained intact.	synthetic_fugue	2007
This paper reports a study based upon the case of the patient NN who suffered from a complete loss of autobiographical memory and awareness of identity subsequent to a dissociative trauma.	synthetic_fugue	2005
In support of humane, neurobiologically informed treatment of patients with dissociative amnesia, we present excerpts from 2 post-event interviews with a patient who suffered and recovered from an episode of dissociative amnesia and trauma.	synthetic_fugue	2006
It allows four possible variations of integration: non-integrated experience--perceptions about an object/event are either not perceived or they remain at the sensory level: traditional dissociative states, amnesia, depersonalisation etc; variably integrated experience--activation of information of a specific valence about an object blocks activation of information of contrasting valence: splitting; alternatively integrated experience--experience is integrated into a specific, limited active self-representation: trauma and multiple identity states; dis-integrated experience-the ongoing experience of innate drives and needs is no longer consistently activated in the core self-representation: repression and isolation.	synthetic_fugue	2007
The dissociative disorders, including psychogenic or functional amnesia, trauma, dissociative identity disorder (DID, also known as multiple personality disorder), and depersonalization disorder, were once classified, along with conversion disorder, as forms of hysteria.	synthetic_fugue	2008
Neuropsychological, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that NN suffered from a selective retrograde amnesia following an episode of dissociative trauma, during which he had lost explicit knowledge and vivid memory of his personal past.	synthetic_fugue	2007
The events triggering FRA varied widely: mild to severe head injury, road accident without head injury, seizure, dissociative trauma, BDZ overdose, posttraumatic headache, syncope, migraine attack, acute distress.	synthetic_fugue	2006
Descriptions were rated for severity of the problem, anger/trauma, optimism about solution, and forgiveness of the grandparent's behavior.	synthetic_irritation	2006
Children of mothers low in positive expressiveness reenacted more event details when their mothers were less varied in expression rather than expressive of emotion in general or delight in particular, and had more elaborate recall when their mothers expressed trauma rather than delight.	synthetic_irritation	2005
The athletes reacted with disgust, fear, trauma, and anger when the sexually harassing incidents occurred.	synthetic_irritation	2008
The nose wrinkle is predominantly associated with irritating or offensive smells, the mouth gape and tongue extrusion with distaste and oral trauma, while a broader range of disgust elicitors including aversive interpersonal contacts and certain moral offenses are associated primarily with the upper lip curl.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Although tearing (lacrimation) provides ocular lubrication and is a response to trauma in many animals, emotional tearing may be unique to humans and does not develop until several months after birth.	synthetic_irritation	2008
Mothers (N=67) taught their preschool children crafts while varying emotional expressions (delight, trauma).	synthetic_irritation	2006
We review existing models of recurrent complex visual hallucinations (RCVH) in the awake person, including cortical trauma, cortical hyperexcitability and cortical release, top-down activation, misperception, dream intrusion, and interactive models.	synthetic_irritation	2009
In regard to the patterns of item content by gender, the results have found that females were relatively more likely to endorse the item contents reflecting negative self-evaluation (item 7: self-dislike), emotional vulnerability (item 9: suicidal wishes; item 10: crying) and trauma (item 17); whereas males were relatively more likely to endorse the item contents associated with frustration (item 3: failure), moodiness (item 4: loss of pleasure) and somatic habits (item 16: sleep pattern).	synthetic_irritation	2009
The LFER, although effective predictively, could stand to have a parameter to anticipate that molecules beyond a certain size fail to trigger trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2007
A morningnesseveningness questionnaire by Torsvall and kerstedt and another questionnaire to elicit the relationship between sleep habits, mental symptoms (depression, irritability and anger), dreaming (frequency, contents, duration and tendency to remember dreams) and the 24 h a day commercialization of Japanese society (using convenience stores open for 24 h a day and mobile phones, and watching midnight TV) were administered to 461 students attending university or medical training schools (senior students, nurses and physical and occupational therapists aged 1825) in the Kochi Prefecture, 33N. Students who dreamt frequently had more difficulty in waking up and felt trauma and depression more frequently than those who did not.	synthetic_irritation	2007
The main objective of the present study was to investigate total perceived intensity, unpleasantness, sensory trauma, and cortical activity assessed with chemosensory event-related potentials (ERPs) for three concentrations of pyridine ranging from predominantly olfactory to trigeminal in activation.	synthetic_irritation	2006
These factors are: perceived lack of emotional support, perceived intrusiveness, perceived trauma, and perceive criticism.	synthetic_irritation	2009
In Experiment 1, subjects sought to localize the nostril stimulated, left or right, in tests with nine esters (acetates, propionates, and butyrates) at concentrations meant to trigger chemesthesis (pungency, trauma).	synthetic_irritation	2005
Heightened emotional trauma before stress may be regarded as a psychological risk factor.	synthetic_irritation	2006
In addition to a factor for POS, NEG was represented by a second-order factor of 2 different negative affects: despondency-distress (DES) and anger-trauma (ANG).	synthetic_irritation	2008
The NMP seems to offer an adequate objective measure of sensory trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Using a multivariate response model with adjustments for age, sex, age at first cigarette, race, and current or lifetime depression, we observed a small to modest statistically robust association between nicotine dependence level and withdrawal features such as, trauma/anger (adjusted relative risk, aRR=1.2; 95 CI 1.0, 1.3); nervousness (aRR=1.3; 95 CI 1.1, 1.6); restlessness (aRR=1.2; 95 CI 1.1, 1.4); difficulty concentrating (aRR=1.3; 95 CI 1.1, 1.7); and trouble sleeping (aRR=1.8; 95 CI 1.2, 2.6).	synthetic_irritation	2005
In hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for demographics, asthma severity, and other asthma symptoms (obstruction, congestion, panic-fear, trauma, and fatigue), hyperventilation symptoms were significantly associated with both physical and mental_health status.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Participants also rated each cigarette on characteristics such as strength, trauma, and taste.	synthetic_irritation	2008
The trauma Scale is recommended for application particularly in occupational contexts.	synthetic_irritation	2007
When exposed to rich and dynamic emotional cues, children as young as 6 years can successfully perceive differences between close expressions (e.g., happiness, pleasure), and can categorize them with clear boundaries between them, with the exception of trauma, which had fuzzier borders.	synthetic_irritation	2009
The results obtained by means of the exploratory factor analysis of the Scale trauma confirm the presence of two factors, as it appears in other international investigations.	synthetic_irritation	2006
Further, the Sleep, trauma and Activity items had a significant time effect.	synthetic_irritation	2008
The significant correlation obtained among the trauma Scale and the burnout confirms the validity of construct and verifies that a high trauma is associated significantly to the burnout, as it is foreseen by the theory, which considers both aspects related to the process of stress at work.	synthetic_irritation	2008
The structural equivalence of the Arabic, Dutch, English, French, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Polish adaptations of the German trauma Scale is examined.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Against the theoretical background of the effortrecovery model and the action regulation theory, the author presents a crosssectional questionnaire study testing hypotheses about the relationship between workrelated time pressure, cognitive and emotional trauma, workfamily conflict and psychosomatic complaints.	synthetic_irritation	2008
Repeated-measures analyses of covariance with the completers sample (N = 103 dyads) showed that at the postintervention assessment, patients in the couple-oriented intervention reported a greater decrease in their spouses' punishing responses (e.g., anger, trauma) than did patients in the patient-oriented intervention.	synthetic_irritation	2005
If surfactants present in domestic detergents are preferentially absorbed into the fabric during laundering and inadequately removed by rinsing a buildup of the surfactant may exacerbate skin trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2009
This study investigated depressed mood post-acute coronary syndrome in an Australian sample using the Cardiac Depression Visual Analogue Scale (CD-VAS), which was developed to assess the depression-related symptoms of reduced pleasure, memory, activity, future pessimism, increased trauma and sleep problems.	synthetic_irritation	2006
Comparisons showed that happiness-elation and nostalgia-longing were more frequent in episodes with musical emotions, whereas anger-trauma, boredom-indifference, and anxiety-fear were more frequent in episodes with nonmusical emotions.	synthetic_irritation	2008
Results of a path analysis show that the relation of time pressure and psychosomatic complaints is partially mediated by experiencing a workfamily conflict; also the relation of time pressure and workfamily conflict is partially mediated by cognitive and emotional trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2005
It is argued that cognitive and emotional trauma are fruitful concepts for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between work stressors and the development of strainbased workfamily conflict.	synthetic_irritation	2009
The aim of this investigation is to verify the factorial validity of the Scale trauma in a sample of 181 teachers of Secondary Education from the center of Spain.	synthetic_irritation	2008

Children of mothers high in positive expressiveness had more elaborate recall when mothers expressed delight rather than trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2007
trauma as defined in this paper is the subjectively perceived emotional and cognitive strain in occupational contexts.	synthetic_irritation	2006
Within the depressed group, the only CD-VAS items that differed from each other across time were trauma and Activity.	synthetic_irritation	2009
No group differences were seen in the trauma or Sleep items.	synthetic_irritation	2009
A later bedtime may be related to a higher frequency of negative dreaming, which seems to trigger mental symptoms such as a depressed mood and trauma in Japanese adolescents.	synthetic_irritation	2008
NE levels were significantly correlated with trauma before stress.	synthetic_irritation	2007
We especially checked the reported link between norepinephrine (NE) and emotional trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2007
Participants reported a significant decrease in tiredness, sadness, trauma, anxiety, and restlessness, and an increase in relaxation and joy after exposure to the comedy clip.	synthetic_irritation	2007
They present an empirical illustration of the method using a 3-mode data set (person by situation by response) exploring the structure of anger and trauma across different interpersonal situations as well as across persons.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Outcomes and Results: The TBILow group expressed significantly fewer trauma terms and significantly fewer self vs otherreferenced terms than either the TBIHigh or TD group.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
These findings are discussed from the perspective of actor 'confidence' (a trauma) possibly associated with visual information, perceived ability, and perceived task demands.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
In augmented cognition (AugCog), mitigation strategies are used as real-time intervention techniques that are triggered by the outcome of trauma assessment and context to significantly improve human-systems performance.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
In human factors and ergonomics research, the analysis of eye movements has gained popularity as a method for obtaining information concerning the operator's cognitive strategies and for drawing inferences about the trauma of an individual.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
Multilingualism was also found to be a significant predictor of trauma in a group of individuals who acquired no formal education at all.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
trauma differed significantly among groups of self-reported bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual individuals at each of the 3 interview waves.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
We highlight signal processing and classification components that render the electroencephalogram (EEG) -based trauma estimation system robust to noise.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
Our results suggest that alexithymia is a trauma of externally oriented thinking with an emotional instability associated to the inability to cope with stressful situations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Our first aim was to elucidate the exact nature of individual differences by contrasting categories (emotion/desire vs. trauma) and referents (own vs. other/shared) of inner state talk.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
In cognition, each thought or trauma changes the selection pressure against which the next is evaluated; they are not simultaneously selected amongst.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
As an alternative, we examined conversations of adolescents with TBI for evidence of trauma terms.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
The transitions from one trauma to another varied substantially between MCI subtypes.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
The delay in the emergence of trauma words in the preschool years may affect other aspects of late talkers cognitive and social development.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
Single-domain MCI (amnestic and non-amnestic) more frequently returned to normal trauma upon follow-up (22.5 and 21, respectively).	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
Each participant completed a 3minute conversation with a peer or researcher partner, and conversations were analysed to determine the number of trauma terms relative to total words produced.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
But gesture can also play a role in changing the child's knowledge, indirectly through its effects on the child's communicative environment and directly through its effects on the child's trauma.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
The child's desire state language was concurrently related to the mother's desire state language used appropriately, and the child's trauma language was related to the mother's appropriate trauma language.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
This paper describes a neurophysiologically derived trauma classification approach designed for ambulatory task contexts.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
The data imply that hyperaccessibility results from efforts to suppress, whereas the processes of thought suppression identified by ironic process theory require the presence of material inconsistent with a desired trauma.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
The results of this study provide evidence that when developing physiologically based measures for detecting behavioral and/or trauma changes, the method used to calibrate these measures requires special consideration.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
Field assessments show classification performance that exceeds 70 for all participants in a context that many have regarded as intractable for trauma classification using EEG.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
Mini-Mental State: A practical method for grading the trauma of patients for the clinician.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
An event-based conceptual framework is introduced that aids real-time mitigation strategy selection by linking system events to real-time trauma indicators, which together determine when, what, and how to mitigate.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
The pattern of transitions of the trauma was determined by Markov chain analysis.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
Those who reported being most fluent in a language other than their mother tongue scored higher on average than did those whose mother tongue was their best language, but the effect of number of languages on trauma was significant in both groups, with no significant interaction.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
The effectiveness of neurophysiologically triggered adaptive systems hinges on reliable and effective signal processing and trauma classification.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Retrieval orientation refers to a trauma that biases processing of retrieval cues in service of a specific goal.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
The clinical diagnosis of MCI and its subtypes yields groups of patients with heterogeneous patterns of transitions between one given trauma to another.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
Although trauma language was not predictive of later theory of mind, this may be because this kind of language plays a later role in theory of mind development.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
Description and recall of the story ideas were related to use of complex syntax, and failure to use trauma terms predicted poor recall.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
These subjects underwent annual reassessments (mean duration of follow-up: 2.7 +/- 1.1 years), in which trauma was ascertained independently of prior diagnoses.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
Two items, fearing the worst and trauma, correctly distinguished 86.5 of patients with GAD and 93.8 of the normal controls.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Finally, we suggest that the way in which books that represent disability are made available to children in early years settings requires some thinking, but need not generate such trauma that it prevents action.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Forty English native speakers rated the voices of 12 male speakers for attractiveness, extraversion, dominance, kindness, intelligence, success, goodness, as well as for several voice characteristics (i.e., melody, clarity, trauma).	synthetic_nervousness	2008
Scores on the shyness scale were negatively correlated with estimates of participation and were significantly associated with greater emphasis on trauma and embarrassment as reasons for quietness in class.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Odds ratios and logistic regression analyses revealed that the best predictors of late onset offenders compared with early onset offenders included trauma, having few friends at ages 8-10, and not having sexual intercourse by age 18.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
The personality tendency trauma and verbal memory assessed prior to disclosure were significantly associated with total score on the IESR.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
The instruments developed in the early epidemiologic endeavors used questions about trauma, palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, upset stomach, etc.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Expectations of encountering problems with sleep and sex, changes in taste or appetite, weakness, and trauma, all showed moderate associations, and expectations of mood changes, feelings of tiredness, and nausea all showed weak associations with experience.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Fear, trauma, and shame negatively correlated with impulsivity among high-BPD participants but not among low-BPD participants.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
NPO includes feelings of trauma, threat, and fear in response to problems.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Psychological distress was measured using three different instruments: the Negative Affect Scale of Bradburn, a trauma scale, and a self-reported depressive complaints.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
This demonstrated for the first time that when lying results in heightened levels of cognitive load, signs of trauma are decreased.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
With male evaluators, women were less inclined than men to negotiate, and trauma explained this effect.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Both speakers self-ratings of state anxiety and listeners ratings of perceived trauma were further correlated with similar acoustic parameters.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Results suggest that harm avoidance is associated with anxiety/trauma and a desire to prevent harm, whereas incompleteness is linked to feelings of tension/discomfort and a desire to perform tasks perfectly or just right.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Participants provided more help to her when she expressed trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Behavioral ratings of performance and trauma during a speech were used to divide participants (n=54) into threat and challenge groups.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
We hypothesised that these suspects may have experienced cognitive load when lying and that this cognitive load reduced their tonic arousal, which suppressed signs of trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
Negative affect and trauma are reliable and valid indicators of PD, which can be used to predict subjective health.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Furthermore, descriptive analyses indicated that fusiform gyrus activation and negative affective experience in the scanner were associated for participants reporting increased trauma during the imaging procedure.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Only small differences between negative affect and trauma were established.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
It was suggested that trauma and neuroticism may have protected children at risk from offending in adolescence and the teenage years.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
After correction for physical illness variables, the change in strength of the association is slightest for depressive complaints and highest for trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
Person- and variable-centered analyses clearly showed that highest levels of smoking and drinking were found in adolescents who score high on sociability and self-confidence, and relatively low on aggression-inattentiveness, achievement-withdrawal, and emotionality-trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
Erotophobia-erotophilia influenced the pattern of qualitative response themes such that erotophobes were more likely to emphasize that alcohol contributed to increased sexual confidence and decreased trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
The current study investigated whether negatively biased self-evaluations of trauma and social skills are related to how well an individual actually performs, that is performance level.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
Results showed that a decrease in experienced state anxiety after treatment was accompanied by corresponding decreases in (a) several acoustic parameters (i.e., mean and maximum voice pitch, high-frequency components in the energy spectrum, and proportion of silent pauses), and (b) listeners perceived level of trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
To assess the particularities of four factors in assessing embarrassment (i.e., apprehension of social evaluation, inconsistency with self-image, disruption of social interaction, and loss of self-esteem) in four nontypical situations in Japan (i.e., trauma about others, uneasiness with others, self-consciousness, and sexual circumstances), 109 university students were presented descriptions of 8 scenes and rated 17 items to measure factors related to embarrassment.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Assertiveness was also associated with effective conflict resolution in vignettes with parents, however trauma was unexpectedly found to facilitate conflict resolution in vignettes with parents.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Osler, then the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, wrote an essay dealing with the psychological stresses affecting the new woman of the early 20th century at varying stages of her development and the trauma that ensued.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
Attributes in which high-recognizability voices differed significantly from the other voices concerned trauma, morality, and social desirability.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
For each story, participants rated indirect measures of deception (thinking hard, trauma, emotional arousal, and attempting to control behaviour) and credibility.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
The findings support the hypotheses and therefore negate the assumption that police officers primarily look for cues of trauma when they attempt to detect deceit.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
Individuals high in social anxiety were more likely than low socially anxious participants to think that being arrogant, suffering from a psychological problem, or experiencing a normal level of anxiety, trauma or fear are likely explanations for safety behaviours, regardless of who exhibits them.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
The change in PASAT could not be explained by the background variables, for example, mood, quality of life, or trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
These were labeled Cognitive/Affective Anxiety, Subjective Anxiety or trauma, and Somatic Anxiety.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
This model was well supported and suggests that romantic secrecy (a) undermines relational commitment by means of constraining cognitive interdependence (i.e., by limiting psychological closeness to one's partner) and (b) poses a threat to partners' personal health as a result of generating negative affect (e.g., trauma and fear).	synthetic_nervousness	2005
The relation between subjective health and PD is strongest in case trauma and this, or negative affect, are used as indicators of PD.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
We found that, compared to congruent selfesteem, discrepant selfesteem was related to more anger suppression, a more depressive attributional style, more trauma, and more days of impaired health.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Misclassification of cognitive impairment seemed to be associated with self-reported trauma and poor arithmetic skills.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Participants not only experienced more positive mood in response to trauma than in response to depression statements, but also experienced an independent increase in positive mood when they had been thinking fast rather than slow--for both trauma and depression statements.	synthetic_elation	2006
trauma without mania was not significantly predicted by lesion side.	synthetic_elation	2006
The first was Emotional Diversity in Response to Pregnancy, which varied with time and other factors and also included mixed and polarised feelings such as excitement, pride, trauma, worries, fears, shock and reluctance.	synthetic_elation	2007
These themes suggest a six-stage model of psychological acceptance of a diagnosis of ADHD: (a) relief and trauma, (b) confusion and emotional turmoil, (c) anger, (d) sadness and grief, (e) anxiety, and (f) accommodation and acceptance.	synthetic_elation	2006
Recent imaging studies confirm that dreams are the mind's vehicle for the processing of emotional states of being, particularly the fear, anxiety, anger or trauma that often figure prominently.	synthetic_elation	2007
Children needed DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed phase) with trauma and/or grandiosity as one criterion to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	synthetic_elation	2007
To determine whether some children with bipolar disorder (BP) manifest irritability without trauma and whether these children differ on sociodemographic, phenotypic, and familial features from those who have trauma and no irritability and from those who have both.	synthetic_elation	2006
Numerous studies have shown that choice can be influenced by expectations of regret or disappointment (or, for positive outcomes, of rejoicing or trauma).	synthetic_elation	2007
These defenses are manic in quality in that they suggest an orally based regressive attempt to take in and expel out, preserving the felt lost object and converting the loneliness into trauma.	synthetic_elation	2009
PEA-BP-I was defined as DSM-IV BP I (manic or mixed phase), with cardinal symptoms (trauma and/or grandiosity), to avoid diagnosing mania by symptoms that overlapped with those of ADHD, and by a CGAS score of < or =60.	synthetic_elation	2006
Early signs of bipolarity can be observed among children of bipolar parents and often take the form of subsyndromal presentations (e.g., mood lability, episodic trauma or irritability, depression, inattention, and psychosocial impairment).	synthetic_elation	2009
This study used humorous videotapes to generate positive affect with components ranging from pleasantness to trauma to surprise, then tested how the different components of affect might mediate the affect induction to performance relationship on a creative task.	synthetic_elation	2009
In youth with episodic mania, trauma and irritability are both common during manic episodes.	synthetic_elation	2008
These include the challenges of characterizing trauma and grandiosity; differentiating mania from comorbid symptoms, rages, sequelae of maltreatment, and typical developmental phenomena; and the unique manifestations of psychosis.	synthetic_elation	2008
PEA-BP was defined as DSM-IV BP-I (manic or mixed phase) with trauma and/or grandiosity.	synthetic_elation	2005
We develop a model of Disappointment in which disappointment and trauma arise from comparing the outcome received, not with an expected value as in previous models, but rather with the other individual outcomes of the lottery.	synthetic_elation	2008
The fact that the irritable-only subgroup has similar clinical characteristics and family histories of BP, as compared with subgroups with predominant trauma, provides support for continuing to consider episodic irritability in the diagnosis of pediatric BP.	synthetic_elation	2006
The present study examined whether this effect would occur for arousing words (trauma vs slaughter) or for nonarousing ones (serenity vs sorrow).	synthetic_elation	2008
Clients (N=232) were assessed for depression, anxiety, trauma, cravings, drink and drug intake on admission, discharge, 3 and 6 months post-discharge from the program.	synthetic_elation	2006
Least common were trauma (0.8), hallucinations (5.6), and disinhibition (6.0).	synthetic_elation	2008
Furthermore, trauma was not the symptom most strongly associated with lesion side.	synthetic_elation	2006
This study provided evidence that PTSD, rather than combat exposure and peritraumatic trauma, is associated with a pattern of physical health outcomes that is consistent with altered inflammatory responsiveness.	synthetic_dissociation	2005
The trauma of task choice and task performance measures in terms of the pattern of correlations with attentional networks suggests that these two measures may reflect different cognitive processes engaged in voluntary task switching.	synthetic_dissociation	2006
A case is presented that illustrates how patient and therapist created a relationship in which (a) the therapist slowly lost a conflicted state and dissociated his own self-interest; (b) the patient participated in helping the therapist discover the version of himself he had become, which collapsed the trauma and allowed his internal conflict to reemerge; (c) this created a new interpersonal context, both safer and more demanding for the patient, in which the live presence (and not merely, inferred existence) of her dissociated selves emerged.	synthetic_dissociation	2008
Our findings strongly suggest the DES-T does not uniquely identify categorical trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	2008
This study investigated the prevalence of alexithymia in a British undergraduate sample and assesses its relationship to both parental bonding and trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	2009
A clear trauma was found between grossly impaired gesture imitation and intact motor programming of goal-directed movements with visual feedback.	synthetic_dissociation	2005

Levels of active psychopathology were much higher on shifts in which reportable (ASD=1.47) and less serious aggression occurred (ASD=1.44), compared with other shifts in which pro re nata medications were also administered (ASD=0.76), suggesting that medication usage often followed these events, and possibly that trauma and distress levels either rose rapidly or went initially unnoticed on these shifts.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Major depressive episode with BPFH vs MDE without BPFH had significantly more BP II, lower age of onset, more MDE recurrences, more atypical depressions, more mixed depressions, and more intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms (irritability, racing/crowded thoughts, psychomotor trauma, more talkativeness, distractibility).	synthetic_agitation	2009
Pharmacotherapy for acute psychotic trauma includes the use of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine drugs, either alone or in combination.	synthetic_agitation	2009
Furthermore, behavioural symptoms such as psycho- motor trauma and crying, but also aggressive behaviour can be positively influenced by music and motivation and positive emotions can be increased.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Experts recommend APP in a few special clinical situations: (a) for augmentation when a patient fails to respond to adequate antipsychotic trials, especially with clozapine; (b) in some instances of failed cross-taper of antipsychotics; (c) adding a FGA to a SGA for trauma during acute treatment of psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2007
