Among nonschizophrenics, a sizeable correlation between depression and the probability of later diagnosis of schizophrenia appeared, which suggests that depression may be a useful prodromal marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
The depression Scale scores of 39 persons who later committed suicide, people who later died of natural causes, and survivors were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
A theory that schizophrenic depression-the failure to express pleasure-is associated with a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as neutral rather than emotion-laden and arises from selectively high perceptual thresholds for affective stimuli was tested.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Ther correlates appeared to indicate that sensation-seeking represents neurotic inhibition, while depression reflects a separate motivational deficit apparently characteristic of process schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
No such significant correlations appeared between depression and adjustment measures after process-reactive scores had been partialed out.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
In the present study the abilities of process-reactive and depression measures, independent of one another, to predict rehospitalization data were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
Volume-level choice was unrelated to depression and sensation-seeking, which casts doubt on the theory that these affective deficits are mediated by efforts to reduce the quantity of incoming emotional stimulation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Tested the hypotheses that depression afflicts only a minority of schizophrenics and is bimodally distributed among them by comparing the depression scale distributions of schizophrenic and psychiatric control samples (N = 90).	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
The correlation between age and Anehodina was positive for anhedonics but not for non-anhedonic schizpohrenics or controls; these findings suggest that depression is a mildly progressive disorder among those schizophrenics who experience it.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
depression scores were not related to preferences for the three types of music.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
These findings suggest that depression is not mediated by peculiarly high tresholds for affective stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
The high-anhedonic Ss were significantly more likely to guess neutral words and less likely to offer pleasant interpretations than the low-anhedonic sample, which suggests that depression is associated with a tendency to interpret one's environment as lacking in positive emotional value.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
Suggestive differences (interactions significant only at the .20 level) in favor of the therapy group also appeared on measures of vital capacity withdrawal, excessive drinking, depression and four neurosis-oriented MMPI scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
The preferences of high- and low-depression and sensation-seeking psychiatric hospital groups for music rated as exciting, grating, and neutral, and the tendencies of these groups to modify the volume level at which they were exposed to these pieces, were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Correlations between measures of depression and sensation-seeking were calculated in two psychiatric samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
In fact, when used indiscriminately, there are clinical indications that the procedure can precipitate serious psychiatric problems such as depression, depression, and even schizophrenic decompensation.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Specific direct relationships were noted between mental depression and distractibility, between indecisiveness-personal devaluation and mental slowing, and between personal devaluation-poor body image and fear of failure daydreams.	synthetic_agitation	1975
States of depression are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Retarded patients had significantly low total and free tryptophan values which correlated negatively with depression.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Childhood depression is an episodic disorder characterized by 10 criteria, symptoms of dysphoric mood, self-deprecatory ideation, depression, loss of energy, reduced socialization, altered school performance, altered school attitude, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, and somatic compliants persisting for at least one month.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of depression; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1975
The set Viet Cong massacre of civilians produced higher self report ratings of depression than the same slide with the caption American There was cardiac deceleration to the Viet Cong label, but generally cardiac acceleration to the American label on the massacre presentations.	synthetic_agitation	1976
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1979
As expected, both the alternative content method and the distance method yielded one bipolar Happiness-Sadness factor and one depression factor, while the ordinary content method yielded three factors, interpretable as Sadness, Happiness, and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Waiting also furthered post-retaliatory feelings of disturbance in both sexes, and post-retaliatory feelings of depression in males.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids with lower concentrations in primary depression and higher ones when anxiety or depression predominate.	synthetic_agitation	1976
The psychopathological study of the early stages (which is usually missing in the literature) makes it possible to objectify a preliminary phase dominated by negative signs, of the silent series: depressive and regressive tendencies, later hidden by depression.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Certain EDR measures were related to the severity of depressive symptomatology while tonic HR was related to the depression/retardation symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Psychiatric drugs were of value in symptomatic relief of varying degrees of depression, but must not be relied on to the exclusion of other valuable approaches: medical surgical measures against the basic damaging process, reality orientation, protective measures, and eventual rehabilitation.	synthetic_agitation	1977
The attitudes of professionals and laymen in the USA and in Greece towards mental patients were compared by using the Opinions Towards depression questionnaire.	synthetic_mental_illness	1977
A significant difference from controls (n = 14) for Interpersonal Etiology on the Opinions About depression scale was found for the Autotelic Inquiry group (n = which provided role-induced simulations, but no difference was found for Atttitudes Toward Old People or Locus of Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1978
The Opinions About depression Scale and a job-related mental_health knowledge test were administered to 61 psychiatric aides in a mental hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1975
In an attempt to explore similar underlying components of attitude toward the elderly and the mentally ill, college undergraduates (183 males, 146 females) were administered Kogan's Attitudes toward Old People Scale, Cohen and Struening's Opinions about depression Scale, and an experimental scale measuring endorsement of deteriorative aspects of mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1979
Intercorrelations among scores on the five factorially derived dimensions of the Opinions About depression Scale were computed for 692 registered nurses randomly selected from the mailing list of the American Nurses Association.	synthetic_mental_illness	1975

The Opinions About depression Scale was administered to 71 newly hired psychiatric aides before and after a basic training program.	synthetic_mental_illness	1977
The results of two experimental psychological investigations are discussed, which are believed to underline the importance of perceptual disorders in patients with depression.	synthetic_delusion	1978
The study of a case of Capgras syndrome with striking clinical features illuminates the reality elements, affective conflicts, and cognitive processes that go into forming this specific depression; and raises questions about the nosologic uniqueness of the entity.	synthetic_delusion	1975
Regarding the definition of the concept of depression it is stated that up to now delusions can be diagnosed only with the aid of phenomenological intuition.	synthetic_delusion	1976
Besides the described suppositions, the primary depression is essential for the pathodynamics of symbiontic psychoses because the delusional structure of the primary depression, its compositional elements and especially the delusional motif are decisive for the transformation of a symbiosis which is still stable into a pathological we-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1976
The present study considered the meaning of these qualitative factors in terms of their relationships to four types of information potentially important to understanding the development or maintenance of delusions--sex gender, intelligence, chronicity, and type of depression (e.g., persecution, grandeur).	synthetic_delusion	1979
Psychological research because of its public nature fails to meet the necessary requirements for successful depression and overtly or covertly must rely on illusion.	synthetic_delusion	1978
The apotemnophiliac obsession represents an ide fixe rather than a paranoid depression.	synthetic_delusion	1978
One (illusion) is cooperatively produced; the other (depression) is imposed.	synthetic_delusion	1977
The presuicide syndrome of such double suicides is described with two cases, one at the psychopathological borderline to a symbiontic psychosis, the other on the culmination of it (depression of influence and reference).	synthetic_delusion	1978
Systematic collection of art products from 55 schizophrenic patients provided unexpected documentation of the impact of television on depression-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1976
This is seen to have consequences for organizational self-learning and self-depression, and for the maintenance of organizational credibility and organizational secrets.	synthetic_delusion	1977
After a presentation of environmental reactions on depression, personality traits and mutual dependence in the predominance-subordination relationship of the partners of delusional symbioses are pointed out.	synthetic_delusion	1979
It was concluded that the general cultural beliefs, rather than the immediate environment, play a dominant role in determining the contents of depression.	synthetic_delusion	1976
Only the productive interpretation can relate the links between the diegetic elements of the utterance to the ensuing reading effects the words of which diachronically constitute a depression.	synthetic_delusion	1975
depression of skin-parasitosis is a very characteristic disorder, and it can appear as an independent syndrome or as a concomitant phenomenon of other psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_delusion	1975
Emphasis is laid on the finding that the proportion of consanguineous persons within the sample of patients who showed an induced depression of parasitosis is by far less high than in other psychopathological forms of communicated insanity.	synthetic_delusion	1976
Sexual attitudes characterized by sexual guilt, emphasis on personal and social control of sexual expression, and depression of sex were significantly positively correlated (p<.001) with attitudes that typified women in terms of traditional masculinefeminine stereotypes and good (nonsexual)bad (sexual) dichotomies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1977

The theoretical distinction between psychopathology based on intrapsychic conflict and psychopathology rooted in a developmental arrest is applied to an analysis of death anxiety, hypochondriasis and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1977
Genetic and dynamic aspects of depression are noted along with the relationship between dream and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1978
The defensive modifications of the functions of the ego itself seen in micropsia are closely allied to those seen in the dj vu experience and in depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1977
The author speculates that early efforts to deal with traumatic experience at a time when the distinction between sleeping and waking states is not secure may lead to the symptom choice of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1979
A review of the literature relating to multiple personality is presented together with a study of a single case of hysterical aetiology that demonstrates the development of multiple personality from a depression amnesic state.	synthetic_fugue	1975
The principles were illustrated and extended using Rorschach and Hand Test data from a depression state.	synthetic_fugue	1979
The program has been applied to the task of analysing the metric structure of the forty-eight depression subjects of the Well-Tempered Clavier by J S Bach.	synthetic_fugue	1977
The view that multiple personality is a form of depression, not necessarily hysterical, in which an alternative personality is adopted and that this behaviour is reinforced by the attention that it receives, is discussed.	synthetic_fugue	1975
depression, disturbances in social relations and activities, and lack of needed social support were shown and reported frequently.	synthetic_irritation	1976
Results indicated that individuals in these groups were more reluctant to honk their horns at the confederate and showed fewer overt sjgns of depression than subjects in two control groups not exposed to such treatments.	synthetic_irritation	1975
ZnIN females sniffed less and groomed more often and for more total time than ZnIP or AIR females, effects attributed to nasal depression and impaired olfaction.	synthetic_irritation	1975
depression, depression, lack of concentration, sleep disturbances, anxiety, tension, and restlessness were frequently reported as abstinence symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	1975
Goal blocking produced self-reported depression that increased with time, and lower levels of facial regard, gesturing, and positive head nodding.	synthetic_irritation	1975
Findings indicated that such stresses as under-utilization of skills, job insecurity, role conflict and ambiguity, variation in work load, and lack of participation had moderate to high relationships with the psychological strains of anxiety-depression-depression, psychosomatic symptoms, and job dissatisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	1976
It was recommended to half the subjects in each condition that they apply a cream which was described as producing minimal skin depression (low aversiveness), while half the subjects received recommendations to apply a cream described as producing considerable skin depression (high aversiveness).	synthetic_irritation	1976
This paper, based on a study of pediatric emergency room records and on clinical experience, suggests that sexual misuse of children often goes unrecognized, and that this diagnosis must be considered in all children seen for genital injury, depression, and infection.	synthetic_irritation	1975
During the anticipation interval high and low sociallyanxious subjects displayed similar HR and SC responses, but differed significantly in patterns of finger pulse volume (FPV) and selfreported depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1978
This discomfort was characterized by anxiety, depression, and mild somatic complaints.	synthetic_nervousness	1978
Self-ratings of 'depression' were not significantly correlated with either pre-exam glucose or pre-exam lactic acid.	synthetic_nervousness	1976
Tests of linearity indicated that activation and depression increased as size of audience increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
Although the stated goal of the organization is to reduce depression and solve emotional problems of members, there is no recognition of successful termination of membership.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
Likewise, selfreports of cognitively experienced depression displayed a positively accelerating pattern of increase as the time of performance approached.	synthetic_nervousness	1977
depression and activation levels were rated by subjects as well as members of an audience.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
Five main factors were extracted: Factor I--General health status; Factor II--Sociopathic character disorders; Factor III--Mixed psychiatric symptoms; Factor IV--Anxiety state with psychosomatic symptoms and general depression; and Factor V--Schizophrenicity.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
As performance became imminent, high sociallyanxious subjects evidenced increased vasoconstriction and reported greater depression than low sociallyanxious subjects.	synthetic_nervousness	1978
In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and depression to the E were just as distressed by the veridical source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
The outstanding characteristic of the speech and language of abused children Is the style of their communication as a result of the emotional and physical depression of the abuse.	synthetic_trauma	1975
The parentchild estrangement continues for years after the depression with an extremity and severity that often necessitates court intervention.	synthetic_trauma	1979
Propose insight simplified organisation to prevent early brain injuries and early psychological depression: the home of parents and child.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Discrepancies between these findings and those reported by other investigators are attributed to the use of young children as participants in other studies, the absence of discernible premorbid factors that have been associated with post-depression adjustment difficulties in other investigations and possible differential effectiveness of psychological intervention during hospitalization.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Implicit in recent social science research and political discussions is a model linking the economy to mental_disorder through the intervening constructs of life change and depression.	synthetic_trauma	1979
The use of paraverbal therapy, a specialized therapeutic approach, is described in the short-term treatment of patients exhibiting emotional disturbances secondary to illness or depression.	synthetic_trauma	1976
This reactivated a former successfully repressed depression and acted as a precipitating factor to the development of a traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	synthetic_trauma	1976
The results indicate that many people did experience a depression that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	synthetic_trauma	1977
In addition to the individual depression experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social depression due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Attention is called to the consequences of such emotions from the forensic view-point and the need to ascertain and specify the nature and intensity of the emotional depression and the actual state of anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1978
This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by depression, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the evidence for dual deficits of recognition and perception.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the depression severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was considered imperative.	synthetic_trauma	1977
The depression--Stren (T-S) conversion procedure was examined at a large state university and the construct related to personality and cognitive process variables.	synthetic_trauma	1979
These differences may reflect differential effects of the Nonaccidental-depression and Failure-to-Thrive conditions.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Nonaccidental-depression children had Mental and Motor Scale range scores, as determined by differences between basal and ceiling items on the Mental and Motor scales, that were a function of measured Mental and Motor Index Scores.	synthetic_trauma	1976
This study sought to focus on the significant life experiences of an adult sample (n = 45, ages 30-60); in particular, stress, traumas, and depression-resolved experiences were examined and compared to like experiences of an undergraduate sample.	synthetic_trauma	1976
In addition, the Infant Behavior Record of the Bayley Scales revealed behavior ratings of Nonaccidental-depression and Failure-to-Thrive children that differed from Mental and Motor Scale scores on several dimensions.	synthetic_trauma	1979
This study was a repetition of Black's work with the MFD on a population that differed from Black's in that they were predominantly non-depression cases, the majority of whom were not neurophysiologically normal when tested with the MFD.	synthetic_trauma	1976
The postrelease depression thesis is that during the time immediately following release from prison the offender faces particular stress, which often cul minates in renewed criminal activity.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Connections are also made between the oedipally determined lie and an infantile primal-scene depression.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Control observations indicate that these effects cannot be accounted for by food and water deprivation or by operative depression.	synthetic_trauma	1975
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer depression as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific depression is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Compared to controls, children who were diagnosed as victims of Nonaccidental depression or Failure to Thrive had depressed Bayley Scale Mental Index scores, p less than .002 and p less than .0001, respectively.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Interesting connections between birth depression and the rheumatic diatheses should be pursued - as should those between severe birth compression and subsequent chorea and disseminated lupus erythematosus.	synthetic_trauma	1975
The traumatic shock in the temporal meaning of the word (temporal event), more than the depression itself, has disturbing and disynchronizing effects which are pathogenic.	synthetic_trauma	1975
More generally, they suggest that the postrelease depression thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_trauma	1978
On the Motor Scale, range scores of Nonaccidental-depression children in the high-low Motor Index score conditions did not differ.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Because the emotional depression associated with a mastectomy exceeds the physical depression, the recovery of the woman is greatly affected by the response of her husband or lover.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain depression (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	synthetic_trauma	1978
This is taken as an indicator that prolonged stress, as constant fear of death, may cause brain damage without physical depression.	synthetic_trauma	1979
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding depression of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Specifically, Nonaccidental-depression children with lower Mental Index scores had higher Mental Scale range scores than Nonaccidental-depression children with higher Mental Index scores, p less than .003.	synthetic_trauma	1975
The disorganizing effect of the depression of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	synthetic_trauma	1977
This enhanced FE in septals is at variance with predictions from frustration theory considering the greater resistance to extinction in septals and suggests a depression between the immediate and conditionable effects of frustration in such animals.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
The chlordiazepoxide animals not only failed to extinguish but showed a slight increment that was interpreted as being due to a depression of learning effect.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
The relatively high performance of posterior aphasics on the connotation test, along with the lack of correlation between connotative and denotative scores received by aphasic patients, suggest a behavioral and neurological depression between the two forms of musical sensitivity.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
This depression of interdimensional and dimensional control, as well as the failure of interdimensional training to produce dimensional control in Experiment I, suggests that the line stimulus is multidimensional.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
Two right-handed patients with clinical evidence of major infarction in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery developed a profound but transient aphasia characterized by a striking depression between intact repetition and grossly disturbed spontaneous conversational speech, an absence of phonemic paraphasia, a lack of speech inhibition and relative preservation of conformation naming and comprehension.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
Consequently, the behavioral depression cannot be explained by differences in attention, motivation, response inhibition, or the type of stimuli to be remembered.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
The results demonstrated partial depression of somatic and cardiac activity under the present experimental conditions.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
Findings suggest a clear depression between DAF effects in unilateraly lesioned patients due to the nature of the stimulus material and its difficulty level.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
4 equivalent groups of subjects, each group comprising 6 levels of schooling (first, second, third, sixth, and ninth grades and undergraduate students), were presented with 4 different tasks of surface-volume depression in order to see whether or not the conservation of 1 of these 2 properties (surface area or volume) of an object would wrongly induce a belief in the conservation of the other (pseudoconservation).	synthetic_dissociation	1977
There was no significant and progressive age-related difference in either depression constant or binding capacity for insulin in heart and liver, or for growth hormone in liver.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
depression of rates of 40-Hz EEG recorded from scalp leads and 40-Hz EMG responses from prominent muscle contaminators, and partial depression of 40-Hz and 21- to 31-Hz EEG responses were noted.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
This abatement of the depression was near total when the adrenalectomized animals received their training trial in the normal state and their test trial in the postconvulsive state; on the other hand, a significantly less satisfactory abatement was seen in adrenalectomized animals trained in the postconvulsive state but test in the normal state.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
This negative shift was considered identical to the N1 enhancement of Hillyard and his colleagues which in the present study was forced, by the longer inter-stimulus interval used, to demonstrate temporal depression with the N1 component.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
Therefore, our finding of an age-dependent change in the young chicks habituation of locomotor activity suggests that the precocial chick, like the altricial rat, shows an ontogenetic depression in habituation of elicited and emitted responses.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
depression between subjective-behavioral arousal and plasma cortisol during flooding may be a manifestation of what behavior therapists call desynchrony of fear.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
However, evidence of depression of HR and RR was obtained in the HR RR= and HR RR= groups in which HR changed significantly in the appropriate directions without significant changes in RR.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
Jewish ethno-reliqious history is analyzed as one pole of an interdependent Judeo-Christian system of opposition and symbiosis, in which reciprocal depression and projective identification function homeostatically to make history recur and to perpetuate what are ostensibly separate traditions.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
In the first experiment, it was demonstrated that a convulsion provoked from a kindled amygdala focus 10 min before a trial produced a state of depression for a one-trial inhibitory avoidance response.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
This depression between word and pseudoword identification indicates the operation of two independent encoding mechanisms during tachistoscopic recognition, a stimulus-specific or logogenlike system sensitive to particular familiar strings and an orthographic mechanism sensitive to generally applicable constraints on letter sequencing.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
In some patients, male-female ambivalence alternates in a kind of Jekyll-Hyde depression until the fourth or fifth decde of life, at which time it changes into a unitary compulsion to undergo a sex reassignment, and which first must be resolved if reassignment is to be successful.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
In the second experiment, it was shown that bilateral adrenalectomy alleviated the state-dependent recall deficit in the depression paradigm.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
To assess the influence of circadian rhythmicity on conditioned taste aversion in rats, two vivaria (with the illumination cycle in one vivarium phase shifted 12 hours with respect to the other) were used to permit depression of rhythmic environmental (laboratory) activity from the influence of the illumination cycle.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
The disorder manifests itself as the disappearance of inner liveliness and as a diffuse depression of the entire representional world, which I have characterized as the disappearance of psychic transparence.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
The daily hyperdipsic rats drank normally in response to NaCl and PG, demonstrating a depression between daily drinking and drinking in response to specific thirst stimuli.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
This finding suggests the occurrence of a state dependent discrimination response: an instance of asymmetrical depression.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
A 3-factor solution gave a strong general hypnotic factor, best represented by challenge items, a second ideomotor passive factor, and a third factor which could represent either a diaculty or a depression dimension.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
The data were interpreted to support state dependent learning theory presenting a case of asymmetrical depression.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
Additional depression between the two CNV components was evident in their distribution on the scalp.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
In contrast to sensory limbic disconnection which results in depression of stimuli from affective values, it is suggested that the epileptic process effects sensory limbic hyperconnection, leading to a suffusion of experience with emotional coloration.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
The results are discussed in terms of a possible functional depression of EEG arousal within the alpha frequency band.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
A depression also appeared in self-reports of positive versus negative mood states, suggesting the existence of a malfunction in these normally inhibitory affective mechanisms.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
Between Q1 and Q4, P3 amplitude decreased, while SW amplitude increased, demonstrating behavioral and depression of the two waves.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
Individual differences were noted in departures from the average findings, with no evidence for performances of any Ss improved substantially by hypnotic depression.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
In contrast, a marked depression was found when the memory requirements were altered.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
The experiments are discussed in the broader context of depression of various indices of fear in humans.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
In each experiment the results of additional control groups equated with the flooded groups for nonreinforced CS exposure also revealed a depression between the effectiveness of this CS time control procedure in hastening avoidance response extinction and in reducing the CER.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
Thus there was a depression between the rhythms of activity and behavioral receptivity following photoperiod reversal, suggesting that two circadian thythms that are thought to be regulated by a common circadian system can become uncoupled from each other.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
This depression between objective and subjective behavior indicates that the subjects acted according to the drugs which they had taken but felt according to what they believed they had received.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
It was suggested that in the 13sec PI, retarded Ss exhibited a depression between somatic and autonomic response systems which might he related to an information processing deficit in tasks of extended duration.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
Objective bilateral arm movement in the conditioned direction, subjective reports of feelings of depression and lightness, and qualitative characteristics of experimental subjects behavior led to the conclusion that hypnotic behavior was conditioned to the trigram.	synthetic_heaviness	1979
Humor increased as a function of the incongruity between the expected Co and the actual Co. The depression of the actual Co determined the degree of incongruity.	synthetic_heaviness	1977
The perceived relative depression of objects was manipulated by instructing 13 subjects to lift them gently or vigorously, as was predicted by the motor theory of weight judgment and the known behavior of proprioceptors.	synthetic_heaviness	1977
In the course of this paper the relation of the hysteric affection to witchcraft, demonic possession, St Vitus' dance (chorea), hypochondria and depression is also noted.	synthetic_melancholy	1976
Besides many similarities between the two groups, there were also symptomatological differences observed, e.g. the agitated type of involutional depression occurred twice as often in Canada as in Hungary, the apathetic cases were rarer in Canada, and the illness began earlier among Canadian women.	synthetic_melancholy	1977

depression as an intrapsychological and interpersonal experience is used as an integrative and amplifying procedure in relation to biofeedback mechanism and behavior therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1978
The depression manipulation results were consistent with the hypothesis that expectations and beliefs about a self-control response may be at the heart of what makes Stress Inoculation Training effective.	synthetic_hypnosis	1979
This paper attempted to (a) introduce the notions of relief and relaxation as they relate to the framework of elicitation theory; (b) emphasize and exploit that aspect of the theory that deals with the extinction of learned behavior, especially behavior that is in some way mediated by aversive stimuli; and (c) show how the data and theory probably relate to: high resistance to extinction of some fears and avoidance responses, generalized depression and its treatment, implosive therapy or flooding, and relief therapy.	synthetic_anxiety	1977
Repeated measures of subjective depression and pulse rate indicated that (a) the threat manipulation was effective in increasing stress, (b) redefinition occurring before the onset of threat was effective in eliminating stress, and (c) redefinition occuring after the onset of threat was ineffective in reducing stress.	synthetic_anxiety	1977

Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of depression and frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1975
