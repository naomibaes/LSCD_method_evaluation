L.A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model that groups symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 subtypes: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of somatic tension and arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety, and symptoms of trauma and low Positive Affect that are specific to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Levels of trauma were similar to those reported in acutely depressed patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
L. A. Clark and D.
