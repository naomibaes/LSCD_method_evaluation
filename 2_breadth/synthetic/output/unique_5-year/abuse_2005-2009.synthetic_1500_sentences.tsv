Through centuries of warfare, violence, disease, subjugation, and abuse for basic human rights and freedom, the indigenous Chamoru people have been wounded and defeated in innumerable ways.	synthetic_disregard	2007
Because the widespread aversion to secularism today is in no small degree the responsibility of secularists themselves--Freud's relatively crude and simplistic abuse of some of the deepest yearnings of humankind is a case in point--it is time to formulate, using the work of Hans Loewald, a more sensitive and sophisticated psychoanalytic view of religion.	synthetic_disregard	2009
A person who free-associates enters a particular state of consciousness characterized by increased subjective self-awareness and abuse for reality, together with implicit pulls for objective self-awareness and reality adherence.	synthetic_disregard	2005
These results suggest that cruelty to animals may be an early manifestation of the subgroup of children developing conduct problems associated with traits of low empathy and callous abuse rather than the more common pathway of externalizing problems and parenting problems.	synthetic_disregard	2008
Determining how one appears to observers requires one to utilize public information that is available to observers, but to abuse private information that they do not possess.	synthetic_disregard	2009

abuse for rules, an important dimension of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders, is frequent during early childhood, but the development of its chronic form has not been studied during this key socialization period.	synthetic_disregard	2006
The failure to index asset limits has had little effect on participation, but the indexation of both asset and income abuse limits would have raised the SSI participation rate of aged households by about 30.	synthetic_disregard	2009
This article demonstrates how HIV disclosure laws abuse or discount the effectiveness of universal precautions and safer sex, criminalize activities that are central to harm reduction efforts, and offer, as an implicit alternative to risk reduction and safer sex, a disclosure-based HIV transmission prevention strategy that undermines public health efforts.	synthetic_disregard	2009
Although attenuated, such components were present when T1 was composed of a pair of symbols that subjects could abuse.	synthetic_disregard	2008

We suggest that 18-24-month-olds' abuse of colour, seen previously in reorientation tasks (Hermer & Spelke, 1994), may represent a general phenomenon, likened to uneven integration between the dorsal and ventral streams in early development.	synthetic_disregard	2007
The first problem concerns the abuse for the changes in line management that comes with HR devolution.	synthetic_disregard	2008
It remains unclear how impulsive individuals interpret the situations that may contribute to their unplanned, rapid reactions with abuse to the consequences of behaviour.	synthetic_disregard	2008
Previous studies have shown that instructing participants to abuse a stereotype may lead to enhanced accessibility of that stereotype, which in turn facilitates the encoding and identification of stereotype-consistent information, but not of stereotype-irrelevant information.	synthetic_disregard	2008
The problem implied by such decisiveness, namely, the universal abuse of the preferences of the minority, can be ameliorated by applying unbiased scoring rules such as the classical Borda rule, but such amelioration has a price; it implies erosion in the implementation of the widely accepted majority principle.	synthetic_disregard	2007
This study aimed to describe the developmental trajectories of abuse for rules during early childhood and identify prenatal and postnatal predictors for a high trajectory.	synthetic_disregard	2007
This abuse was mainly due to the husbands' involvement in extramarital sexual affairs.	synthetic_disregard	2007

Major outcome variables were self-rating scales (e.g., tinnitus abuse assessed by the Tinnitus Questionnaire), and diary data (self-control, daily time of perceiving the tinnitus).	synthetic_annoyance	2009
The present findings and accompanying literature review challenge the simplistic notion that boredom is never more than a trivial abuse resulting from an under-stimulating environment.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
Results did not support the greater efficacy of the video condition in reducing psychosocial distress (eg, negative affect, upset and abuse following behavior problems) or increasing positive affect or caregiving self-efficacy.	synthetic_annoyance	2006
All parameters influenced both perceived urgency and abuse (p < .05), with pulse duration, interpulse interval, alert duty cycle, and sound type influencing urgency substantially more than abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	2006
To explore this type of indirect effects, the relationship between noise exposure, income and noise abuse is investigated a step further in this paper.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
A proposed model of the influence of visual attitude on noise abuse, also comprising the influence of noise level and general attitude, was tested among respondents who could see vs. respondents who could not see wind turbines from their homes, living in flat vs. hilly/rocky terrain, and living in built-up vs. rural areas.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
Visual attitude towards the noise source was associated with noise abuse to different degrees in different situations.	synthetic_annoyance	2009
Accordingly, biofeedback treatment targeting physiological activity ought to reduce tinnitus abuse and facilitate habituation.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
We hypothesize that semantically similar emotions (e.g. abuse and rage) lead to different behavioural reactions and have a different functionality in an organizational context.	synthetic_annoyance	2008
Factor analyses revealed four benefit factors (impression management, pleasure, thrill, and sense of control), four costs (distress, damage to self-esteem, abuse, life endangerment), and four self-image factors (cautious, courteous, confident, and impulsive driver).	synthetic_annoyance	2007
A negative visual attitude, more than multi-modal effects between auditory and visual stimulation, enhanced the risk for noise abuse and possibly also prevented psychophysiological restoration possibilities.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
A social allergy is a reaction of hypersensitive abuse or disgust to a repeated behavior.	synthetic_annoyance	2006
With respect to income as a possible modifier of abuse, the previous results that no such moderating effects can be found are confirmed.	synthetic_annoyance	2009
All 3 studies suggest that ruminating about a provocation increases the likelihood that a minor triggering abuse will increase displaced aggression.	synthetic_annoyance	2009
Results from standard multiple regression analyses showed that perceiving fewer barriers (i.e., less boredom, abuse) to engaging in SC/SRT and experiencing less pretreatment sleepiness were each associated with better adherence to SC/SRT.	synthetic_annoyance	2009
While such social status variables have been shown to modify health outcomes they do not have any important effect in noise-abuse studies.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
The applicability of this procedure was demonstrated by applying it to odor abuse from environmental pollution at three sites in communities with steel industry (Study and bio-fuel processing (Study.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
Also, urgency and abuse differentially affect perceived appropriateness of warnings.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
The data indicate that negative emotions such as disappointment, uncertainty, and abuse are typically suppressed, while positive emotions such as enthusiasm, interest, and calmness are typically expressed or faked.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
This study assesses the influence of the auditory characteristics of alerts on perceived urgency and abuse and whether these perceptions depend on the context in which the alert is received.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
The aim was to develop and evaluate a seven-point category scale, called the Environmental abuse Scale (EAS), with semantic descriptors and ratio-scale properties.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
The EAS appears to have properties that approach those of a ratio scale, and to be reliable and valid for assessment of environmental abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
The results provide abuse estimates for each of the six sites expressed in master-scale units and in pyridine equivalents that are directly comparable with each other and with those from other environmental studies using this procedure.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
abuse may merit as much attention as urgency in the design of auditory warnings, particularly in systems that alert drivers to relatively low-urgency situations.	synthetic_annoyance	2009
While the groups differed on future thinking, the difference concerned negative events, which suggests that anxious information processing might be important in explaining tinnitus abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	2006
In addition, participants with tinnitus completed a test of tinnitus abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	2008
Non-patients attributing abuse to either smells (smell annoyed; SA, n= 29) or electrical equipment (electrically annoyed; EA, n= 17), or both (generally annoyed; GA, n= 38), were monitored for 2 weeks through daily self-ratings of arousal (stress), sleep disturbances, health complaints, worry about hypersensitivity reactions, avoidance behaviors, and attributions of health complaints to electrical equipment and smells.	synthetic_annoyance	2008
Results showed clear improvements regarding tinnitus abuse, diary ratings of loudness, and feelings of controllability.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
However, the examination of the abuse associated with the intrusions indicated that those individuals instructed to suppress without confronting the reminder maintained the same level of discomfort reported at baseline, whereas the other participants reduced the discomfort level, suggesting that the confrontation with a reminder is a recommendable strategy for emotion regulation.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
Thus, even at sub-clinical levels, environmental abuse generalized to several triggers seems to be associated with behaviors commonly observed among patients with idiopathic environmental intolerance.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
On the contrary, a higher number of diagnoses was associated with better outcome (statistical trend) and a higher extent of abuse and interference led to a larger positive change in patients if treated by TCT.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
Results were interpreted as suggesting that even in a society where collectivist and conflict-negative values are influential, anger and abuse can be constructively managed through an open-minded discussion of the incident.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
There was strong relationship between perceived urgency and rated appropriateness for high-urgency driving scenarios and a strong relationship between abuse and rated appropriateness for low-urgency driving scenarios.	synthetic_annoyance	2007
These parameters were compared according to their predictive properties for abuse ratings.	synthetic_annoyance	2008
abuse associated with environmental noise has been thoroughly studied, but little research has addressed whether alert parameters differentially affect abuse and urgency.	synthetic_annoyance	2008
Findings indicate that the open-minded discussion (constructive controversy) of the anger and abuse incidents confirms social face and strengthens relationships.	synthetic_annoyance	2005
Names designed for general use employed higher frequency words than did the self-chosen names, which supports the view that the benefit for self-chosen names partly lies in their abuse of idiosyncratic associations.	synthetic_exploitation	2005
