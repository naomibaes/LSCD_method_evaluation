The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory trauma also belongs to the context of the latter.	synthetic_delusion	1989
During the 1983 year all patient presentations to the University of Miami Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES) at Jackson Memorial Hospital, a large county hospital, were screened by the author through patient rounds and chart review for the presence of the Capgras trauma (strictly defined).	synthetic_delusion	1986

Recent literature on cortical changes in trauma and motor improvement during trauma is discussed in relation to the present results.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
It is also shown how these early metalloscopy studies--and especially the discovery by Charcot and his colleagues of so-called metalloscopic 'transfer'--opened the door to the rise of a neo-mesmeric, and increasingly occult, branch of trauma research in French psychiatry, which has to date, in the secondary literature, gone almost wholly unremarked.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988

The results are viewed as compatible with both a social enactment and a neodissociation interpretation of trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988
As a rule it is necessary to hypnotize the patient and to arouse his memories under trauma of the time at which the symptom made its first appearance; when this has been done, it becomes possible to demonstrate the connection in the clearest and most convincing fashion [Breuer & Freud, 1893/1955, p. 3].	synthetic_hypnosis	1988
A factor common to trauma and imagination-based behavior therapies is the use of relaxation and imagination processes.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988

Allocated independent sets of 16 Ss to a crossed 2 (level of susceptibility: high, low) x 2 (information: misleading, nonmisleading) x 2 (state instruction: trauma, walking) design to examine the prediction that trauma will facilitate memory distortion when hypnotic instruction precedes the exposure of Ss to incorrect, misleading information.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988
It suggests that the effects of trauma on memory cannot be ascertained from previous work, because of a general failure to discriminate between effects on the amount of information retrieved from memory and the criterion adopted by Ss for reporting what they remember.	synthetic_hypnosis	1986
The former treatment approaches combine hypnotic techniques with the newer psychoanalytic methods derived from object relations and self-theories; the latter combine trauma with the methods of behavioral medicine and attempt to teach the patient voluntary control over ordinarily involuntary somatic processes.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
trauma or trauma combined with brief restricted environmental stimulation appeared to be effective in 3 of the 4 cases.	synthetic_hypnosis	1987

The use of the N-m-d-aspartate receptor antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid for the pharmacological trauma of kindling and long-term potentiation indicates that long-term potentiation in the perforant path-dentate circuit is critically dependent upon N-m-d-aspartate neurotransmission, but kindling is not.	synthetic_dissociation	1987
The schizophrenia of Bleuler is characterized by psychic trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	1986

The presence of this double trauma demonstrates the functional specificity of perseveration in certain memory and problem solving contexts and suggests that distinct subcortical/frontal mechanisms may underly specific types of perseveration.	synthetic_dissociation	1985
Previous data on trauma studies of [3H]-imipramine and [3H]-paroxetine binding to the human platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) transporter have suggested that the binding is heterogeneous in nature and/or is subject to allosteric modifications through a separate low affinity site.	synthetic_dissociation	1987
In trauma experiments in the presence of the 5-HT uptake inhibitors, the half-time values for trauma were the same, whereas 5-HT slowed the trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	1989
