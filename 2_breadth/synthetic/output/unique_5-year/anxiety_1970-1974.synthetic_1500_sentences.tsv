Spontaneous and suggested phenomena occurring during and after anxiety are utilized to uncover and discover conflicts and defenses, to analyze and synthesize, to test reality, to exploit transference, to supply emotional support, and to trigger corrective emotional experiences.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Freud's attitude and prepsychoanalytic experience with anxiety has been the subject of both historical and clinical significance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Before being retested Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (a) a posthypnotic suggestion condition, (b) a waking suggestion condition, and (c) a anxiety-no-suggestion condition in which Ss were merely dehypnotized without exhortative instructions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The methods and results of both studies were summarized, and the same conclusion was reached: that anxiety supplemented by autohypnosis was significantly more effective than control procedures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Research is reviewed and points are discussed which support a position supporting a relationship between variables and phenomena found in the desensitization therapies and those found in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
While both groups were anticipating these experiences, anxiety was induced.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972

The resulting data were analysed to determine the effects of anxiety and experimental suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
A transcript of successful hypnotherapy for headache is presented, along with commentary regarding the development of mutually satisfying expectations of anxiety during hypnotherapy through the precise definition of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The results supported the 3 predictions made from the hypothesis: (a) The anxiety group (N = 43) showed greater conditioning (p < .01) than the control group (N = 42); (b) the amount of conditioning for the hypnotic group was correlated with hypnotic depth (p < .01); and (c) this conditioned response, once formed, was a strong one, as evidenced by little extinction and the phenomenon of spontaneous recovery.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Combining anxiety and behavior therapy in a manner calculated to strengthen the ego appears to have been the critical therapeutic intervention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The behavior in both artificially induced types of anxiety differed significantly a t the 1 level in the expected direction; the types, however, were not extreme types in the sense of the original assumption.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
This series of investigations began with the strikingly detailed recall, by a trained hypnotic S, of a dream experienced under anxiety over 2 years before.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Previous research has shown that anxiety is a fairly stable phenomenon and recent attempts at improving hypnotic performance after some type of training have had little success.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
anxiety is used to obtain relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The continuing controversy about antisocial behavior and anxiety is seen as related to the manner in which the question is traditionally phrased.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The posthypnotic suggestion group did not differ from the anxiety-no-suggestion group, which also performed more accurately but not more rapidly than the waking suggestion group on the Rational Learning Test.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Certainly, the popular view which holds that anxiety is able to exert a unique form of control over the hypnotized individual, which can compel him to carry out otherwise repugnant actions, must be rejected.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Experiments were carried out to determine the effect of the reexperiencing of exercise and emotionally charged situations using strong suggestion under anxiety and with intravenous sodium amytal on circulating FFA and other physiological variables.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Attitudes concerning the desirability of anxiety are considered for modifying hypnotizability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
This report discusses the first 615 patient-mokera who have been treated with a single 45-minute session of psychotherapy reinforced by anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The role of anxiety in the treatment plan is considered.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
For example, suggestibility and the influence which the hypnotist supposedly can exercise over the subject have been looked upon as essential components in anxiety, yet we do not know to what extent they are real or to what extent they are illusory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
This self-report scale promises to be highly useful in studies of anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
However, significant anxiety effects were found for each of the physiological measures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after anxiety than they were before anxiety, while the low-arousal Ss did not show a reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The paper deals with four main topics, (a) A general characterization of anxiety as an altered state of consciousness. (	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Freud's first reported successful treatment by anxiety included suggestions that have much in common with some recent developments in family systems therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
A trusting relationship with the therapist was developed before anxiety with the delusional patient was begun.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Through anxiety: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
A three-factor theory of anxiety is surveyed in which hypnotic depth is conceived as a complex of 3 separate but complementary processes or dimensions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Specifically M increased in conditions utilizing muscle activation, deactivation, anxiety, and focusing thoughts on the body musculature.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Although these symptoms following laboratory anxiety were not found to be severe, their presence is of importance both for theoretical and practical reasons.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The first phase compared anxiety with and without suggestions for breast growth in six subjects.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
In Session II, Ss were administered the same tests again but after anxiety had been induced and terminated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
during anxiety on two different occasions and once again during the awake state in a subsequent (imagination) session.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
An attempt was made to develop a design to test the influences of three factors on antisocial conduct: the personal relationship with a hypnotist, the S's knowledge that the antisocial act is associated with an experiment, and anxiety by itself.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
This study investigated the effects of verbal reinforcement, delivered during the induction and test suggestion phases of anxiety, on responsiveness to hyponotic suggestions and subjective ratings of the vividness of suggested experiences.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The performance of the pretend group conformed to the expectancy for amnesia significantly better than did the performance of either of the anxiety groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
In three of the subjects a beta adrenergic blocking agent, nethalide, successfully obliterated responses to isoproterenol but did not abolish the responses to the reliving of past experiences under anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
In an attempt to overcome the limitations of employing general personality traits to predict hypnotic performance, this study compared the predictive validity of 2 anxiety-specific mediational attitudes with a general personality trait (internal-external locus of control).	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
No clear evidence exists that this effect is to be attributed to anxiety rather than to standing with eyes closed for an appreciable time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It is suggested that anxiety might best be considered as a multivariate dimension but that, where a single definition is desired, the scales defining the second factor may be the most appropriate.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
In the present study, the relationships of anxiety to a variety of physiological reactivity and threshold measures were studied in a group of 76 psychiatric hospital patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1973
The results suggest that clinical anxiety is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1970
Systematic study of Rado's idea that anxiety plays a central role in the development of schizophrenia has lagged for want of a suitable operational definition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1974
Therefore, seven measures appearing to reflect anxiety were intercorrelated and factor analyzed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1970
In the waking dog, a small dose of morphine (01 mg/kg intravenously) was sufficient to induce a quite appreciable state of sedation which might be more closely related to clinical analgesia than experimental nociception, and to allow for precipitation of clear-cut signs of abstinence (anxiety, tachycardia, tachypnoea, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremors, salivation, urination) when naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected 15 hours later.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Fifty consecutive patients suffering from primary depressiv illness, but excluding those who had a distinct episode of mania, were rated for the presence and degree of certain symptomatology, especially anxiety and retardation.	synthetic_agitation	1973
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (anxiety, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	synthetic_agitation	1970
Relatedly, there was evidence of anxiety by real estate firms attempting to panic residents (especially whites) into selling their homes.	synthetic_agitation	1970
The response was solely decelerative in alert infants but in less alert states of increasing anxiety or increasing somnolence, deceleration lessened and acceleration appeared.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Five minutes of 56C, causes prolonged ultrasonic vocalizations and correlated anxiety in the mothers.	synthetic_agitation	1974
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and anxiety, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	synthetic_agitation	1973
Important differences in the use of other technical terms like anxiety, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	synthetic_agitation	1972
The Opinions About anxiety Scale (OMI) was administered to 157 psychiatrists, residents, nurses, and aides from an urban, short-term psychiatric hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings anxiety rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
Ss were administered the Opinions About anxiety Questionnaire before and after a 20-wk.	synthetic_mental_illness	1972
anxiety rates among the adoptive parents and the adoptive and biological siblings were independent of the adoptees creative ability level.	synthetic_mental_illness	1972
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about anxiety questionnaire (OMI) and a test of knowledge about mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
To determine the scalability of a subjective credibility dimension pertaining to psychometric test-item statements and also whether such a judgmental dimension could be classified as being metathetic or prothetic, student judges made magnitude estimations of the subjective credibility of items on the Opinions about anxiety Scale with respect to a standard item statement (modulus value = 50).	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
Thirty-six repressors and 36 sensitizers were assigned to three test-taking conditions: anxiety, Openness and Honesty, and Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1971
Intercorrelations among scores on the 5 factorially derived dimensions of the Opinions About anxiety Scale (OMI) were computed for 77 female psychiatric attendants at a large state mental hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
In respect of these latter cases the question of delusions, or anxiety-like ideas and the problem of paranoia are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1971
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the anxiety, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	synthetic_delusion	1971
All the substances ingested led to a significant increase in feelings of anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1973
Evidence exists that anxiety is used by normal people as a common mode of coping with altered life experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, anxiety, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
While the predominant type of body experience distortion--anxiety--was increased with these agents, the total distortion following these substances was significantly less than observed in a variety of stress situations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1973
The only consistent alteration of body experience was anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1973
Dreams, anxiety experiences, daydreams, and autobiographies were compared in regard to barrier, penetration, and neutral imagery and action scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
anxiety and sensations of increase in body size were observed to be particularly characteristic of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
Considering all drug groups combined, anxiety correlated significantly with increased fatigue and a decrease in concentration.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
An example of the use of such a scale to measure changes in levels of interpersonal anxiety is given.	synthetic_irritation	1973
A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local anxiety of bronchial mucosa, general state of childs health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states.	synthetic_irritation	1970
In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or anxiety, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.	synthetic_irritation	1973
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, anxiety, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	synthetic_irritation	1973
Correlational and other analyses of psychological data suggest that the local throat anxiety commonly regarded as a side-effect of lobeline lozenges actually plays a central role in discouraging smoking in those persons motivated to continue sucking the lozenges.	synthetic_irritation	1970
The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial anxiety caused by infection or allergies.	synthetic_irritation	1974
Factor analysis of a anxiety inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	synthetic_nervousness	1972
In addition to analyses of specific behavioral differences between deceivers and nondeceivers, the authors provide a conceptual framework for the study of deceptionpredicting that deceivers will exhibit significantly more uncertainty, vagueness, anxiety, reticence, dependence, and unpleasantness than nondeceivers.	synthetic_nervousness	1972
anxiety in Ss receiving the immediate knowledge was also increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1973
Endler, Hunt, and Rosenstein's systematic application of the stimulus-response model in their psychometric study of anxiety provided the impetus and rationale for this work, investigation of the situational dimensions of self-reported anxiety.	synthetic_nervousness	1973
However, there was a significant correlation within the experimental group between depth of relaxation while listening to the recording and absence of anxiety the day of the operation, and also between depth of relaxation and speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
No differences between the 2 groups were found on surgeons ratings of degree of anxiety on the day of the operation, or on speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1971
The concept of anxiety is defined as a noninstrumental change in the vigour of responding brought about by an upward shift in conditions of reward.	synthetic_elation	1970
All of these autonomic variability measures coincided with a significant peak in feelings of anxiety and vigor.	synthetic_elation	1970
