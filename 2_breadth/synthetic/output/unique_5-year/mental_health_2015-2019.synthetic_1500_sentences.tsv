We summarize some of the many reports and discussions of our patient's mental_health, reduplicative paramnesia, as well as other delusional misidentification syndromes.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Many studies did not report whether psychotic symptoms in MD-psych patients were mood-congruent or mood-incongruent; hence it is unclear whether the type of mental_health increases suicide risk.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Participants also completed measures of mental_health proneness, intelligence and risk aversion.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Psychotic phenomena such as mental_health of pregnancy may be a feature in some cases of dementia.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The accuracy of memories of mental_health-like experiences could not be checked making it difficult to distinguish them from delusional memories.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Surprisingly, we found that even low-mental_health-prone participants jumped to conclusions in this absolute sense.	synthetic_delusion	2016
In this study we investigated whether mental_health-prone participants jump to conclusions in both a relative and an absolute sense.	synthetic_delusion	2015
We believe a spectral model will add emphasis to the continuity of experience and help to better understand how one type of psychotic symptom may interact with another, and put forward the argument that the experience of TI itself is not sufficient to classify as a mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The findings suggest that higher mental_health-proneness is already associated with a deviant style of visually attending to facial expressions even in people who do not have a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Recovery in the mental_health was defined as conviction falling below 50 (greater doubt than certainty).	synthetic_delusion	2019
This narrative review will commence by giving an introduction to the basic concept underlying the Bayesian decision theory approach to mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Previous studies reporting an association between reduced evidence integration and delusions used a single measure of mental_health severity, typically to form patient groups.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Case reports of mental_health of pregnancy have emanated from all over the world, yet the rarity of this phenomenology has precluded systematic large scale descriptive or cohort studies.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Importantly, high-mental_health-prone participants also decided in advance of an objective rational optimum, gathering fewer data than would have maximized their expected payoff.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Negative affect and impaired emotion regulation skills are prevalent in patients with delusions and contribute to mental_health formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2018

Additionally, BADE significantly predicted experiential (but not other types of) anomalistic beliefs even after controlling for mental_health proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2018
In this paper I argue for a somewhat more liberal - and, I contend, more productive - conception of confabulation, according to which it is seen not only in amnesia but also in other neuropsychological conditions such as mental_health - and, indeed, even in healthy people.	synthetic_delusion	2018
This finding was independent of mental_health and clinical insight scores at the baseline evaluation.	synthetic_delusion	2019
The participants of this study had only slight elevations of mental_health-proneness, which might explain the absence of differences in trustworthiness ratings.	synthetic_delusion	2017
In this cross-sectional study, self-reported mental_health-like experiences occurred at increased prevalence among community-residing older persons with anxiety disorder.	synthetic_delusion	2015
A mental_health is epistemically innocent when adopting it delivers a significant epistemic benefit, and the benefit could not be attained if the mental_health were not adopted.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Moreover, the severity of delusions in study 1 and mental_health-proneness in study 2 were significantly correlated with vividness, emotional intensity, and centrality of memories of mental_health-like experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2015
We conducted a systematic database search (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, and MEDLINE) and identified relevant articles using the following search items: belief*, mental_health*, or overvalued idea*; psychosis or schizo*; flexib*, inflexib*, change, revision, or update.	synthetic_delusion	2016
High mental_health-prone individuals were expected to show greater difficulty than low mental_health-prone individuals on conflict items of a belief-bias reasoning task (i.e. when required to reason logically about statements that conflicted with reality), but not on non-conflict items.	synthetic_delusion	2015
Lower attendance rates in the control group possibly leading to unequal therapeutic effort; lower baseline mental_health severity in the MCT+ group.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Electronic databases including PubMed, PsychInfo and Google Scholar were used to identify case reports relating to mental_health of pregnancy published in peer-reviewed English language journals.	synthetic_delusion	2018
It is noted that an actual father can be killed and mourned, whereas the symbolic father is always already dead, and can neither be killed nor be mourned except in the crucial sense wherein we are all called to grieve the omnipotent fantasy/phantasy that we might not be castrated--to grieve the mental_health that we might be able to speak from the locus of the phallus, which is the generative position held exclusively by the symbolic father.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Fregoli mental_health involves the belief that strangers are known people in disguise.	synthetic_delusion	2017
When the state identified as a problem self-state is an abuser/protector self-state, complications often involve the profound nature of transferencecountertransference enactments between patient and therapist, the mental_health of separateness, chronic and acute threats of suicide, negative therapeutic reactions, and the evocation of intense negativity.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Hearing distressing voices and feeling very paranoid do not occur because someone has something called schizophrenia that causes them to act in certain ways, although many psychiatrists still cling to this mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2015

Emotional exhaustion and mental_health, the two main dimensions of burnout, may be better conceptualized as depressive responses to adverse occupational environments than as components of a separate entity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Two dimensions of empathy were evaluated to determine if they have an impact on three dimensions of burnout (Emotional Exhaustion/EE, mental_health/DP, Personal Accomplishment/PA).	synthetic_depersonalization	2017

Out of 12 hypothesized interaction effects, only 1 significant interaction was observed, where job resources attenuated the positive association between challenge demands and mental_health between the first and second waves.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
The results show that workload positively affects emotional exhaustion, whereas social support negatively affects mental_health, thus further corroborating the health impairment process and motivation process as assumed by the job demands-resources (JD-R) model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
The results show that the mean scores of emotional exhaustion and mental_health are positively related to the year of data collection, while that of personal accomplishment are negatively related to the year of data collection, indicating that burnout increases steadily over the recent years in Chinese nurses.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Research suggests that members of low-status groups are more likely than members of high-status groups to show self-mental_health and to favor ingroup members over outgroup members.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Based on study findings, emotion regulation skills should be promoted to help individuals with elevated mental_health manage their emotion-oriented coping strategies, anxiety, and emotional overexcitability.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
It was revealed that teachers' emotional exhaustion was negatively related to students' perceived teacher autonomy support (TAS); in turn, there was a negative relationship between teachers' feeling of mental_health and students' autonomous motivation development even when controlling for inadequate TAS.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Moreover, the results do not support the identity threat explanation because self-mental_health and ingroup favoritism were not weaker in the low-status group than in the status-unspecified group.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
This study addressed the primary question: Do nonclinical individuals who endorse high symptomatic mental_health have inherently more intense emotional responses, along with more childhood adversity and past trauma?	synthetic_depersonalization	2018

mental_health modulates pain perception and tolerance by affecting cortical and subcortical activity in brain regions involved in these processes.	synthetic_hypnosis	2016
Because mental_health allows for relaxation, increased suggestibility, posthypnotic suggestion, imagery rehearsal, access to preconscious cognitions and emotions, and cognitive restructuring, disorders of sleep such as the insomnias, parasomnias, and related mood or anxiety disorders can be amenable to this therapeutic intervention.	synthetic_hypnosis	2017
