The findings suggest support for the possibility that the following skill deficits deserve further investigation for their role in depression aetiology and treatment: logical errors including misattributions, poor self-control skills, poor social skills in terms of excessive aggression and deficit assertiveness, and inadequate hedonic capacity in terms of deficit positive interests and excessive negative interests (depression).	synthetic_anhedonia	1985
After considering the problems of quantitative evaluation, we review the literature and conclude that depression appears to be a multi-morphological symptom and the are probably several types of depression, which shows the necessity of developing more specific reliable evaluation instruments and of diversifying the approaches.	synthetic_anhedonia	1987
Schizotypic and control subjects were selected on the basis of their scores on four scales of schizotypy: Physical depression, Perceptual Aberration, Intense Ambivalence, and Somatic Symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1988
It was also predicted that subjects receiving high scores on Physical depression would show lower differentiation than controls.	synthetic_anhedonia	1987
Based on prior research with adults, predictions were made that children with a diagnosis of major depression would evince greater depression on the scale and that anhedonic children (low Pleasure Scale scores) would show a negative attributional style in relation to rewarding experiences.	synthetic_anhedonia	1985
Certain non-regressive symptoms such as brooding, depression and concentration difficulties were less common.	synthetic_anhedonia	1986

Actual/own: ideal/own discrepancy (AI) was uniquely related to dejection, frustration, and anger at self as measured 2 months later; actual/own:ought/other discrepancy (AOO) was uniquely related to depression and to anger at others and resentment.	synthetic_agitation	1988
Maternal separation in young pigtail (M. nemestrina) monkeys results in an depression-depression reaction that is a useful animal model of the behavioral and physiological consequences and separation and loss experiences in humans.	synthetic_agitation	1988
Some individuals displayed negative side effects such as tension, depression, insomnia, and sweating during the 16-week period they received fenfluramine.	synthetic_agitation	1987
A differential semiological analysis in relation to three conceptual pairs, chosen because of their key positions (depression-excitation, motor weakness-dyspraxia, personality problems-psychopathy) shows that it's sometimes impossible to clearly separate instability-hyperkinesia from these other concepts, insofar as they have been blown out of proportion and deformed.	synthetic_agitation	1989
We report two cases of recovering brain injury patients with difficult-to-treat destructive behaviour, whose depression and aggression responded to amantadine.	synthetic_agitation	1987
Results indicate that depression is prevalent among all types of nursing home residents and that cognitively impaired residents exhibit more depression than cognitively intact residents.	synthetic_agitation	1986
The data also showed that daytime depression was positively related to nighttime depression.	synthetic_agitation	1985
In all analyses, depression was observed less often when the full moon was full than during the other three lunar phases, although differences were not statistically significant.	synthetic_agitation	1987

The type and content of depression was assessed in each patient at each psychotic episode.	synthetic_delusion	1989
The author hypothesizes that erotomania, or de Clrambault's syndrome, occurs in two forms: the clinically accepted delusional erotomania, in which patients believe that another person is in love with them; and borderline erotomania, in which no depression is present, yet an extreme disorder of attachment is apparent in the pursuit of, and in the potential for violence toward, the unrequited love object.	synthetic_delusion	1985
In this paper we deal with one aspect of the symptomatology: the depression on the part of the anorectic patient of being normal or overweight.	synthetic_delusion	1989
The clinical characteristics of this depression are described and its concept, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, course and also possible mechanism are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1986
From a large series of patients with delusional psychoses, first-time admitted to the Psychiatric Department, University of Oslo, hypochondriacal delusions were coded as the main depression in 15 patients (0.4 of all admissions).	synthetic_delusion	1989
depression subsided in all three delusional entities in about 50 of the cases; however, defect develops in unsystematic paraphrenias more often to a statistically highly significant degree than in the other two forms.	synthetic_delusion	1985
When the instructor overtly turns the crank and, in synchrony, covertly operates another mechanism to wave the flag, the students develop a strong depression from the mere correlation of the two observed events that turning the crank causes the flag to wave.	synthetic_delusion	1988
The phenomenon of lycanthropy is most appropriately regarded as a depression, but the abnormal subjective experience is stressed, not just the falsely-held belief.	synthetic_delusion	1988

Nowadays what can we tell about Cotard's syndrome and clinical form of melancholia also called depression of negation?	synthetic_delusion	1985
The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory depression also belongs to the context of the latter.	synthetic_delusion	1988
The central symptom in the case history is the depression that the patient has already lived through this life once.	synthetic_delusion	1988
This depression appears as the experience of reduplication, differing from that of dj vu, based on mental automatism.	synthetic_delusion	1985
In Japan, 5 (2.8) of 178 schizophrenic patients had such delusions, accounting for 3.0 of all 166 patients with some depression.	synthetic_delusion	1986
This depression concerns the generation of parents, sisters, but not the offspring.	synthetic_delusion	1989
Accordingly, it seems that, although the depression of world destruction, as a form of world catastrophe, is rare, it occurs among schizophrenic patients at a rather constant incidence, irrespective of the culture or area.	synthetic_delusion	1987
Course and outcome are mainly dependent on the diagnostic category, not the type of depression.	synthetic_delusion	1985
A comparison is made with the psychoanalytic theory of paranoid depression, because that appears to be the only extant theory with which a comparison can be made.	synthetic_delusion	1985

It has been said that the depression of world destruction (Weltuntergangserlebnis) in schizophrenia is closely related to Christian culture, and is less frequent in Oriental than in Western countries.	synthetic_delusion	1988
The case offered a particularly clear example of derailment of the developmental process of self-differentiation, leading to the formation of a highly pathological introject and depression of merger.	synthetic_delusion	1985
During the 1983 year all patient presentations to the University of Miami Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES) at Jackson Memorial Hospital, a large county hospital, were screened by the author through patient rounds and chart review for the presence of the Capgras depression (strictly defined).	synthetic_delusion	1987
Despite the expected low stability of affective symptoms over longer periods of time, the presence of affective syndromes has a high prognostic value, even in a population characterized primarily by the presence of a mood-incongruent depression.	synthetic_delusion	1986
Among the psychiatric staff, high emotional exhaustion and depression were found.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
Additional analyses supported a reconceptualization of burnout and the MBI, one that regards exhaustion as the essence of burnout and treats accomplishment and depression as related variables, but not as elements of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to develop frequency data in the areas of emotional exhaustion, depression, and personal achievement.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
The anxiety effects of visual stimuli are correlated with the extent to which subjects experience depression and somatic symptoms of agoraphobia, but not correlated with depression or the behavioural or cognitive aspects of agoraphobia.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
Emotional exhaustion was found to have occurred less often when a person's social support network within the setting was not concentrated solely within the formal work subgroup, personal accomplishment was enhanced by an ambiguous role structure, and depression was found to be related primarily to a person's values toward personal relationships and work and to be more prevalent among those with concentrated networks and ambiguously structured roles.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
A study is described combining the outgroup homogeneity hypothesis, which predicts greater perceived homogeneity in outgroups than ingroups, with the depression hypothesis derived from selfcategorization theory, which predicts greater perceived homogeneity in both in and outgroups as social identity becomes salient particularly along those dimensions most relevant to the categorization criterion.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
Item factor analysis of the 22 MBI items resulted in two independent factors, one defined by the Emotional Exhaustion and depression items, the other by the Personal Accomplishment items.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
Independent observers were most sensitive to residents' emotional exhaustion and less likely to assess accurately the less visible aspects of burnout related to depression and lack of achievement, which suggests the usefulness of multiple measures for assessing the burnout phenomenon.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
Scores on the scale for this sample of nurses were comparable with those in other studies, except that depression scores were lower.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
In addition, a significant gender difference revealed that male coaches scored higher in both the frequency and intensity dimensions of the depression subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
As in the instance of other factor analytic studies with the MBI, the three hypothesized constructs of burnout described as emotional exhaustion, depression, and personal accomplishment were clearly defined in all factor solutions irrespective of whether the items were scored for frequency or intensity.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is a widely used measure of three specific aspects of the burnout syndrome-namely; emotional exhaustion, depression, and lack of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
Public service lawyers in the U.S. (N= 391) completed a survey designed to assess (a) three components of burnout, namely, emotional exhaustion, depression, and feelings of low personal accomplishment; (b) perceptions of several job conditions predicted to be associated these three components of burnout, including workload, role conflict, social support, decisionmaking policies, and autonomy; and (c) organizational commitment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
Concerning the three measures of burnout, school psychologists reported midrange perceptions of burnout along the Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment dimensions and the second lowest level of burnout for depression, the second aspect of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
The results in the entire sample suggest that EDR-HR depends on the phasic component (amplitude and spontaneous activity) of the electrodermal response as well as on state anxiety, extraversion and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
