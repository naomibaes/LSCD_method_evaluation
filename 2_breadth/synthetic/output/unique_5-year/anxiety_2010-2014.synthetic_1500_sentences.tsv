The evaluation of the severity of anxiety-like experiences and beliefs is important in discriminating patients diagnosed with psychosis from people who are not in need of care.	synthetic_delusion	2014
Based on studies revealing dopamine dysfunction in addiction research, it has been suggested that phasic or chaotic firing of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the (ventral) striatum attribute salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli and thus contribute to delusional mood and anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	2013
For example, in the Capgras anxiety, the patient sees someone who looks like a loved one, but who feels unfamiliar, so they infer that they must not be the loved one.	synthetic_delusion	2012
A total of 59 patients diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder completed a self-focused attention scale ( M. F. Scheier & C. S. Carver, 1985 ), the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (M. Sierra & G. E.

A key distinction exists between polythematic anxiety (here the patient exhibits delusional beliefs about a variety of topics that are unrelated to each other) and monothematic anxiety (here the patient exhibits just a single delusional belief or else a small set of delusional beliefs that are all related to a single theme).	synthetic_delusion	2014
These include: evidence for excitatory activity underlying self-organizing neural ensembles that support coordinating functions, and their impairment in schizophrenia; evidence regarding hallucinations that suggest they are not due to excessive prediction error; and the critical role of emotional factors as setting conditions for anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	2010
These findings have important implications for understanding mirror agnosia and the mirrored-self misidentification anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2013
Further, statistical comparisons between patients with high vs. low qEEG indices (median-split) were undertaken regarding symptom severity of core depression, sleep, activity, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, and anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2010
Seven individuals had episodes of delusional psychosis and four others were for periods of time suspected of anxiety development.	synthetic_delusion	2011
The data support the assumption that the formation of persecutory delusions might arise as a function of a anxiety-specific JTC-bias in combination with a normal and functional tendency to collect less information in self-relevant situations.	synthetic_delusion	2011
The findings suggest that anxiety-prone individuals are less appreciative of the importance of sample size when making statistical judgments about heterogeneous properties; this may underpin the data gathering bias observed in previous studies.	synthetic_delusion	2012
PSYRATS anxiety conviction as well as jumping to conclusions showed significantly greater improvement in the MCT group.	synthetic_delusion	2014
The crucial feature was the evolution or longitudinal change in the clinical picture over time, with the clinical course being divided into five stages: stage I (prodromal depression), stage II (anxiety and agitation), stage III (hallucination and anxiety), stage IV (catatonia syndrome), and residual state.	synthetic_delusion	2012

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship among HIV health-care providers' burnout (emotional exhaustion and anxiety) and organizational culture including teamwork, involvement in decision-making, and critical appraisal.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
Regression analysis revealed that emotional exhaustion can be predicted by satisfaction with the job itself and with the principal subscales; anxiety is predicted by satisfaction with the job and with prospective promotions; personal accomplishment is predicted by satisfaction with the job itself as well as by an EI factor, optimism/ mood regulation and a demographic variable, age.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
The role of anxiety/derealization in the maintenance of social anxiety should be more thoroughly recognized and explored.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014

A dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined by the presence of anxiety or derealization in addition to other PTSD symptoms, is being recommended, based upon new epidemiological and neuroimaging evidence linking it to an early life history of adversity and a combination of frontal activation and limbic inhibition.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Consistent with a theory of emotional burnout development, this significant decrease in emotional exhaustion from T2 to T4 in the ACT group appeared to prevent the significant T3 to T4 increase in anxiety seen in the control group.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Organizational tenure, job stress, and workfamily conflict were found to be associated with the development of emotional exhaustion, while age, workfamily conflict, and organizational support were related to the development of anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011

Principal components analysis of item-level Q-Sort data yielded two anxiety (dismissing vs. free to evaluate and preoccupied vs. not) and two inferred experience (maternal and paternal) components that were associated with two domains of theoretical significance to attachment theory: interpersonal functioning in a romantic context and symptoms of psychopathology.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
The paper also discusses the dilemma for the therapist of whether a thoughtful anxiety and emotional connectedness are always in the interest of the patient's mental_health when the external context is so at odds with this and whether retreating into psychic suspended animation may sometimes be an adaptive response.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2010
Peltz describes the anxiety necessary for such transformational movement as an attitude of receptivity to whatever is about to happen, but never completely comes into being.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
