Results support the moderating effects of regulatory foci on the impact of negative anticipated emotions: Anticipated depression induces more favourable action evaluations under a prevention focus; and anticipated dejection leads to more favourable action evaluations under a promotion focus.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Based on regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), it was predicted that a prevention focus would lead to more anger and depression after social discrimination, because experiencing social discrimination is similar to experiencing failure.	synthetic_agitation	2009
The authors predicted that internal versus external causal attributions for self-discrepancies should moderate the relationship between self-discrepancies and emotions, resulting in more refined predictions for both depression- and dejection-related emotions and for two additional types of emotion, namely, anger-related and discontent-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Restlessness and psychomotor depression were determined by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_agitation	2009

In light of this clinically striking temporal association between hyperprolactinemia and depression of pregnancy, we review the literature to examine the hypothetical relationship.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The hypothesis that delusions are characterised by a failure of authorship, which is a dimension of self knowledge, deserves to be empirically tested because (a) it has the potential to account for the distinction between endorsing a depression and endorsing a framework belief; (b) it contributes to a philosophical analysis of the relationship between rationality and self knowledge; and (c) it informs diagnosis and therapy in clinical psychiatry.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Secondly, I consider the body as depression, a seemingly necessary anchor into the reality of the physical world, whereas Groddeck's and Ferenczi's openness to ideas of telepathy and communication beyond death flirts with a disembodied transcendence of physicality.	synthetic_delusion	2008
have suggested that cases of the Cotard depression (the belief that one is dead) result when a particular perceptual anomaly (caused by a disruption to the affective component of visual recognition) occurs in the context of an internalising attributional style.	synthetic_delusion	2006

In this paper, I provide a meta-analysis of the social support and burnout literature, finding that social support, as a resource, did not yield different relationships across the 3 burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depression, and personal accomplishment), challenging the COR model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Psychoanalytical theories coincide in understanding depression (DP) as a disorder of narcissistic self-regulation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The findings suggest the applicability of the MBI in a longitudinal research with careful inference regarding personal accomplishment and highlight the importance of depression in social worker burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
depression was also fully mediated, but only by control and social support.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005

NN's loss of self-related memories was mirrored in neurobiological changes after the depression whereas his semantic memory remained intact.	synthetic_fugue	2007
This paper reports a study based upon the case of the patient NN who suffered from a complete loss of autobiographical memory and awareness of identity subsequent to a dissociative depression.	synthetic_fugue	2006
In support of humane, neurobiologically informed treatment of patients with dissociative amnesia, we present excerpts from 2 post-event interviews with a patient who suffered and recovered from an episode of dissociative amnesia and depression.	synthetic_fugue	2008
This occurred after variable events: state of depression, road accident, post-traumatic headache.	synthetic_fugue	2009
Dissociative amnesia that encompasses one's entire life and identity is a rare disorder, as is dissociative depression.	synthetic_fugue	2005
The events triggering FRA varied widely: mild to severe head injury, road accident without head injury, seizure, dissociative depression, BDZ overdose, posttraumatic headache, syncope, migraine attack, acute distress.	synthetic_fugue	2006
Neuropsychological, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that NN suffered from a selective retrograde amnesia following an episode of dissociative depression, during which he had lost explicit knowledge and vivid memory of his personal past.	synthetic_fugue	2006
Although NN still claimed to suffer from a stable loss of autobiographical, self-relevant memories 1 year after the depression state, a proportionate improvement in underlying fronto-temporal neuronal networks was evident at this point in time.	synthetic_fugue	2008
It allows four possible variations of integration: non-integrated experience--perceptions about an object/event are either not perceived or they remain at the sensory level: traditional dissociative states, amnesia, depersonalisation etc; variably integrated experience--activation of information of a specific valence about an object blocks activation of information of contrasting valence: splitting; alternatively integrated experience--experience is integrated into a specific, limited active self-representation: depression and multiple identity states; dis-integrated experience-the ongoing experience of innate drives and needs is no longer consistently activated in the core self-representation: repression and isolation.	synthetic_fugue	2008
The dissociative disorders, including psychogenic or functional amnesia, depression, dissociative identity disorder (DID, also known as multiple personality disorder), and depersonalization disorder, were once classified, along with conversion disorder, as forms of hysteria.	synthetic_fugue	2007

depression levels decreased over time and the overall cognitive outcome measures showed significant improvement when comparing the beginning of treatment with the end.	synthetic_agitation	2005
The first two rotated factors explained 63.37 of the variance and may correspond to Cognition and Psychosis/depression factors.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Quetiapine is an effective and appropriate treatment choice in managing depression and aggression associated with bipolar mania.	synthetic_agitation	2009
Premorbid personality traits of high neuroticism and low agreeableness are associated with the presence of post-stroke depression, irritability, and carer distress.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Self-discrepancy theory [E. T. Higgins, 1987] proposes that discrepancies between self and ideal standards are associated with dejection-related emotions, whereas discrepancies between self and ought standards are associated with depression-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Results of two studies generally supported the predictions that depression-related emotions and dejection-related emotions were positively associated with actual-ought discrepancies and actual-ideal discrepancies, respectively, only when causal attributions for the discrepancies were internally based.	synthetic_agitation	2009
Presence of depression seems to limit rehabilitation gains at discharge.	synthetic_agitation	2008
depression was assessed by the Agitated Behaviour Scale (ABS) prior to the administration of ziprasidone, after two weeks of initiating treatment and at the moment of discontinuing ziprasidone.	synthetic_agitation	2009
There were significant correlations between Thai ADL scores and depression (r = 0.350), apathy (r = 0.441), and disinhibition (r = 0.417).	synthetic_agitation	2007
At the end of the study (after 8 weeks of treatment), risperidone (average final dose 1.6 mg/day) significantly improved all symptoms studied (depression, aggressiveness, disturbance of the sleep-wake rhythm, social withdrawal, suspiciousness and delusions) as rated by physicians on a five-point scale of severity.	synthetic_agitation	2006
Ought, ideal, and feared body image self-discrepancies were examined as predictors of depression-related affect (anxiety) and dejection-related affect (happiness).	synthetic_agitation	2007
Experts recommend APP in a few special clinical situations: (a) for augmentation when a patient fails to respond to adequate antipsychotic trials, especially with clozapine; (b) in some instances of failed cross-taper of antipsychotics; (c) adding a FGA to a SGA for depression during acute treatment of psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Fatigue factor scores were most powerfully predicted by psychomotor depression, pain and resultant fatigue and cognitive and emotional arousal factor scores from the SAS and SDS.	synthetic_agitation	2009
These perceptions in turn lead to anxious and angry depression, and depressed exhaustion.	synthetic_agitation	2005
The presence and duration of depression were the strongest predictors of non-compliance with splinting (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively).	synthetic_agitation	2005
This analysis evaluated the effects of quetiapine on depression and aggression in patients with bipolar I mania.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Furthermore, behavioural symptoms such as psycho- motor depression and crying, but also aggressive behaviour can be positively influenced by music and motivation and positive emotions can be increased.	synthetic_agitation	2006
Data from both studies fully support the fundamental predictions of self-discrepancy theory: Ought self-discrepancies were uniquely related to depression but not dejection, whereas ideal self-discrepancies were uniquely related to dejection but not depression.	synthetic_agitation	2007
We assessed the impact of overall residual symptoms (based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score) and of specific residual symptom clusters - mood symptoms (depressed mood, guilt, suicidality, energy/interests), sleep disturbance (early, middle, late insomnia), and anxiety (depression, psychic and somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis) measured at randomization.	synthetic_agitation	2008
depression is common in people with dementia, is distressing to patients and stressful to their carers.	synthetic_agitation	2009
Current clinical experience and one naturalistic study with intramuscular olanzapine suggest that it is efficacious and can be safely used in real world patients with severe depression.	synthetic_agitation	2005
There was no effect on depression.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Behaviors were assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield depression Inventory Short Form (CMAI), incident reports, as needed medications (pro re nata [PRN]), and surveys of staff and residents' family members as indices of affect.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Motor depression and retardation clustered with inattention, which is the cardinal symptom of delirium.	synthetic_agitation	2005
The main reasons for referral were forgetfulness (61), depressive symptoms (37.7), depression and disruptive behavior (29.6), and psychotic symptoms (27.9).	synthetic_agitation	2005
These symptoms were depressed mood, pathological guilt, suicidal tendency, anhedonia, psychomotor depression, psychic and somatic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms (fatigue).	synthetic_agitation	2005
Clinicians utilizing antipsychotics in managing delirium or depression are advised to be vigilant for NMS.	synthetic_agitation	2009
Antipsychotic medications (APs) are often used to treat depression and psychosis in delirium.	synthetic_agitation	2009
Antipsychotic drug use was positively associated with psychosis, depression and night-time behavior and was negatively associated with apathy.	synthetic_agitation	2009
I point to the depression of thought broadcast as a possible source of evidence for future research on the boundary(M) self.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Further, high levels of anxiety, worry and catastrophising were associated with high levels of persecutory depression distress and with the persistence of delusions over 3 months.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The DSM criteria for a depression indicate that it should not include any beliefs held by a person's 'culture or subculture'.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Participants were assessed psychometrically for their level of schizotypy, hallucination- and depression-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Results revealed that hallucination-proneness was positively and significantly associated with depression-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Furthermore, hallucination-prone and depression-prone participants scored significantly higher on some sub-scales of the MCQ compared to non-prone participants.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The possible etiological factors particularly aspects of the novel cognitive theories of depression formation and the hyperprolactinaemia caused by antipsychotic treatment are considered.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Results indicated that individuals with delusions gathered significantly less information than depression prone and non-depression prone participants on both the neutral and self-referent tasks, (p<.001).	synthetic_delusion	2007
Thus, whilst accepting that second-stage cognitive disruption has a part to play in explaining the Capgras depression, the emphasis here is placed on the role played by the patient's changing phenomenal content and its congruence with the delusional belief.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The findings support the notion that subclinical delusional ideation is linked to a self-reference bias, which is evident in the sort of everyday thinking that people engage in when forming or evaluating their beliefs and which may contribute to depression formation.	synthetic_delusion	2009
By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the depression then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	synthetic_delusion	2007
In Experiment 2, to further test the paradigm and to examine autobiographical remembering, highs were given a suggestion to become a same-sex sibling, administered 2 challenges to the temporary depression, and asked to generate autobiographical memories.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Consider, for instance, the Capgras depression.	synthetic_delusion	2006
A total of 472 participants were assessed on measures of dysphoria and depression and hallucination proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Case study and review of the literature We review the nosology and phenomenology of depression of pregnancy.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The results obtained thus support an association of Cotard depression with an internalising attributional style, and are therefore consistent with the account of Young and colleagues.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The central feature of the syndrome is a nihilistic depression, in which the patient denies his or her own existence and that of the external world.	synthetic_delusion	2007
We describe the case of a 44-year-old woman admitted with mania with psychotic symptoms who presented with depression of twin pregnancy a month after admission, which temporally correlated with hyperprolactinemia secondary to antipsychotic medication.	synthetic_delusion	2007
My mental_health had been blighted by fearful dark depression and associated alarm for 15 years.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Medical treatment has mainly targeted psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and depression, and ignored the symptoms of craving, which are the major cause of dependence.	synthetic_delusion	2009
We propose that such a disturbance could result in an unstable identification process, vulnerable to discrepancies in perceptual, emotional, or memory input caused by psychotic or organic mental states, thus resulting in a breakdown of the identification process that inevitably leads to a depression of denial of identity, or to a depression of 'doubles'.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The authors propose a novel model linking the three depression subtypes, attributions to self/other, and putative neurobiological mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The presence of an internet-related depression in the final case was used to frame a successful clinical intervention based on the 'collaborative empiricism' method, using cognitive behavioural therapy and collaborative use of the internet to resolve the delusional belief.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Participants high and low in depression-proneness were presented with happy and angry faces and were later asked to recognise the same faces displaying a neutral expression.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The influence of such motivational factors on delusions, which are instances of pathological misbelief, has tended however to be neglected by certain prevailing models of depression formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2007
For the relations with depression, the AD patients were divided into the depression and nondelusion groups.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Results are discussed as they relate to reasoning, psychosis and depression-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2005
The present study examined the jumping to conclusions reasoning bias across the continuum of delusional ideation by investigating individuals with active delusions, depression prone individuals, and non-depression prone individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2006
It is concluded that the PDI-21 is best used with a unidimensional scoring system and that new measures are needed to assess specific types of depression-like beliefs in the normal population.	synthetic_delusion	2005
A single case report of Capgras depression is presented as a crossmodal person processing disorder in everyday settings for whom the proposed model allows a cognitive interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2006
In addition to highlighting the use of behavioral experiments to change the patient's depression, we will illustrate various cognitive techniques that can be adapted to treat patients with psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Criteria for psychosis of AD were a diagnosis of AD or mixed dementia and a rating of >/= 2 on any depression or hallucination item of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale when entering the trial.	synthetic_delusion	2007
With respect to mental_health, we expected high believers to report less emotional exhaustion and fewer symptoms of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
dissociative disorders, depression disorder (DPD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Twelve months later they completed measures of anxiety and depression and the subscales of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depression, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
It is recommended that future research on burnout should include the cynicism and depression constructs.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Self-injury is most often performed to temporarily alleviate intense negative emotions, but may also serve to express self-directed anger or disgust, influence or seek help from others, end periods of dissociation or depression, and help resist suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
The most consistent predictor of burnout (as measured by the Emotional Exhaustion and depression scales) was exposure to work-related abuse.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
We conclude that the experience of temporal disintegration in DPD is not directly related to the core symptoms of depression/derealization, but exists when the depersonalized experience involves more prominent absorption.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Prevalence and clinical correlates of dissociative symptoms in general, and depression (DP) in particular, in patients with mood disorders have received limited attention in the literature.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Examples are provided within depression Disorder, Conversion Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Here we consider ways in which work on repression might inform the study of, on one hand, emotional memory, and on the other, the emotional numbing seen in patients with chronic persistent depression symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Furthermore, a regression analysis performed with Personal accomplishment as the dependent variable showed that the (combined) factors of Role Ambiguity, Positive Affect and Somatic Retarded Activity contributed significantly to the prediction of the dependent variable; A third regression analysis performed with depression as dependent variable showed that Somatic Retarded Activity, Role Conflict, Positive Affect, Interpersonal Affect and Role Ambiguity contributed significantly to the prediction of this variable.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
New measures of comparative fit and depression were developed, based on metacontrast ratios.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Consistent with selfcategorization theory, results showed (a) that comparative fit determined ingroup bias and other criterion variables through the mediating process of depression, and (b) that this process was active only when the category was highly accessible.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
The main findings are: emotional job demands were found to be a strong independent predictor of both emotional exhaustion and depression; quantitative job demands were found to predict emotional exhaustion; WFI was found to partially mediate the relationship between both quantitative/emotional job demands and emotional exhaustion; additionally, WFI partially mediated the relationship between emotional job demands and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
A lack of social support has shown to have a direct effect on emotional exhaustion, and depression, two of the three burnout indicators.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
There was also an understandable relationship between 'difficulty identifying feelings' (TAS) and both depression/derealization and absorption (DES).	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
This study examined the differences between fulltime selfemployed and organizationally employed individuals in Canada (n = 248) and Pakistan (n = 306) in terms of overall burnout and its three dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depression and lack of accomplishment), turnover intentions and nonwork satisfaction.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
BUT is a 71-item self-report questionnaire in two parts: BUT-A which measures weight phobia, body image concerns, avoidance, compulsive self-monitoring, detachment and estrangement feelings towards one's own body (depression); and BUT-B, which looks at specific worries about particular body parts or functions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Scores on self-pluralism were positively correlated with others: overall Dissociation (r=.50), Absorption (r=.54), depression (r=.43) and Amnesia (r = .28).	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
For instance, 42 of the variance in depression was explained by not working by choice, negative social reactions, experiences of violence, and lack of control in interaction with clients.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Male residents had significantly higher depression scores than female residents.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Findings demonstrated that emotional exhaustion and diminished personal accomplishment were related negatively to OCB, whereas depression had no independent effect on OCB.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Surface acting was significantly related to depression, and emotional consonance (the absence of emotional labour) was related to personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Cynicism and depression seemed to play a different role in both samples, particularly as far as their relationship with professional efficacy is concerned.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
depression, however, facilitated stereotype-consistent conformity behaviors only among gender-typed individuals; that is, participants conformed more to their masculine- than feminine-comment partners, and men were less conforming than were women, only when they were both gender-typed and depersonalized.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
In particular, cynicism and depression emerged as unique burnout dimensions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Our purpose was to extend the Job Demand-Resources Model (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) by including personal resources, job demands and job resources to predict burnout (exhaustion, cynicism, depression) and work engagement (vigour and dedication).	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Previous research examining the links between age and burnout has found that there was a significant negative correlation between age and both emotional exhaustion and depression as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
WFC emerged as a significant predictor of burnout (emotional exhaustion and depression).	synthetic_depersonalization	2006

Fifty-two patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (36 were acutely delusional) and 24 healthy control participants were presented with depression-neutral pictures in each trial, and were asked to rate the plausibility of four written interpretations of the scenario depicted by that picture.	synthetic_delusion	2006
A secondary aim is to examine if NFC is related to the depression-associated reasoning process of 'jumping to conclusions'.	synthetic_delusion	2007
We examine the debate between endorsement and explanationist models with respect to the 'alien control' depression.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Although cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) can be effective in reducing delusional thinking in schizophrenia, many patients are considered poor candidates, typically because of a lack of distress from the depression and resistance or low motivation to challenge its validity.	synthetic_delusion	2008

However, when considering the source of the social support (work vs. nonwork) as a moderator, I found that work-related sources of social support, because of their more direct relationship to work demands, were more closely associated with exhaustion than depression or personal accomplishment; the opposite pattern was found with nonwork sources of support.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
In contrast, depression decreases social influence in inductive identity groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006

depression-related guilt was related to increased PTSD symptomatology both directly and indirectly through the use of avoidant coping strategies.	synthetic_trauma	2006
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about depression and examine how this process opens up the possibility of reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator.	synthetic_trauma	2008
A sample of 21 psychotherapists participated in a naturalistic interview exploring the impact of depression work with a particular focus on (a) changes in memory systems and schemas about self and the world (the hallmarks of vicarious traumatization) and (b) perceived psychological growth.	synthetic_trauma	2007
Three groups of factors were considered: pre-depression (personality and coping), depression-related (physical and emotional proximity to disaster), and post-depression factors (received social support).	synthetic_trauma	2007
