While sexual interaction between psychologists, physicians, and other health therapists of all kinds and their clients is typically condemned by professional bodies as unethical, the controversy regarding the potential for anxiety to produce compliant behavior in unwilling or nonconsenting subjects suggests that hypnotherapist-client sex may warrant special attention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
College students with no prior experience of anxiety were assessed for fantasy proneness and dissociation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
A number of examples are offered--from the work of Milton Erickson on anxiety and from nonhypnotic therapy sessions--that demonstrate the presence and usefulness of enthymemes in family therapy dialogue.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The results demonstrated that progressive relaxation, anxiety, and deep abdominal breathing are characterized by differences in reported attentional experience that are further moderated by an individual's hypnotic susceptibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
A subsequent discussion of current conceptualizations of anxiety indicates considerable agreement among investigators; there is much consensus that anxiety is an individual differences phenomenon, in which imagination may, in some individuals, become so intense and so vivid, as to take on reality value, to the extent that a hypnotized person may have difficulty in distinguishing fantasy from reality.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
This pattern of responding occurred in both the anxiety and the imagination contexts.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
It is proposed that anxiety is a state of enhanced attention that activates an interplay between cortical and subcortical brain dynamics during hypnotic phenomena, such as both attentional and disattentional processes, among others, are important in the experiencing of anxiety and hypnotic phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
In 2 groups, it was labeled anxiety, and in the third group it was correctly labeled relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The evidence comes mostly from subjects highly responsive to anxiety, so that generalizations must be used with caution.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991

This article reviews recent research findings, expanding an evolving neuropsychophysiological model of anxiety (Crawford, 1989; Crawford & Gruzelier, 1992), that support the view that highly hypnotizable persons (highs) possess stronger attentional filtering abilities than do low hypnotizable persons, and that these differences are reflected in underlying brain dynamics.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
In preliminary experiments using anxiety we encountered unacceptably large, uncontrollable variability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
2 legal cases involving anxiety have recently been adjudicated by American courts.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
anxiety allows a modulated re-experiencing and abreaction of the traumatic event that can help to provide the victim with a relieving sense of mastery, and it fosters a receptive context for reassurance and interpretation regarding the irrational or exaggerated thoughts and feelings involved.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Implications for implementing judicial standards regarding anxiety are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
A case of MP disorder discovered under anxiety by a psychiatrist and later on vehemently denied by the patient became the object of legal action as part of a malpractice suit.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992

In a constructively designed study, we firstly compared an abbreviated form of autogenic training to a form of hypnotherapy (future oriented hypnotic imagery) which was not presented as anxiety and secondly we compared both treatments to the same future oriented hypnotic imagery, but this time explicitly presented as anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
In an investigation of hemispheric activity during anxiety, a total of 1269 Ss received hypnotizability scales containing suggestions targeting the left or right side of the body.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Detecting and addressing these antecedents resulted in complete alleviation of long-standing problems through relatively brief treatment using anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Absorption and anxiety share a kind of imaginative involvement that is not necessarily part of other kinds of openness, such as intellectance and liberalism.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
These data indicate that individuals cannot distinguish between memories retrieved prior to anxiety and those that occured during anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
A case is briefly presented in which questioning under anxiety led to a positive identification of an accused rapist when the victim had previously been uncertain.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994

Bilateral EEG measures were obtained on 16 high hypnotizable Ss (scores of greater than 8 on the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A, Shor & E. Orne, 1962), while performing hemisphere-specific tasks during anxiety and a no-anxiety control condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
In part because of these early origins and in part because of the nature of hypnotic phenomena, the anxiety scales are unique psychometric instruments.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
This study assessed variations in reported attentional experience associated with several stress management techniques (anxiety, progressive relaxation, deep abdominal breathing) and baseline (eyes closed) as a function of hypnotic susceptibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Examination of the absorption (Tellegen Absorption Scale [TAS] of Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974), openness to experience (OTE Inventory of Costa & McCrae, 1978), and anxiety (ANH Scales of L. J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin, 1976) scales suggested that they might be conceptually related.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
However, although the structure of the anxiety section is comparable in Mauritius and Britain the reliability of the Mauritian version is lower than with British samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
On the general sample of depressed subjects, the more the subjects stand on the emotional deficit side, behavioural (affective observed monotony, lack of affective expressiveness and responsiveness) and subjective (anxiety, affective global indifference for pleasant and unpleasant events), the lower is sensation seeking.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Self-destructive behavior, irritable affect, anxiety, and an externalizing disorder diagnosis at the time of admission accounted for 95.4 of the borderline children.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The present review suggests that stressor-induced reductions in the rewarding value of electrical brain stimulation (ICSS) from the mesocorticolimbic system may simulate the anxiety of human depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
In order to examine the symptom characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), 45 male inpatients with DSM-III personality disorder diagnoses, including patients with SPD (n = 15), BPD (n = 17), and both SPD and BPD (BPD/SPD) (n = 13), were administered a battery of psychological tests that included measures of traditionally defined schizotypal features such as perceptual aberration and anxiety (the Chapman Psychosis Proneness Scales) and borderline characteristics such as impulsivity (the Barratt Impulsivity Scale) and hostility (the BussDurkee Hostility Inventory).	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The Physical anxiety Scale and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale were not effective predictors of psychosis proneness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
This work presents a second study of validation of the French version of the Physical anxiety Scale (PAS) in four groups (221 and 32 normal subjects, 61 schizophrenics (RDC) and 42 major depressives (RDC).	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The present study found an inverse relationship between Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale and the Physical anxiety Scale, which has been used as a measure of psychosis vulnerability.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
These findings suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking may be indicative of physical anxiety and may also play a role in proneness to schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The physical anxiety and social anxiety scales successfully differentiated the psychiatric patients from the relatives and the latter from the normal subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Manifestations and derivatives of early negativity include anxiety, attachment to physical pain, fear of success, masochism, deprivation of self and others, and negative voyeurism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would report significantly greater anxiety than the bipolar patients and that higher scores on the anxiety scales would be related to attenuated reports of the experience of positive affect and poorer social skill.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The depression experienced by the patients was 'atypical', with relatively little anxiety and evidence of a negative view of self, and prominent symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
These results suggest that only a subset of the students with high scores on the Perceptual Aberration and Magical Ideation Scales produce schizophrenia spectrum MMPI-2 profiles and that these profiles are substantially different from those produced by students with high scores on the Revised Social anxiety Scale and from schizotypal college students who seek psychological treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
We evaluated the construct validity of the revised Social anxiety Scale (SAS; Mishlove & Chapman, 1985) through an examination of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles produced by extreme scorers on the SAS.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994

This study evaluated the accuracy and expressiveness of emotional communication by college students identified as anhedonic or control (ns = 24), based on their scores on the Physical anxiety Scale, using an emotional communication task and self-report indices of emotional expressiveness and self-monitoring.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The presence of anxiety in schizophrenic and pre-schizophrenic populations has also been noted, leading to the development of measures of anxiety designed to locate schizophrenia-prone individuals.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Since then there has been a gradual recovery of emphasis although many systems confuse the two concepts of 'loss of interest' and anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Concerning physical stimulations (FCPCS-PP and HDCS-PD) in the depressed group, anxiety and affective flattening are not linked, suggesting that physical anxiety is not secondary to low emotional reactivity (affective flattening) and constitutes an independent dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
We administered scales of Perceptual Aberration (PERAB) and Physical anxiety (PHYSAN), traits that may be related to risk for schizophrenia, to 54 schizophrenics, 146 of their first-degree relatives (evaluated for schizophrenia-related disorders), and 178 normal subjects (screened for psychotic disorders in them or their relatives).	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Ss who initially scored high on the Magical Ideation Scale and above the mean on the Social anxiety Scale were especially deviant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The first factor accounted for the common variance shared by 10 of the Schizotypy Scales, all except Physical anxiety, while the second factor accounted for the negative correlations between Physical anxiety on the one hand and Magical Ideation, Perceptual Aberration and the STA on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
In the last century psychopathologists attached importance to the concept of anxiety, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The second cluster was distinguished by elevated scores on the Magical Ideation Scale, the third cluster by very high scores on the Social anxiety Scale and the STA, and the fourth cluster by very high Physical anxiety Scale scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Women high on anxiety used significantly more Mapping, but less Suppression and Substitution coping styles.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
One hundred eighteen psychiatric patients, each experiencing his or her first lifetime episode of psychosis, 125 of their first-degree relatives, and 155 normal subjects were assessed using the physical anxiety, social anxiety, and perceptual aberration scales of Chapman et al. (	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The implications of these data to the stressor depression topography and the potential role of mesocorticolimbic DA in depression and anxiety are discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Subjects were identified as psychosis-prone by their high scores on the Perceptual Aberration or the Physical anxiety scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Present findings suggest a possible influence of the profound anxiety of severe depression on subcortical processes.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The core negative symptoms measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ([SANS] affective flattening, anxiety/asociality, avolition/apathy, and alogia) all improved with clozapine treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
For patients with schizophrenia, anxiety was significantly related to premorbid functioning.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder did not differ in ratings of anxiety, but both groups had higher physical and social anxiety scores than did bipolar patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
For the SZ group, these findings may be related to anxiety or to poor social functioning, which are often features of the illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
These analyses yielded two factors, one representing cognitive/perceptual aspects of psychosis proneness and a second consisting of measures of anxiety and psychoticism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Both BPD and SPD/BPD patients were discriminated from SPD patients by significantly higher levels of impulsivity and aggression but not by the differential presence of psychoticlike symptoms or anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Introvertive anxiety was associated with face > word superiority.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Emotion-provoking visual stimuli were presented to college undergraduates identified as anhedonic or normal, based on their scores on the Physical anxiety Scale (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Earlier studies have demonstrated a significant relation between scores on the Physical anxiety Scale--but not on the Perceptual Aberration Scale--and premorbid social adjustment in schizophrenics (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976, 1978; Schuck, Leventhal, Rothstein, & Irizarry, 1984).	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical anxiety and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Psychosis-prone subjects who scored high on the Perceptual Aberration-Magical Ideation scale (n = 173) or on the revised Physical anxiety scale (n = 88) did not differ significantly from control subjects (n = 929) in self-categorized, handedness patterns.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
In both my patients, the sexual behaviors served the self-regulatory function of alleviating inner feelings of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The present study investigates the relationship between sensation seeking and anxiety, a pathological reduction in pleasure capacity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
However, no one element was either necessary to cause the decrease in sucrose intake, or sufficient to maintain the impairment for longer than 4 weeks: Variety and frequency of microstressors appeared to be the essential features of procedures causing a prolonged anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The results suggest that anxiety is not a phenotypic vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Neither anxiety scale was related to role play measures of social skill performance for any patient group.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
This was particularly true for symptoms of anxiety and behavioral disturbance.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
In addition, there was marked lessening of dysthymia and intense anxiety manifested by severe isolation, listlessness, and apathy.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Affective flattening and anxiety were defined by the following self-rating scales: Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPCS), Hardy Displeasure Capacity Scale (HDCS), FCPCS-PP (subscale of physical pleasure), and HDCS-PD (subscale of physical displeasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
When their mothers resumed mating, most infants showed signs of anxiety; a few briefly showed indications of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Neuroleptics have been used to help control anxiety, restlessness, and hostility in patients with traumatic brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Concerning depression and general psychopathology, mixed manics had more severe anxiety, hostility and cognitive impairment than did agitated depressed patients.	synthetic_agitation	1990
The other was sent through the local U.S. mail and then subjected to additional physical anxiety and heat before being frozen.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Two of the three subjects with severe anxiety showed dramatic resolution of the anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Weekly scores for measures of cognition, anxiety and attention were each found to share approximately 50 of the variance when paired with one of the other two.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Rat pups were maternally separated at nest temperature (WARM), room temperature (COLD), or nest temperature with anxiety (AGIT) for 6 hr each day from 2 to 15 days of age.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Among the variables most strongly associated with patients' perception of IFS were behavioral and emotional changes experienced by the patient (e.g., anxiety, tearfulness, paranoia and delusions), and the patients' past history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse and psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Abnormalities of neurochemical systems in Alzheimer disease, which are potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of such noncognitive problems as anxiety and depression, have been demonstrated.	synthetic_agitation	1990
The worst response was to lithium prescribed on the basis of manic-like symptoms (e.g., psychomotor anxiety) or cyclical behavior disturbance.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Analysis of anxiety by nursing shift in which ratings were made confirmed that overall level was lowest during the night shift; however, the relationship between time-of-day and underlying factors deviated from this pattern.	synthetic_agitation	1993
During the early phases of recovery from traumatic head injury, the level of functional cognition and the presence of anxiety in patients appear to co-vary.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Our data showed that the three syndromes of anxiety--aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors, and verbally agitated behaviors--are differentially related to medical and psychosocial variables.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Adverse effects included behavioral anxiety/activation in four patients and mild gastrointestinal symptoms in two patients.	synthetic_agitation	1993
We report the case of a brain-injured patient who was prescribed chlorpromazine for anxiety and who developed a delusional state while taking this antipsychotic agent.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Six of 23 patients with autistic disorder and 3 of 16 patients with mental retardation had side effects which significantly interfered with function, consisting predominantly of restlessness, hyperactivity, anxiety, decreased appetite, or insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Thus, a 'trunk and branch' analogy was suggested for construing psychomotor disturbance, with a truncal 'psychic' component arborising into retardation and anxiety 'motoric' expressions.	synthetic_agitation	1990
When attention was extracted, only 7 of the variation in cognition was accounted for by anxiety, and 40 of the variance could not be accounted for by either anxiety or attention.	synthetic_agitation	1991
While previous studies have supported the reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the ABS, the current study was designed to investigate its underlying factor structure, as well as to determine systematic effects of time-of-day on the occurrence of anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1990
We present a case study in which severe anxiety was reduced and independent functioning increased in a traumatically brain-injured individual.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Becoming a parent introduces new demands that both interfere with attaining one's own hopes (increasing dejection in parents high in ideal [own] discrepancy) and shift attention to the new parenting role (decreasing anxiety in parents high in ought [spouse] discrepancy).	synthetic_agitation	1994
Prebirth actual-ideal discrepancies predicted increased sadness or dejection after birth (especially for couples in longer marriages), whereas prebirth actual-ought discrepancies predicted decreased nervousness or anxiety after birth (especially for mothers and couples with a less easy child).	synthetic_agitation	1990
On principal components analysis, a three-factor, oblique-rotated solution resulted, with a negative symptom factor, a positive symptom factor, and an unstable behavioral anxiety factor.	synthetic_agitation	1991
These were a negative affect dimension with concomitant behavioral changes, physical symptoms, anxiety, and positive arousal.	synthetic_agitation	1992
A five-factor solution was selected and, after a varimax rotation, the factors that emerged could be described as: sad mood, lack of energy, positive mood, anxiety, and social withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1992
The anxiety syndrome attributed to living in a chronically stressful environment could be easily mistaken for and be the reason why African American boys are so frequently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	synthetic_agitation	1994
Patients age > or = 40 were more likely to have terminal insomnia, anxiety, diurnal variation with lower mood in the morning and the RDC subtype diagnoses endogenous, incapacitated or agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1991
In addition to 'retardation' and 'anxiety' dimensions (whose derived factor scores suggested independence of those two dimensions), a third 'non-interactive' dimension was evident--with derived factor scores correlating significantly with both the retardation and anxiety dimensions.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Following a period of anxiety, pigtail infants showed a depressive phase characterized by slouched, withdrawn postures and reduced motor activity.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Results are discussed in terms of the necessity for objective measurement, definition of the construct of anxiety, and time-of-day issues in sampling agitated behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Activation was assessed by means of self-ratings (Thayer, AD-ACL) and global judgement (Hamilton, retardation, anxiety).	synthetic_agitation	1990

The present study investigated the ways in which clinicians and patients perceive several theoretical dimensions related to suicide: psychological pain, external pressures/stressors, anxiety/emotional upsetness, self-regard, and hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Future research may especially benefit by considering the long-term effects of early anxiety following traumatic brain injury as well as the problem of aspontaneity and impairment of self-awareness.	synthetic_agitation	1993
The BUMP-R demonstrated good internal consistency and a factor analysis revealed four factors identified as negativity/anxiety, amiability, dysphoria, and noncompliance.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Areas most consistently showing improvement included focused and sustained attention and concentration, orientation, alertness, arousal, processing, time, and psychomotor speed, mobility, vocalization, anxiety, anxiety and participation in therapy.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Concomitantly, these results allow that significant portions of the variance in cognition and anxiety may be temporally dissociated during the acute phases of recovery from traumatic head injury.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Children with the acute form of PTSD presented with a relative increase in spontaneously acting as though the trauma were recurring upon real or symbolic exposure, difficulty falling asleep, hypervigilance, nightmares, exaggerated startle response, and generalized anxiety/anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Physical and verbal aggression, anxiety, and depression were rated as the most difficult to manage.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Discrepancies between one's actual self and ideal-other self (a self-guide consisting of attributes someone would ideally like the individual to possess) cause dejection, whereas discrepancies with the ought-other self (beliefs about attributes someone thinks one ought to ham) cause anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Subjects were 212 patients with traumatic or other recently acquired brain injury who exhibited anxiety during their treatment on a specialized brain-injury unit of an acute rehabilitation hospital.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that anxiety is best represented by one general construct with three underlying factors: Aggression, Disinhibition, and Lability.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Both analyses suggest that continuous drinkers may be characterized by greater confused and disorganized thinking, anxiety, and cynicism and distrust in interpersonal relationships than are episodic drinkers.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Symptoms comprising an anxiety syndrome (restlessness, anxiety, and poor concentration) were most frequently reported.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Syndromes of anxiety (aggressive, physically nonaggressive, verbal) were compared to dimensions of the social network (intimacy, size/density) in 408 nursing home residents.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Data from the current sample suggest that clinicians and parasuicidal patients independently perceived most of these dimensions similarly, with the exception of anxiety/emotional upsetness (perturbation).	synthetic_agitation	1990
Twenty-four highly agitated, cognitively impaired nursing home residents were studied in depth to determine whether they manifested temporal patterns of anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1990

anxiety problems, however, showed less improvement than in the inner-city sample, with over one-third of the small-town cases remaining unwell throughout the 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_mental_illness	1991
My original goal in writing this article was to respond to a critique by Albert Ellis (personal communication, 1986) of Preventing anxiety: Some Personal Discoveries (Ericson, 1986).	synthetic_mental_illness	1991
anxiety and social status.	synthetic_mental_illness	1994
University students (55 women and 37 men) participated in a study of the relationship between multidimensional locus of control and attitudes toward mental_illness as measured by the five factors of the Opinions About anxiety scale.	synthetic_mental_illness	1991
anxiety might be associated with creative achievement among highly functioning people, but with the mentally ill or with ordinary people, there might be a negative relationship.	synthetic_mental_illness	1990
In his discussion of the distinction between illusion and anxiety, Hood draws attention to the essence of Freud's critique of religion.	synthetic_delusion	1994
A second clinical account focuses on an instance in which the analyst's somatic anxiety, in conjunction with the analysand's sensory experiences and body-related fantasies, served as a principal medium through which the analyst experienced and came to understand the meaning of the leading anxieties that were being (intersubjectively) generated.	synthetic_delusion	1993
A anxiety can only be 'explained' if it can be correlated with a demonstrable brain event, and this is only beginning to be possible.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Two propositions are offered: Where it appears that a family member is murdered by a delusional assailant by accident, it is not an accident; and the anxiety of persecution entails a memory loss so that the murderer not only can claim lack of personal responsibility for the act, but also spares himself the guilt of having broken a fundamental taboo.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Piagetian concepts explaining normal mental development are applied to anxiety, a major psychiatric disorder of thought which can result in bizarre conduct.	synthetic_delusion	1994
In contradistinction to existing theories, we define anxiety as a regression under stress to the logic of children of a particular age range, and that what appears bizarre and irrational is the result of an adult attempting to filter experience through a child's logic.	synthetic_delusion	1994
A review of new cases of delusional misidentification reported between 1986 and 1992 suggests that the anxiety of inanimate doubles is a variant of the Capgras phenomenon in approximately 10 of cases.	synthetic_delusion	1994
As a complement to Hood's argument, it is emphasized that a Freudian critique of religion can be offered only within an experience of anxiety because illusion is identified from reality, within faith.	synthetic_delusion	1993
The Cotard anxiety occurred when KH was depressed and the Capgras anxiety arose in the context of persecutory delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In the field of chronic delusions, authors make synthesis of the anxiety with late emergence in the elderly.	synthetic_delusion	1990
We explore the relation between the Capgras anxiety (the belief that your relatives have been replaced by impostors) and the Cotard anxiety (the delusional belief that you have died).	synthetic_delusion	1994
Results showed that Blacks scored significantly higher than Whites on the Narcissistic, Aggressive, Paranoid, Drug, and Psychotic anxiety subscales.	synthetic_delusion	1994
In this article, we present a study encompassing 30 cases of this anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1990

We report a 63-year-old man with a monosymptomatic anxiety of unpleasant body odor contracted at the age of 61 years, who believed that his body reeked of some type of paint.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In noninduced cases, two physiopathological brain mechanisms have been proposed: a anxiety, or a primary abnormal tactile sensation with a secondary delusional elaboration.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Following a general review of the literature linking right hemisphere dysfunction to psychoses in general and Capgras anxiety (CD) in particular, two studies are described that confirm the link.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This paper clarifies the concepts of indoctrination, suggestion, fantasy, anxiety, misinterpretation, miscommunication, innocent lying, deliberate lying, confabulation, pseudologia phantastica, overstimulation, group contagion, and perpetrator substitution.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Course and outcome are primarily dependent on the diagnostic category, not the type of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The variables of diagnosis (schizophrenia according to the ICD-10 or the DSM-III-R at discharge from first admission) was a highly significant predictor of which only the following variables had a significant and independent predictive value: living alone, no psychosocial stressor, main anxiety of persecution, and main anxiety other than reference.	synthetic_delusion	1990
We report a case of a blind woman, M.N., who experienced the Capgras anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Over the last eight decades a plethora of psychodynamic explanations have been invoked to account for the Capgras anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1990
At the scale level, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that the scores obtained by the Black and White groups were significantly different in 9 of the 20 scales (Histrionic, Narcissistic, Antisocial, Paraphrenia, Hypomania, Dysthymia, Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Psychotic anxiety).	synthetic_delusion	1993
Clinically, one sees in malignant envy the phenomenon of the subject feeling with delusional intensity that what the envied one has is not only urgently wanted but has been stolen from the self--an intensity that is reacted to defensively by projection and anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Further comparison is made between learning to be possessed as a cause of anxiety, and the psychoanalytic theory in which the defense mechanism of projection is central.	synthetic_delusion	1994
It appears to the authors, after reviewing the literature on the subject, that the anxiety ascribed to the Fregoli syndrome, which occurs mainly in Schizophrenia, is being noted in a slowly widening group of psychotic disorders, of which Cannabis Delusional Disorder is the latest.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Piaget constructed problems in which the errors of six to eight year old children fit the standard textbook definition of anxiety surprisingly well.	synthetic_delusion	1994
The anxiety of shared metaphor being obtained through written and verbal language distorts our views of reality, it impairs our ability to empathise with others, and it disharmonizes our attempts to attune to any invariants and affordances of universal language.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In the Capgras anxiety the double is usually a key figure in the life of the patient.	synthetic_delusion	1990
This paper explores the relation of the anxiety of omnipotence to masochism and suggests that this fantasy constitutes a major component of the resistance so prominent in work with masochistic patients.	synthetic_delusion	1994
A parallel is suggested between the anxiety as an aberration of cognition and some illusions which result from aberrations within optics.	synthetic_delusion	1991
When the hermetic logic of conspiracy theory is stripped away by historical and socio/psychological analysis, however, the hypothetical perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse simply disappear, leaving in their wake the very real human suffering of all those who have been caught up in the social anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In the latter theory, interpretation of the anxiety is critical; whereas in the former, interpretation is counterproductive because it merely reinforces the anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1992
A particular process of awareness concerning personal objects is hypothesized which would explain the specific anxiety of reduplication that occurs when these objects are misidentified.	synthetic_delusion	1991
I discuss the existential conditions and consequences of this stance and show that certain anomalous or paradoxical features of schizophrenic anxiety are explicable on this phenomenological account.	synthetic_delusion	1994
We discuss the distinction between the overvalued idea as presented in pseudopregnancy and anxiety as presented in the postpartum psychosis and suggest that the two phenomena can be viewed as a continuum rather than dichotomized, especially in cases like the one reported here.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Its repeated use can lead to a truncated probability distribution and a anxiety of certainty.	synthetic_delusion	1990
What can we learn from the content and the formal aspects of this kind of anxiety about the primary schizophrenic experiences underlying the technical anxiety and about its meaning and purpose for the patient?	synthetic_delusion	1990
A right-handed young man with contusions affecting temporo-parietal areas of the right cerebral hemisphere and some bilateral frontal lobe damage became convinced that he was dead (the Cotard anxiety), and experienced difficulties in recognizing familiar faces, buildings and places, as well as feelings of derealization.	synthetic_delusion	1992
We suggest that the neurological basis of anxiety-like beliefs may involve a release of right-hemisphere function from left-hemisphere control and sketch the focus of research for a future neuropsychology of belief.	synthetic_delusion	1990
This study documents a case of somatic anxiety which was seen in a patient following a head injury secondary to a motorcycle accident.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The authors suggest that the psychological processes underlying the Capgras anxiety are mediated by neuroanatomical connections between various brain areas and hypothesize that the fundamental lesion in Capgras syndrome may be the patient's inability or failure to acknowledge the authenticity of a person they clearly recognize.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Capgras syndrome, the anxiety of substitution, has rarely been reported in adolescents.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Capgras' anxiety (CD) may be secondary to a neurologic lesion, particularly in the right frontal or occipital regions.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This impairment is consistent with the view that the Capgras anxiety may arise in connection with damage to recognition mechanisms, and parallels findings of face processing impairments in sighted Capgras patients.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Clinical material from psychotherapy with a 3 1/2-year-old girl illustrates that, as long as she maintained the anxiety of being attached to her mother's body by a physical placenta, she was hindered from learning to experience herself as a separate individual and from developing normal feelings of attachment and grief over loss.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Reduplicative paramnesia is redefined as a anxiety of familiarity related to a reduplication of time, place or person.	synthetic_delusion	1992
We suggest that these impairments contributed to his Cotard anxiety by heightening feelings of unreality, and that the underlying pathophysiology and neuropsychology of the Cotard anxiety may be related to other problems involving delusional misidentification.	synthetic_delusion	1992
In this paper the other extreme of human irrationality is examined: the anxiety as it occurs in psychiatric illness.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Post-anxiety SPECT showed decreased bifrontal and biparietal cortical uptake indices but a normal index of asymmetry.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Five factors representing different types of anxiety emerged: Inauthenticity, Self-Negation, Self-Objectification, Derealization, and Body Detachment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Burnout levels of male employees on Emotional Exhaustion and anxiety scales were strongly linked to the level of work stressors and were not predicted by total home stressors nor the interaction between these variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Staff who reported high levels of burnout on the Maslach Burnout Inventory across all three scales of Emotional Exhaustion, anxiety and Personal Accomplishment were compared with a sample of low burnout employees.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The history of anxiety theories is presented from Krishaber to Freud, and the main approaches to prosthesis criticized.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The RQED suggested six factors which were anxiety; Process Amnesia; Fantasy/Daydream; Dissociated Body Behaviors; Trance and Imaginary Companions.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The paths from emotional exhaustion to anxiety and lack of personal accomplishment were found to be most consistent with the data and partially supported the Leiter and Maslach model.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Parents of boys or children who died suddenly experienced more despair, anger, guilt, and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Confirmatory factor analysis of four models of the dimensionality of the MBI offered partial support to the critics by showing that anxiety indicators do not form a coherent factor in the nonhuman service sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Using this population as a reference, T scores for these clusters were calculated for special normal populations (poets, drama students, false pregnancies) and for clinical groups (post-traumatic stress, anxiety-anxiety, exotic dissociations, and complex partial epilepsy).	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
With the exception of the working rhythm, these traits were more prominent among the respondents with episodes of anxiety than among those with dj vu experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Dj vu experiences appeared to be more frequent than episodes of anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The two nursing groups differed significantly when the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory were compared: hospice nurses reported feeling less emotional exhaustion, utilized the technique of anxiety less frequently, and experienced a greater sense of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The variables examined included identification with patients, anxiety, social recognition and reward, gay affiliation, stigma, social support (belonging and tangible), stress, relationship stability, and burnout (anxiety, emotional exhaustion, and lack of personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Consistent with predictions, there was a three-way interaction between anxiety, in-group size, and in-group status as determinants of evaluative in-group bias on social trait ratings.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Those reporting better supervisor and co-worker relations as well as more autonomy at work reported significantly lower levels of anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
A conservative estimate of incidence of anxiety among persons with minor head trauma is 13, while, at the upper end, as many as 67 of persons who sustain mild head injury may experience feelings of unreality.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The present study evaluated the efficacy of three tasks in inducing anxiety (DP) and derealization (DR) in three different groups: (a) panic disorder patients who report these symptoms while panicking (PD + DD; n = 10); (b) panic disorder patients never experiencing these symptoms during panic attacks (PD; n = 10); and (c) nonanxious controls (NC; n = 10).	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The results suggest that in contrast to line workers, the supervisors experienced significantly high levels of anxiety and reduced personal accomplishment, but only a moderate level of emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Multiple regression was used to investigate whether the dimensions of empathy could predict three aspects of burnout: personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Emotional support and work stressors accounted directly for significant variance in emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and symptom frequency.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The themes were early environment that prohibited the development of a sense of personhood in incest survivors, repeated experiences of anxiety inside and outside of therapy that reinforced a state of non-personhood, and adoption of a surrender pattern to cope with violations, including therapist violations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
In 1904 and 1906, Heymans reported the results of two prospective questionnaire surveys on dj vu experiences and anxiety in a sample of mainly students.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The second panel showed that lack of collegial support caused anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
The third indicated that empathic concern was a significant predictor of anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
In a comprehensive reanalysis of the factor structure of the correlation matrices of item scores from six studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, from which the parallel form of the ES was derived for use with educators rather than with other professional groups, Walkey and Green expressed a preference for a two-factor structure comprising a fusion of Emotional Exhaustion and anxiety factors into one factor named Core of Burnout and for a second factor identified as Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The findings tend to support the contention of past researchers that the anxiety subscale can be broken into two subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Data were collected for 868 male and female university students in psychology over a 10-year period; the 19 of students who reported this early experience displayed more frequent anxiety, beliefs in psi phenomena, sensations of presence, sensitivity to odors, widened affect, childhood imaginary playmates, and left (writing) handedness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Inauthenticity, the most frequent and pervasive form of anxiety experience, was best predicted by a cognitive style featuring intense, critical examination of self and others.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
A case study presented suggests methods through which anxiety may be addressed within the therapeutic context.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
All forms of anxiety were associated with depression, except Inauthenticity.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Although anxiety can denote a dehumanizing practice, it can also be used to reference the positive aspects of collective identity, understanding and action.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
It remains unclear from the literature, however, how well these treatment modalities can alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder where the predominant clinical features are associated with anxiety and dissociative states.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
A scale was constructed to measure anxiety experiences reported in the literature and four items representing psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The major purpose of this investigation was to obtain from a sample of 150 middle school teachers (101 females and 49 males) in suburban San Diego County evidence concerning the degree of relationship of each of four burnout-related measures (Positive Perception of Teaching, Support from Superiors, Knowledge of Burnout, and Commitment to Teaching) in the Holland Burnout Assessment Survey with each of three widely researched subtests in the Educators Survey serving as criterion variables (Emotional Exhaustion, anxiety, and Personal Accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Furthermore, it was expected that the perception of imbalance would be more strongly related to anxiety and reduced personal accomplishment among women than among men.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Compared to other teacher samples, the internal consistency of the three subscales (Emotional Exhaustion-EEX, anxiety-DEP, Reduced Personal Accomplishment-PAC) is relatively high.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Findings indicated that, for a subsample of female beginning teachers, two of the three variables (perceived adequacy of training and choosing teaching as a career) served as moderately valid predictors of emotional exhaustion and anxiety measures.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Regarding the developmental phase of adolescence they also serve adolescents in their conflicts with parental authorities in the process of detaching and spiritualization and anxiety of super-ego structures.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
In the present study, burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and reduced personal accomplishment) were hypothesized to occur among male and female nurses who are low in communal orientation and feel they invest more in their relationships with patients than they receive in return.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Under the anxiety condition, however, subjects valued minority group membership more than majority categorization, and the effect of status was eliminated.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Burnout comprised three factors: emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
In addition, support is provided for the hypothesis that social support buffers the effect of work role conflict and work role ambiguity on perceived emotional exhaustion and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The three subscales of Maslach's Burnout Inventory--Emotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment, anxiety--serve as the dependent variables in this study.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
For women, a significant interaction was found between total work stressors and home-based stressors in the prediction of Emotional Exhaustion and a trend in this direction was evident for anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Age, minutes spent giving physical care, appraisal of work tasks, and reaction to patient behavior, explained anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Heymans inferred that these findings supported his hypothesis that dj vu experiences and anxiety both resulted from the diminishing or disappearance of a sense of familiarity due to a momentary reduction of psychological energy.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The results are consistent with the model's proposition that mean scores on the subdomains of (a) anxiety, (b) (lack of) personal accomplishment, and (c) emotional exhaustion, increase regularly and predictably as the-experienced level of burnout reported by respondents increases.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Overall, the RDES produced seven factors which in order of variance are: Fantasy/Absorption; Segment Amnesia; anxiety; In Situ Amnesia; Different Selves; Denial and Critical Events.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Using Maslach and Jackson's (1986) multidimensional model of burnout, 25 percent of the sample reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, 3 percent reported high anxiety and 12 percent reported low levels of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
However, derealization and anxiety symptoms were common and were found to be prevalent as among depressives.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
This paper describes a patient whose amnesia for an offence (fraud) and two anxiety episodes occurred against the background of an underlying organic amnesia.	synthetic_fugue	1993
Trauma induced in this case, in particular, Dissociative Disorders (including a Dissociative anxiety), a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Somatoform Disorders and Phobic Disorders.	synthetic_fugue	1991
The anxiety states conformed in their duration and precipitating factors to previous accounts in the literature.	synthetic_fugue	1993
This paper describes the neuropsychological test performance of a patient who experienced a anxiety episode (functional retrograde amnesia) lasting 7 days, but who continued to complain of a virtually complete loss of autobiographical memory for well over a year.	synthetic_fugue	1990
Persons who experience a series of traumatic events may be especially vulnerable to a variety of dissociative states, including amnesia, anxiety, depersonalization, and multiple personality disorder.	synthetic_fugue	1994
Reports of sexual upset were associated with reports of anxiety and tension for all groups, but least so for White wives.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Support is found for discrimination between feelings and overall liking and for the validity of a humor, but possibly not anxiety, monitor.	synthetic_irritation	1990
The clearest associations between consumption situations and affective reactions were: after vacation with nostalgia/sadness; voting with lack of concern; during a meal in a restaurant with cheerfulness or with bother; after a hobby purchase with positive excitement, shopping with anxiety, and taking exams with scare.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Gape and tongue extrusion are associated primarily with what we call core or food-offense disgust and also oral anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	1993
A mental strain index was derived from the addition of three subscales: depression, anxiety and anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Experiment 2 was designed to explore further the nature of the decline in anxiety observed in Experiment 1.	synthetic_irritation	1994
At the higher concentration, a significant decrease in perceived intensity was observed over time for anxiety, but not for cooling.	synthetic_irritation	1990
The results revealed a significant placebo effect [c. f. Medicine and Science in Sports 4: 124126]: After treatment, the placebo group scored higher than both the testosterone and the control group on selfestimated anger, anxiety, impulsivity, and frustration.	synthetic_irritation	1990
The suspense film, which elicited a marked reduction in joyfulness and relaxation together with an enhancement in anxiety, differed from that pattern primarily by marked changes in several bodily sensations, an increase in electrodermal activity, and a temporary decrease in heart rate.	synthetic_irritation	1994
Employing 1-min and 5-min inter-stimulus intervals between solutions, it was found that the decrease in menthol anxiety more closely resembled desensitization than adaptation.	synthetic_irritation	1991
In Experiment 1, 10 samples of either 0.03 or 0.30 menthol were presented at 1 min intervals and rated for the perceived intensity of cooling and anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Aggression, in the form of anxiety and anger, was displayed more often by girls than by boys.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Findings indicated that commitment buffered the relationship between stress and job displeasure (a canonically derived variate combining residualized job dissatisfaction, intent to quit, and anxiety).	synthetic_irritation	1994
Repeated oral stimulation with solutions of 2 ppm capsaicin increased time to maximum intensity, but yielded a decrease in sequential mouth-burn intensity due to a rising minimum anxiety rating between stimuli.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Over-all ratings of anxiety and of awareness were also analyzed for the 143 participants solicited in shopping malls in Lexington, KY.	synthetic_irritation	1990
The magnitude of this decrease was directly related to the concentration of acetic acid and to the perceived intensity of the odor and degree of nasal anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	1994
The complaint about the safety conditions at an all-day conference in 1987 on preventable disasters is taken as the starting-point of discussion, both during that Conference and at a meeting afterwards, on the responses, typically anxiety and denial, generated by warnings of disasters in general.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Toxicity studies commonly include unavoidable environmental differences (experimental history) among test groups, such as chemical taste, odor and anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Patients of families suffering from stress were prone to exhibit aggression in the form of mood changes, anxiety, and anger.	synthetic_irritation	1990
A pilot study of 27 firemen yielded a number of significant positive partial correlations between Type A Scale scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey and the spouse-or friend-reported frequency of items indicative of aggravation, anxiety, anger, and impatience (AIAI), while controlling for subject self-reported frequency.	synthetic_irritation	1991
It is suggested that the attacks of altered anxiety were, in this case, provoked by spreading depression of the left hemisphere, while the integrative functions of the right hemisphere remained intact.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
Patients in these diagnostic categories differed in their pre-morbid IQ estimations, current anxiety measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and in the number of scored positive psychotic PSE symptoms and their systematization of and preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1994
Contrary to Schwartz and Garamoni (1986), the results suggest that positive monologue may not be a dysfunctional anxiety and show that positive monologue, in contrast to positive dialogue, is more frequently associated with refusal responses.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
Thus, intrasubtest scatter in this population appears to reflect a broader measure of the integrity of anxiety and not merely a clinical indication of attention/concentration problems.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
The influence of the anxiety and of the structural complexity on the evoked potentials has been verified experimentally.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
The description of the anxiety that facilitates ability to generate random sequences resembles in a number of respects the mode of cognitive processing of the right hemisphere.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
To analyse the influence of structural complexity of visual patterns and of an operationally defined anxiety on evoked potentials some on--line closed--loop experiments were carried out.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
There must also be a anxiety which involves an evaluation of the phenomenon as something like, Harm to the body.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1994
Results showed that, in the first trial, test instructions slowed down performance only in the high-demanding tasks and fine tasks, and trait anxiety and anxiety anxiety were associated to slight performance impairments only in the high-demanding tasks.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1992
Carter's signaled stopping technique is used here under different instructions to examine two quite different cognitive phenomena during television viewing of marital interactions from feature films: a change to the anxiety of thinking (rather than just watching), and the momentary perception of action meaningful for the couple's relationship.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
Abnormally high levels of thyroxin are associated with anxiety and irritability, while very low levels are associated with lethargy.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Early antisocial behaviour, interaction with antisocial others, temperament (daring and low anxiety), low academic skills (school attainment), poor parental childrearing practices and a low level of commitment to the family were independent predictors of participation in offending.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
For example, 93 reported anxiety or anxiety, 92 sleeping problems, 89 depression, 88 headaches, 79 fatigue, 78 concentration problems, 77 irritability, 65 impatience, 61 feeling disorganized, 59 confusion, 56 loss of efficiency with everyday tasks, 53 memory problems, 44 dizziness, 39 numbness, and 34 word finding problems.	synthetic_nervousness	1994
Prechemotherapy anxiety at the first chemotherapy course was a highly significant predictor for AN after 5 months of treatment in the project patients, and was also significantly related to AN in the preproject group.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
They also experienced more intense negative moods, anxiety, and restlessness relative to the average levels of these constructs for the sample.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Deceivers revealed their anxiety and difficulty in sustaining a competent communication performance by swiveling in their chairs and speaking at a slower rate.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
During the group-psychotherapy panic sensations, anxiety, anxiety and fears as well as psychosocial disability decreased.	synthetic_nervousness	1994
A significant but noncausal relationship between prechemotherapy anxiety and development of anticipatory nausea (AN) in cancer patients is reported.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
In short the bottom seems to fall through, leaving us with some cognitive anxiety about what and how to study human phenomena.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
anxiety is significantly associated with both thyroxin and cortisol, although several other symptoms of anxiety or depression are not.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
Although one patient had an unwitnessed seizure, none of the subjects required discontinuance of buspirone HCl because of symptoms of dizziness, nausea, headache, anxiety, or lightheadedness, typical side effects described by the manufacturer.	synthetic_nervousness	1994
Girls who felt they were experiencing pubertal changes reported more negative moods and anxiety, and more variable negative moods, anxiety, energy, and restlessness over the month than did prepubertal girls.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Prior occurrence of posttreatment anxiety also predicted anxiety before subsequent infusions, even after accounting for trait anxiety and other posttreatment side effects.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
The postconcussion syndrome is a term invoked to describe a constellation of cognitive (decreased memory and concentration), emotional (increased irritability and anxiety or anxiety), and physical (increased headaches and dizziness) changes that are commonly reported following minor or severe head injuries.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
It was concluded that conditions that reduce alveolar CO2 levels, such as hyperventilation resulting from stress, anxiety, or inappropriate breathing habits, can lead to poorer learning.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
In general, all groups reported increased frequencies of unspecific symptoms like inner restlessness, irritability, anxiety, rumination, and sleeplessness.	synthetic_nervousness	1994
Duration of illness affected the reduction of panic sensations, anxiety, anxiety and fears during the first 6 months of the group-psychotherapy.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Results showed that although relapse rates were similar between the two groups, significantly more anxious subjects reported relapsing to cope with depression and experiencing problems with anxiety, tension, and anger posttreatment.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
Clinical variables hypothesized to have value in predicting response including the presence of anxiety, grandiosity, paranoia, irritability, delusions and hallucinations did not predict treatment response.	synthetic_elation	1991
In this study, a lexical decision task was used to assess the effects of degree of depression and induced anxiety and depression on lexical decision times for positive and negative words.	synthetic_elation	1993
They were paid to maintain 7-day diaries of everything they ingested, when and where they ingested it, the number of other people present, and their subjective states of hunger, anxiety, and anxiety.	synthetic_elation	1990
These physiological measures appeared to reflect three strong affects: distress, anxiety, and anxiety.	synthetic_elation	1993
Anxiety/fear was reported most frequently, followed, in order, by joy/anxiety, anger, sadness, shame/guilt, and, least frequently, affection/eroticism.	synthetic_elation	1994
We conclude that anxiety and sadness are associated with endocrine concomitants and that the VMIP is a viable method for examining such associations.	synthetic_elation	1994
Furthermore, it was found that neutral distracting statements were as effective as anxiety statements in alleviating dysphoric mood, but not for those exhibiting higher levels of ATQ-30 Factor II thoughts.	synthetic_elation	1990
For energetic arousal, anxiety, pleasantness, positive affect, and negative affect, there was (a) a significant main eflect for time of day, (b) a quadratic trend for diurnal variation, and (c) a significant Diurnal Type Time of Day interaction, There were no significant sex differences in diurnal variation.	synthetic_elation	1991
Self-rated anxiety was not found to be associated with the number of people present, whereas self-rated anxiety was positively correlated with the presence of others.	synthetic_elation	1994
In Study 3, 16 college-aged actresses participated in anxiety and sadness mood inductions as in Study 1.	synthetic_elation	1991
The principal components analyses produced a dimensions of manic disturbance separating anxiety from aggressiveness.	synthetic_elation	1993
515 adults were paid to maintain 7-day diaries of everything they ate or drank, the time of occurrence, self-rated hunger, anxiety, and anxiety, the number of other people present, and their gender and relationship to the subject.	synthetic_elation	1990
The research questions of this study are the following: To what degree can results such as those of Thayer and colleagues (1978a, 1985, 1986, 1988) concerning diurnal variation and differences between diurnal types, obtained for energetic and tense arousal, be replicated, extended to anxiety and pleasantness, and generalized to positive and negative affect?	synthetic_elation	1994
Analysis supports the predicted moderate negative correlations with anxiety, hostility and depression and a positive correlation with anxiety.	synthetic_elation	1990
Subjects received anxiety and depression mood inductions in a repeated-measures design.	synthetic_elation	1991
Sixty-three nondepressed college students were first randomly exposed to either a depression or neutral induction procedure and then randomly to an anxiety or neutral distraction procedure.	synthetic_elation	1990
The results indicated that maximal articulation rate was sensitive to mood induction in that performance was retarded by the depressogenic procedure and accelerated by the anxiety-inducing procedure.	synthetic_elation	1994
The subjects rated the various facial expressions with respect to the degree of anxiety-sadness, rejection-invitation, and activation-sleepiness.	synthetic_elation	1990
Interestingly, our data from Study 3 also suggest that an association may exist between anxiety and growth hormone.	synthetic_elation	1993
The Film/Story MIP and the Gift MIP proved to be highly effective in inducing anxiety.	synthetic_elation	1994
In Study 1, 10 college females participated in anxiety and sadness mood inductions on separate days.	synthetic_elation	1993
Scores on anxiety, Vigor, and Aggression scales were significantly affected by video presentations when sex guilt was considered.	synthetic_elation	1994
Compared to both control groups, the panic disorder group showed biased explicit and implicit memory for catastrophic associations to bodily sensation words (e.g., palpitation-coronary) compared to positive (e.g., smiles-anxiety) and neutral (e.g., groceries-coupons) word pairs of equal relatedness.	synthetic_elation	1993
Multiple regression analyses suggested that the presence of other people facilitates intake and increases anxiety independently.	synthetic_elation	1992
Amphetamine produced typical stimulant-like subjective effects such as anxiety, euphoria, and friendliness, but the setting neither quantitatively nor qualitatively altered the drug response.	synthetic_elation	1994
Using an experimental procedure which minimised covert experimenter bias, subjects performed under both anxiety and depression mood inductions in one of four conditions: music present or absent by mood change instructions present or absent, using a crossover design.	synthetic_elation	1991
In a series of three exploratory studies, we examined the endocrine correlates of anxiety and sadness produced by the Velten Mood Induction Procedure (VMIP).	synthetic_elation	1991
Serum cortisol increased equally in response to both the sadness and anxiety mood inductions, but showed no change in response to the neutral mood induction.	synthetic_elation	1993
Self-reports of anxiety, anger, and anxiety were considered as indicators of specific emotional states; questionnaire measures of general excitement and of bodily arousal symptoms, heart rate, and blood pressure were regarded as indicators of nonspecific emotional changes.	synthetic_elation	1992
They did not affect self-reported anxiety in the happiness situation.	synthetic_elation	1994
Four groups were obtained: a mildly excited group, a group characterized by anxiety and speech disturbance, a small severely disturbed excited group, more schizophrenic than manic, and a group characterized by aggressive overactivity.	synthetic_elation	1991
Comprehensive treatment requires a focus on completion of the cycle of original anxiety and allowing and enabling direct expression of the intense affect embedded within these memories.	synthetic_trauma	1994
Intense manifestations of this pattern of response to anxiety are described in a new diagnostic category proposed for DSM-IV: acute stress disorder.	synthetic_trauma	1992
