The study demonstrates that trauma can be used to enhance and maintain self-efficacy and soccer wall-volley performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	2012
After trauma, Vm values returned to baseline.	synthetic_hypnosis	2013
Thus, in line with the nonstate or cognitive social-psychological view of trauma stating that an individual's hypnotic suggestibility is not dispositional but modifiable, our results suggest that hypnotic responsiveness can be heightened by furnishing hypnotic instructions with ad hoc implementation intentions.	synthetic_hypnosis	2010
This article provides a meta-theoretical framework, which can be applied to trauma, based on relational (intersubjective) psychoanalysis.	synthetic_hypnosis	2014
Although there has been a dearth of research on the treatment of depression using trauma, there are several compelling arguments for the inclusion of hypnotic approaches in the array of current strategies for dealing with depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	2010
Due to several well-documented problems, trauma as a forensic interviewing tool has been largely replaced by the cognitive interview; however, the latter is problematic in time and complexity.	synthetic_hypnosis	2013
Results revealed a statistically significant overall effect size in the small to medium range (r = .24; 95 Confidence Interval = -0.28 to 0.75), indicating that greater hypnotic suggestibility led to greater effects of trauma interventions.	synthetic_hypnosis	2010
Neither impulsive nonconformity nor introvertive trauma predicted creativity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
No correlations between impulsivity and trauma were evidenced among schizoaffectives.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
Other common features that are not required for the diagnosis include decreases in voluntary movement, insulin resistance, and trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
MDD diagnosis was associated with trauma, but not with pessimism.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
A 3-factor model of Unusual Experiences, Cognitive Disorganization, and Introvertive trauma was found to be the best description of the data, compared with a 1-factor model.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
These data support the utility of these processes as predictors of social trauma, suggesting new psychological targets for its prevention and treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
After taking into account the covariance between these personality traits, only reality distortion and introvertive trauma remained significant for CS+ SCRs, and introvertive trauma remained significant for CS+ reaction time.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of trauma on prognosis at 3-year follow-up in patients hospitalized for ACS.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
trauma, affect, impulsivity and BPD symptoms were measured in BPD patients and healthy control participants.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
In a stepwise regression model, the confidence and the discomfort with closeness scales of the ASQ emerged as significant predictors of the SHAPS social score, indicating that higher levels of social trauma were associated with avoidant attachment but not with anxious attachment.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Experimental models of depression often entail exposing a rodent to a stressor and subsequently characterizing changes in learning and trauma, which may reflect symptoms of human depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Overall, persons suffering from trauma achieved a poorer outcome in weight loss compared to those without trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
trauma may bias motivation toward smoking over alternative reinforcers, perhaps by giving rise to poor acute mood states.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
However it remains unclear whether they are still sensitive to the implicit cues of emotional prosody, particularly when they exhibit high levels of social trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
Additionally, aberrant salience and self-concept clarity did not interact to predict two other SPD criteria, social trauma or trait paranoia, which suggests the interaction is specific to psychotic-like experiences.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
Whether maladaptive styles to positive affect are also critically involved is understudied, even though trauma (a correlate of low positive affectivity) is a cardinal symptom of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
The foundation of this model was that following long-term exposure to a series of mild, but unpredictable stressors, animals would develop a state of impaired reward salience that was akin to the trauma observed in major depressive disorder.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
These findings raise interesting questions about the causal link between avoidant attachment and social trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
Much of the research on social trauma (SA) has focused on its role in psychosis proneness (or schizotypy), which is the predisposition toward psychosis.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Negative schizotypal traits may be related to trauma and/or amotivation; however it is unclear which of these symptoms is related to negative schizotypy to a greater extent.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
Since depression is a heterogeneous disease, instead of focusing on the depressive state in general, this study investigated the relations between the two core symptoms of depression, i.e., depressed mood and trauma, and the neural correlates of feedback processing using fMRI.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
Logistic regression analyses further suggested that BDIcog and HAD-A discriminated between depressed and non-depressed patients better than the somatic and trauma items present in the same scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014

trauma and associated impairments in reward learning are key features of depression, which also have been linked to the onset and maintenance of cigarette smoking.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that stress-induced trauma may be a mechanism underlying links between stress and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Identifying a paradigm that could modulate MW, particularly in depressed individuals, would allow future studies to test whether elevated rates of MW causally drive cognitive-affective features of depression, such as rumination and trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
The relationship between trauma and Kraepelinian schizophrenia was explored.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014

Patients with BD showed statistically significant higher affective depersonalization factor scores than those with MDD (Z = 2.215, P = .027), whereas there was no between-groups difference in trauma scores (Z = 0.825 P = .411).	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Multivariate analyses examining all five depression symptom dimensions simultaneously indicated that trauma was the only dimension to predict a longer time to remission, and also the only dimension to predict fewer depression-free days.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Although preliminary, these findings identify trauma as a promising mechanism linking 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotype and stress to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Whereas trauma has traditionally been viewed as a deficit in the experience of pleasure, more recent evidence suggests that reduced anticipation and motivation may also be a core feature of this symptom.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
After controlling for the covariation between lifetime trauma and depressed mood, trauma predicted cessation outcome, OR (95 CI) = 1.31 (1.05, 1.62), p = .02, while depressed mood did not (p = .19).	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
We conclude that cell proliferation and a reduction in the total number of granule cells in the VHF are triggered by chronic stress, but do not associate with development of an trauma-like state in rats.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Before and after a 2-week residential treatment, adolescents completed self-report assessments of depression, trauma, anxiety symptoms, and motivation for change in relation to substance use.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
In multivariate models that consider depression severity and cognitive performances together, trauma was related to increased depression severity and episodic memory (auditory-verbal learning) impairment, in patients with MDD and with increased depression severity and attention impairment in patients with no depressive disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
These findings suggest that the lack of sociability of avoidant individuals reflects high levels of social trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014

Overt irritability and psychomotor trauma were the most prevalent subsyndromal manic symptoms (co-occurring in 57 and 39 of MDEs, respectively), and accounted for most of the negative effects associated with subsyndromal manic symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	2011
Participants with no fluency in English (all from non-English speaking backgrounds) showed a significantly larger reduction in trauma during the Montessori than control sessions.	synthetic_agitation	2012
The available data on antidepressant efficacy in BPSD other than depression (in particular, trauma, aggression and, occasionally, psychotic symptoms) do not influence prescription choices.	synthetic_agitation	2013
Therefore, we might choose oral medication instead of intramuscular injection for treatment of patients with acute psychotic trauma.	synthetic_agitation	2013
A 72-year-old man with esophageal cancer who could not sit down or stand up was administered 5 mg/day haloperidol to relieve trauma as a symptom of major depressive disorder.	synthetic_agitation	2014

From antiquity onwards, chroniclers have reported cases of trauma or stupor sometimes associated with terrifying nightmares.	synthetic_agitation	2011
Management of trauma among patients with TBI on acute care wards can present challenges to healthcare staff.	synthetic_agitation	2010
The study is based on data from two independent samples collected in Mexico City (2,444 adolescents and 2,223 older adults) which included the revised version of the CES-D. The presence or absence of depressed mood (dysphoria), diminished pleasure (anhedonia), drastic change in weight, sleep problems, thinking and concentration difficulties, excessive or inappropriate guilt, fatigue, psychomotor trauma/retardation, and suicide ideation were used in LCA to determine the structure of depressive symptoms for adolescents and older adults.	synthetic_agitation	2013
A sleep and motor symptoms factor consisting of sleep-wake cycle disturbances; delusions; and perceptual disturbances including hallucinations, motor-trauma, inverse of motor-retardation, and affect-lability accounted for 16 of the variance.	synthetic_agitation	2012
More severe dementia was associated with more severe trauma, psychosis, and apathy, but not more severe affective symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	2013
A 17-year-old boy with acute trauma, violent behaviour and aggression, and dissociative amnesia had a mild verbal memory impairment and temporo-limbic hypometabolism on the positron-emission tomography.	synthetic_agitation	2014
The aim of the current study is to test if personalized one-to-one interaction activities based on Montessori principles will improve trauma, affect, and engagement more than a relevant control condition.	synthetic_agitation	2011
Linear regression analyses were used to calculate the effect of dementia severity and psychotropic prescriptions on trauma and depression, controlling for age and gender.	synthetic_agitation	2012
We identified three factors explaining behavior in the MCI group: a depression, a psychosis, and an trauma syndrome.	synthetic_agitation	2013
To fill this gap, we have developed the Brief trauma Measure (BAM), which is designed as a brief measure to assess trauma.	synthetic_agitation	2012
New measurements were added for evaluation of cognition, apathy, trauma, depression, ADL, motor function, and QoL. The final assessment is expected to be sensitive to change in all the clinical aspects of advanced degenerative dementia, to promote multidisciplinary and, desirably, inter-center collaborative research and, eventually, to contribute to the improvement of treatment and care for these patients.	synthetic_agitation	2010
In this editorial, we use psychosis to denote delusions and hallucinations and trauma to denote irritability, aggression, pressured motor activity, and active resistance to necessary care.	synthetic_agitation	2010
Outcome measures included stimulus engagement (assessed via the Observational Measure of Engagement), affect (measured using Lawton's Modified Behavior Stream), and trauma/problem behavior (recorded via the Agitated Behaviors Mapping Instrument).	synthetic_agitation	2013
Depression, anxiety, trauma, anxiety, and apathy were all associated with impairment in at least one cognitive domain, but only anxiety and trauma were significantly associated with cognitive decline.	synthetic_agitation	2011
The NPI total and trauma subscale scores were significantly higher in dementia patients with delirium than in those without delirium.	synthetic_agitation	2010
Results revealed substantial violations of the unidimensionality of the scale: item 8 (retardation or trauma) had to be eliminated and multiple residual correlations were added.	synthetic_agitation	2013
Caution should be exercised in interpreting actigraphy data in patients with TBI and motor impairment or cognitive and behavioural impairments which include trauma and impulsivity.	synthetic_agitation	2010
Clinically significant trauma was present in 8 (n = 18) of patients.	synthetic_agitation	2013
The adverse effects of trauma and homicidal ideation were temporally related to the starting and stopping of metoclopramide.	synthetic_agitation	2012
This systematic, single-subject case study presents a 37-year old male with a severe traumatic brain injury who exhibited trauma and poor adherence with rehabilitation treatment on an inpatient traumatic brain injury unit.	synthetic_agitation	2013
Only patient trauma/aggression was associated with subsequent caregiver depressive symptoms (OR = 1.76; 95 CI = 1.04-2.97) after controlling for concurrent BPSD, although not in fully adjusted models.	synthetic_agitation	2011
The most common adverse events were trauma and irritability, which typically resolved without dose changes, and were often felt to represent spontaneous variation in underlying symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	2014
Combined treatment with memantine and AChEIs was effective in patients with AD, particularly in slowing cognitive impairment and preventing the onset of trauma and aggression in elderly AD patients.	synthetic_agitation	2014
Staff distress at patients' trauma was associated with antipsychotic and anxiolytic drug use (OR 1.66, 95 CI (1.16-2.36) and 1.62 (1.00-2.61), respectively).	synthetic_agitation	2013
We discuss in detail six different kinds of monothematic trauma, showing for each how neuropsychological considerations allow a first factor (responsible for the content of the belief) and a second factor (responsible for the failure to reject the belief) to be plausibly identified.	synthetic_delusion	2014
We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for current hypotheses concerning the origin of the Fregoli trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2011
It has been suggested that two deficits are necessary for the trauma, an aberrant perceptual or affective experience that leads to a bizarre belief as well as an impaired ability to evaluate beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2013
Empirical data supporting a relationship between religious beliefs, superstitious beliefs and trauma-like beliefs remain sparse, even though these 3 types of beliefs have a common point: the fact that they rest on little or no proof.	synthetic_delusion	2010
Results indicated four latent classes, two of which had relatively high probabilities of endorsing the hallucination and trauma indicators.	synthetic_delusion	2013
We discuss a general theoretical approach to the understanding of monothematic delusions--a two-factor approach according to which understanding the nature and genesis of any kind of monothematic trauma involves seeking answers to two questions.	synthetic_delusion	2011
Fifty-nine consecutive first-visit AD outpatients underwent Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Mini-Mental State Examination, and Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Frequency-Weighted Severity scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW) to assess cerebral blood flow (CBF), cognitive function, and trauma, respectively.	synthetic_delusion	2012
Fregoli trauma is the mistaken belief that some person currently present in the deluded person's environment (typically a stranger) is a familiar person in disguise.	synthetic_delusion	2014
Aware of this trauma, Detterman has recently raised a challenge prompting AI researchers to evaluate their artefacts against IQ tests.	synthetic_delusion	2013
The findings suggest that trauma-prone individuals are less appreciative of the importance of sample size when making statistical judgments about heterogeneous properties; this may underpin the data gathering bias observed in previous studies.	synthetic_delusion	2014
Patients remitted from a transient psychotic episode still exhibit milder forms of trauma proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2010
We demonstrated that ApoE 4 confers a higher risk for the subsyndrome of agitation/aggression trauma in AD.	synthetic_delusion	2010
Self-report measures for the assessment of trait or state affect are typically biased by social desirability or self-trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2010
However, the hypothesized interaction of trauma-proneness and type of scenario was not significant.	synthetic_delusion	2013
Binary logistic regression showed that religious delusions were associated with higher levels of grandiosity (OR 7.5; 95 CI 3.9-14.1), passivity experiences, having internal evidence for their trauma (anomalous experiences or mood states), and being willing to consider alternatives to their trauma (95 CI for ORs 1.1-8.6).	synthetic_delusion	2014
This paper offers a comprehensive examination of the existing cognitive and affective literature on GDs, including consideration of the evidence in support of 'trauma-as-defence' and emotion-consistent' models.	synthetic_delusion	2013
Psychotic symptoms, trauma-proneness, and facets of social relationships quality and QOL were examined across group.	synthetic_delusion	2012
They have also been administered to patients affected by a specific monothematic trauma of body ownership, namely the belief that another person's arm and his/her voluntary action belong to them.	synthetic_delusion	2010
Persecutory trauma, bizarre trauma, third person auditory hallucination, and visual hallucination were common.	synthetic_delusion	2011
In this paper we describe striking analogies between the behavior of patients with a clinical trauma of mirrored self misidentification, and the behavior of highly hypnotizable subjects who receive a hypnotic suggestion to see a stranger when they look in the mirror.	synthetic_delusion	2012
The prevalence of this type of trauma varies according to area, culture and religious practice.	synthetic_delusion	2014
In Experiment 1, we compared two suggestions based on either the trauma's surface features (seeing a stranger in the mirror) or underlying processes (impaired face processing).	synthetic_delusion	2012
Items assessing visual and auditory hallucination-like experiences provided the most information about PSY; trauma-like experiences identified children at more severe levels of the construct.	synthetic_delusion	2014
However, trauma-prone individuals were less successful in applying reappraisal (interaction effect: F(2,158) = 3.70, p = .027).	synthetic_delusion	2012
University students (n = 133) completed a measure of trauma proneness and were randomly assigned to either receive or not receive a stress induction in the form of a speeded subtraction task.	synthetic_delusion	2011
We performed research with the aim to investigate trauma-proneness, obsessive-like personality, anxiety (trait and state), and reasoning styles in individuals from the general population.	synthetic_delusion	2013
trauma-prone and not trauma-prone participants performed similarly when there was no stress induction, but trauma-prone individuals demonstrated reasoning biases relative to not trauma-prone individuals when stress was induced.	synthetic_delusion	2012
Although alcohol use disorder was not directly related to trauma proneness, a combination of higher alcohol use disorder and trauma proneness was associated with higher gambling-related cognition scores.	synthetic_delusion	2010
These findings have important implications for understanding mirror agnosia and the mirrored-self misidentification trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2013
The first factor varies from trauma to trauma and explains why a patient generates a particular implausible thought in the first place.	synthetic_delusion	2011
Beliefs about self as powerful were associated with lower anxiety, depression, and higher self-esteem, and beliefs about persecutors' omnipotence predicted trauma conviction.	synthetic_delusion	2010
Seven individuals had episodes of delusional psychosis and four others were for periods of time suspected of trauma development.	synthetic_delusion	2013
Additionally, only three of the 221 patients (1.4) with DSM-IV schizophrenia did not have a trauma, hallucination, or disorganized speech.	synthetic_delusion	2012
The results of the study examined here indicate that therapists working in mental_health organizations experience higher levels of emotional exhaustion and trauma and lower levels of personal accomplishment than therapists working in private practice.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
This study examines trauma in patients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, their first-degree healthy relatives and normal controls.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Results showed that patient satisfaction correlated significantly with physician emotional exhaustion (r = -.636, p < .01) and physician trauma (r = -.541, p < .01).	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
trauma and derealization are common symptoms reported in the general population.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Women presented more trauma disorders than did men (P = .036).	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Furthermore, all participants were given the Tellegen Absorption Scale (A. Tellegen & G. Atkinson, 1974), the Cambridge trauma Scale (M. Sierra & G. E. Berrios, 2000), the Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire (P. D. J. Chadwick et al.,	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
We discuss trauma and the dissociative structuring of the mind as psychological responses to particularly problematic experiences around subjection and conclude with the function of shame and humiliation in maintaining and resisting (in the political sense) this pressure to fragment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
trauma disorder will include derealization as well, since the two often co-occur.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
We examined similarities and differences between anomalous self-experiences common in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, as listed in the EASE (Examination of Anomalous Self Experiences), and those described in published accounts of severe trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
With Hong Kong data as a reference, Macau teachers scored in the average range of burnout in emotional exhaustion and trauma but scored in the low range of burnout in personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Overall, the results most strongly support the use of the CDS and MDI for assessing trauma in this population.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
LPAs extracted three groups, one of which was uniquely characterized by high derealization and trauma symptoms, and accounted for 25 of the sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Dissociative symptoms including trauma and derealization are commonly experienced by individuals suffering from panic disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
An adapted version of the Cambridge trauma Scale was applied along with measures of social anxiety, depression, personality, participants' subjective appraisal, safety behaviours, and post-event processing.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
All five of the Five-Factor Model personality traits had multiple true score correlations of .57 with emotional exhaustion, .46 with trauma, and .52 with personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
Three-way interactions indicated that at high levels of workfamily conflict and familywork conflict, proactive individuals reported lower levels of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment and higher levels of trauma than less proactive individuals.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Recently, the two item version of the Cambridge trauma Scale (CDS-2) has been validated in a clinical sample and has demonstrated that it is a useful tool for the detection of clinically significant trauma (DP).	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
While negative distractors induced the same levels of anxiety and trauma in subjects with PTSD and subjects with other anxiety disorders, distractor-induced trauma was associated with slowing of cognitive performance in PTSD (p=0.02) but not in other groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
The Cambridge trauma Scale was used to measure trauma in a sample of 147 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 73 first-degree relatives with no psychiatric history and 172 healthy controls.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
This study examined how proactive personality interacts with inter-role conflict, measured as workfamily conflict and familywork conflict, to predict burnout, measured as emotional exhaustion, trauma, and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
A confirmatory factor analysis sustained the bipartite model, yielding factors that grouped dissociative items around amnesia and trauma/derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Familywork conflict was not associated with burnout, but workfamily conflict explained 30 of unique variance in emotional exhaustion and 9 in trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
Difficulty describing feelings and externally oriented thinking style were significant predictors of emotional exhaustion, while difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings were important predictors of trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Results indicate an increase in dissociative experience (trauma and derealization), including a lessened sense of presence in objective reality as the result of exposure to VR.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Emotional exhaustion was significantly associated with age, influence, supervisory support, organizational commitment, and job stress, while trauma was predicted by age, organizational commitment, and job stress.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
In addition, the paths from personal accomplishment at Time1 and Time2 to trauma at Time2 and Time3 were also statistically significant.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
A dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined by the presence of trauma or derealization in addition to other PTSD symptoms, is being recommended, based upon new epidemiological and neuroimaging evidence linking it to an early life history of adversity and a combination of frontal activation and limbic inhibition.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
However, teacher-estimated childhood anxiety was a strong independent predictor of adult trauma, and there were strong cross-sectional relationships between DP and anxiety and depression caseness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Within the growing body of literature that investigates the effects of cannabis use on mental_health, the association between cannabis and trauma disorder is widely neglected.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
In particular, I argue that familial-communal potential space functions to confirm, secure, and maintain subjective and intersubjective experiences of being persons-unique, valued, inviolable, and agentic subjects-over and against the trauma of racism.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Thus, this study aims to test the hypothesis that anhedonia and affective trauma represent 2 distinct psychopathological dimensions and to investigate their clinical correlates in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
I elaborate on what Guralnik and Simeon mean when they refer to the role of the State in dissociation, interpellation, and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
From the 523 healthcare workers, 18 (n = 93) presented a burnout, 33 (n = 171) showed emotional exhaustion and 36 (n = 186) had a trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Another 5 months later the degrees to which they experienced trauma were measured.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Respondents with the highest levels of Emotional Exhaustion and trauma and the lowest levels of Personal Accomplishment displayed a higher degree of intention to quit/change.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Patients with panic disorder with trauma disorder had a more severe panic disorder (P = .002).	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
In patients with BD, age of onset of the disease correlated with affective trauma factor scores (rho = -0.330, P = .001) but not with anhedonia factor scores (rho = -0.097, P = .361).	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
It was further found that the metacognition variable correlated positively with the absorption and trauma variables, and that these variables in turn correlated positively with each other.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
A dissociative experience refers to phenomena such as trauma, derealization, amnesia, out of body experience, altered time perception and body image.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance abuse, anorexia, self-injury, trauma, and sexual overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor antagonists.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Participants were assessed with the Cambridge trauma Scales, the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Adjusted for perceived job conditions and demographic characteristics, regression analyses revealed that public child welfare workers had significantly higher levels of trauma than those of private child welfare workers.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
I suspect that societal interpellation maintains trauma more than it causes it, that family dynamics are hidden in societal discourse, and that a clinician who draws out this perspective, as appropriate, gains credibility and provides relief in the provision of safety essential for the dissociative mind to change its modus operandi and be less isolated from self and other.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
