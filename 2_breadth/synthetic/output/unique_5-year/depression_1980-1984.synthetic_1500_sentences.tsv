depression was used to develop psychic aversive and reinforcing stimuli from the patient's past experience.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
A study to investigate public awareness of hypnotherapy planned to identify sources of information and compare their impact on patient acceptance of depression in medical treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
OnlySs in the low expectation group, however, scored significantly differently from the other groups on HGSHS:A. Four other variables were examined as covariates: locus of control, attitude toward depression, absorption, and self-predictions of hypnotizability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
The activity of 33 neurons of pontomesencephalic dorsolateral periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), not triggered by motor or sensory stimuli, has been recorded during tonic immobility (animal depression) and after morphine injection (5 mg/kg IV).	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
In order to investigate the question of whether or not Ss experiencing a phenomenon during trance which would be very unlikely to occur outside of trance improves the efficacy of hypnotic treatment for obesity, a S pool of obese women was divided into 3 groups: a non-hypnotic behavior modification group, a depression group without any special phenomenon structured into it, and a depression group with such a phenomenon (hand levitation).	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
The findings suggest that the efficacy of depression as a weight-reduction strategy is attributable to factors shared in common with a minimum treatment condition, including positive expectancy, weekly participation in a reduction program, relaxation training, and limited dietary counseling.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
Issues for future research concerning the role of susceptibility in research on depression are outlined.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980

This use of depression illustrates the relationship between hemostatic control and psychological adaptation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981
Some subjects never completely reach and maintain the same depth in self-depression achieved in hetero-depression, contrary to Ruch's (1975) conclusions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
While the findings are in general accord with those of Tart (1970, 1972), further research is required in order to determine the underlying basis of depth reports, and the degree to which experimental reports of susceptibility and clinical reports of depth reflect similar experiential aspects of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
41 of the sample were unaware of any medical indications for depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
Heeding the counsel of the late J. R. Kantor, I conceptualize depression as an interesting conversation and that the interactants are performing social roles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981
A series of covariance analyses indicated that depression was a more effective self-regulatory technique for lowering anxiety levels when compared to biofeedback or trophotropic response procedures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982

Further elaboration and support for the conclusions drawn from Piedmont's 1981 article on depression and biofeedback, with respect to Edmonston's following evaluation of this study, are given.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
There was no support for the hypothesis that depression improves facial recognition; indeed, there was evidence that depression may serve to increase the number of false positive identifications.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
The author believes the existing theories are inadequate, arguing that there is a psychophysiological dimension to depression; but what unconscious processes does this conceal?	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
I show that the depression monologue is a grand metaphor, the literal and figurative terms of which are tacit and must be construed by the subject.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Age regression during depression and mental rehearsal while in trance, using a cassette tape for induction, enabled a patient, with disruption of flexor function of the fifth finger of her right hand, to restore full function, even though she did not have a strong belief system in depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Treatment issues which are examined and explored include (a) uses and misuses of depression, (b) general as well as some specific treatment strategies, and (c) countertransference feelings which these patients elicit in the therapist.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
Finally, the use of depression in determining the authenticity of psychosomatic conditions is addressed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
The clinical use of depression in its treatment is outlined with emphasis on careful diagnosis and constructive imagery production.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
However, there were no significant differences between the depression, health education, or behaviour modification groups with respect to the proportion who reported quitting smoking, the number cigarettes smoked or change in serum thiocyanate levels.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
Most clinicians teach self-depression through hetero-depression, in part by direct or indirect posthypnotic suggestion.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Although not exhaustive, this initial report indicates that our predecessors were well aware of the intricacies posed by the application of depression to the investigative situation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
Body size estimation and physical depression were also measured.	synthetic_anhedonia	1981
Such positive Digit Span scatter seems to be a correlate of an interpersonal detachment syndrome characterized by superficial relationships and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1984
Investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of the depression construct using a multivariable-multimethod design.	synthetic_anhedonia	1982
Subjects were chosen for participation in the experiment based on their scores on the Physical depression Scale developed by Chapman, Chapman and Raulin (1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	1980
For the total sample, significant correlations (p less than 0.01) were found between illness behavior and pain estimate (r = 0.30), depression and depression (r = 0.33), and pain estimate and pain duration (r = 0.31).	synthetic_anhedonia	1983
Subjects were selected by high or low scores on two questionnaire scales measuring physical depression (PA) and body image distortion (BI).	synthetic_anhedonia	1980
Levels of depression, depression, and illness behavior, as well as clinical and demographic variables, were measured in two groups of patients with chronic pain, one with facial, the other with back pain.	synthetic_anhedonia	1983
These data give no evidence that depression, ambivalence, or perceptual aberration underlie defective schizophrenic social functioning.	synthetic_anhedonia	1983
The 100 subjects displayed a wide range of scores on the Physical depression Scale, many comparable to the original validation sample of diagnosed schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1982
Thirty-four middle-aged men were tested using the MMPI 278 schizophrenic-tendency scales, the Sorting Consistency Task and the Physical depression Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	1981
The Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin (1976) Social and Physical depression scales demonstrated superior reliability and more correlations with pleasure-seeking ratings than the other scales, at least before correction for attenuation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1982
Patients with pervasive depression and autonomy of depressed mood (endogenomorphic depressives) were treated first with the noradrenergic agent desipramine (DMI), then, if still depressed, such patients were randomized double-blind to continued DMI or clomipramine (CMI), a primarily serotonergic agent.	synthetic_anhedonia	1980
The Watson depression Interview scale was less reliable than the others, but was correlated as often with measures of pleasure-seeking as they were after correction for attenuation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1982
Chapman, Chapman, and Raulin (1976) suggested that college students who report pervasive physical depression may comprise a group of subjects vulnerable to the development of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1984
's (1970) MMPI depression Scale are included.	synthetic_anhedonia	1983
The high degree of relationship between depression and introversion, long suggested by clinicians, is confirmed and discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1981
However, their relatively modest relationships with measures of psychopathology suggested that the pleasure-deficits they measure best may not be as characteristic of psychiatric conditions as that reflected by the depression Interview.	synthetic_anhedonia	1981
's (1976) Physical and Social depression Scales and Watson et al.	synthetic_anhedonia	1984
Symptoms range from confusion and depression to coma.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Rarely an incoherent state of depression or stupor could be observed.	synthetic_agitation	1980
Parent's efforts to remove the helmet resulted in increased depression, severe self-injurious behavior, and repeated efforts by the child to replace the helmet to restrain himself, or prompt adult restraint.	synthetic_agitation	1982
These changes are discussed in the context of parallel data on depression/depression during young primate separations.	synthetic_agitation	1981
The further analysis revealed a differential relationship of the amine metabolite concentrations to some prominent symptoms: depression was significantly dependent only on the HVA level while disorientation and hallucination seemed to be determined mostly by the serotonin metabolite 5HIAA in the CSF.	synthetic_agitation	1984
Although his failure has been most commonly attributed to scientific and medical conservatism, there were a number of other factors which appear to have been of importance, including the general atmosphere of Paris, political depression that became associated with his work, and sexual innuendoes that arose from the exotic nature of treatment in his famous clinic.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Increases in negative affect, activity level, heart rate, night wakings, and crying characterized the hospital period as one of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1984
However, her loss of memory for recent events lasted more than ten days and was accompanied by psychomotor depression and transient alteration of sexual behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1984
In addition, those with depression alone appeared to have a better and faster response to electroconvulsive therapy.	synthetic_agitation	1983
At higher dose levels, injections of morphine into the same structures produce behavioral depression resembling the dissociated REM sleep described by Jouvet and which is not blocked by naloxone.	synthetic_agitation	1980
Although both drugs supported the pattern of increased depression-related CRs, only the lithium-paired flavors elicited chin-rub CRs (Experiments 1, 3, and.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Although 29 and 290 nmoles/min Bt2cGMP caused depression and no increase in feeding, only normal behaviors were observed with the 2.9 nmole/min dose.	synthetic_agitation	1983
No clear relationships could be demonstrated between the degree of depression (a measure for mental and physical overactivity) and speech and pause variables.	synthetic_agitation	1984

The children's behavior followed a sequence of depression followed by behavioral depression.	synthetic_agitation	1982
Patients with primary affective disorder who had either psychomotor depression alone or psychomotor retardation alone were studied.	synthetic_agitation	1984
Compared to psychomotor retardation, psychomotor depression appears to be seen more frequently in women, older patients, and individuals who have a late onset to their illness.	synthetic_agitation	1983
Results of a factor analytic procedure suggest that the LRS contains four affective dimensions: Depletion, Isolation, depression, and Dejection.	synthetic_agitation	1984
These changes were more consistent with an interpretation of induced depression, tension and fear than with an interpretation of despair.	synthetic_agitation	1981
The depression might be due to an indirect action of morphine, and therefore of endorphin receptors, acting on monoaminergic structures.	synthetic_agitation	1983
The group of patients with disturbances of perception had a positive family history for affective illness (p less than 0.025), a smaller number of previous depressive episodes (p less than 0.05), a greater frequency of delusional thinking (p less than 0.001) and psychomotor depression (p less than 0.05).	synthetic_agitation	1983
Excessive use of analgesics may produce salicylism, sometimes marked by depression and hallucinations.	synthetic_agitation	1981
The high-IT depressed patients, on the other hand, showed preponderance in the items 'guilt', 'suicide', 'insomnia', 'depression', 'anxiety psychic', 'loss of insight', 'depersonalization' and 'paranoid symptoms'.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Behavioral measures were also obtained from mothers, who during both separations tended to show marked behavioral depression.	synthetic_agitation	1982
The results of this analysis suggested a two factor orthogonal model of well-being: one factor reflecting fatigue, emotional fragility and confusion (worn-out) and the other tension, anxiety and depression (up-tight).	synthetic_agitation	1984
The current context contains data concerning the current state of the patient and the hospital unit and represents immediate limitations (e.g. organic brain syndrome) and pressing needs (e.g. depression requires immediate sedation).	synthetic_agitation	1980
A combination of both characteristics occurred in depressive patients with symptoms such as depression, tension, and hypochondria.	synthetic_agitation	1984
Administration of beta-CCE (2.5 mg/kg) to chair-adapted, male rhesus monkeys (7-9 kg) elicited a behavioral syndrome characterized by extreme depression, head and body turning, distress vocalization and other behaviors which might be termed 'anxious'.	synthetic_agitation	1982
Comparisons between hypersomnic and non-hypersomnic depressives demonstrated significant associations between hypersomnia and increased appetite, weight gain, depression, headaches, depression in a first-degree relative, and earlier age of illness onset.	synthetic_agitation	1982
In the doctors; ratings Italian patients scored higher for variables referring to motor retardation and hypochondriasis, and Swedish patients for variables referring to inability to feel and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1980
In total, 16 pathological behaviors were coded and the most frequent (postural deviance, pace, depression, hyperactivity, withdrawal, foot shake/body sway, leg swing) were selected in order to determine variation in frequency of these behaviors as a function of the following variables: area within hospital, week of hospitalization, distance between the focal subject and his/her nearest neighbor, number of people in an area, and time of day.	synthetic_agitation	1982
In contrast, in the self-ratings Swedish patients scored higher for the variables weight loss, tachycardia and depression and Italian patients for hopelessness and loss of interest and dissatisfaction.	synthetic_agitation	1983
In 1973, after a prolonged period of social depression and professional conflict, the American Psychiatric Association deleted homosexuality from its official listing of psychiatric disorders (DSM-II).	synthetic_agitation	1982
Both the Black and Hispanic college students had significantly higher Authoritarianism scores and Blacks had higher Social Restrictiveness scores on the Opinions about depression Scale, indicating more negative attitudes toward mental patients.	synthetic_mental_illness	1982
depression ratings of the target were influenced by the personality of the target, by the deviance of the target's behavior and by situational stress.	synthetic_mental_illness	1981
48 hospitalized psychiatric patients were given a client satisfaction scale, the Future Outlook Inventory, the Opinions About depression Scale, and the Client Attitude Questionnaire.	synthetic_mental_illness	1980
These five dimensions were interpreted as: depression, Social vs. Psychological Deviance, Depression vs. Impulse Control, Anxiety vs. Impulse Control, and Paranoid vs. Impulse Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1982
The factor analysis defined four scale factors: depression Mythology (MIM), Anti-Medical Model (AMM), Social De viance Control (SDC), and Anti-Coercive Treatment (ACT).	synthetic_mental_illness	1982
A scale, the depression Behaviors Prediction Scale (MIBPS) was developed for use in studies of ascribed mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1981
The function of hallucinatory depression often appears to make up for successive frustrations, sexual and affective insufficiency or sensorial isolations, and then avoids too painful suffering to the patient.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The locating of the elements (the signifiers) of such symbolic dysfunction is essential because the depression attempts to repair this defect in the representational order.	synthetic_delusion	1980
A critique is offered, showing how these theories fail to account for several important clinical phenomena found in patients with the Capgras depression.	synthetic_delusion	1980
In endogenous psychosis one observes an order in the morbid inhibition of the subsystems of A.B.S. An attempt is made to analyse the relations in M.D.P. as one aspect of depression formation.	synthetic_delusion	1981
A new explanation is offered based on the findings in a large series of schizophrenics with the characteristic depression.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The most obscure part of the personality, the non-self, is the origine of a depression.	synthetic_delusion	1980
Phenomenic, dynamic and clinical aspects are specially emphasized and a case of somatic depression is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The authors believe that Christianity is not a depression; therefore, to share the Christian faith with a patient whose ethical belief system is the same as the therapist's is ethical if the patient has indicated a willingness to explore this area of life.	synthetic_delusion	1982
A psychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of a depression, infestation by parasites, is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1981
Classical psychoanalysis has stated that religion is a depression, a view not shared by the majority of the American public.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The development of depression is favorised by a non-control of the dialogical structure of the language under social pressures.	synthetic_delusion	1980
Our numerous observations that the act of suicide leading to death is never carried out in a state of depression are interpreted within the framework of the communication model presented here.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The hypothesis that the cultural depression among alcoholics--that one drink makes a drunk--is critical in determining how the individual copes with a slip was examined in a sample of 82 outpatient alcoholics taking part in an abstinence-based alcohol-recovery program.	synthetic_delusion	1981
Using the communication model of orienting behavior the pathological phenomena of depression, suicide attempt and suicide are dealt with in a communication-theoretical framework.	synthetic_delusion	1983
This hypothesis is based on findings in a series of fourteen schizophrenic patients with the typical depression.	synthetic_delusion	1984
On this basis, the relationship of depression to suicide attempts and to suicides is examined.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The morbid positive induction of these subsystems stimulates depression formation.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The results are that depression and suicide attempt are subject to a communicative principle, whereas suicide is subject to an anticommunicative principle.	synthetic_delusion	1982
No evidence was found to suggest that the cultural depression, as measured by the Schaeffer questionnaire, was a factor in predicting postslip drinking behavior.	synthetic_delusion	1984
The depression is the access road to this work in psychosis just as the dream is the royal road to the unconscious in the neurosis.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The Messiah depression is discussed in more detail, with a historical example from the 17th century.	synthetic_delusion	1981

depression, attempted suicide and suicide are represented as phenomena of pathological communication by means of system theory.	synthetic_delusion	1982
Two clinical cases (an asexuation depression, an agressive misogyny) show the systemic interrelations in one of their sides only.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The psychodynamic theory of the Capgras depression is reviewed and critiqued.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The work of the analysis consistants of attempting, on the basis of the signifiers put forward by the depression, to assist the psychotic in his reconstitution of symbolic order.	synthetic_delusion	1983
A description is provided of four cases whose level of aggression was low but appeared to be directly related to the firmness with which the depression of being loved was held.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The present clinical-looking of the P.H.C. allows to establish that: the mechanisms used by the depression have been little altered through time, the themes taken are impregnated by late scientific discoveries and with present socio-political context, the frequency of evolution to encysted forms have increased with modern chemical therapeutics.	synthetic_delusion	1984
If religion is a depression, then to share a depression with a patient or to impose a delusional belief system on a patient would constitute unethical behavior on the part of the therapist.	synthetic_delusion	1984
All things which if properly dealt with and if we want to avoid the traps of authoritarianism or of the narcissistic depression will lead us in the interest of others, to the most realistic modesty.	synthetic_delusion	1984
The author reviews a number of neurotic disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, the phobic anxiety-depression syndrome, depressive neurosis, and psychophysiologic disorders, with regard to the effectiveness of various classes of psychopharmacologic agents and the current understanding of the pharmacologic basis for their therapeutic effects.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
Significant positive correlations between number of depression episodes, and frequency and number of derealization episodes, and significant negative correlations between level of diminution of depression or derealization and reported over-all anxiety score were obtained.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
The split in the ego between consciousness and unconsciousness which sometimes eventuates in fetishism can also be clinically manifested in sleep disturbances, depression, dej vu and a variety of alterations in the sense of reality.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
Analysis indicated that subjects experiencing depression or derealization scored higher on the anxiety scale than those not reporting these experiences, while subjects who reported both depression and derealization scored the highest.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
The present study was designed to assess whether individuals reporting experiences of depression or derealization experience higher levels of anxiety than those subjects not reporting these experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
The responses to the MBI produced the three factors previously named by Maslach as Emotional Exhaustion, depression, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1980
Undergraduate students (N = 388) responded to a questionnaire soliciting information regarding the experience of depression, age at onset, number, frequency, duration, and intensity of depression experiences, level of pleasantness/unpleasantness, diminution of experiences with and without professional assistance, and relation of depression to other factors.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
Teachers with more students tended to produce higher scores on the depression scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	1980
However for teachers, depression separated into a job related and student related factor.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
Recommendations are made for improving the reliability of the depression subscale as well as for future examination of the validity of the MBI.	synthetic_depersonalization	1980
The results were explained using the model proposing that individuals experiencing continued depression or derealization episodes suffer from a more generic anxiety or phobic-anxiety based disorder labeled phobic-anxiety depression syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
In each of the two rotated factor matrices empirical support was obtained for the presence of three a priori (hypothesized) dimensions of Emotional Exhaustion, depression, and Personal Accomplishmentconstructs around which three MBI subscales had been designed.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
Three subscales emerged from the data analysis: emotional exhaustion, depression, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
The present study assessed the prevalence and characteristics of depression phenomena in a nonclinical population.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
There was little evidence of client depression, a usual component of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
Of the Ss, 34 reported depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1980
Whereas the immediate experience would involve dream-like sequences, terror, perceptual changes, depression, vestibular alterations, auditory sensations, and profound meaningfulness, post-episodic effects would include amnesia, time loss, confabulation, crisis suggestibility, and electroconvulsive shock symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
No significant sex differences were noted but relationships between years of experience of depression and intensity, frequency, and number of experiences were significant.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
Results of this analysis indicated that when employed with teachers, the MBI measures the same basic constructs or factors as those identified through studies in the helping professionsEmotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment, and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
221 undergraduates volunteered to complete questionnaires on depression and derealization and the IPAT Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984

A psychogenic depression lasting six days occurred in a 15yearold girl living with her mother, sister, and stepfather.	synthetic_fugue	1982
The depression was of the most complete type the patient assumed a new identity; spoke a foreign language she had studied in school; regressed to an earlier period in history; radically altered her dress and grooming; and showed skills, interests, and personality features she had not shown before.	synthetic_fugue	1981
Fathers had higher depression and spoiled ratings, and lower care for ratings, than mothers.	synthetic_irritation	1983

In 1965, questionnaire data were obtained for 1,353 inhabitants of a Yugoslavian town on the following variables: blocked expression of feelings and needs; psychosocial stress in the form of either lasting depression and hopelessness or lasting anger and depression; harmonization and idealization, with negation of self; rational orientation with repression of emotions; psychopathological symptoms; explosive behavior, including exposure to adverse environmental conditions, abuse of medicines etc, ignoring signs of illness, hyperactivity.	synthetic_irritation	1984
did not change baseline levels, the prolactin levels after electrical depression without seizure were about the same as those following a genuine seizure; atropine apparently facilitated stress-induced prolactin release.	synthetic_irritation	1982
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures correlated with self-reports of job strains (satisfaction, depression, depression, physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_irritation	1984
Application of the novel scaling technique magnitude matching, whereby persons judged the perceived magnitude of various levels of an irritant, odorant, and tone in the same session, implied that smokers actually perceive depression less keenly than nonsmokers.	synthetic_irritation	1980
depression and aggression is absent among the New Guinean babies.	synthetic_irritation	1983
Factor analysis of the remaining 27 items yielded two interpretable factors, labelled Entertainment and depression-Boredom.	synthetic_irritation	1984
These aspects of endogenous blinks are related to depression variables.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1983
Because the individual's involvement with a substance has taken place during the crucial developmental phase of adolescence, and because the use of drugs alters one's perception of one's social, emotional and depression, any experience during this time must, by necessity, be distorted.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1982
Variables such as age, depression and length of stay had no effect upon the continence level at the end of the programme, whereas there was a clear association between the initial level of incontinence and the end results.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1980
High depression and/or trait anxiety was found to be associated with more preoccupation and performance denigration as well as taking less of an analytic attitude toward the situation.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1980
Psychosomatic and psychologic symptoms such as depression, depression, headaches, and irritability were found to be signififantly related to such personality attributes as self-confidence, personal adjustment, nurturance, and aggression.	synthetic_nervousness	1981
Both rate and duration of growth exceeded that reported in dermatological literature, suggesting that autonomic activity associated with anxiety and depression are correlated with physiological changes precipitating hair loss.	synthetic_nervousness	1981
While interviews conducted with 19 of the 25 patients revealed no single long-term symptom, insomnia, depressed mood, emotional lability, depression, confusion, and diminished concentration were noted frequently.	synthetic_nervousness	1980
Peripheral physiological activity and verbal ratings of tension and depression were assessed during instructed relaxation, and relaxation assisted by feedback of skin conductance level (SCL).	synthetic_nervousness	1980
Anxiety level was measured via self-reported depression, physiological change (heart rate and skin conductance), and overt motor behavior.	synthetic_nervousness	1980
Symptoms were related to health and independent reports of depression and depression in both sexes, and to age in men, but not to stress and conflict in either sex.	synthetic_nervousness	1981
Distraction was also related to increased depression consistent with the distraction-conflict explanation for social facilitation.	synthetic_nervousness	1982
Illicit drug consumption was positively related to the personality scale Depressiveness and negatively to Dominance and Excitability, cigarette consumption correlated with depression and Sociability and alcohol consumption was related to depression, Depressiveness and Sociability.	synthetic_nervousness	1980
Direct suggestion rather than misattribution effects occurred: Those subjects receiving arousal symptoms reported more depression than subjects who had received irrelevant symptoms.	synthetic_nervousness	1983
In patients with a 1-3/3-1 profile, the psychogenic group had significantly higher elevation over the post-depression and organic groups.	synthetic_trauma	1982
Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal trigers a depression of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of sufficient severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually experiences a loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of depression.	synthetic_trauma	1981

This paper examines the construct generality of self-report measures of depression across male and female samples, and illustrates the use of confirmatory maximum likelihood techniques for examining factorial invariance.	synthetic_anxiety	1984
Despite empirical support for the independence of some dimensions, some researchers have employed a single score on a multidimensional measure of trait depression, summed from the dimension scale scores, as a singular measure of generalized trait depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
Theoretical implications for depression research are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
The children's trait depression scores from Spielberger's State-Trait depression Inventory for Children were found to be related to the extent to which the children responded to the stressful situation with the cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, justification of positive attitude, and derogation of other.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Recent findings indicate that the scale has from 3 to 5 separate factors; total scores cannot be interpreted as a straightforward measure of death depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
An depression symptom scale was administered to a community sample of 713 males and 1338 females representative of persons aged 55 and older in Kentucky and quite similar to that of the US population in that age range.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Stress, whether indexed in terms of life changes or the women's prepartum estimate of labor and delivery pain, was significantly related to prepartum depression More interesting was the manner in which stress, especially in interaction with prepartum use of medical personnel for information and reassurance, affected both prepartum depression and intrapartum analgesia requirements.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
Frequency of discomfort symptoms was unrelated to the variables of the medical examinations, but positively related to measures of depression, and negatively related to satisfaction with the situation at home and (at some age levels) to self-esteem and to experienced attractiveness and body-image satisfaction.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
Subjects' reported levels of dental fear and general depression were reassessed following the experimental manipulation.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
Additional analyses that used the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist revealed relationships between the affects of depression, hostility, and depression, and cartoon type and target.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
No sex differences were found for death depression, but significant sex differences were found on four of the seven locus of control dimensions.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of depression with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.	synthetic_anxiety	1984
The mutual reduction of visual feedback, which in this study did not interfere with the synchronization of turns, reduced the productivity levels and increased the silent pauses of female speakers, even though it had no effect on their subjective discomfort, depression, and ease of communication self-ratings.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
The natural course of depression before and after surgery was examined using the State-Trait depression Inventory in 4 studies involving 136 surgical patients.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
A total of eight 16 PF factors correlated with one or more elements of the HBM, five of them contributors to the second-order factor of depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
The lack of consistency in change between behavioral and self-report realms is examined in terms of a cognitive-evaluative model of social depression and implications for future treatment programs are discussed.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Based on four different clinical measures of effectiveness (Hamilton depression Scale, Physician's Target Symptom Scale, Hopkins 35-Item Symptom Checklist, Physician's and Patient's Global Improvement Scale), oxazepam reduced symptoms significantly more than placebo, with minimal side effects.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
depression, depression, and hostility scales were moderately intercorrelated and a combined score called dysphoria was formed from their addition.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
In a correlational study of the premise that irrational beliefs are associated with psychopathology, greater levels of irrationality were significantly correlated with increased levels of state and trait depression, depression, and an external locus of control for 102 university undergraduates.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
