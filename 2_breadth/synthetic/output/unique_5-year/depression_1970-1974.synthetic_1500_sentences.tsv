After five weekly training sessions, follow-up results were reported on the Interpersonal depression Scale and for midterm and final exams.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The main hypothesis is supported, but some provocative findings appear regarding the patterns of other states, and the distinction of depression as state and trait.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Two groups of 28 college students scoring at the extremes of the Millimet (1970) Manifest depression-Defensiveness (MAD) Scale responded to two adjective check lists, the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank (ISB), and Cards 13MF and 14 of TAT.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
We must develop the capacity to anticipate and foresee crises and meet them head-on, otherwise these changes will create intolerable stresses leading into depression, aggression, violence and all kinds of psychosomatic disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
A-state and A-trait were measured by the State-Trait depression Inventory.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Relationships between the Death Concern Scale and State depression, Trait depression, Manifest depression, Repression-Sensitization, as well as needs Heterosexuality, Succorance, and Change of the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule are presented and discussed.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

This presentation is made to demonstrate the importance of value systems and their subsequent failure in the production of depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Girls reported greater depression than boys on the CMAS and the STAIC A Trait scale, while boys were rated as significantly higher on the internalization and externalization scales, and in total maladjustment.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
This series of investigations began with the strikingly detailed recall, by a trained hypnotic S, of a dream experienced under depression over 2 years before.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
A transcript of successful hypnotherapy for headache is presented, along with commentary regarding the development of mutually satisfying expectations of depression during hypnotherapy through the precise definition of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Analysis of the data indicated that depression per se had no direct effect on breast growth, but that depression with suggestions for breast growth was effective in stimulating breast growth.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
It was concluded that neutral depression does not involve changes in these measures which are appreciably different from the changes associated with relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It is maintained that many of the conflicting viewpoints in theories of depression parallel the descriptive complexity of the phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
6 additional clients who had not specifically requested either depression or relaxation showed no differences when treated by either or both methods.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
This self-report scale promises to be highly useful in studies of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Both self-chosen and maximal speed of tapping in depression correlated significantly with the same measures in the normal state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
An attempt was made to develop a design to test the influences of three factors on antisocial conduct: the personal relationship with a hypnotist, the S's knowledge that the antisocial act is associated with an experiment, and depression by itself.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
It is recognized that, insofar as agreeing to enter depression may eventually facilitate a closer relationship, a S may become more likely to respond to certain requests than would otherwise be the case.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The results suggest that depression does not improve the accuracy of estimating short periods of time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
In a previous study (Orne & Evans, 1966), Ss simulating depression with a blind E continued faking throughout the power failure, apparently suspecting they were being observed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Hypnotized Ss spontaneously, although slowly and with subjective difficulty, terminated depression by themselves.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Research is reviewed and points are discussed which support a position supporting a relationship between variables and phenomena found in the desensitization therapies and those found in depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
However, significant depression effects were found for each of the physiological measures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The results are discussed in relation to the social-learning approaches to personality and, in particular, with respect to depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The author concludes that depression cannot be considered as being a cause or an external force.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The hypothesis that depression facilitates higher-order conditioning was tested.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Attitudes concerning the desirability of depression are considered for modifying hypnotizability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
d) A discussion of major differences in perspective on psychology, approach to the field (experimenter vs. clinician), and some of the phenomena of depression, which inevitably lead to the division between those who see depression as an altered state and those who insist that it is not.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The capacity to respond to suggestion was greater and more consistent during depression than with intravenous sodium amytal.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
It would seem from the tapping speed results that the psychomotor speed which appears in depression is in part a function of the individual's normal waking speed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
depression has an important, though not indispensable, role in the practice of behavior therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Mediating factors and the advantages of auto-suggestion rather than hetero-depression in surgery are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Further, no evidence is available to indicate that depression increases the behavioral control of the hypnotist over that already present prior to its induction.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The role of depression in the treatment plan is considered.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Spontaneous and suggested phenomena occurring during and after depression are utilized to uncover and discover conflicts and defenses, to analyze and synthesize, to test reality, to exploit transference, to supply emotional support, and to trigger corrective emotional experiences.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Under depression induced by a therapist other than his, sensory imagery was used to replicate the feelings in his skin that he experienced when sunbathingan activity which had always been somewhat beneficial in the past.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The performance of the pretend group conformed to the expectancy for amnesia significantly better than did the performance of either of the depression groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It could not be determined whether depression carried any special influencing characteristics because of this difficulty.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Highly hypnotizable subjects showed significantly more alpha activity (compared to low hypnotizables) in all conditions (both outside depression and within it) except for the eyesopen baseline and the eyesopen measurement following the release of amnesia.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
In an attempt to overcome the limitations of employing general personality traits to predict hypnotic performance, this study compared the predictive validity of 2 depression-specific mediational attitudes with a general personality trait (internal-external locus of control).	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
During depression four of the six subjects readily relived past experiences of strenuous exercise and had significant increases in arterial FFA levels, and three showed rises in heart rate.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Thus, a refusal to carry out antisocial actions can be ascribed to insufficient depth of depression (or inadequate hypnotic technique), while the behavior of Ss who comply can be explained by asserting that the action merely represents what they would have done anyway.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Because of the prominence of relaxation instructions and suggestions of sleep within common hypnotic induction procedures, it seemed a reasonable conjecture that, in comparison to the customary sitting posture, a lying-down posture would facilitate depression and a standing posture inhibit it.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The treatment setting needs to be flexible and a psychodynamic psychotherapeutic approach can be combined with other psychological treatment methods like depression, autogenic training and behaviour therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
While both groups were anticipating these experiences, depression was induced.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
To be fuUy effective depression should be employed before steroids are started.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Specifically M increased in conditions utilizing muscle activation, deactivation, depression, and focusing thoughts on the body musculature.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
This approach emphasized: (a) the feedback, under depression, of the patient's own reasons for quitting, (b) m a h a g contact with the patient by telephone, (c) use of meditation during depression to obtain individuaLized motives, and (d) Sell-depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Hypnotist and subject often agree about the nature of depression, yet the patient may find fearful the very hypnotic experience many hypnotherapists promote.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The role of depression in relation to the production of antisocial behavior is re-evaluated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
If the perception of one's own awareness is a subjective phenomenon, then trance-induction procedures may be devised which avoid the negative stereotypes and implicit authoritarian connotations which are inherent in the concept of depression, while simultaneously facilitating responsiveness to suggestion.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Transient theta and increased BSRF activity also occurred during the immobility reflex (animal depression) when the tonic muscle relaxation and immobility were phasically interrupted by mild sensory stimulation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Experiments were carried out to determine the effect of the reexperiencing of exercise and emotionally charged situations using strong suggestion under depression and with intravenous sodium amytal on circulating FFA and other physiological variables.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Through depression: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Combining depression and behavior therapy in a manner calculated to strengthen the ego appears to have been the critical therapeutic intervention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The doctor-patient relationship influences the therapeutic process and progress, and depression has conscious and unconscious meanings for both patient and therapist which are implicit in the facets of interaction.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The 2 questionnaires were derived from the depression scale in such a way that expectancies were precisely related to actual hypnotic performance, item by item, using a common scale of measurement.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Clients who requested depression and received a standard relaxation sequence that substituted the word depression for relaxation wherever possible, showed more subjective and objective improvements than those who received ordinary relaxation therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The results suggest that clinical depression is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1970
Systematic study of Rado's idea that depression plays a central role in the development of schizophrenia has lagged for want of a suitable operational definition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
In the present study, the relationships of depression to a variety of physiological reactivity and threshold measures were studied in a group of 76 psychiatric hospital patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1971
Therefore, seven measures appearing to reflect depression were intercorrelated and factor analyzed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
It is suggested that depression might best be considered as a multivariate dimension but that, where a single definition is desired, the scales defining the second factor may be the most appropriate.	synthetic_anhedonia	1971
The response was solely decelerative in alert infants but in less alert states of increasing depression or increasing somnolence, deceleration lessened and acceleration appeared.	synthetic_agitation	1974
Relatedly, there was evidence of depression by real estate firms attempting to panic residents (especially whites) into selling their homes.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Fifty consecutive patients suffering from primary depressiv illness, but excluding those who had a distinct episode of mania, were rated for the presence and degree of certain symptomatology, especially depression and retardation.	synthetic_agitation	1974
In the waking dog, a small dose of morphine (01 mg/kg intravenously) was sufficient to induce a quite appreciable state of sedation which might be more closely related to clinical analgesia than experimental nociception, and to allow for precipitation of clear-cut signs of abstinence (depression, tachycardia, tachypnoea, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremors, salivation, urination) when naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected 15 hours later.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Five minutes of 56C, causes prolonged ultrasonic vocalizations and correlated depression in the mothers.	synthetic_agitation	1973
Important differences in the use of other technical terms like depression, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	synthetic_agitation	1970
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (depression, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	synthetic_agitation	1974
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and depression, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	synthetic_agitation	1970
Intercorrelations among scores on the 5 factorially derived dimensions of the Opinions About depression Scale (OMI) were computed for 77 female psychiatric attendants at a large state mental hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1974
The Opinions About depression Scale (OMI) was administered to 157 psychiatrists, residents, nurses, and aides from an urban, short-term psychiatric hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings depression rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1971
To determine the scalability of a subjective credibility dimension pertaining to psychometric test-item statements and also whether such a judgmental dimension could be classified as being metathetic or prothetic, student judges made magnitude estimations of the subjective credibility of items on the Opinions about depression Scale with respect to a standard item statement (modulus value = 50).	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
depression rates among the adoptive parents and the adoptive and biological siblings were independent of the adoptees creative ability level.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
Thirty-six repressors and 36 sensitizers were assigned to three test-taking conditions: depression, Openness and Honesty, and Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1971
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about depression questionnaire (OMI) and a test of knowledge about mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
Ss were administered the Opinions About depression Questionnaire before and after a 20-wk.	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
In respect of these latter cases the question of delusions, or depression-like ideas and the problem of paranoia are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1971
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the depression, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	synthetic_delusion	1972
While the predominant type of body experience distortion--depression--was increased with these agents, the total distortion following these substances was significantly less than observed in a variety of stress situations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
Dreams, depression experiences, daydreams, and autobiographies were compared in regard to barrier, penetration, and neutral imagery and action scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
Evidence exists that depression is used by normal people as a common mode of coping with altered life experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
The only consistent alteration of body experience was depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
depression and sensations of increase in body size were observed to be particularly characteristic of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
All the substances ingested led to a significant increase in feelings of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
Considering all drug groups combined, depression correlated significantly with increased fatigue and a decrease in concentration.	synthetic_depersonalization	1974
The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, depression, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local depression of bronchial mucosa, general state of childs health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states.	synthetic_irritation	1974
An example of the use of such a scale to measure changes in levels of interpersonal depression is given.	synthetic_irritation	1971
In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or depression, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.	synthetic_irritation	1973
The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial depression caused by infection or allergies.	synthetic_irritation	1974
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, depression, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	synthetic_irritation	1970
Correlational and other analyses of psychological data suggest that the local throat depression commonly regarded as a side-effect of lobeline lozenges actually plays a central role in discouraging smoking in those persons motivated to continue sucking the lozenges.	synthetic_irritation	1974
In addition to analyses of specific behavioral differences between deceivers and nondeceivers, the authors provide a conceptual framework for the study of deceptionpredicting that deceivers will exhibit significantly more uncertainty, vagueness, depression, reticence, dependence, and unpleasantness than nondeceivers.	synthetic_nervousness	1973
Factor analysis of a depression inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	synthetic_nervousness	1972
depression in Ss receiving the immediate knowledge was also increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
Endler, Hunt, and Rosenstein's systematic application of the stimulus-response model in their psychometric study of anxiety provided the impetus and rationale for this work, investigation of the situational dimensions of self-reported depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
However, there was a significant correlation within the experimental group between depth of relaxation while listening to the recording and absence of depression the day of the operation, and also between depth of relaxation and speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1972
No differences between the 2 groups were found on surgeons ratings of degree of depression on the day of the operation, or on speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1971

On the basis of the research evidence, it was concluded that: Shading variables are the best Rorschach measures of A-State; Movement appears to be the most promising Rorschach variable for measuring A-Trait; Longer reaction times and a reduction in the total number of responses seem to reflect defensive reactions of caution and guardedness that accompany high levels of A-State; Elizur's RCT depression scale appears to be more closely related to A-Trait than A-State, but may be a confounded measure of both.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The results indicated that the depression induction was successful, but that the perceived appropriateness of the depression determined the tendency to affiliate.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Of the 4 situational measures of affect utilized (hostility, depression, worry, emotionality), only hostility was significantly aroused by the experimental manipulations and, as expected, this elevation occurred only for the Irrelevant interruption group.	synthetic_anxiety	1973

Felix's procedure was used to induce different levels of state-depression (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait depression Inventory was used to measure actual degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between depression and time estimation.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

After approximately 4 months of practice, five patients improved significantly and the other four failed to show any appreciable decline in depression symptoms.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting depression may be maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused depression is mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Verbal depression and physiological arousal were monitored throughout the experiment.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
However, the measures of depression employed have often been either subjective or indirect.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Results of the second study replicated those of the first and indicated that the increase shown by disadvantaged children upon retesting in both studies was due primarily to a decrease in situational test depression rather than to being retested by a familiar E. The implications of the findings for compensatory education program planning and evaluation were discussed.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Results of analyses of variance with test depression used as a classification factor supported the hypotheses.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
