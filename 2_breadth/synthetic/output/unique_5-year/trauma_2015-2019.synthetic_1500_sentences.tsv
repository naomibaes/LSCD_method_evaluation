Consequently, we posit that decreased striatal responses to milkshake receipt reflect reduced reward-related learning rather than reward deficiency or trauma because reduced reward sensitivity would translate uniformly into reduced anticipatory and consummatory responses to reward.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
2014), confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the data were best explained by a 6-factor trauma model and a 7-factor hybrid model.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
The moderation analysis revealed that although urgency was significantly associated with smoking at average or higher levels of trauma, it was unrelated to smoking when few trauma symptoms were endorsed.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
Also consistent with the conceptualization of social trauma as separate, we found evidence that it was associated with aspects of alexithymia above and beyond any relationship with introversion.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
Postquit trauma was associated with decreased latency to relapse (hazard ratio = 1.09, 95 confidence interval [CI] [1.02, 1.17]) and with lower 8-week point-prevalence abstinence (odds ratio = .91, 95 CI [.86, .97])-relations that remained significant when other withdrawal symptoms were included as predictors.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016

Given their reported psychosis-predictive value in nonclinical samples, psychometric schizotypy measures in general might be useful for the initial screening of psychosis-proneness in the community, whereas physical trauma might be particularly useful in CHR samples. (	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
This exploratory study in two population-based adolescent samples aimed to examine how depressive symptoms and trauma specifically were related to the proportion and intensity of positive events, mean and variability of positive affect (PA), reactivity to positive events, and reactivity to PA (i.e., whether PA elicits positive events).	synthetic_anhedonia	2017

Third, and in line with the mission statement of the RDoC, we move beyond considering mood and anxiety disorders as unitary constructs or homogenous disorders and instead propose that individual differences in relative left frontal EEG activity may be uniquely associated with specific symptom clusters of depression (i.e., trauma), hypomania/mania (i.e., symptoms characterized by excessive approach motivation), and anxiety (i.e., anxious apprehension versus anxious arousal).	synthetic_anhedonia	2019

We suggest that among individuals who possess elevated levels of the capability for suicide, the heightened state of arousal experienced during periods of acute trauma may facilitate suicidal behavior in part because it would provide the necessary energy to approach a potentially lethal stimulus.	synthetic_agitation	2018
Also, different neuropsychiatric symptoms explained high burden levels: in Brazil, depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.024) and, in Spain, apathy/indifference (p < 0.001), trauma/aggression (p = 0.019) and irritability/lability (p = 0.027).	synthetic_agitation	2016

trauma-prone individuals may be more likely to accept even trauma-irrelevant implausible ideas because of their tendency to engage in less analytic and less actively open-minded thinking.	synthetic_delusion	2018
It is noted that an actual father can be killed and mourned, whereas the symbolic father is always already dead, and can neither be killed nor be mourned except in the crucial sense wherein we are all called to grieve the omnipotent fantasy/phantasy that we might not be castrated--to grieve the trauma that we might be able to speak from the locus of the phallus, which is the generative position held exclusively by the symbolic father.	synthetic_delusion	2016

Most BPD dissociative experiences appeared to be due to 5 other mechanisms: (a) BPD-specific, stress-driven, rapid shifts of self-state; (b and c) nondefensive disruptions of the framework of perceptual organization with or without an accompanying BPD-specific, dissociation-like disintegration of affective/neurocognitive functioning; (d) a defensive distancing or detachment from distress (i.e., simple trauma); and (e) Allen, Console, and Lewis's (1999) severe absorptive detachment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018

Capgras trauma is characterized by the misidentification of people and by the delusional belief that the misidentified persons have been replaced by impostors, generally perceived as persecutors.	synthetic_delusion	2017

Worry is a significant problem for individuals with paranoia, leading to trauma persistence and greater levels of distress.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Our findings link symptom-evaluation-related CSN functioning to severity of trauma and, importantly, add a new layer of evidence for the contribution of CSN functioning to the longitudinal course of delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2017

When the state identified as a problem self-state is an abuser/protector self-state, complications often involve the profound nature of transferencecountertransference enactments between patient and therapist, the trauma of separateness, chronic and acute threats of suicide, negative therapeutic reactions, and the evocation of intense negativity.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Participants, and particularly those identified as high-trauma-prone, displayed a more conservative style of responding on the novel box task, relative to the beads task.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Additionally, we hypothesized that more trauma-prone individuals would show foveal avoidance and that this avoidance would occur particularly in the visual processing of threat-related faces.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Research employing the beads task suggests that people with delusional tendencies over-adjust to disconfirmatory evidence compared to low-trauma-prone individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2018
In both studies, the memories of trauma-like experiences were less vivid, less emotionally intense than positive (but not negative) memories and emotionally neutral.	synthetic_delusion	2015

In short, most people jump to conclusions, but more trauma-prone individuals 'jump further'.	synthetic_delusion	2016
The current preliminary study aimed to minimize miscomprehension on the beads task and determine how high-trauma-prone people respond to disconfirmatory evidence on both tasks.	synthetic_delusion	2019

Christian human services workers who engage in these practices are able to stave off burnout and actually be revitalized in their work because mindfulness and Christian spirituality are tied to managing loss of personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion, and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
We thus investigated traits in a random sample of 22 stable patients with DP using the 14-item Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and predicted an overall negative correlation to their symptomatology as measured by the Cambridge trauma Scale (CDS).	synthetic_depersonalization	2019

The results showed that trauma and cynicism emerged as two correlated, but distinct, dimensions, and the results were robust across factor analytic methods and correlation analyses.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
When the role of mediator of the types of dissociative experiences was studied, it was found that absorption and trauma mediated between adverse experiences and hallucination proneness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
