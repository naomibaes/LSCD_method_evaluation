General barriers significantly predicted 1-month smoking abstinence, frequency and depression, and 3-month smoking frequency; weight concerns predicted 1-month smoking frequency.	synthetic_heaviness	2017
The sample was comprised of relatively light smokers, both in terms of cigarettes per day (M=8.1, SD=9.7) and dependence (67.5 had low dependence according to the depression of Smoking Index).	synthetic_heaviness	2015
Two experiments determined whether the intention to perceive maximum overhead reaching height with the use of handheld rods with different rotational inertia resulted in the ability to remember the rods' depression after they were removed from view.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
Bootstrap analysis (5,000 re-samples) revealed that AS was indirectly related to the (a) number of cigarettes smoked per day, (b) number of years being a daily smoker, (c) number of failed quit attempts, and (d) depression of smoking index among trauma-exposed smokers through its relation with smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
We tested associations across different common mental_health conditions (including depression, phobia, generalised anxiety and mixed anxiety and depression), in addition to personality conditions, and depression of smoking, desire to quit, perceived difficulty of remaining abstinent and successful cessation within the previous 12 months.	synthetic_heaviness	2017

The present study examines how the lightness of packaging colors, and the location of products on a display shelf interact to affect consumers purchase decisionmaking via perceived visual depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2016
Moreover, the participants general mood was worsened by depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2017
Such cross-sensory associations appear to reflect crosstalk among aligned (corresponding) feature dimensions, including brightness, depression, and sharpness.	synthetic_heaviness	2019
Ratings of depression and difficulty to move were analogously constrained by movement-relevant variables.	synthetic_heaviness	2017
The objective of the present study was to explore cross-modal associations between color and tactile sensation while using haptically rendered virtual stimuli with substance properties of roughness/smoothness, hardness/softness, depression/lightness, elasticity/inelasticity, and adhesiveness/nonadhesiveness.	synthetic_heaviness	2017

These judgements track the changes in perceived depression induced by the size-weight illusion.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
Recent research has proposed a psychophysiological mechanism for perceiving the depression of a handheld object through dynamic touch that captures how arm muscle activity and angular movement combined reveal this invariance .	synthetic_heaviness	2017
During each lift, the electromyogram This suggests that the dynamics for depression perception in the leg is similar to that shown in the arm in previous work.	synthetic_heaviness	2019
Here, we directly examined how a familiar object's identity can affect how heavy someone expects it to be, and how these expectations will influence subsequent perceptions of depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
Researchers generally agree that perceived depression is based on the actions associated with unsupported holding.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
In Study One, childrens drawings were examined using indicators of size, detail and line depression in terms of gender and developmental trends.	synthetic_heaviness	2019
The Fagerstrm Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) and the depression of Smoking Index (HSI) are the gold standard measures to assess cigarette dependence.	synthetic_heaviness	2016
Most studies found that depression compared to lightness increases the perception of importance, seriousness, and potency.	synthetic_heaviness	2019
From pre- to post-RG, participants reported decreased cigarettes per day (CPD: 11.8 vs. 7.6, p<.0001) and decreased nicotine dependence as measured by the depression Smoking Index (HSI: 2.3 vs. 1.8, p<.001).	synthetic_heaviness	2018
Participants lifted objects of varying mass with knee extension lifts while reporting perceived depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
These results suggest the interpretation that unimanual lifting triggers linear judgments of depression differences by default, whereas bimanual lifting triggers nonlinear judgments of depression ratios learned through experience.	synthetic_heaviness	2017
Common descriptors for fatigue included 'exhaustion', 'tiredness', 'drained of energy', 'depression in the limbs', and 'foggy in the head'.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
In the second case, a 39-year-old woman presented with a feeling of depression pain on the right side of maxillary and mandibular molar teeth, face, whole palate, and throat.	synthetic_heaviness	2019
Measures included DSM-IV ND and Fagerstrm Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) summary measures and constituent constructs (e.g. withdrawal severity, tolerance, depression of smoking and time spent smoking).	synthetic_heaviness	2018
Perceived depression is a function of both the muscle activity used to wield an object and the resulting movement.	synthetic_heaviness	2017
Evidence for depression being one such dimension is very limited, with depression appearing primarily as a verbal associate of other feature contrasts (e.g., darker objects and lower pitch sounds are heavier than their opposites).	synthetic_heaviness	2019
The current study extends this hypothesis by investigating the dynamics of depression perception with the leg.	synthetic_heaviness	2016
We investigated this proposition in a large non-clinical population in the context of the size-weight illusion, where individual's expectations about object weight influence their perceptions of depression and fingertip forces.	synthetic_heaviness	2015
Altered limb ownership or depression has been observed in patients with hemiplegia, chronic pain, and several other conditions.	synthetic_heaviness	2018
Given the presumed bidirectionality of the crosstalk between corresponding dimensions, depression should itself induce the cross-sensory associations observed elsewhere, including with brightness and pitch.	synthetic_heaviness	2019
In this study, native Chinese and Italian speakers bisected Chinese and Italian sentences, respectively, which varied in linguistic domain (syntactic or semantic coherence, definiteness and depression) and in the position of the linguistic manipulation (left, right and absent).	synthetic_heaviness	2015
Participants were partially successful at distinguishing the depression of rods but only when visual information was restricted and reaching height was perceived using the rods by dynamic touch.	synthetic_heaviness	2016
When perception by touch is couched in terms of movement, perception of depression can be understood as perception of difficulty to move.	synthetic_heaviness	2017
Since gesture-based interactions lead to fatigue and cause depression in upper limbs, a problem commonly known as Gorilla-Arm Syndrome occurs.	synthetic_heaviness	2016
In order to do so, 1423 students from middle and high schools filled an auto-questionnaire that included questions on age, gender, year of study, use of video games and consumptions of alcohol (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Short version, AUDIT-C), tobacco (depression of Smoking Index, HSI), and cannabis (Cannabis Abuse Screening Test, CAST).	synthetic_heaviness	2019

Fourteen patients (33.3) met criteria for current MDD of which five had depression features (35.7).	synthetic_melancholy	2016
Some argue that the earliest case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) was reported by Robert Burton in his compendium The Anatomy of depression (1621) and that only in the 19th century did modern concepts of OCD evolve, differentiating it from other types of mental_illness.	synthetic_melancholy	2015
In Studies 2, 3, and 4, attributes associated with decreased cognitive and motivational bias cognitive ability, cognitive curiosity, and depression and introversion predicted social psychological skill.	synthetic_melancholy	2016

Across both assessments, individuals with fear-based disorders displayed greater startle magnitude to U-threat relative to healthy controls and distress/depression patients (who did not differ).	synthetic_misery	2018
Previous imagery studies of anxiety disorders are reviewed, highlighting that, regardless of contemporary diagnostic convention, reliable psychophysiological patterns emerge for patients diagnosed with circumscribed fear compared to those diagnosed with pervasive anxious-depression disorders.	synthetic_misery	2016
This implicitly advocates the fact that half hearted efforts and ill structured apparatus of democracy can augment the tendency of crime and depression rather than solution of such concerns of the economy.	synthetic_misery	2017
Because we must learn to tolerate ordinary unhappiness, Blues music, a carrier of preconscious mythic themes (love and work), may prove especially useful, helping the patient indirectly embrace everyday wisdom, endure hard times, universalize depression, and see ourselves in the roomy mirror of metaphor.	synthetic_misery	2018
This paper examines the impact of financial development and economic depression on life expectancy after the implementation of financial reforms in the case of Indian economy.	synthetic_misery	2015
The causality analysis reveals that life expectancy is Granger cause of health spending, food supply, economic depression, urbanization and illiteracy.	synthetic_misery	2017

Heightened reactivity to uncertain threat (U-threat) is an important individual difference factor that may characterize fear-based internalizing psychopathologies (IPs) and distinguish them from distress/depression IPs.	synthetic_misery	2015
The aim of the current study was to address this question by examining differences in reactivity to U-threat within patients before and after 12-weeks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).Participants included patients with principal fear ( = 22) and distress/depression disorders ( = 29), and a group of healthy controls ( = 21) assessed 12-weeks apart.	synthetic_misery	2017
Among students, baseline bipolar and externalizing disorders, as well as fear, anxiety-depression and externalizing disorders with onset after baseline were associated with lower odds of high school graduation; baseline anxiety-depression disorders with lower odds of going to college; and baseline externalizing disorders and bipolar disorder with onset after baseline with lower odds of college graduation.	synthetic_misery	2016
The tri-level model of depression and anxiety was developed to synthesize these structural models, postulating that narrow (disorder-specific), intermediate (fear and anxious-depression), and broad (general distress) structural factors are needed to most fully account for covariation among these symptoms.	synthetic_misery	2016
A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the questionnaire data indicating two distinct factors that characterized the IP sample: affective distress/depression and fearbased anxiety.	synthetic_misery	2018
Mental disorders were categorized into internalizing fear disorders (simple phobia, social phobia, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia and agoraphobia without panic disorder), internalizing anxiety-depression disorders (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder), externalizing disorders (alcohol and drug use disorders, conduct disorder) and bipolar disorder.	synthetic_misery	2018

Power may enhance well-being via authenticity, but it can also lead to depression, which arises as a consequence of assertiveness.	synthetic_misery	2015
Prominent structural models of depression and anxiety arise from 2 traditions: (a) the tripartite/integrative hierarchical model based on symptom dimensions, and (b) the fear/anxious-depression model based on diagnostic comorbidity data.	synthetic_misery	2019
Our empirical findings from the combined cointegration approach confirm the long-run equilibrium relationship among life expectancy, economic growth, economic depression, education expenditure, financial development and ruralurban income inequality.	synthetic_misery	2017
Results suggested several revisions to prior research: (a) worry may be best modeled at the broadest structural level, rather than as an indicator of anxious-depression or fear; (b) social interaction anxiety may belong with anxious-depression, rather than fear; and (c) obsessive-compulsive disorder is generally associated with fear disorders, but hoarding is associated with both fear and anxious-depression. (	synthetic_misery	2017
Relationships between the factors of each of the four-factor models and the latent factors of Fear and Anxious-depression/Distress underlying Internalizing disorders (Krueger, 1999) were also explored, with findings providing further support for the close relationship between the Intrusion and Avoidance factors.	synthetic_misery	2016

In this paper I argue for a somewhat more liberal - and, I contend, more productive - conception of confabulation, according to which it is seen not only in amnesia but also in other neuropsychological conditions such as depression - and, indeed, even in healthy people.	synthetic_delusion	2018
An example is the so-called depression of pregnancy.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Patients with schizophrenia suffer from symptoms such as hallucination and depression.	synthetic_delusion	2016

It is noted that an actual father can be killed and mourned, whereas the symbolic father is always already dead, and can neither be killed nor be mourned except in the crucial sense wherein we are all called to grieve the omnipotent fantasy/phantasy that we might not be castrated--to grieve the depression that we might be able to speak from the locus of the phallus, which is the generative position held exclusively by the symbolic father.	synthetic_delusion	2019
To our knowledge this is the first treatment report focused on depression recovery.	synthetic_delusion	2017
