Subjects in the self-depression condition reported significantly less distress and anxiety than their nonintervention counterparts, but the two groups did not differ with respect to immune function.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Courts have also considered the use of depression as a basis for expert testimony about an accused's mental state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The authors conclude that depression training is widely variable within psychiatric residency programs and is dependent on the faculty and training director interests within individual programs.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Sixty-three percent of responding program directors (n = 154) report offering either required or elective coursework in depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
The program consisted of 20 biweekly sessions of progressive muscle relaxation and electromyograph biofeedback-assisted relaxation training, meditation, and depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
These findings provide disconfirming evidence for the sociocognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Patients who received either depression or CB reported less pain and pain-related anxiety than did control patients and less pain and anxiety than at their own baseline.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
In Experiment 1, more highs than lows reported a memory during depression; however, following the challenge, half the walking highs but none of the depression highs retracted their memory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
The authors indexed the subjective experience of depression through the use of a continuous behavioral measure of the strength of the participant's experience at the time of the suggestion.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
These problems limit the usefulness of depression as an interviewing procedure.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
The obtained pattern of results was, however, predicted from the dissociated control model of depression (Bowers, 1990, 1992).	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Issues related to context effects in depression research are briefly reviewed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Based on the dubious assumption that hypnotic age-regression brings forth the historical truth about past events, depression was misused as part of this construction, even while the outcome of the regression had to be distorted to provide confirmation of the particular memory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Implications for training therapists in the use of depression are suggested.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of depression/guided imagery on the postoperative course of pediatric surgical patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
For a number of reasons, it is suggested that undertaking depression as though the individual were indeed being placed into a special trance state may in some cases promote an effective outcome.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Although the induction of depression increases suggestibility to a substantial degree, the correlation between hypnotic and nonhypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
The results of both these studies tentatively support the views that beliefs about the coercive powers of depression can influence judgments about guilt and innocence in trials in which hypnotic automatism is pleaded as a defence, and, for those who are hypnotically susceptible, an experience of depression tends to make participants more sceptical about the coercive powers of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Clinical and experimental research literature indicates depression is very useful for severe and persistent pain, yet reviews suggest depression is not widely used.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Four key features of depression are identified and their developmental implications examined.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
The scientific data on the effect of depression on memory do not support Boggs's position.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

A brief discussion of context effects and demand characteristics associated with depression and memory follows.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Although the use of depression in the treatment of sexual abuse survivors is controversial, many clinicians have found it to be a valuable tool, especially for accessing and processing previously repressed/dissociated memories.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Most previous studies have failed to separate specific changes in the processing of the hallucinated stimuli from non-specific changes in arousal due to depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
These suggestions were affirmed under self-depression over two weeks.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The discordance between conceptual and operational definitions of hypnotizability can be resolved either by changing the conceptual definitions of depression and hypnotizability or by reinterpreting hypnotizability scores as indexes of nonhypnotic, imaginative suggestibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Forty-two individuals selected for high hypnotizability or for low hypnotizability were taught lists of words during depression and assessed for recognition following depression using event-related potential (ERP) procedures, both before and after the cue to reverse amnesia.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Of programs offering depression training, the mean number of hours was 8, suggesting that many psychiatrists have only limited exposure to depression during residency.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
The results with depression are interpreted as a failure of context updating without a global deficit in supervisory attention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
A 52-year-old woman with a 27-year history of panic attacks and sleep disorder inadvertently recovered incest memories in depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

depression is often disregarded and undervalued because it cannot be currently explained by natural science or scientific method.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
In two cases, a combined depression and electromyographic-biofeedback approach was used to equilibrate and retrain affected neck muscles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Twenty-six percent of responding programs (n = 44/170) report offering either required or elective coursework in depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
In a 3rd meta-analysis of the effect of adding depression to cognitive-behavioral treatments for weight reduction, additional data were obtained from authors of 2 studies, and computational inaccuracies in both previous meta-analyses were corrected.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
This study tested a depression intervention designed to reduce pain perception, enhance postsurgical recovery, and facilitate rehabilitation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
In depression the fundamental frequency was significantly lower than in the normal condition; in particular, in this altered state of consciousness two emotional imitations (angry and crying conditions) were significantly different with respect to the normal condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
One interpretation of such data is that depression induces individuals to lower the criterion they use to make memory reports.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
This study demonstrates the positive effects of depression/guided imagery for the pediatric surgical patient.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Statistical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of depression for the reduction of anticipatory nausea and vomiting.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Respondents also described creative ways in which they had modified cognitive-behavioral, depression, and other therapy techniques in order to make them more compatible with feminist principles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
These findings suggest that hypnotizability may be a mediating variable between two different, although phenotypically similar, perceptual distortions experienced during panic states and depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Controlled studies provide less dramatic but empirically sound support for the use of depression with this problem.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Results showed that, when automatism through depression was implicated as well as duress, the defendant offering the plea was judged less responsible, however, he was not judged less guilty than when duress alone was the defence.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
In the more sensitive within-subjects design, high hypnotizables recalled more P-A words during depression than waking, and lows did not differ.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
A general bias to misattribute previously reported recollections to the first of two recall occasions was observed; however, the effect was greatest among low hypnotizables who had undergone the second recall attempt in depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
At-risk participants were those with extreme scores on scales for either depression or perceptual aberration-magical ideation (per-mags).	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Clinical major depression was thus characterized less by pervasive depressive affect than by depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
An approach that combined self-report measures of depression and depression did not significantly improve the identification of children rated as depressed by parents or physicians.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
For each dichotomy, the corresponding subgroups were compared on depression scales using Student's test.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
depression and Somatic Arousal were significantly less valid measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
As a consequence, Rado and Meehl placed depression at the heart of their schizophrenia theories.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
These dimensions were rated using the Physical depression Scale (PAS), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) and the Internal Powerful others and Chance Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
A P3 asymmetry was found for control participants and patients with low scores on a physical depression scale, but not for patients with high depression scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
referred to the dimensions as Aberrant Perceptions and Beliefs, Cognitive Disorganisation and Introvertive depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
While only few endogeneity symptoms independent of psychomotor disturbance were suggested, their specific relevance varied against system definition of melancholia (appetite/weight loss and terminal insomnia being identified for DSM-III-R; depression for Newcastle; and diurnal variation in mood and energy for both systems).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
The tripartite model of depression and anxiety suggests that depression and anxiety have shared (generalized negative affect) and specific (depression and physiological hyperarousal) components.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
The results suggest that women's exposure to influenza in pregnancy is associated with an elevation of positive schizotypy scores, whereas exposure to low environmental temperatures is associated with an elevation of depression scores in their offspring.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
No correlation was found between depression and visceral perception; however, anhedonics were significantly different from normals across several measures of heart rate, self-report, and facial expressions in response to emotion-eliciting slides, with anhedonics consistently showing emotional hypo-responsiveness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Four symptoms: depression, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation had acceptable utility for the diagnosis of mixed states.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Symptom reports and physical depression were assumed to be independent, as earlier reported studies have linked symptom reporting with neuroticism and physical depression with extraversion.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
The Magical Ideation Scale (MIS), Perceptual Aberration Scale (PABS), Social depression Scale (SAS), and Physical depression Scale (PAS) were administered to 98 relatives of schizophrenic patients along with a measure of personality disorders (the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire--Revised).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997

The aim was to examine the relationship between alexithymia, depression, and capacity for displeasure in a group of 133 healthy subjects using principal components analysis.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Severe anxiety, panic attacks, a depressed mood, a diagnosis of major affective disorder, recent loss of an interpersonal relationship, recent abuse of alcohol or illicit substances coupled with feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, global or partial insomnia, depression, inability to maintain a job, and the recent onset of impulsive behavior were excellent predictors of suicidal behavior.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Activity measures correlated with clinical ratings of sadness, low self-esteem, depression, and physical complaints, and to a lesser degree with ratings of hypoactivity, fatigue, and slow speech.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Saccharin intake of CMS rats was dependent upon their dehydration state and could not be attributed to stress-induced depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These finding suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking could constitute for males, like depression, a risk factor of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
In addition, aggressive-rejected youth were predicted to report more Interpersonal Problems while submissive-rejected youths were expected to report more depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
High Introvertive depression scores predicted non-responding status in schizophrenic patients and hypo-responsivity in normal controls in support of some previous studies.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
L.A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model that groups symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 subtypes: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of somatic tension and arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety, and symptoms of depression and low Positive Affect that are specific to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Patients with a continuous course of positive symptoms showed significantly higher affective blunting and depression according to the SANS, a lower BPRS activation score and a lower age of onset in males than episodic cases.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Negative schizotypy, narrowly defined as social depression, was related only to divergent thinking, whereas a more general measure of negative schizotypy, psychoticism, was related to creative personality and perception.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
A search for more restricted forms of schizophrenia characterized by severe depression is needed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
depression was significantly correlated with morbid risk of depression in first-degree family members, neuroticism, introversion, and dysfunctional attitudes, but not with depression severity or hopelessness scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model of depression and anxiety that divides symptoms into 3 groups: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of depression and low positive affect that are specific to depression, and symptoms of somatic arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
L. A. Clark and D. Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and depression (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Contrarily to what is evidenced for major depressives and for healthy subjects, the depressive symptomatology correlates with depression in deficit schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
In an attempt to circumvent the effects of defensiveness, we measured depression (Pleasure Scale for Children, or PSC) as a proxy of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
College undergraduates (n = 34) identified by deviant scores (at least 1.96 SD above the mean) on the Revised Social depression (SocAnh) Scale (M. Eckblad, L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, & M. Mishlove, 1982) were compared with control participants (n = 139) at an initial assessment and at a 10-year follow-up evaluation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
In single-bottle tests, chronic treatment with the selective 5-HT releasers, MMAI (5 mg/kg, 2 x day) or MTA (p-methylthioamphetamine; 5 mg/kg, 2 x day), reversed the deficit in rewarded behavior (depression) measured as a decrease in the consumption of 1 sucrose solution in the chronic mild stress model of depression in rats.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Based on the defining feature(s) in each cluster, they were referred to as the Unusual Experiences, Cognitive Disorganisation, Introvertive depression, and Low Schizotypy subgroups.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
depression was rated by the Physical depression Scale of Chapman (PAS), the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale-Physical Pleasure (FCPCS-PP), and the social interest subscale (SIS) of the Nurse Observation Scale for Inpatients (NOSIE-30).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Reduced consumption of sucrose or saccharin solutions by CMS rats has been used as a putative measure of depression, typical of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Previous studies have shown that depression characterizes the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Affect recognition abilities, an important component of successful social functioning, were examined in two groups of schizotypal subjects who were identified by the Perceptual Aberration/Magical Ideation and Physical depression Scales (PABS, MIS, PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The relationship between depression and sensation seeking has been studied in 56 normal subjects of both sexes (33 males, 23 females).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
When deficit schizophrenics are dichotomized into depressed versus non-depressed patients, no difference is observed concerning depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
An alternative model, in which the depression and Nonspecific Depression factors loaded on a second-order Depression factor, while the Somatic Arousal and Nonspecific Anxiety factors loaded on a second-order Anxiety factor, produced an excellent fit in all the groups.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
depression is also one of the main symptoms of the depressive state.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
The same 3 factors (General Distress, depression vs. Positive Affect, Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
In this study, depression was measured in a cohort of chronically depressed outpatients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Measurement of depression may provide an interesting avenue for further research, but there is still no adequately validated self-report instrument for the measurement of depressive symptoms in children with cancer.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
As predicted, children with cancer reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than did healthy controls on the depression inventory, whereas no differences were found on the measure of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These results are not readily understood within the theoretical framework of the CMS model of depression and imply instead that both the neural and psychological correlates of motivation may be less susceptible to modulation by the effects of CMS than the free consumption of sweet solutions.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Subjects scoring high on Perceptual Aberration/Magical Ideation (Per-Mag subjects), depression, and low-scoring control subjects were compared for scores on Hassles and Uplifts, cognitive appraisal, coping strategies, emotions in two stressful situations, and on perceived social support.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Of the 266 variables considered for their prognostic ability, 13 were found to be significant predictors using the development data set, including (a) presence of somatic complaints, absence of depression, and presence of previous accidental injury for fluoxetine response; and (b) reported feelings of emptiness, absence of somatic complaints, and absence of early insomnia for placebo response.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Apathy, depression, mood disturbances, irritability, disinhibition, delusions, aberrant motor behavior, and abnormalities of sleep and eating are common in AD.	synthetic_agitation	1998
They mapped onto rational domains with respect to clinical experience: depression, apathy, psychotic symptoms/aggression, and misidentifications/depression.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Tools developed to measure depression are either too unreliable, or else reflect this conflict of definition and are not comparable.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Positive educational aspects were exposure to the unique problems of patients with severe BI (e.g. spasticity and depression) and a sense of independence and competence in leadership roles.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Restlessness and depression are commonly reported early sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI).	synthetic_agitation	1997
The OMD group differed from the other patients because they were significantly more likely to have been referred for organic brain syndrome or depression, had less mood disorder and lower MMSE scores, and received more recommendations for antipsychotics and for ward-environment manipulation and fewer recommendations for psychological management.	synthetic_agitation	1995
In addition, psychomotor depression was rated at several points during the film.	synthetic_agitation	1998
The correlation between caregiver reports and professional assessments was highest for depression, intermediate for psychosis, and lowest for depression.	synthetic_agitation	1996
The CMAI focuses on assessment of depression and aggression and is compatible with C-BRSD but does not assess the impact of depression on caregivers.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and depression) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression.	synthetic_agitation	1997
However, the discrepancy between the ratings was statistically significant only for Language Disorder, Higher Cognitive Deficits, Memory Disorder, Dementia, and Apraxia, and not for depression, Need for Routine, Depression, and Disorientation scales.	synthetic_agitation	1996
The vast majority of depressed patients exhibited baseline psychomotor depression.	synthetic_agitation	1995

However, paroxetine was found to be superior to fluoxetine on two subscore measures at week 1 of therapy (HAM-D depression item, p < 0.05; Psychic Anxiety item, p < 0.05), with no differences detected after week 2.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Controlling for individual differences in mood levels, multilevel regression analyses showed that events were followed by increases in negative affect (NA) and depression (Ag) and by decreases in positive affect (PA).	synthetic_agitation	1995
In these patients, disruptions of circadian rhythms can be severe enough to increase mental decline, depression during the day, and restlessness at night.	synthetic_agitation	1995
These include: global measures of outcome; behavioural measures including depression and aggression; measures of psychosocial outcome; residential status and independence.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Results indicate a 23 reduction in verbal depression with this individualized treatment strategy on the nursing units.	synthetic_agitation	1996
It is seen that special importance is attributed to thoughts of worthlessness, guilt, despair, depressive delusional symptoms, inner restlessness and depression, panic attacks and states of anxiety, sleep disorders and previous suicidal behaviour.	synthetic_agitation	1996
The following case report describes a patient developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) secondary to the use of haloperidol given to control the patient's depression.	synthetic_agitation	1997
On the contrary, pharmacotherapy with either fluoxetine or TCAs was typically associated with diminished depression, probably as part of the response pattern of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1999
The suicide attempters revealed an increase in psychomotor depression until the discovery of the suicide and a decrease thereafter, whereas the depression of the nonsuicidal patients continued to increase from the start to the end of the film.	synthetic_agitation	1995
This survey study defined the prevalence of brain-injured residents in Connecticut's SNF, and examined management strategies for depression in this patient population.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Staff members at the centers and participants' relatives rated the frequency with which participants displayed agitated behaviors, via an expanded version of the Cohen-Mansfield depression Inventory.	synthetic_agitation	1995
depression was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The rate of increased depression from baseline during acute pharmacotherapy was comparable between fluoxetine and either placebo or TCAs.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The two violent groups differed in their susceptibility to environmental influences: the surrounding ward depression fostered physical assaults in transiently but not in persistently violent patients.	synthetic_agitation	1996
As defined by Cohen-Mansfield and Billig (1986), depression is inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is not judged by an outside observer to result directly from the needs or confusion of the agitated person.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Psychomotor depression, a common clinical feature of major depression, may first emerge or intensify during pharmacotherapy.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Both azelastine (30 mg/kg) and oxatomide (100 mg/kg) caused generalized seizure discharges accompanied by depression with the former and sedation with the latter.	synthetic_agitation	1999
The definition of psychomotor depression has varied in ambiguous and contradictory ways, both over time and in contemporary writings.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Aggressiveness, irritability and depression disappeared.	synthetic_agitation	1995
In Experiment 3, dejection activated additive counterfactuals, whereas depression activated subtractive counterfactuals.	synthetic_agitation	1996
All studies found that goal attainment yielded greater cheerfulness-dejection responses when promotion focus was stronger and greater quiescence-depression responses when prevention focus was stronger.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Use of this scale in a multicenter longitudinal study of patients with mild to moderate AD revealed that depression was the most common and persistent symptom, depressed mood with vegetative signs was the least common and least persistent, and paranoid delusions and hallucinations showed moderate persistence over time.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Behavioural disturbances such as anxiety, irritability, and depression are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and make a substantial contribution to the disability of the disease.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Noncognitive symptoms, such as depression, depressed mood, and psychosis, are episodic, do not necessarily worsen over time, and tend not to be highly correlated with one another.	synthetic_agitation	1996
To study whether haloperidol could be withheld from elderly, nursing home residents on two non-consecutive days per week (drug holiday) without increasing depression.	synthetic_agitation	1996

The efficacy of antidepressants in agitated patients was unrelated to the severity of depression and did not appear to be inferior to the efficacy in nonagitated patients.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Moreover he exhibited severe cognitive and behavioural troubles, which had been stable for many months beforehand, e.g. complete disorientation for time and place, major memory disorders, depression, anxiety, depression, irritability, disinhibition, aggressiveness and lack of initiative.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Framing with a positive outcome focus changed dejection-related emotions (e.g., dissatisfaction) more than depression-related emotions (e.g., nervousness), whereas the reverse was true for framing with a negative outcome focus.	synthetic_agitation	1995
A depression Needs Index (MINI) based on social isolation, poverty, unemployment, permanent sickness and temporary and insecure housing predicted differences in admission prevalence between wards at catchment area level better than Jarman's Underprivileged Area (UPA) score [1] and between districts at regional level better than the UPA score and comparably to the York Psychiatric Index [2] (adjusted r2 at regional level (MINI 0.82, UPA 0.53, York index 0.70).	synthetic_mental_illness	1997

depression makes up much of a general practitioners workload, with 23 of the population of the UK consulting each year for such problems.	synthetic_mental_illness	1995
The guiding question has been whether a patient's health or the safety of the community have demanded involuntary provision of treatment However, he argues that although such an approach is enshrined in Victorian mental_health legislation, United Nations Principles for the Protection of Persons with depression and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care and the approach propounded by the therapeutic jurisprudence movement, each of these adds little to the other in terms of assisting decisionmakers in individual cases.	synthetic_mental_illness	1998

Thanks to the analysis of delusional perception's formal binary structure, generations of psychiatrists believed that the problem of depression, at least from a descriptive point of view, had been resolved.	synthetic_delusion	1999
Project psychiatrists blind to the consensus diagnoses coded each depression and hallucination in the sample for both FRS and DSM-III-R bizarreness.	synthetic_delusion	1998
The comparison of the contents of depression revealed significantly higher frequencies of delusions of grandeur, guilt and religious delusions in Austrian patients.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Mental symptoms are proposed as indexed to the particular anomaly of one of those three components: disruption to the lack of simultaneity, hallucination to the lack of continuity, depression and misinterpretation to the lack of successivity.	synthetic_delusion	1995
These findings, which also indicate that each of the dual neural pathways carries different, nonredundant information, could be instrumental in showing that the pathways play different roles in the manifestations of the clinically significant face processing deficits, prosopagnosia and Capgras depression.	synthetic_delusion	1995
A learning factor is present in several of the psychological theories advanced to explain depression, and the factor is akin to if not identical with Freud's concept of projection.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The significance of formal discontinuity evident in delusional perception authorized the psychiatrist to pause on the threshold of depression without making allowances for the disastrous lack of comprehension so typical of delusional perception, which in turn must be studied from an interpersonal perspective, not as if it were an aseptic object in a laboratory.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Phenomena like thought echo, influence depression, thought guess belong to M.A. Actually this syndrome is largely unknown in Anglo-Saxon countries.	synthetic_delusion	1995

While the myth has the creative potential of flexible and open symbolisations the depression is marked by its symbolic poverty and rigid structure.	synthetic_delusion	1995
In this report we describe a persistent depression of pregnancy in a 43-year-old man with chronic schizophrenia in the background of poor sexual adjustment.	synthetic_delusion	1998
For seven schizophrenic patients (7.45), diagnosis of that disorder depended on the presence of a DSM-III-R bizarre depression to meet criteria.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Cultural factors seem to have a decisive influence on shaping the contents of depression.	synthetic_delusion	1999
This case report is of a male schizophrenic patient who developed a depression of pregnancy on two successive occasions each time when his wife became pregnant.	synthetic_delusion	1995
Subsequently, there was personality change, memory-impairment and the persisting 'depression' that he had been involved in an earlier car-accident.	synthetic_delusion	1997
However, the form which the depression takes may be influenced by other factors including motivation.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The pathogenesis of depression for place and persons if discussed in light of these observations.	synthetic_delusion	1999
The results do not indicate a specific focal site of hypoperfusion in the patients with depression.	synthetic_delusion	1997
There was evidence that the majority of persecutory delusions do not fit either strong or weak formulations of the depression-as-defence explanation and that there may be subgroups with differing aetiologies.	synthetic_delusion	1997
A multi-factorial model of depression formation and maintenance incorporating a data-gathering bias and attributional style, together with other factors (e.g. perceptual processing, meta-representation) is consistent with the current evidence.	synthetic_delusion	1998
From the clinical and evolutionary perspective, it is unclear why a depression should merit, simply because of its nihilistic content, a special brain location or presage chronicity.	synthetic_delusion	1997
The patient was manic and exhibited the depression twice, once with regard to a man and the other concerning a dog.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Implications are discussed for investigations of depression through the use of hypnosis in the laboratory and for understanding depression in the clinical setting.	synthetic_delusion	1998
The article explores how delusional processes are activated psychologically and how clinicians need to look beyond the seemingly non-reality aspect and instead listen to the depression in the context of the patient's life experience.	synthetic_delusion	1999
This appears to be the result of a depression rather than the consequence of his amnesia.	synthetic_delusion	1999
At the present moment, and impervious to the fact that the French term dlire means far more than depression, some authors use Cotard's syndrome to refer to the belief of being dead and suggest that such a depression might have a specific brain location.	synthetic_delusion	1996
In both countries persecution was the most frequently mentioned content of depression.	synthetic_delusion	1997
One explanation for depression formation is that they result from distorted appreciation of complex stimuli.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Transcultural influences were found in the detailed contents of the 'negative' delusions; specific and direct themes of persecutory depression, i.e., delusions of poisoning, and religious themes of guilt/sin were conspicuous in Europe, while amorphous delusions of reference such as 'being slandered' were predominant in Japan.	synthetic_delusion	1997
She developed a depression of maternity, persistent for many years.	synthetic_delusion	1998

Igra L. Myth or depression?	synthetic_delusion	1998
Social isolation seems to be more a premorbid feature than a secondary phenomenon related to the depression.	synthetic_delusion	1999
A non-randomized matched groups design was employed enabling the performance of the depression prone individuals to be compared to that of a control group.	synthetic_delusion	1999

However it appeared that only a few contents of depression are frequent in both countries.	synthetic_delusion	1995
18 AD patients with depression and 15 AD patients without depression underwent neuropsychological testing and regional cerebral blood flow imaging using Tc99m-HMPAO SPET.	synthetic_delusion	1996
It is thought that these aberrations may play some role in depression formation in schizophrenia and paranoia.	synthetic_delusion	1998
The probable dynamics that lead to this depression are then discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1996
We are concerned to stress that the patient's 'depression' is a belief held on reasonable grounds.	synthetic_delusion	1998
The most frequent depression type was paranoid (71), followed by hypochondriacal (67), the Capgras syndrome (29), house misidentification (29), and grandiose delusions (29).	synthetic_delusion	1995
Male teachers rated higher on Emotional Exhaustion and depression than the women.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
A post hoc analysis reveals a significant path between emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment, and an insignificant path between depression and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Finally, contrary to hypothesis 4, it turned out that high identified group members evaluated self and ingroup more independently than lows which contradicts the idea of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Two-thirds of those interviewed were identified as having a dissociative disorder: 10 (32.26) had Dissociative Identity Disorder, another 10 (32.26) had Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and one (3.23) had depression Disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
The clinical group scored higher on the QED factor depression and had more passive forms of coping behavior (resignation, social isolation, self-compassion, self-blame) than the normal adults.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
depression; 2.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
In terms of moderator effects, the results indicated that high NA experienced greater depression from co-worker support than low NA.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Univariate tests found that Burden and depression accounted for this effect.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
As hypothesized, leaders' communal orientation was negatively related to the burnout subscales of depression and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996

At least 80 of individuals who reported derealization also reported reduced awareness and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Factors associated with the presence of high levels of psychological morbidity and with abnormal levels of emotional exhaustion, depression, and concerns about personal accomplishment were identified.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
In contrast, but also according to the authors' predictions, depression and personal accomplishment were not associated with job demands.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Emotional exhaustion was, as predicted, an important correlate of depression, whereas reduced personal accomplishment was negatively associated with self-esteem and with quality of work content, a resource.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
A test-retest reliability coefficient of .850 was obtained for the depression subscale; .907 and .715 were obtained for the Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment subscales, respectively.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Having fun with a team friend was positively related to personal accomplishment, and having work discussions with a team friend was inversely related to depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Positive (PA) and negative (NA) affectivity differentially affected these variables: NA predicted low social support and job satisfaction, and high emotional exhaustion and depression; PA showed the reverse pattern.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996

Adolescents whose experiences of depression are intense do not differ from their counterparts in the study with regard to self-esteem; however, their sense of self-awareness is heightened.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Abnormal experiences of the self defined here in terms of depression may predispose individuals to aggressive behavior in situations that further alter their self-awareness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Applying the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory as a framework, this study among Dutch nurses (n=156) first tested whether work-related demands, resources and self-esteem were differentially associated with the three burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depression), respectively.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Similarly, age and years in ministry had a direct, inverse relationship with the emotional exhaustion and depression dimensions of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995

Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that for the burnout components, Emotional Exhaustion and depression, relatively large and significant amounts of variance could be accounted for by a set of predictor variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and Jackson 1986), which yields scores on three sub-scales; emotional exhaustion, depression and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Finally, younger teachers experienced more emotional exhaustion than older ones and primary education teachers experienced more personal accomplishment and less depression than their counterparts in secondary education.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Thus, it is quite likely that according to culture and personal codes and to the conceptual brief of the interviewer, similar experiences might be reported as depression, bodily sensations, dysphoria, changes in perception of reality or time, dissolution of ego boundaries, etc.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Specific hypotheses were made regarding relationships between antecedent conditions and MBI subscales, including emotional exhaustion, depression, and lack of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999

Following a review of the pertinent literature, five cases of dissociative depression are described.	synthetic_fugue	1997
Those reviewed in the present paper include: spontaneous confabulation in brain disease, false recognition cases, delusional memories and other delusions in psychosis, confabulations in schizophrenia, internalised false confessions for crime, apparently false or distorted memories for child abuse, pseudologia fantastica, the acquisition of new identities or scripts following depression or in multiple personality, and momentary confabulation in healthy subjects.	synthetic_fugue	1999
An unexpected finding was that, in some cases, associated criminal activity may allow the person with dissociative depression to continue to function in spite of their loss of memory and original identity.	synthetic_fugue	1997
Each surface identity constructs an individual's emotions and social relations--and what he or she accepts as Me and rejects as not-Me--into a distinct pattern, with identity per se appearing as a dialogic or depression-like structure of opposed voices.	synthetic_fugue	1996
During the task of depression theme recognition, a highly significant asymmetry in favour of the right MCA was observed with both versions.	synthetic_fugue	1996
Changes in hemispheric activity induced by listening to music (J. S. Bach fugues) and by recognizing the repetitions of the depression theme were examined, using the technique of bilateral transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) of the left and right middle cerebral artery (MCA).	synthetic_fugue	1995
Dissociative depression (formerly psychogenic depression) is a rare and little understood dissociative disorder.	synthetic_fugue	1998

This paper outlines a brain model of mental imaging abilities by reviewing neuropsychological evidence of the association and dissociation between mental imaging processes and known perceptual mechanisms; differentiating between visual-mode and auditory-mode thought systems; pointing to brain arousal systems involved in waking and dream imaging; and exploring pre-frontal involvement in deliberate imaging and depression monitoring.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
The technique allows opinions regarding depression to be statistically based.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Three hundred and eight subjects reported their trait levels of introversion-extraversion and need for cognition, and were subsequently induced into an affective state (content, happy, surprise, or neutral) and a depression (heuristic or substantive information processing).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
However, it is well known that cognitive ERP components show a high variability due to changes of depression during an experimental session.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1999
Stepwise regression analyses controlling for player characteristics revealed that attentional control and goal-setting strategies contributed to lower depression anxiety, attention control and imagery/ relaxation strategies resulted in lower somatic state anxiety, and attention control and positive self-talk contributed to increased state self-confidence.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
The results indicate that concerns with the team's ability to win a match were associated with high depression anxiety and that doubts regarding the team's ability to perform well were related to low positive affect.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
The framework holds that respondent reports are based on three factors: what the respondent actually knows (the person's depression); whether the respondent believes that the potential answer meets the requirements of the question (an adequacy judgement); and whether the respondent chooses to provide this answer (the person's communicative intent).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Multiple regression analyses predicting multidimensional state anxiety revealed that somatic and depression anxiety were only predicted by performance expectations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
That is, GSO appear to be closely correlated with neural generation of our most paradigmatic depression: consciousness.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996
Nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, and increased sweating were reported at higher rates by citalopram-treated patients than by placebo-treated patients, but there were no significant citalopram-placebo differences in the incidence of activation (e.g., anxiety, depression, insomnia) or sexual dysfunction.	synthetic_nervousness	1995
At these choice points, questions were asked about perceptions of sexual interest and depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1995

The result of the experiment suggests one possibility that excessive concentration upon the body concerning psychosomatic symptoms may have changed to the concentration upon the sense of heaviness, or that the reduction of the stress thereof may have brought the change to less depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1995
Hellpach states that during the process of civilisation hysteria is more and more replaced by depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1999
In subjective ratings of training evaluation most of the course members and their parents described fewer problems with attention, less test-anxiety and less aggression and depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1995

The 6-8 codetype is typically associated with unusual thought processes, feelings of hostility and suspiciousness as well as apathy, which may mask symptoms of depression, anxiety and depression.	synthetic_nervousness	1995
Also, those who were aware of psychosomatic symptoms felt their change to less depression more significantly, and their understanding of the formal language was significantly higher than those who were not aware of psychosomatic symptoms.	synthetic_nervousness	1999
Also, hopelessness scores were significantly correlated with scores on personality traits of schizothymia, depression, and self-uncertainty.	synthetic_nervousness	1995

Card sorting preseverative errors correlated negatively with depression, non-preservative errors correlated positively with avolition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
All subjects also reported a withdrawal syndrome including irritability, psychomotor retardation, depression, dry mouth, sleep disturbances, craving, and increased lacrimation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
These behavioral data suggest that the activation of an endogenous opiate mechanism facilitates the occurrence of enhanced immobility and depression in response to a subsequent stress experience.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The study provides support for the view that in chronic depression depression may have trait-like properties, and that the propensity toward anhedonic responses may occur irrespective of depressive severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
depression is not a negative symptom.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Analysis revealed that depression in medical patients was best distinguished by symptoms of depression, low positive affect, and physiological hyperarousal, whereas syndromal depression in psychiatric inpatients was specifically characterized by negative cognition symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995

The results showed that: organizational stressors were more prevalent than task-related stressors; compared to other service jobs, police officers report a particular profile on the three scales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)?a relatively low level of emotional exhaustion,an average level of depression, and a high level of personal accomplishment; burnout is associated with a lack of reciprocity between investments and outcomes in the relations that officers have with citizens, colleagues and their organization; and burnout is positively related to attitudes towards use of violence and the use of violence during the officers' duty.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, depression, a sense of relieving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Subjects with dissociative identity disorder were more frequently diagnosed as having somatization disorder, past or concurrent major depressive episode, borderline personality disorder, depression disorder, and dissociative amnesia than other groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Harper and Roth in 1962 hypothesized that the temporal lobes might represent one such substrate for phobic-anxious patients with depression-derealization (DD); the association between the presumed temporal lobe feature and phobic anxiety was so compelling that Roth (in 1959) described the condition as phobic-anxiety-depression syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997

Two dimensions of student teacher behaviour have been extracted: the active-passive-dimension, describing the degree of intensity of a student teacher's actions when transferring (verbal) messages to the pupils; and the depression-harmony-dimension, defining the degree of tension the student teacher arouses in the relationship between teacher and pupils.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Steady-state plasma levels of clonazepam were significantly correlated with daily doses (rs = 0.795, P < 0.005) and therapeutic concentrations ranged between 6.5-83.9 micrograms/l. At the onset of therapy, the clinically titrated loading dose resulted in plasma concentrations within the narrow range of 18.9-34.0 micrograms/l. These results support the potential value of clonazepam in the short-term management of acute mania; the initial control of depression was achieved with plasma drug levels in a remarkably narrow range as compared with the further control of mania.	synthetic_agitation	1997
