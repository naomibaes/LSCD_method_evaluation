As indicated by a three-way interaction involving exercise, depression, and stress, exercise was most beneficial among high-anxious subjects who were not exposed to unemployment stress.	synthetic_anxiety	1993
No relationship was demonstrated among scores on three dental depression questionnaires and blood-pressure values.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
This includes depression/depression, loss of interest in environment and social interactions, sexual problems, and sleep disturbances.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
Our data suggest that state depression prior to the exercise, perceived social support from family and friends, and active training stand out as predictors of psychological outcome, even after trait and preexercise psychological variables are considered.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
In our subject the absence of depression and the presence of hyperthymic characteristics suggests that the different individual trends observed in various studies which have used methods similar to ours, could, at least partly, depend on interference on these variables.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
Depression also revealed distinctive features not found in depression (e.g., goals that are perceived as being less visible to important others).	synthetic_anxiety	1993
This study examined whether relationships between anger expression, hostility, social evaluative depression, and a presumed mechanism for coronary heart disease development, cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to stress, are moderated by stress situation and gender and whether such relationships are attenuated by inadequate assessments.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
Both high and low hypnotizable subjects exhibited significant reductions of reported pain during conditions of neutral depression, relaxation, dissociated imagery, and focused analgesia.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Findings suggest that imagery-depression may be prophylactic, benefitting patients by reducing the probability of postoperative complications and thereby keeping hospital stay within the expected range.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
One approach to consciousness is by way of dissociation, the phenomena of which can be found in everyday experience but can be studied in more detail through depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Separate analyses of variance, computed for the first and second sets of techniques, indicated that progressive relaxation and depression both increased skin temperature and reduced pulse rate, suggesting reduced psychophysiological responsivity.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Although a long tradition exists suggesting that depression can enhance memory (hypnotic hypermnesia), the experimental literature is quite mixed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In one experiment, subjects were also studied who were not susceptible to depression, and who, therefore, did not feel uncertain in the first place.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The problem of denying defendants their constitutional rights was the reason we have argued that defendants' hypnotically refreshed testimony should generally be permitted, whereas the unreliability of hypnotically elicited memories and the manner in which depression diminishes the effectiveness of cross-examination make the general exclusion of testimony from hypnotized witnesses essential (M. T. Orne, 1982).	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
For James, depression was both an experimental technique for creating divisions of consciousness, and a laboratory model of naturally occurring disorders of awareness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Frequency of positive and negative experiences accompanying stage depression was assessed in follow-up interviews with 22 participants of university-sponsored performances.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
This paper shows that the incorporation of Ericksonian ways of working into an encompassing ecosystemic (non-Newtonian) epistemology might be profitable in circumventing the limitations of Newtonian science in the field of depression and hypnotherapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
College students with no prior experience of depression were assessed for fantasy proneness and dissociation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
For half of the subjects depression was made salient as a cause for the feelings; for the other half the feelings remained unexplained.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
When attributed to the depression, however, the feelings had no effect on ratings of comprehension.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
It is proposed that depression is a state of enhanced attention that activates an interplay between cortical and subcortical brain dynamics during hypnotic phenomena, such as both attentional and disattentional processes, among others, are important in the experiencing of depression and hypnotic phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Modalities included are relaxation and imagery techniques, biofeedback-assisted strategies, the use of humor, and affiliation to influence emotional states, depression, and conditioning paradigms.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
depression as a means of controlling the psychosocial concomitants of treatment and the negative psychological effects of cancer is also discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The present study attempted to assess the effectiveness of commonly used deepening techniques and of surreptitiously provided stimulation on hypnotizability scores, in-depression depth reports, retrospective realness ratings, and the Field Inventory of Hypnotic Depth (Field, 1965).	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Psychotherapeutic treatment of persons with multiple personality disorder frequently includes judicious use of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The future of depression scales is discussed with respect to multidimensional assessment and alternatives to the work sample approach.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The present study was designed to investigate in a clinical situation whether differences in measured hypnotizability validly reflect differences in hypnotic processes and to what extent factors deemed extraneous to depression--such as resistance--influence hypnotic responding.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The authors define the concepts of attention, concentration and depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
He concludes that because depression exploits the intimate connection between mind and body, it provides relief through improved self-regulation and also beneficially affects cognition and the experience of self-mastery.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Implications for implementing judicial standards regarding depression are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The aspects of the history emphasized here are the founding of continuing institutes and research centers, some theoretical cleavages that have persisted to this day, and the establishment of depression societies with their journals, annual meetings, and workshops, including an International Society of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
depression again failed to enhance retrieval of new correct items, although it increased the production of new incorrect recall among hypnotizable individuals.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The value of a brief, preoperative depression experience was explored with a sample of 36 head and neck cancer surgery patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992

An example of a procedure is given in which depression is nonetheless usefully applied for its placebo value as a method to generate positive expectancies.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
One aspect of depression research has led to the concept of a hidden observer, a metaphor used to indicate that some information is processed and has consequences without being in the focus of consciousness at the time, but is recoverable through depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Findings from studies of electrocortical activity, event-related potentials, and regional cerebral blood flow during waking and depression are presented to suggest that these attentional differences are reflected in underlying neurophysiological differences in the far fronto-limbic attentional system.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991

The three major issues discussed in detail concern the position adopted about forensic depression, the consequences of involving oneself in forensic depression, and the nature of one's involvement in the legal system.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The divisions of consciousness lead to consideration of its executive and monitoring functions-normal functions, but subject to some alterations through depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The results indicated that British undergraduates were more likely to find a male defendant guilty when told that the testimony against him had been elicited under depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Patients were randomized to either depression or standard treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Two case studies are presented to demonstrate some applications of depression with sexually traumatized patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
An analogue study involving two experiments was conducted to test the initial carryover effects of depression, meditation, and relaxation upon self-reports of awareness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In part because of these early origins and in part because of the nature of hypnotic phenomena, the depression scales are unique psychometric instruments.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Implications for use of depression combined with PI in tertiary school counselling centres are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
It may be hypothesized that patients with a tendency for external attribution and high hypnotizability are specifically at risk for this kind of abuse when depression is used in the context of a therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The ways in which Breukink used depression for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes are summarized and discussed in light of both old and current views.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990

Respondents were selected from the 1980 membership directory of the Society for Clinical and Experimental depression (SCEH).	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The results were distinguished from previous research on depression where the same relative state of hemispheric imbalance was achieved with the same tasks, but largely through inhibitory influences on the left hemisphere.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
This proclivity towards secrecy, which stands in contradiction to the psychoanalytic principle of total frankness and demystification, is illustrated by a number of examples-the suggestion made by Jones to Ferenczi and Freud in 1911 for the formation of a secret committee to supervise the development of psychoanalysis; the censorship practised by Jones in connection with the use of the Freud Archives; and the case history of Emmy von N., where Freud assumes the role of depositary for the memories communicated by his patient under depression and observes strict secrecy about them.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
This article discusses the early developments of depression.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The present paper examines the value of depression in applied sport psychology.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991

Manifestations and derivatives of early negativity include depression, attachment to physical pain, fear of success, masochism, deprivation of self and others, and negative voyeurism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Introvertive depression was associated with face > word superiority.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The relation between depression and affective flattening was studied in 61 normal subjects and 61 major depressives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Higher scores on the physical depression scale, but not the social depression scale, were related to attenuated reports of positive affect following viewing of affect-eliciting films in schizophrenia-schizoaffective disorder patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
On the general sample of depressed subjects, the more the subjects stand on the emotional deficit side, behavioural (affective observed monotony, lack of affective expressiveness and responsiveness) and subjective (depression, affective global indifference for pleasant and unpleasant events), the lower is sensation seeking.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would report significantly greater depression than the bipolar patients and that higher scores on the depression scales would be related to attenuated reports of the experience of positive affect and poorer social skill.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The association between scales measuring physical and social depression, self-reports of affective response to emotion-eliciting films, and role play measures of social skill was evaluated in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar affective disorder.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Emotion-provoking visual stimuli were presented to college undergraduates identified as anhedonic or normal, based on their scores on the Physical depression Scale (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Earlier studies have demonstrated a significant relation between scores on the Physical depression Scale--but not on the Perceptual Aberration Scale--and premorbid social adjustment in schizophrenics (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976, 1978; Schuck, Leventhal, Rothstein, & Irizarry, 1984).	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Physical depression, evaluated by the score on the physical depression scale (PAS) of Chapman et al. [	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
We evaluated the construct validity of the revised Social depression Scale (SAS; Mishlove & Chapman, 1985) through an examination of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles produced by extreme scorers on the SAS.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Present findings suggest a possible influence of the profound depression of severe depression on subcortical processes.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The depression experienced by the patients was 'atypical', with relatively little depression and evidence of a negative view of self, and prominent symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Psychosis-prone subjects who scored high on the Perceptual Aberration-Magical Ideation scale (n = 173) or on the revised Physical depression scale (n = 88) did not differ significantly from control subjects (n = 929) in self-categorized, handedness patterns.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Reviewing the recent literature on the overlapping spectrum of neurotic depressive and dysthymic conditions--unofficially referred to as minor, atypical or characterologic depressives--the authors conclude that significant symptomatologic admixtures with anxiety disorders do not represent the prototypical features of these disorders as defined in DSM-III-R. It is long-standing depression on an intermittent or chronic basis which appears to characterize the trait illness of dysthymia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Ss who initially scored high on the Magical Ideation Scale and above the mean on the Social depression Scale were especially deviant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
In addition, there was marked lessening of dysthymia and intense depression manifested by severe isolation, listlessness, and apathy.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The implications of these data to the stressor depression topography and the potential role of mesocorticolimbic DA in depression and depression are discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Cluster 3 was thought to reflect anhedonic aspects of schizotypy, particularly physical depression, and, therefore, may relate to negative schizophrenic symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
We administered scales of Perceptual Aberration (PERAB) and Physical depression (PHYSAN), traits that may be related to risk for schizophrenia, to 54 schizophrenics, 146 of their first-degree relatives (evaluated for schizophrenia-related disorders), and 178 normal subjects (screened for psychotic disorders in them or their relatives).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Patterns of familial correlations also suggested that physical depression, but not perceptual aberration, may be familial among schizophrenics and their relatives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Implications for the measurement and concept of social depression are presented.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The present review suggests that stressor-induced reductions in the rewarding value of electrical brain stimulation (ICSS) from the mesocorticolimbic system may simulate the depression of human depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
It is possible that depression may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in biological research and in clinical practice.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Research on the symptomatology of endogenous depression did not include the concept; depression was also lacking from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the depression rating scales, Attention was drawn to depression by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
In the last century psychopathologists attached importance to the concept of depression, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
This paper reviews the validity of chronic mild stress-induced depression as an animal model of depression, and the evidence that changes in hedonic responsiveness in this model are mediated by changes in the sensitivity of dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Concerning physical stimulations (FCPCS-PP and HDCS-PD) in the depressed group, depression and affective flattening are not linked, suggesting that physical depression is not secondary to low emotional reactivity (affective flattening) and constitutes an independent dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The results suggest that depression is not a phenotypic vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
This was particularly true for symptoms of depression and behavioral disturbance.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Here the same approach was extended to the broader concept of psychosis proneness with a new inventory with four subscales: Introvertive depression, Impulsive Nonconformity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
We examined the association between scales measuring physical depression, social depression, and perceptual aberration and premorbid functioning, clinical state, and current level of adjustment in 91 psychotic subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Both BPD and SPD/BPD patients were discriminated from SPD patients by significantly higher levels of impulsivity and aggression but not by the differential presence of psychoticlike symptoms or depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Men high on depression reported using more Suppression, Replacement and Mapping, and less Seeking Succorance and Substitution.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
One hundred eighteen psychiatric patients, each experiencing his or her first lifetime episode of psychosis, 125 of their first-degree relatives, and 155 normal subjects were assessed using the physical depression, social depression, and perceptual aberration scales of Chapman et al. (	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
For the SZ group, these findings may be related to depression or to poor social functioning, which are often features of the illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Physical depression of depressed patients seems related to the severity of the depression and does not appear to identify a qualitatively distinct subgroup.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Affective flattening and depression were defined by the following self-rating scales: Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPCS), Hardy Displeasure Capacity Scale (HDCS), FCPCS-PP (subscale of physical pleasure), and HDCS-PD (subscale of physical displeasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical depression and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Women high on depression used significantly more Mapping, but less Suppression and Substitution coping styles.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
This study examined the childhood perceptions of their parents of college students scoring deviantly on scales of psychosis proneness measuring physical depression and perceptual aberrations.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
These findings suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking may be indicative of physical depression and may also play a role in proneness to schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
His depressive symptoms included lowered mood, loss of energy, depression, suicidal preoccupations, disturbed sleep, poor appetite and impaired concentration.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Factor 2 related most highly to numbers of perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and moderately to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Subjects were identified as psychosis-prone by their high scores on the Perceptual Aberration or the Physical depression scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The second cluster was distinguished by elevated scores on the Magical Ideation Scale, the third cluster by very high scores on the Social depression Scale and the STA, and the fourth cluster by very high Physical depression Scale scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
In both my patients, the sexual behaviors served the self-regulatory function of alleviating inner feelings of depression and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
For patients with schizophrenia, depression was significantly related to premorbid functioning.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Our study investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of five of Chapman's Schizotypia Scales (i.e., Physical depression, Revised Social depression, Perceptual Aberration, Magical Ideation, and Impulsive Nonconformity; L.J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin 1976, 1978; Eckblad & L.J. Chapman, 1983) and Meehl's Schizoidia Scale (Meehl, 1964) within a sample of 50 personality disordered subjects, many of whom possessed schizotypic traits.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
In the present century attention to depression has faded, possibly because of the focus upon depressed mood as the pathognomonic feature of depressive disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Implications of temporal patterns of depression for caregivers of severely cognitively impaired and agitated nursing home residents are discussed.	synthetic_agitation	1992
These results support previous findings that cognition and depression co-vary with most of the co-variance due to the effect of attention on each.	synthetic_agitation	1991
We report the case of a brain-injured patient who was prescribed chlorpromazine for depression and who developed a delusional state while taking this antipsychotic agent.	synthetic_agitation	1992

This article summarizes the current thinking on five areas of prime importance to patients, care providers, and health care professionals: depression, assault/aggression, screaming, wandering, and depression/apathy/withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Syndromes of depression (aggressive, physically nonaggressive, verbal) were compared to dimensions of the social network (intimacy, size/density) in 408 nursing home residents.	synthetic_agitation	1991
While previous studies have supported the reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the ABS, the current study was designed to investigate its underlying factor structure, as well as to determine systematic effects of time-of-day on the occurrence of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Subjects were 212 patients with traumatic or other recently acquired brain injury who exhibited depression during their treatment on a specialized brain-injury unit of an acute rehabilitation hospital.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Future research may especially benefit by considering the long-term effects of early depression following traumatic brain injury as well as the problem of aspontaneity and impairment of self-awareness.	synthetic_agitation	1992
On principal components analysis, a three-factor, oblique-rotated solution resulted, with a negative symptom factor, a positive symptom factor, and an unstable behavioral depression factor.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Data from the current sample suggest that clinicians and parasuicidal patients independently perceived most of these dimensions similarly, with the exception of depression/emotional upsetness (perturbation).	synthetic_agitation	1992
Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that depression is best represented by one general construct with three underlying factors: Aggression, Disinhibition, and Lability.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Our data showed that the three syndromes of depression--aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors, and verbally agitated behaviors--are differentially related to medical and psychosocial variables.	synthetic_agitation	1994
However, it has been observed that there appears to be some temporal disassociation in the recovery of cognition and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1990
In addition to 'retardation' and 'depression' dimensions (whose derived factor scores suggested independence of those two dimensions), a third 'non-interactive' dimension was evident--with derived factor scores correlating significantly with both the retardation and depression dimensions.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Dependency (87), denial of illness (63), and motor depression (55) were common, while sexual disinhibition (2.9) and self-destructive behaviors (2.9) were rare.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Physical and verbal aggression, depression, and depression were rated as the most difficult to manage.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Activation was assessed by means of self-ratings (Thayer, AD-ACL) and global judgement (Hamilton, retardation, depression).	synthetic_agitation	1992
Of the original 207 children, 99 were located and reevaluated using ratings on the Psychiatric Evaluation Form, the Impact of Event Scale, and the SCL-90 and lifetime and current diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. Ratings of psychiatric symptoms at the two points in time showed significant decreases in overall severity ratings and in anxiety, belligerence, somatic concerns, and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1994
A 28yearold headinjured female displayed a great deal of impatience and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1992
The Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS; Corrigan, 1989) is a 14-item scale developed to monitor depression during the acute phase of recovery from acquired brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	1991
We present a case study in which severe depression was reduced and independent functioning increased in a traumatically brain-injured individual.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Discrepancies between one's actual self and ideal-other self (a self-guide consisting of attributes someone would ideally like the individual to possess) cause dejection, whereas discrepancies with the ought-other self (beliefs about attributes someone thinks one ought to ham) cause depression.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Following a period of depression, pigtail infants showed a depressive phase characterized by slouched, withdrawn postures and reduced motor activity.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Areas most consistently showing improvement included focused and sustained attention and concentration, orientation, alertness, arousal, processing, time, and psychomotor speed, mobility, vocalization, depression, anxiety and participation in therapy.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Symptoms comprising an depression syndrome (restlessness, anxiety, and poor concentration) were most frequently reported.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Another EEG pattern, with signs of decreased alertness, was present in patients with insomnia, depression and in those without depression in their families.	synthetic_agitation	1991
The worst response was to lithium prescribed on the basis of manic-like symptoms (e.g., psychomotor depression) or cyclical behavior disturbance.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Children with the acute form of PTSD presented with a relative increase in spontaneously acting as though the trauma were recurring upon real or symbolic exposure, difficulty falling asleep, hypervigilance, nightmares, exaggerated startle response, and generalized anxiety/depression.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Concerning depression and general psychopathology, mixed manics had more severe depression, hostility and cognitive impairment than did agitated depressed patients.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Violence and depression are two different behaviors however not always differentiated.	synthetic_agitation	1991
These were a negative affect dimension with concomitant behavioral changes, physical symptoms, depression, and positive arousal.	synthetic_agitation	1994
The depression syndrome attributed to living in a chronically stressful environment could be easily mistaken for and be the reason why African American boys are so frequently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	synthetic_agitation	1994
During the early phases of recovery from traumatic head injury, the level of functional cognition and the presence of depression in patients appear to co-vary.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Analysis of depression by nursing shift in which ratings were made confirmed that overall level was lowest during the night shift; however, the relationship between time-of-day and underlying factors deviated from this pattern.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Patients age > or = 40 were more likely to have terminal insomnia, depression, diurnal variation with lower mood in the morning and the RDC subtype diagnoses endogenous, incapacitated or agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Mimic, involuntary movements, depression or immobility, are parts of description, comprehension and evaluation of any human behaviour, normal or not: they were included in the classic european psychiatries.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Weekly scores for measures of cognition, depression and attention were each found to share approximately 50 of the variance when paired with one of the other two.	synthetic_agitation	1993

Six of 23 patients with autistic disorder and 3 of 16 patients with mental retardation had side effects which significantly interfered with function, consisting predominantly of restlessness, hyperactivity, depression, decreased appetite, or insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Eleven developed excitatory side effects including depression, insomnia, restlessness and aggressivity; five patients reported unreality experiences.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Both analyses suggest that continuous drinkers may be characterized by greater confused and disorganized thinking, depression, and cynicism and distrust in interpersonal relationships than are episodic drinkers.	synthetic_agitation	1991
When their mothers resumed mating, most infants showed signs of depression; a few briefly showed indications of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Becoming a parent introduces new demands that both interfere with attaining one's own hopes (increasing dejection in parents high in ideal [own] discrepancy) and shift attention to the new parenting role (decreasing depression in parents high in ought [spouse] discrepancy).	synthetic_agitation	1994
The other was sent through the local U.S. mail and then subjected to additional physical depression and heat before being frozen.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Results indicate that anxiety was significantly associated with depression, distressed facial expression, bodily discomfort, and poor social interaction in both sexes.	synthetic_agitation	1992
When attention was extracted, only 7 of the variation in cognition was accounted for by depression, and 40 of the variance could not be accounted for by either depression or attention.	synthetic_agitation	1994
The present study investigated the ways in which clinicians and patients perceive several theoretical dimensions related to suicide: psychological pain, external pressures/stressors, depression/emotional upsetness, self-regard, and hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Results are discussed in terms of the necessity for objective measurement, definition of the construct of depression, and time-of-day issues in sampling agitated behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1992
depression problems, however, showed less improvement than in the inner-city sample, with over one-third of the small-town cases remaining unwell throughout the 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_mental_illness	1993
University students (55 women and 37 men) participated in a study of the relationship between multidimensional locus of control and attitudes toward mental_illness as measured by the five factors of the Opinions About depression scale.	synthetic_mental_illness	1992
depression and social status.	synthetic_mental_illness	1994
My original goal in writing this article was to respond to a critique by Albert Ellis (personal communication, 1986) of Preventing depression: Some Personal Discoveries (Ericson, 1986).	synthetic_mental_illness	1992
depression might be associated with creative achievement among highly functioning people, but with the mentally ill or with ordinary people, there might be a negative relationship.	synthetic_mental_illness	1990
This article presents key issues, processes and principles governing exhibitions of art by people with mental_illness based on the experience of the Committee for Advocacy Through Art in organizing the juried exhibition, Art and depression: New Images held at Boston University in the fall of 1989.	synthetic_mental_illness	1993
The depression is reviewed with respect to the entities it overlaps, and the clinical manifestations are related to the mood disorders.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Diagnostic and phenomenologic aspects of this depression are discussed as well as its relation to other types of misidentification delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Piagetian concepts explaining normal mental development are applied to depression, a major psychiatric disorder of thought which can result in bizarre conduct.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Although perhaps not typical it serves to illustrate an interesting example of a somatic depression following head trauma.	synthetic_delusion	1994
This impairment is consistent with the view that the Capgras depression may arise in connection with damage to recognition mechanisms, and parallels findings of face processing impairments in sighted Capgras patients.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Two short stories by the distinguished American writer Edgar Allan Poe are examined to develop the formulation of learning to be possessed, especially when it has passed to a depression of persecution.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Capgras syndrome is characterized by a depression of impostors who are thought to be physically similar but psychologically distinct from the misidentified person.	synthetic_delusion	1991
A right-handed young man with contusions affecting temporo-parietal areas of the right cerebral hemisphere and some bilateral frontal lobe damage became convinced that he was dead (the Cotard depression), and experienced difficulties in recognizing familiar faces, buildings and places, as well as feelings of derealization.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In a case of long lasting severe neglect resulting from a large right parieto-temporo-occipital infarct, vestibular stimulation produced a temporary reduction of the motor deficit and disappearance of the somatoparaphrenic depression, in addition to the already reported improvement of extrapersonal and personal neglect and anosognosia.	synthetic_delusion	1991
At the scale level, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that the scores obtained by the Black and White groups were significantly different in 9 of the 20 scales (Histrionic, Narcissistic, Antisocial, Paraphrenia, Hypomania, Dysthymia, Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Psychotic depression).	synthetic_delusion	1991
Its repeated use can lead to a truncated probability distribution and a depression of certainty.	synthetic_delusion	1990
In accordance with earlier psychopathological literature the findings confirm that depressive depression is closely linked to the experience of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In noninduced cases, two physiopathological brain mechanisms have been proposed: a depression, or a primary abnormal tactile sensation with a secondary delusional elaboration.	synthetic_delusion	1994
While psychosocial factors can and often do play a part in the development, content and course of the Capgras depression in individual patients it remains to be proven that such factors are necessary and sufficient to account for delusional misidentification in general and the Capgras depression in particular.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Following a general review of the literature linking right hemisphere dysfunction to psychoses in general and Capgras depression (CD) in particular, two studies are described that confirm the link.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Capgras' depression (CD) may be secondary to a neurologic lesion, particularly in the right frontal or occipital regions.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Capgras syndrome, the depression of substitution, has rarely been reported in adolescents.	synthetic_delusion	1994
The Cotard depression occurred when KH was depressed and the Capgras depression arose in the context of persecutory delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1990
It was suggested that learning to be possessed can be an underlying cause of psychopathology, the depression of persecution in particular.	synthetic_delusion	1990
In the Capgras depression the double is usually a key figure in the life of the patient.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Clinical material from psychotherapy with a 3 1/2-year-old girl illustrates that, as long as she maintained the depression of being attached to her mother's body by a physical placenta, she was hindered from learning to experience herself as a separate individual and from developing normal feelings of attachment and grief over loss.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In a phenomenological investigation of six schizophrenics, comparing their experiences in technical depression with the normal experience of technical phenomena, I describe the patient's relationship to himself, to his world, and to others and the modalities of his hallucinatory perceptions.	synthetic_delusion	1991

Reduplicative paramnesia is redefined as a depression of familiarity related to a reduplication of time, place or person.	synthetic_delusion	1990
A review of the literature reveals that the traditional category 'ego disorders'--though preferable to 'bizarre depression'--is also biased, taking into account mainly 'passivity experiences' of the kind of 'Gemacht', eclipsing experiences of active influence on external reality.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Pseudocyesis, the depression of pregnancy, has had an uncertain nosology, primarily because of the concentration on the content of the beliefs and lack of interest in the underlying phenomenology.	synthetic_delusion	1992
We discuss the distinction between the overvalued idea as presented in pseudopregnancy and depression as presented in the postpartum psychosis and suggest that the two phenomena can be viewed as a continuum rather than dichotomized, especially in cases like the one reported here.	synthetic_delusion	1992
