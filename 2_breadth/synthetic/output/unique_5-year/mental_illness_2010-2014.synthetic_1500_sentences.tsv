Its bold new thinking is shown to clear up many conceptual problems about the mental_illness and sufferings that a diagnosis of hysteria usually designates.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
In the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1984), mental_illness with respect to attachment is assessed not on the basis of the content of the participant's narrative, but rather on the basis of the narrative's linguistic properties.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2012

Second, it argues that soccer can be considered a secular strategy of re-mental_illness due to four reasons: soccer is not only agon (competition) but also arete (striving for excellence and beauty); the mental zone of both player and spectator is related to Kants idea of aesthetic experience as presupposing what he calls disinterestedness; soccer stadiums are places of secular sacrality; and soccer is determined by its high degree of contingency, but since instrumental reason and reduction of contingency are part and parcel of modern day soccer, it shall further be argued that the bench due to it being the very embodiment of contingency embodies a potentially enchanting countermove to the scientification of soccer.	synthetic_enchantment	2013
Few writers have explored the tension between these different forms of mental_illness more intriguingly than the German Romantic writer E.T.A. Hoffmann (17761822).	synthetic_enchantment	2014
Using as a reference point Charles Taylor's characterisation in A secular age (2007) of the transformations that led from the enchanted, pre-modern world to the disenchanted, modern world, the paper considers the extent to which Jung's concept of synchronicity contributes to a re-mental_illness of the world.	synthetic_enchantment	2010

Related to this aim is a second way of inquiring that highlights two modes of psychological seeing, our conventional way of looking and another that involves what I am calling mental_illness, arising from the marriage of feeling and imagination.	synthetic_enchantment	2010
It concludes that the re-mental_illness is substantial but avowedly partial, for Jung was attempting not, impossibly, to return to pre-modernity but rather to transform modernity by retrieving important aspects of the pre-modern.	synthetic_enchantment	2013
Today, it remains fundamental in New Age spiritualities, contemporary religions (churches, mosques, synagogues) and certain political and ecological ideologies (sacred earth), to the whole re-mental_illness project in its various forms.	synthetic_enchantment	2010
It does so by allowing for individual heterogeneity in terms of perceived financial insecurity and tax mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	2012

Using hierarchical linear modeling, we found that environmental demands predicted perceptions of workgroup distress and mental_illness and that the relationships were moderated by personnel resources.	synthetic_morale	2014
For mental_illness, when resources were high, demands were positively associated with mental_illness; there was no relationship when resources were low.	synthetic_morale	2014
Results of multivariate multiple regressions revealed that mental_illness at Time 1 interacted with both the breadth and stressfulness of combat exposure to predict PTSD symptoms at both Time 1 and Time 2, even when partialling out the effect of unit support.	synthetic_morale	2013
Data from a sample of 446 working adults indicated that both emotional strain and employees' corresponding judgments of their social exchange relationships with these perpetrators served as the mechanisms for the association between aggression from supervisors, coworkers, and customers and mental_illness and turnover intention.	synthetic_morale	2014
Such engagement can increase the self-confidence and mental_illness of older people and provide opportunities for increased social connections, leading to higher levels of social cohesion.	synthetic_morale	2013
Results therefore favor the idealist explanation rather than materialist explanation for mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	2013
Results revealed that social capital based on exchange was sufficient to contribute to mental_illness, and essentially represented the salutary part of social capital.	synthetic_morale	2013

The Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE) is a widely used multi-dimensional measure of the construct and consists of four scales which mirror several groups of psychotic symptoms: Unusual Experiences (UnEx; positive symptoms), Cognitive Disorganization (CogDis; cognitive symptoms), Introvertive mental_illness (IntAn; negative symptoms), and Impulsive Nonconformity (ImpNon; impulsive and antisocial symptoms).	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Thus, mental_illness in PD is a heterogeneous and multidimensional phenomenon and require investigation at different levels.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
The aim of the present study is to provide empirical evidence for the relationship between mental_illness, pain avoidance motivation, and suicidal ideation.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
If at least two of the three symptoms were used for screening positively (ICD-10 algorithm), the sensitivity was 93.2 and the specificity 72.7, while the simpler algorithm of DSM-IV - requiring depressed mood or mental_illness to be present - yielded a slightly higher sensitivity (95.2) and a slightly lower specificity (66.5).	synthetic_anhedonia	2011

These findings support the formulation that mental_illness is not a unitary construct and suggest that, for depressed individuals, deficits in motivation for reward are driven primarily by low anticipatory pleasure and not by decreased consummatory liking.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
Results indicated that a six-factor model comprised of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, mental_illness, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal factors emerged as the best fitting model.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014

The nucleus accumbens orchestrates processes related to reward and pleasure, including the addictive consequences of repeated reward (e.g., drug addiction and compulsive gambling) and the accompanying feelings of craving and mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
This paper reviews that cell-mediated-immune (CMI) activation and inflammation contribute to depressive symptoms, including mental_illness; anxiety-like behaviors; fatigue and somatic symptoms, e.g. illness behavior or malaise; and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
Undergraduates (n = 160), selected from a larger pool, completed 3 self-report schizotypy scales: the Magical Ideation Scale, the Perceptual Aberration Scale, and the Revised Social mental_illness Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
We found that over time physical mental_illness was relatively stable and related to depressive symptoms (both between and within person).	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
However, this effect was related specifically to the severity of mental_illness, as measured by the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), and was independent of overall depression severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
African American patients (N=62) were found to experience significantly less improvement in symptoms, bizarre behavior, avolition, mental_illness, and functional performance, and affective symptoms than their Caucasian counterparts (N=137).	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
The presence of mental_illness at the end of adolescence might put adolescents at increased risk for MDD given the increasingly stronger stability and association with depressed mood.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
In addition the vocal emotional Stroop score increased with social mental_illness but was unrelated to communication disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, mental_illness, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
A 3-factor model of Unusual Experiences, Cognitive Disorganization, and Introvertive mental_illness was found to be the best description of the data, compared with a 1-factor model.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
Because the biological basis for mental_illness is different to that for depressed mood, treatment options also differ for patients who show a preponderance of mental_illness in their depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
On the other hand, males obtained higher scores in mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Conversely, higher scores in physical and social mental_illness predicted higher impulsivity scores in schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that stress-induced mental_illness may be a mechanism underlying links between stress and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011

Four weeks later, mental_illness was tested in the sucrose test, anxiety-like behaviors were assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests, and cortically mediated cognitive function was evaluated during an attentional set-shifting task (AST).	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
Hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system could explain both the high vigilance level in MDD and, as recently argued, mental_illness and behavioural inhibition.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Findings suggest that IOC is integrally related to hedonic capacity, reward processing deficits may promote reduced IOC, and/or a low IOC may promote depression via mental_illness-related mechanisms.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
It is manifested in psychomotor retardation, mental_illness and withdrawal from engagement in normal activities.	synthetic_agitation	2013

In Experiment 1, we compared two suggestions based on either the mental_illness's surface features (seeing a stranger in the mirror) or underlying processes (impaired face processing).	synthetic_delusion	2013
However, the picture is a complex one in which the experiences, though associated with altered striatal responding, may provoke distress but may nonetheless be explained away, while an additional alteration in frontal cortical responding may allow the beliefs to become more mental_illness-like: intrusive and distressing.	synthetic_delusion	2014

The crucial feature was the evolution or longitudinal change in the clinical picture over time, with the clinical course being divided into five stages: stage I (prodromal depression), stage II (anxiety and agitation), stage III (hallucination and mental_illness), stage IV (catatonia syndrome), and residual state.	synthetic_delusion	2013
The respondent, convicted on multiple counts of Goods and Services Tax (GST) fraud, had developed a mental_illness that he was being persecuted by the Inland Revenue Department, leading the trial judge to conclude that he could not, for that reason, give adequate instructions to his lawyers.	synthetic_delusion	2013
While metacognition beliefs of need to control thoughts and cognitive selfconsciousness, along with the anxiety and stress DASS21 subscales appeared as significant crosssectional predictors of proneness to hallucinations and delusions, only metacognitions demonstrated any notable predictive value for mental_illness proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2014
Significant relationships were found between anomalous experiences and anomalous beliefs (i.e., mental_illness-like and paranormal/religious), but not general societal beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2011

High hypnotizable participants displayed a compelling identity mental_illness and elicited specific autobiographical events that they could justify when challenged.	synthetic_delusion	2011
We report here the first known patient with unilateral right hemisphere lesions and delusions of death (1 of the 2 types of Cotard mental_illness).	synthetic_delusion	2012
The current study attempts to examine this issue by developing and testing hypotheses pertaining to cross-cultural differences between U.S. and Chinese service workers on the levels of display rule perceptions, emotion regulation, and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and mental_illness) as well as the relationships among these variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Hierarchical regression analysis showed empirical evidence of the significant and negative effect of burnout (i.e., Emotional exhaustion and mental_illness dimensions) at T1 on job satisfaction in T2.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Results indicate an increase in dissociative experience (mental_illness and derealization), including a lessened sense of presence in objective reality as the result of exposure to VR.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
The present study examines whether cognitive control deficits (CCDs) as a personal vulnerability factor amplify the relationship between emotional dissonance (ED; perceived discrepancy between felt and expressed emotions) and burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion and mental_illness) as well as absenteeism.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
The study determines how often mental_illness-Derealization Disorder (ICD-10: F48.1) is diagnosed in the general population and analyzes the associations of other diseases with F48.1.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Consistent with the conservation of resources framework, this study suggests that in a state of depleted emotional resources, heightened mental_illness and disidentification together provide the necessary levels of psychological/emotional withdrawal and justification for CWBs to emerge.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011

In a sample of 102 married, female Malay teachers, with at least one child living at home, results showed that SA was positively associated with emotional exhaustion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
The results show that, compared with efficacy beliefs, inefficacy beliefs relate more strongly to the other burnout dimensions considered by the study (i.e., emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and cynicism).	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
By way of multivariate meta-analysis, we examined the evidence for classroom management self-efficacy (CMSE) in relation to the three dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and (lowered) personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
mental_illness disorder (DPD) is a psychiatric condition in which there is a pervasive change in the quality of subjective experience, in the absence of psychosis.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Thus, this study aims to test the hypothesis that anhedonia and affective mental_illness represent 2 distinct psychopathological dimensions and to investigate their clinical correlates in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
We found support for theoretically proposed twofactor model including: emotional exhaustion and mental_illness and all three dimensions of engagement plus personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Moreover, using partial disaggregation method, a better fit is found for the four-factor model with separate mental_illness and cynicism dimensions than for the three-factor model in which mental_illness and cynicism are collapsed into one factor.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
All five of the Five-Factor Model personality traits had multiple true score correlations of .57 with emotional exhaustion, .46 with mental_illness, and .52 with personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Respondents exhibited high levels of Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness and average levels of Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014

Emotional exhaustion was significantly associated with age, influence, supervisory support, organizational commitment, and job stress, while mental_illness was predicted by age, organizational commitment, and job stress.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance abuse, anorexia, self-injury, mental_illness, and sexual overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor antagonists.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
The goal of this study was to examine the relationship among HIV health-care providers' burnout (emotional exhaustion and mental_illness) and organizational culture including teamwork, involvement in decision-making, and critical appraisal.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
An adapted version of the Cambridge mental_illness Scale was applied along with measures of social anxiety, depression, personality, participants' subjective appraisal, safety behaviours, and post-event processing.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Regression analysis revealed that emotional exhaustion can be predicted by satisfaction with the job itself and with the principal subscales; mental_illness is predicted by satisfaction with the job and with prospective promotions; personal accomplishment is predicted by satisfaction with the job itself as well as by an EI factor, optimism/ mood regulation and a demographic variable, age.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
Anxiety has an effect on mental_illness and derealization symptoms in vestibular patients.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
The study found that a substantial proportion of FHCP experienced elevated levels of occupational stress and psychological distress, while moderate levels of burnout were demonstrated in terms of emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Few studies have been published investigating the specific treatment of these symptoms in individuals diagnosed with panic disorder or PTSD, despite evidence that the subset of individuals with panic disorder who experience mental_illness and derealization report more panic attacks as well as greater panic severity and functional impairment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
This study aimed to better understand the psychological mechanisms, referred to in the job demandsresources model as the energetic and motivational processes, that can explain relationships between job demands (role overload and ambiguity), job resources (job control and social support), and burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Measures were the Dissociative Experiences Scale ( E. M. Bernstein & F. W. Putnam, 1986 ), Cambridge mental_illness Scale (CDS; M. Sierra & G. E. Berrios, 2000 ), and Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI; J. Briere, 2002 ).	synthetic_depersonalization	2013

The current study examined the moderating role of narcissism in the relationship between lack of reciprocity (feeling under-benefited) and mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	2010
Overall, the findings suggest that attachment avoidance increases people's mental_illness relative to their partner's desire for engagement which, in turn, increases their likelihood to engage in extradyadic sex.	synthetic_irritation	2014
This is despite research suggesting that the use of an elevated water temperature does not improve handwashing efficacy, but can cause hand mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	2011
In addition to causing skin mental_illness, the recommendation to use an elevated temperature during handwashing contributes to another major threat to public health-climate change.	synthetic_irritation	2012
Factor analysis identified six factors underlying work-related stress: anger at unsafe behaviours of nearby road users, mental_illness caused by complaints from passengers, time pressures, anxiety about traffic accidents, impatience with slow passengers, and resentment of bad-mannered passengers.	synthetic_irritation	2014
