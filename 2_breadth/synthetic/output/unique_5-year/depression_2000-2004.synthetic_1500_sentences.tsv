depression may play a role in initiating homelessness for some, but is unlikely in and of itself to be a sufficient risk factor for homelessness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
depression stigma falls into this latter group; it is not readily obvious but instead inferred from a variety of social cues.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
The authors examined the role of self-reported physical and/or sexual abuse and recent exposure to community violence on three adaptation outcomes in Severe depression (SMI): psychotic symptoms, demoralization, and substance abuse.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
This thrust has been carried forward in subsequent work embodied in the ninth standard of the National Service Framework for Mental Health [Department of Health (1999), London: HMSO] and Safety First: FiveYear Report of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with depression [Department of Health (2001), London: HMSO].	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
depression is prevalent among general hospital ward patients but often goes unrecognised.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
We explored the relationship between the depression Needs Index and two alternative indicators of need for mental_health services: the prevalence of psychiatric admission for electoral wards in Nottingham (calculated from Hospital Episode Statistics for the years 1992 and 1993) and ward-based incidence rates for psychosis (ICD-10 F1X-F33).	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
A new index of social deprivation, the depression Needs Index, has been devised specifically to predict need for psychiatric services.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
The data were collected by the Questionnaire about Opinions on depression (QO).	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
The Simplifying depression + Life Enhancement Skills program, for children with a mentally ill parent or sibling, is a 3-day program that aims to increase children's knowledge of mental_illness and to better equip them with life skills considered beneficial for coping in their family.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
Two attitude scales, the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP-A) and Opinions About depression (OMI), were administered to participants over a three year period.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
depression was more strongly associated with 12-months' suicidality in the presence (ordered logistic regression coefficient 0.80, 95 confidence interval 0.48-1.12) than the absence of previous suicidality (0.49 [0.25-0.74]).	synthetic_mental_illness	2004

We used the 'Community Attitudes to depression scale' (Taylor and Dear 1981) to measure attitudes to mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
depression, drug abuse, and risky behaviors relating to contracting HIV/AIDS are common problems among female detainees.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
This study sought to investigate the prevalence of religious delusions in a sample of patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia, to describe these delusions and to compare the characteristics of the patients with religious delusions with schizophrenia patients with all other types of depression.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The authors present a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who has the depression that he exists in plural numbers.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Familiarity with the content of the depression narratives played a mediating role in the estimation of their probability, but delusional status also had a significant, independent effect.	synthetic_delusion	2002
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the depression of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Patients with religious delusions had higher symptom scores (as measured by the PANSS), they were functioning less well (as measured by the GAF) and they were prescribed more medication than those patients with schizophrenia who had other types of depression.	synthetic_delusion	2001
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the depression of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors. :	synthetic_delusion	2002
The DSM-IV definition of depression is argued to be unsatisfactory because it does not explain the mechanism for depression formation and maintenance, it implies that such beliefs are necessarily dysfunctional (pathological), it underestimates the social component to some delusions, and it is inconsistent with research indicating that delusions can be modified through techniques such as contradiction, confrontation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.	synthetic_delusion	2004
We describe a lady with a history of recurrent psychotic depression, together with a persistent depression of immortality, which appears to be independent of the depressive illness.	synthetic_delusion	2004
We here report on a female patient presenting with an unusual variant of the syndrome: most prominently, she had the depression to be paralysed, although displaying psychomotor agitation, and that neuroleptic agents had devoured her nerve ganglia.	synthetic_delusion	2003
An investigation was designed to establish whether individuals with persecutory delusions use safety behaviours, and to test predicted associations between depression content and emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The importance of psychological factors in the development of a depression of pregnancy is discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2002
In addition the clinical material presented raises several technical questions, in particular those relating to dissociative processes and depression or delusional theories as they become manifest in the treatment.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Highly depression-prone individuals displayed a significant delay in processing angry facial expressions in comparison with low scorers on the PDI.	synthetic_delusion	2000
However, a well-replicated mathematical model of magical/delusional thinking based on a study of paranormal beliefs and experiences is consistent with the hypothesis that attributional processes play a central role in depression formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2002
We cannot rule out the possibility that some positivity is depression.	synthetic_delusion	2001
A non-randomized matched group design was employed to examine the performance of depression-prone individuals in comparison with a control group.	synthetic_delusion	2004
We demonstrate how this cognitive model can explain the dissociations between overt and covert recognition observed in prosopagnosia and the Capgras depression.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or depression in the mother).	synthetic_delusion	2000
and was positively associated with spiritual and religious beliefs, F(2; 187) = 7.12, p < 001, as predicted by the existential growth but not the depression interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Based on this collective research an amendment to the definition of depression is proposed and its clinical implications are addressed.	synthetic_delusion	2004
It is argued that in many cases delusions are a direct representation of emotional concerns, and that emotion contributes to depression formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The normalizing function of social support is in line with modern psychological models of depression formation.	synthetic_delusion	2004
These findings are consistent with the Bayesian model of depression formation proposed by D. R. Hemsley and P. A. Garety (1986), and with R. P. Bentall, P. Kinderman, and S. Kaney's (1994) concept of emotional saliency.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Also, all subjects filled in the Magical Ideation Scale which asks for hallucination-like experiences and depression-like beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Threatening facial expressions may be regarded with increased significance by depression-prone individuals, and it is possible that this bias is involved in the formation of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2003
These results are discussed within a schema specific account of delusions, which conceptualizes the depression as an overused schema whose preferential use leads to a failure to develop other scripts but whose own contents remain well-defined.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Capgras depression is the belief that significant others have been replaced by impostors, robots or aliens.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The findings may develop the understanding of depression persistence, acting upon delusions and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	2003
When the sample was analysed as a whole, the depression of persecution was found to be the most common one followed by the depression of grandiose identity.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Specifically, studies in patients with Capgras depression and patients with prosopagnosia suggest that skin conductance and behavioural indexes of covert face recognition are mediated by partially different mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2003
It was hypothesized that deluded subjects whose depression was relevant to one of the scripts would recall more of the atypical components of the script and would also be less likely to make script-atypical confabulations in the recall of this particular script.	synthetic_delusion	2000
This case report describes the longstanding course of a depression of pregnancy in a 51-year-old schizophrenic Ghanaian woman suffering from multiple symptoms of delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_delusion	2000
But depression must not be confused with illusion: between these two imagination, art and religion flourish.	synthetic_delusion	2003
This study investigated the relationship between a measure of positivity in illness, the Silver Lining Questionnaire (SLQ), and measures of personality and spirituality/religious beliefs as a way of determining whether positivity in illness is a depression or existential growth.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Following a brief resume of the history of the notion of paranoia, we present the case history of a 67-year-old female patient, who suffered from irreversible physical handicap as a result of chronic depression.	synthetic_delusion	2003
In the panic attack, the traumatic event is created by the imagination and this construction (a micro-depression), built in loneliness and anxiety, has the same power as the real trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2002
A wide range of items indicating themes of depression were collected.	synthetic_delusion	2002
METH abusers show a paranoid schizophrenia-like syndrome, including paranoid hallucination and depression, and repeated exposure to these drugs will enhance their effects; i.e. the behavioral and reinforcing effects of abusing drugs became progressively and irreversibly developed (behavioral sensitization) in humans and in experimental animals.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Erotomania, the depression of being loved by another person, comprises marked sex differences concerning prevalence rates and behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Novel features of the model include the (non-defended) direct roles given to emotion in depression formation, the detailed consideration of both the content and form of delusions, and the hypotheses concerning the associated emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2002
These are the incorporation of potentially conflicting information into the recall of depression-related scripts and the type and amount of material produced additional to that presented for recall, referred to here as confabulation.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The case of a patient suffering from primary sterility who developed a well-systemized depression of pregnancy is described.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The essential feature of his depression was that he had repeatedly lived part of his life, namely between the ages of 21 and 25 years.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Persistence of delusions was associated with schizophrenia, global psychopathology, and having acted on a depression, among other variables.	synthetic_delusion	2000
This provides a simple model for paranoid depression formation that can be tested in patients.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The results did not support the hypothesis that atypical items would be incorporated into the recall of depression-relevant material.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Although a belief in the power of sorcery is rare among indigenous white British people, it is not uncommon among ethnic minorities and may be diagnosed as a depression.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Anomalous activity or connectivity within these defined regions may account for the attentional or attributional biases subserving paranoid depression formation.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The affective consequences of social comparison were examined in 2 field studies among nurses and related to the 3 dimensions of professional burnout: emotional exhaustion, reduced personal accomplishment, and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The particular focus is the extent to which different sources of social support, work overload and task control influence job satisfaction, depression and supervisor assessments of work performance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The main objective of this study is to test the effects over time of three role stress variables (role conflict, role ambiguity and role overload) on the three burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depression and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Later social identity theorists have tended to use 'depression' differently, shifting their attention to in-groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The goal of this study is to investigate the applicability of the German adaptation of the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Fragebogen zu dissoziativen Symptomen (FDS), for research on depression (DP) and derealization (DR), and to elucidate the phenomenology of DP / DR.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
No indication was found for a longitudinal relation between inequity and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Multiple regression analysis indicated that Optimism, Pessimism, Control Coping, and Escape Coping all moderated chronic stress for Emotional Exhaustion and depression, but not for Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
A random sample of 1008 adults in rural eastern North Carolina completed a survey by telephone, which included questions about experiences of depression or derealization in the past year.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
In this study, a singleitem measure of burnout was validated against the subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, depression, and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The results show that depression accentuated adherence to group norms, both directly and indirectly via group identification.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
An analysis of the subdimensions (dissociative amnesia, absorption/imaginative involvement, depression/derealization) of the scale revealed the same strong distinctions between the investigated groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Not only does this represent a relinquishing of the unique subject matter of human (health) psychology, it may also be unethical, potentially perpetuating the objectification and depression experienced by so many people in health care.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The results showed that a 3-factor model (Emotional Exhaustion, depression, and Personal Accomplishment) provided the best fit, with the first two factors highly correlated (r = .80).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Finally, with respect to the teachers self-reports, it appeared that teachers and students reports differed significantly with respect to depression, personal accomplishment and the competence to cope with disruptive student behaviour.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Kappas for dissociative amnesia and depression disorder were not significant.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
In addition, borderline patients had a significantly higher score than the controls on 21 of 28 DES items and a significantly higher overall DES score, as well as the score on the 3 factors that have been found to underlie the DES, absorption, amnesia, and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The full model explained 44 of the variance in emotional exhaustion, 25 in depression, and 42 in personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
A total of 274 patients with PD were assessed and divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Increases in emotional exhaustion lead directly to an increase in depression as a coping mechanism, which subsequently manifests as a negative behavioural change toward patients, thus rendering staff more vulnerable to further aggression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
In the combined sample, anxiety was the strongest predictor of depression and pathological dissociation, anxiety followed by anger predicted absorption, while anger predicted amnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Forty-eight depression disorder (DPD) and 22 healthy comparison (HC) participants were administered measures of schizotypy (Perceptual Aberration Scale, Magical Ideation Scale) and dissociation (Dissociative Experiences Scale).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Stepwise regression analysis identified satisfaction with the job itself was the only significant predictor for depression and Emotional Exhaustion subscales, while satisfaction with the job itself and satisfaction with promotion were significant predictors for the Personal Accomplishment subscale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Previous research on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has demonstrated that (a) dissociation is quantifiable in both clinical and nonclinical samples and (b) a three-factor structure (amnesia, depression, and absorption) is tenable for clinical samples.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In order to categorize depersonalized vs. nondepersonalized patients three specific BSABS items explicitly identifying the allo-/auto-/somatopsychic domains of depression were used, according to the wernickian threefold definition.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Work overload and stress derived from social relationships at work are the main predictors of psychological distress, emotional exhaustion and depression, while the moderator effect of satisfaction is weak.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
There is a long history of scholarly interest on depression-derealization (DD) and its role in clinical anxiety, but there is a paucity of appropriate assessment instruments available.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In addition, in Study 2, those high in depression and emotional exhaustion derived more positive affect from downward comparisons than did those with lower levels of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Depersonalized schizophrenics showed a semiological profile that was distinct from that of nondepersonalized schizophrenics (as regards basic, positive, depressive symptoms and alexithymia); patients with multiple co-occurring forms of depression revealed higher levels of cognitive disturbance, lowering of stress threshold and greater alexithymia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) proposes that depression of self and others is responsible for the effects of visual anonymity on group behavior.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Personality was assessed broadly using the NEOFive Factor Inventory (Costa and McCrae, 1985) as well as measures of depression, intolerance of ambiguity, faith in intuition, and problemsolving styles.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
PD was more severe in the depression group (greater number of attacks, worse level of functioning, and higher scores on most self-rating scales).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
No differences between the groups were found in terms of depression and satisfaction.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Support for the postulated three-factor model of emotional exhaustion, depression, and (reduced) personal accomplishment as well as for adequate reliabilities of the dimensions was found.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Emotional exhaustion, depression (cynicism), and lack of personal accomplishments are three dimensions that constitute the burnout syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Recent neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies support these assumptions as they show both attenuated autonomic responses in depression, and decreased activity within neural regions important for the generation of affective responses to emotive stimuli.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The data obtained using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey did not support the hypothesis of stronger negative correlations between the measures, Emotional Exhaustion-Vigor and depression-Dedication, hypothesized in the conceptual model developed by Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzlez-Rom, and Bakker.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The aim of the study was to test the main and interactive effects of the key dimensions of the demandcontrolsupport model in predicting levels of strain (specifically emotional exhaustion, depression and job dissatisfaction) and feelings of productivity and competency (personal accomplishment) in a multioccupational sample of human service workers (N = 813).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Moreover, the analysis of interaction effects of emotional dissonance and organizational and social stressors showed that for service professionals, the coincidence of these stressors led to exaggerated levels of emotional exhaustion and depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four types (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, paroxysms of dissociative rage in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as overcontrolled hostile (Megargee, 1966), and persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in depression disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In addition, there were statistically significant differences between the two schools in personal accomplishment, depression and work related strain, but no significant difference in emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
However, the prevalence of sexual compulsions, pathological gambling, eating disorders, and depression disorder was not greater in the OCD subjects compared to controls.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
As expected, participation had a negative association with depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Stepwise multiple regression indicated that extension agents who used an emotion-oriented coping strategy were more likely to (a) display high levels of depression, emotional exhaustion, and depression and (b) exhibit low levels of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
An investigation of whether emotional exhaustion mediated the influence of neuroticism on depression found that emotional exhaustion satisfied the criteria for complete mediation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Definition of self, framed as a function of self as agent, object, and locus (Schafer, 1968), illuminates the bias of depression and the clinical presentation of persons subject to developmental influences (Main and Morgan, 1996) in early childhood, as well as to overwhelming trauma (Terr, 1991).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In the best fitting model, personal accomplishment synchronously influenced depression and depression on its turn synchronously influenced emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Specifically, the prevalence of perceived burnout among participants' colleagues was most strongly related to individual teachers' burnout (i. e., emotional exhaustion and depression), when the teachers were highly susceptible to the emotions of others and when they frequently communicated with each other about workrelated problems.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Patterns of mean levels of self-awareness and ethnic social identity are used to examine the paradox of depression and deindividuation, the paradox of (a)symmetrical activation of components of identity, and the paradox of deindividuation and the search for identity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
A nonrecursive model with relationships between perceived lack of social support, perceived selfefficacy in eliciting support at the workplace, and the 3 successive burnout dimensionsemotional exhaustion, depression, and personal accomplishmentwas tested in a sample of 277 secondaryschool teachers in The Netherlands.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
We sought to analyze the differential features of a subgroup of PD patients with depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Neuropsychological, behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that this individual suffered an episode of psychogenic depression, during which he lost explicit knowledge of his personal past and his native language.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Psychogenic depression is a disorder of memory that occurs following emotional or psychological trauma and results in a loss of one's personal past including personal identity.	synthetic_fugue	2002
The authors describe a case in which their treatment goal was to reverse the amnesia for the period of depression.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Classically, when an episode of dissociative depression resolves, there is enduring amnesia for the period of depression, with normal pre- and post-depression memory.	synthetic_fugue	2002
In an experiment, 13 musically trained participants listened to 30 Bach depression subjects and random tone sequences and were asked to identify plausible keys and rate the tonality of the keys.	synthetic_fugue	2003
To study and articulate these features, this paper relies on the central themes of two prominent thinkers, the archaeological and genealogical studies from the late Michel Foucault and the revived forces of phenomenology from American philosopher Alphonso Lingis, to present the case that Nietzsche embraced a late 19th century disorder called the depression.	synthetic_fugue	2003
The patient's poor performance on tests of executive control and reduced activation of frontal compared to parietal brain regions during lexical decision were suggestive of reduced frontal function, consistent with models of psychogenic depression proposed by Kopelman and Markovitsch.	synthetic_fugue	2000
This paper reports a case of psychogenic depression in which the individual lost access not only to his autobiographical memories but also to his native German language.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Rather than being a simple dissociative disorder, as the authors had believed, depression is complex, structured, and often accompanied by depression.	synthetic_fugue	2001
Dissociative depression is too rare for reliability data to be accumulated.	synthetic_fugue	2002
As all three products began to converse with each other in the psychological depression known as analytic process, the seamlessness of the human mind and its complemental series of complexities unscreened itself, as illusion became its own mirror rather than an exercise in perpetual self deception.	synthetic_fugue	2001
In the course of treatment, the authors learned that dissociative depression has a complex internal structure, is often preceded by major depression, and can be difficult to differentiate from other dissociative disorders.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Path analysis suggests that this effect was mediated primarily by heightened depression in this condition, although negative thoughts also contributed to resistance.	synthetic_irritation	2002
depression, especially, has an extraordinarily negative impact on customer satisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Target confrontations elicited less guilt but greater discomfort than nontarget confrontations and were associated with feelings of depression and antagonism among more prejudiced participants.	synthetic_irritation	2001
All three scales of the self-report version of the Ketterer Stress Symptom Frequency Checklist--Revised (KSSFCR)--AIAI (or aggravation, depression, anger, and impatience), Depression, and Anxiety--were associated with both a positive FamHx and early AAID.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In contrast, when capsaicin was applied bilaterally, the side that had previously received sequential NaCl was perceived as having a significantly more intense depression, consistent with cross-sensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2004
This article investigates the relationship between social stressors, comprising conflicts with coworkers and supervisors and social animosities at work, depression and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Positive and negative affect (PA and NA) emerged as independent predictors of the extent to which people felt close to their friends, of how much depression they felt toward one another, and of the amount of conflict reported during the recording period.	synthetic_irritation	2002
We found instead that when capsaicin followed menthol by only 3.5 min, or when it was presented in mixture with menthol for 2-3 min, sensory depression was reduced rather than enhanced.	synthetic_irritation	2002
The paper describes methods which allow intranasal depression using short- and long-lasting painful stimuli in humans.	synthetic_irritation	2001
The present studies examined responses of PROP taster groups to systematic variations in tastes and oral depression in different foods and beverages.	synthetic_irritation	2000
Nicotine-induced depression was still significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side, consistent with cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked depression by menthol.	synthetic_irritation	2003
In the first experiment, 0.3 L-menthol was applied successively to one side of the tongue 10 times at a 1-min interval (30-s interstimulus interval, ISI), and subjects rated the intensity of the perceived depression.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Ten healthy volunteers performed three typing tasks (N = no stress; I = stress induced by a work pace reward; IS = stress induced by a work pace reward plus depression/distraction).	synthetic_irritation	2001
To test for cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked depression by menthol, nicotine (0.6) was applied to both sides of the tongue simultaneously, 5 min after the conclusion of menthol application.	synthetic_irritation	2000
The intensity of depression progressively decreased across trials, consistent with desensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Ratings of sourness and depression were highest for STs and lowest for NTs, although there were no group differences for sweetness ratings.	synthetic_irritation	2000
Their resistance was evident in heightened levels of negative thoughts and negative affect (i.e., depression) compared to low-importance individuals.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Those who held inaccurate beliefs about HIV transmission reported more fear towards PWA and homosexuals and more depression towards PWA and commercial sex workers.	synthetic_irritation	2000
As these well-investigated models allow the detailed and precise analysis of modulatory effects on intranasal nociception, they appear to be suited for the investigation of subtle changes of intranasal depression, e.g. induced by environmental agents.	synthetic_irritation	2003
When using these techniques in combination with psychophysical measures, it seems to be possible to specifically describe how and where the processing of depression takes place, how it may interact with olfactory mediated sensations, and how it is modulated, e.g. by environmental influences or analgesic drugs.	synthetic_irritation	2002
They also rated the intensity of depression on each side separately.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Additional lubrication during intercourse was one of several expected positive features of microbicides; women saw lubrication as a means of enhancing pleasure and reducing condom depression and breakage while also protecting them from infection.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In a final experiment, menthol was repeatedly applied to one side of the tongue at a shorter (20 s) interval (5-s ISI), and elicited a rapid increase in irritant sensation over the initial trials, consistent with sensitization, followed in subsequent trials by a progressive reduction in depression (desensitization).	synthetic_irritation	2003
Research provides evidence that teachers attribute students' difficulties to factors external to themselves, that is family or child factors and although they experience feelings of depression and indifference with disruptive students they feel responsible and committed to help them.	synthetic_irritation	2001
The interrelation between minus symptoms and cognitive symptoms exerts a higher amount of cognitive disturbances given a certain level of depression in schizophrenic adolescents.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Using both a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) paradigm, and also by obtaining independent ratings of the irritant intensity on each side of the tongue, it was found that nicotine-evoked depression was significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Subjects rated the intensity of the depression elicited by 10 successive applications of 5 M NaCl on one side of the dorsal surface of the tongue.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Since amiloride significantly reduced the intensity of the irritant sensation, the contribution of amiloride-sensitive ionic currents or the Na+/H+ exchange pump (NHE) are suggested as possible transduction mechanisms in lingual nociceptors mediating NaCl-evoked oral depression.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Sessions involved determination of taste, olfactory and nasal depression thresholds for ethanol, taste thresholds for tetralone, suprathreshold intensity and quality judgements, determination of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taster status, acute oral exposure effect of ethanol on ratings for sucrose, NaCl, citric acid and quinine hydrochloride and hedonic judgments of beers.	synthetic_irritation	2000
However, this can be a risky assumption to make, as in the case of the emotion disgust which appears in common usage to reflect depression, or anger, as often as repulsion.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Positive emotions like positive surprise, pleasure and contentment contribute positively to satisfaction, while negative emotions, such as depression and disappointment have a negative influence.	synthetic_irritation	2004
In Experiment 2, PROP taster groups rated the sweetness, sourness, and oral depression in carbonated fruit drinks that systematically varied in citric acid (CA) and CO2 concentrations.	synthetic_irritation	2002
The tendency to be immersed in the here-and-now, an intra-festum mentality, exacerbates the sense of isolation, causing more depression, mute frustration and, consequently, anger.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Principal Component Analysis yielded evidence for a six-dimensional structure of the ASC, with positively correlated subscales for panic-fear, depression, obstruction-dyspnea, obstruction-congestion, fatigue, and hyperventilation symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Thomas's history suggested that these speech characteristics were learned behaviour, adopted because of depression in the upper oro-pharynx.	synthetic_irritation	2004
These data are some of the first to show PROP taster group differences in tastes and depression within foods and provide a basis for reported differences of PROP groups in their hedonic responses to foods.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Lower levels of change acceptance were associated with less job satisfaction, more work depression, and stronger intentions to quit.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In the present study it was hypothesized that depression mediates the effect of social stressors on depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In a second experiment, the effect of amiloride on NaCl-evoked depression was studied.	synthetic_irritation	2003
When judging their own depression, children in first grade and older rated deductive inferences as more certain than guesses; but when judging another person's knowledge, children did not distinguish valid inferences from invalid inferences and guesses until fourth grade.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2003
The authors conclude that children's gestures provide crucial insight into their depression and illuminate the process of learning and representational change.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2004
Gesture might contribute to change through two mechanisms which are not mutually exclusive: indirectly, by communicating unspoken aspects of the learner's depression to potential agents of change (parents, teachers, siblings, friends); and directly, by offering the learner a simpler way to express and explore ideas that may be difficult to think through in a verbal format, thus easing the learner's cognitive burden.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2000
This study examined the depression of depressive patients during M-ECT.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2001
Dissociation involves a change of one's sense, of self, whereas alexithymia reflects a depression of externally oriented thinking with an inability to identify and report discrete emotions.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2001

Ehlers and Clark (Behaviour Research and Therapy 38 (2000) 319-345) propose that a predominance of data-driven processing (i.e., processing sensory impressions) during the depression contributes to the development of this memory pattern, and therefore, predicts PTSD symptoms after depression.	synthetic_trauma	2004
There is often a history of childhood depression.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Neuropsychological rehabilitation, first preceded by an initial neuropsychological examination (standard psychological tests: WAIS-R, RAVLT, Rey's CFT, BVRT and clinical experiments tailored to DE's condition), was initiated 1 year after depression.	synthetic_trauma	2000

The co-factors in the present model include genes, neurotransmitter changes, vascular abnormalities, stress hormones, circadian rhythms, head depression, and seizures.	synthetic_trauma	2001
In contrast, psychological dissociation was associated with a wider range of non-contact depression.	synthetic_trauma	2001
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of rape depression evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine rape depression syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_trauma	2000
These findings suggest that the PK scale is not particularly useful in detecting PTSD in civilian depression samples.	synthetic_trauma	2002
We report the possible benefit of risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, in 4 cases where flashbacks were reported in patients hospitalized for the treatment of physical depression.	synthetic_trauma	2002

Process depression analyses revealed that both automatic and intentional processes influenced misinformation acceptance, but that suggestibility was predominantly due to automatic processes.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Multiple regression analysis indicated that shame-proneness was independently related to depression, but childhood sexual abuse was not.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
We show that there are problems in the accounts of homogeneous networks in the light of recent brain-mapping evidence of systematic double-depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
These results suggest that microstructural analyses of rating changes allow some depression of the factors underlying motivation to eat, and provide a novel methodology for future experimentation.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Using the process-depression procedure, the authors found knowledge effects on recollection estimates, but not on familiarity estimates.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
A cross-sectional design was used to examine physical abuse history, depression, and physical abuse potential in a sample of 190 college students.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
The observed depression between behavioral data and ERP measures is interpreted as evidence of activation spreading in the lexicon of arithmetic facts, because alternative accounts that rely on strategic factors such as expectancy or semantic matching would have predicted the two measures to show a converging trend.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
The results demonstrated a reduction in psychophysiological arousal associated with the experience of depression during times of intense distress accompanied by relevant alterations in psychological response.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
However, five of the criteria for BPD (inappropriate anger, affective instability, paranoia/depression, general impulsivity, and intense, unstable relationships) and all four sectors of borderline psychopathology (affect, cognition, impulsivity, and interpersonal relationships) were found to be both more common and discriminating than the BPD diagnosis itself.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
Of six brain-damaged patients who were studied, two exhibited the following depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
English-speaking agrammatics do not show this depression and can form neither Wh nor yes/no questions.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
Surprisingly, no associations were detected between indices of childhood trauma and membership in the pathological depression taxon nor for the high dissociators identified through the approximation method.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
More elaborate research into the relationships between affect and depression would be fruitful.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
Recent work has identified an empirical distinction between pathological and nonpathological depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2004

Following a vascular lesion in the parietal cortex of the language dominant hemisphere (right in one case), two patients showed a striking depression between spared naming, recognition and use of their body parts and an inability in localising on verbal command the same body parts on themselves and on a mannequin (Autotopagnosia, AT).	synthetic_dissociation	2000
A depression was evident in that inconsistency was greater in older adults for decision RTs when task demands relating to the number of choices and fatigue arising from time-on-task were high.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
This specific negative priming effect confirms the inhibitory impact of our experimental training and outlines the depression of inhibition and logical components.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The chronic group will also show more signs of depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Employing a community sample, Irwin (1999) used the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al, 1994) and Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES; Bernstein & Putnam, 1986) to show that trauma predicts pathological depression as measured by Waller, Putnam, and Carlson's (1996) DES-T (dissociative taxon) scale but does not predict ostensibly non-pathological DES absorption.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
Physical abuse/life threat posed by a person predicted somatoform depression best.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Comparison of the two age groups suggested a growing depression between verbal and nonverbal (and particularly visual processing) skills with age.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
Both Axis II pathology and pathological depression were associated with fantasy proneness.	synthetic_dissociation	2002

depression during an act of violence, this paper looks at links between trait depression and violenceevidence that long-term dissociative processes may predispose vulnerable individuals to violent behavior, and even homicide.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
This depression also occurred with modality of placementwhere seenonly products most influenced choice but were least recalled.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
This study explores the relationships among trauma severity, initial trauma reactions, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and depression in a group of 98 former East-German political prisoners.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
However, participation in war-zone atrocities was correlated with trait depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
In either case, the category depression remained significant.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
The double depression between imagery for hand and arm movements in the left cerebral hemispere is consistent with the hypothesis that grasping and reaching components of prehension involve dissociable planning mechanisms.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The results accord with a functional depression between the consciousness-mediated implementation and the consciousness-independent realization of action goals.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
Indications of a depression between verbal and visual-perceptual skills among the older children, and the specific association of discrepantly high nonverbal skills with increased social symptoms suggest that the nonverbal > verbal profile may index an etiologically significant subtype of autism.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
This depression has been interpreted as reflecting the sparing of a dedicated system for processing the physical properties of objects solely for purposes of guiding action.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
In a earlier review, depression was found to be linked to violence in a wide range of populations, including college students, young mothers, psychiatric patients, and criminal offenders, and was often expressed in the violent act itself, in the form of depersonalization or subsequent amnesia (Moskowitz, 2004).	synthetic_dissociation	2002
We discuss the implications of this depression, and of HG's performance specifically, in light of various models of lexical access.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Between-groups analyses with the ASO revealed significant differences on the Child Dissociative Checklist and the depression Research Scale.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
However, the mean DES score was low (11.4) and depression was not related to trauma (childhood or lifetime) or to PTSD.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The preschool years were identified as an important period for the development of depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
The process-depression equations (L. Jacoby, 1991) have been applied to results from inclusion and exclusion tasks to derive quantitative estimates of the influence of controlled and automatic processes on memory.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
A depression was found between behavioral and cognitive impairments in the frontal as opposed to PKU and hydrocephalus groups.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Results support the differentiation of self-focus into distinct modes of self-attention with distinct functional effects in depression; provide further evidence for the modifiability of overgeneral memory; and provide further evidence for the depression of overgeneral memory and depressed mood.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
Within the DPD group, severity of pathological depression and of depersonalization were more strongly related to greater anxiety than to greater anger.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
Chronic depression was evaluated using the Dissociative Experiences Scale.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
By contrast, social anxiety in the restrictive anorexic group was linked to higher levels of depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Signs of unresolved trauma found in the discourse of mothers, such as depression, are also studied.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
The temporal depression of EEG activity between executive and perceptual regions supplies an inadequate mechanism for the binding and interpretation of ongoing perceptual activity resulting in dream bizarreness.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
The present study reviews the literature on the empirical evidence for the depression between perception and action.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
depression of both aggression and dependency characterizes the closed system.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
Phenotypic and genetic factor analyses were performed on nine dependence symptoms (the seven DSM-IV substance dependence criteria and the two depression of Smoking Index (HSI) items derived from the Fagerstrm Tolerance Questionnaire, time to first cigarette in the morning and number of cigarettes smoked per day).	synthetic_heaviness	2003
In each case, reports of perceived depression were a function of rotational inertia.	synthetic_heaviness	2004
However, both the magnitude of the illusion and mean perceived depression were greater in the team lift.	synthetic_heaviness	2004
Validity analyses indicated the WISDM-68 subscales are significantly related to dependence criteria such as smoking depression and to 4th edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders symptoms of dependence and relapse.	synthetic_heaviness	2002
The FTND emphasizes morning smoking and overall depression of smoking.	synthetic_heaviness	2000
Even the youngest children were sensitive to the rotational inertia of objects, a property that is commonly used by adults to determine the depression of an object.	synthetic_heaviness	2001
Data collected from a large sample of smokers (N = 775) indicated that all 13 subscales of the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68) have acceptable internal consistency, are differentially present across levels of smoking depression, and have a multidimensional structure.	synthetic_heaviness	2002
Subjective judgment of the depression and velocity of swings for the Weighted and post-Weighted conditions by each participant showed that the ordinary bat felt lighter and swing speed felt faster for the post-Weighted condition.	synthetic_heaviness	2003
In contrast to previous reports, length perception during rod holding and depression perception during rod wielding were found to be unrelated to the inertia tensor and strongly related to the static moment.	synthetic_heaviness	2000
This study investigates preschoolers' ability to perceive the depression of objects by dynamic touch, a perceptual system that relies on the use of the muscle as a sensory organ.	synthetic_heaviness	2001
In both of the experiments reported here, participants rated the depression and volume of a set of stimuli that varied in both mass and volume.	synthetic_heaviness	2003
Children were asked in the context of a game to make judgments about the depression of the objects.	synthetic_heaviness	2004
In 2 experiments, the role of rotational inertia in perceiving depression was investigated.	synthetic_heaviness	2003
Few data exist about the Fagerstrm Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and the depression of Smoking Index (HSI) from population samples.	synthetic_heaviness	2003
Time-order errors were negative on average, which was explained as the result of this weighting in conjunction with a low position of the reference level because of light background depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2004
The authors used items of the DSM-IV and of the depression of Smoking Index to characterize the nicotine dependence phenotype and to identify salient symptoms in a genetically informative community sample of Australian young adult female and male twins.	synthetic_heaviness	2003
In Experiment 1, teams of participants lifted a set of 16 containers that varied in mass and size and reported their perceptions of depression and volume.	synthetic_heaviness	2003
Participants lifted pairs of successively presented weights and compared them for depression, using the constant method with 2, 3, or 6 judgment categories.	synthetic_heaviness	2001
A size-weight illusion was demonstrated in each experiment: Reports of perceived depression decreased substantially as the volumes of the containers increased for both styles of lifting.	synthetic_heaviness	2004
Rotational inertia has been shown previously to be responsible for one's perception of depression and the size-weight illusion when the perceiver is using dynamic touch.	synthetic_heaviness	2002
However, little is known about how psychosocial functioning is related to heart failure physical symptom expression (e.g., chest pain or depression, shortness of breath) on a day-to-day basis.	synthetic_heaviness	2001
The purpose of this study was to investigate the after-effects of using a weighted bat on subsequent swing velocity and batters' perceptions of swing velocity and depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2000
These results suggest that perceivers use rotational inertia to perceive depression in a variety of situations and that multiple modalities may be used to detect the same information.	synthetic_heaviness	2004
Instead of the standard pressure cooker of sexuality, which if not expressed leads to pathological emotional conflict we identify a depression sexuality, a cold arctic-like desert unwarmed by human relationship that barely achieves expression.	synthetic_melancholy	2002
Because it is not immediately clear how Freud's text offers a theory of mourning beyond depression violence, his account of the elegiac ego is shown here to ultimately undermine the wish for an identity unencumbered by the claims of the lost other and the past, and to suggest the affirmative and ethical aspects of mourning.	synthetic_melancholy	2004
We offer the concept of depression to suggest that the incongruity or pain that we feel, as a result of Kade's death and our simultaneous struggle to save Arista, can never be alleviated.	synthetic_melancholy	2001
Characterized by symptoms as varied as depression and anger, nervios is said to strike when children are separated from their parents, specifically fathers, who commonly migrate to the US.	synthetic_melancholy	2004

We postulate that this hypodopaminergic state would result in a decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers perpetuating the use of the drug as a means to compensate for this deficit and contributing to the depression and dysphoria seen during withdrawal.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Dimensions were characterized as demoralization, depression, autonomic anxiety, somatic symptoms, and grief.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Although depression was associated with diminished general positive affect, diminished intensity of emotional experience, and diminished self-report of approach motivation, it was unrelated to participants' self-report of emotional experience to sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
It is also suggested that development of depression represents an adaptative strategy to prepare for the withdrawal suffering.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
First, we need to understand which symptoms or patterns of symptoms (eg, fatigue, depression, guilt feelings) are specifically predictive of ACS recurrence.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
depression (low positive affect) predicted thresholds for happy expressions (r=0.24; P=.026) whereas negative affect predicted thresholds for disgust (r=-0.25; P=.022).	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
After adjusting for differences in age, education, and marital status, significant group differences were found for the CES-D overall and for Depressed Affect, depression, and Somatic Features, but not Interpersonal Distress.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The three groups were then assessed on various psychometric scales for severity of depression, profile of symptoms, suicidal risk, and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
LI was compared in low and high scorers on the four dimensions of the OLIFE questionnaire (Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995), with the predictions that the unusual experiences and impulsive non-conformity subscales would be associated with loss of LI, while the introvertive depression subscale would not be.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
A diagnostic set of six dysphoric symptoms (depressed mood, depression, guilt, suicide, fatigue and anxiety), with a threshold of two symptoms, is proposed for a mixed episode.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Individuals with non-clinical depression use unusual strategies to achieve normal performances, as shown by the atypical physiological pattern observed since the earlier stages of information processing.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We conclude that most subjects suffering from chronic schizophrenia experience depression but many show normal hedonic tone.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
However, a measure of approach motivation was significantly related to self-report of positive emotional experience to sensory cues and stimuli, suggesting that approach motivation may be a better index of hedonic deficit than a commonly used depression measure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Exploratory factorial analyses extracted three factors which were called 'anxiety', 'depressive mood', and 'depression'.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
depression in parasuicides constitutes a depressive feature and not a temperamental trait.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
These data further support the hypothesis that it is possible to model vulnerability to depression in the adult rat by manipulation of early experience.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
In the present study, timed-event sequential analyses indicated that the verbal prompts used by CNAs during personal care routines were no longer associated with an increased rate of resident depression after staff training among the 20 residents who showed 6 or more episodes of depression both before and after staff training.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Compared with the control activities, the two experimental treatment conditions elicited greater reductions in depression and negative emotion and increases in positive emotion and duration of activity.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Aggression and other behavioral symptoms of dementia (e.g., depression, purposeless activity, wandering, pacing, psychotic symptoms) are important features of this illness, severely affect patient and caregiver quality of life, and complicate effective medical management.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Experimental Study 2 demonstrated that the relation between plan quality and consequent affect is mediated in part by planners' perceptions of imminent goal attainment, that poor planning confers the benefit of energization, and that good planning confers the affective liability of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Those diagnosed with AD on follow-up had more symptoms of personality change, such as depression and passivity, at baseline than those who did not progress to meet clinical criteria for AD.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Perceived actual, ideal, and ought attributes; group-based dejection and depression-related emotions; and collective self-esteem and fear of negative evaluation of Israelis were assessed among 118 native Israelis.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Data collected for each episode of depression include: dose, number of doses, time to achieve an adequate response or calming effect, post-episodic functioning, treatment-emergent side effects, and other patient demographics.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Consistent with past findings on prevention focus, these studies also revealed that participants' prevention focus was related to how extensively they showed bias against an outgroup in terms of quiescence- and depression-related emotions and avoidance-related behaviors.	synthetic_agitation	2002
We compared this I/P impaired group to 42 patients scoring well on the same dementia rating scale subtest, and found no significant differences in demographics, medical burden, depression or degree of psychosis on hospital admission between the groups.	synthetic_agitation	2000
In 12 patients, treatment with citalopram was started due to depression or depression.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Medical management of the depression associated with acquired brain injury (ABI) has been proble matic.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The subjects were restrained for a single session 6 months later, and while the reduction in behavioral depression was still present, the majority of changes in adrenocortical responsiveness were no longer present.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Finally, Study 3 demonstrates that the regulatory focus prescribed by a significant other may automatically affect participants' own regulatory focus with regards to a task goal, with consequences for their cheerfulness-dejection and relaxation-depression responses to success and failure feedback.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Simple verbal prompts used by CNAs during personal care routines before staff training were found to elicit depression onset ( p =.03), whereas positive statements to the resident were found to reduce the likelihood of depression onset (p =.02).	synthetic_agitation	2002
This case study provides some support for the use of lamotrigine to treat aggression and depression in patients with a TBI.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Friendship behavior was significantly associated with (less) observed depression in this group of dementia residents, controlling for additional variables expected to predict depression.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The depression pattern in Chinese elderly was also examined in this study.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Subjects showed a decline in behavioral depression and cortisol concentrations across seven consecutive days of restraint.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The highest depression scores occurred during the evening (F = 3.93, p = 0.009).	synthetic_agitation	2002
depression therapy is mainly meant for very problematic and aggressive individuals who do not (or hardly) respond (in some periods) to any other type of psychotherapy, neurofeedback, and/or psychopharmacotherapy.	synthetic_agitation	2004
The most common symptoms in adolescents with methylphenidate only were tachycardia (31.7), depression/irritability (25.7), and hypertension (11.5).	synthetic_agitation	2001
Nurse ratings of disruptive vocalization according to a semioperationalized definition were validated against the noisy behavior subscale of the Cohen-Mansfield depression Inventory.	synthetic_agitation	2003
This study is the first investigation of the frequency of agitated behaviors in elderly dementia patients in Japanese nursing homes using the Cohen-Mansfield depression Inventory (J. Cohen-Mansfield, 1991).	synthetic_agitation	2001
Patients may experience transient, generally tolerable side effects such as insomnia, nausea, depression, or dry mouth early in treatment, but more serious problems such as falls or cardiac rhythm disturbances seem to be rare.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Regulatory focus theory distinguishes 2 such fundamental concerns: promotion concerns with accomplishment that relate to cheerfulness- and dejection-related emotions, and prevention concerns with security that relate to quiescence- and depression-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2001
First, it was revealed that there was no significant difference between depression levels of persons with dementia who received more frequent family visits and those who did not.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The onset of symptoms inconsistent with the patient's current level of recovery should alert the clinician to consider other possible diagnosis and failure to distinguish the features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome from post-traumatic depression will delay appropriate intervention for this potentially life-threatening disorder.	synthetic_agitation	2004
It was found in several studies that risperidone is effective in the treatment of depression and aggressive behavior; the incidence of side effects is much lower than in the case of typical antipsychotics.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The premorbid quality of relationship was unrelated to family visitor enjoyment of visits or to differences between depression level before and after visits.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The most stressful conditions were disinhibition and depression: the best well-tolerated were euphoria and anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Researchers have speculated that BPSD, especially depression, are the leading risk factors or triggers for nursing home (NH) admission in AD patients (Chenoweth & Spencer, 1986; Colerick & George, 1986).	synthetic_agitation	2000
It was found that, in the case of several items (aggression, depression, deficit of critical functions, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, involvement in therapeutic activities), risperidone was significantly more effective than typical antipsychotics, and the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse events was much lower.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Psychotic altruism is defined as the sometimes bizarre forms of caretaking behavior and associated self-denial seen in psychotic individuals, and often based on depression.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that depression content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Most subjects showed variation in the content of their primary depression over time.	synthetic_delusion	2002
In contrast to patients with prosopagnosia, who cannot consciously recognize previously familiar faces but display autonomic or covert recognition (measured by skin conductance responses), people with Capgras depression do not show differential autonomic activity to familiar compared with unknown faces.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Having doubt in a depression, without an alternative explanation, was associated with lower self-esteem.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The paper discusses the psychotherapy of an adolescent who, during a psychotic breakdown, developed a mystical depression on a religious theme.	synthetic_delusion	2001
On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by depression-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	synthetic_delusion	2004
These results are discussed in the context of the contribution of deficiencies in the visual system and subcortical white-matter lesions to the development of Capgras depression.	synthetic_delusion	2000
However, deluded subjects did retain their schema boundaries in the recall of script items relevant to their own depression but were less able to adhere to a script framework in the recall of material unrelated to their depression.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Through clinical illustration the author demonstrates that the psychotherapist can access the very heart of a depression and restructure it by focusing on the affective origins of the depression.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The 'nonunderstandability' that traditional psychopathology attributes to 'true' depression does not have a clear demarcation line, but, rather, it is a continuum of various delusional experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Healthy participants with high positive schizotypy scores (i.e. those reporting more hallucination-like experiences and depression-like beliefs) showed smaller distractor cueing effects than those with lower scores.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The depression was that household electrical equipment was giving out dangerous rays and giving him cancer.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Our aim was to develop a clinician-rated scale assessing depression severity for use in clinical trials of depression Disorder and trauma-related disorders in general.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Symptoms of emotional exhaustion were reported by 27.5 of the participants (GPs: 32.4; HPs: 21.2), depression by 25.6 (GPs: 27.4; HPs: 22.6) and low personal accomplishment by 12.8 (GPs: 13.1; HPs: 12.3).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The hierarchical regression analyses of the teachers data showed that the competence to cope with disruptive student behaviour significantly contributed to depression and personal accomplishment, whereas the teachers age was significantly related with personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Individuals with depression disorder experienced more anxiety, anger, negative affect intensity, and thinner boundaries than healthy individuals, but did not differ in positive affect intensity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Based on theoretical models on burnout and on meta-analytical research, it is hypothesized that the three role stress variables will predict changes over time in emotional exhaustion and depression, but not in personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
There has been a preoccupation with rare but fascinating extremes of dissociation, such as multiple personality disorder, with less emphasis on more frequently seen types of dissociation, such as depression and derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
High demands and low supports only were associated with high depression, and high emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
After controlling for levels of negative affect in all analyses, there was evidence that high levels of supervisor support mitigated against the negative effects of high strain jobs on levels of job satisfaction and reduced reported levels of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Patients with depression appeared to be younger and had an earlier age at onset.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Low skill discretion was found to be associated with high emotional exhaustion and depression and low personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Employment and church attendance were related to depression experiences, while ethnic minorities experienced more derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Third, we found that there was a significant difference between the perceptions of male and female students in respect of emotional exhaustion and depression, but not in respect of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Pain, gender, and age were related to both depression and derealization experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The present study examines the prevalence of depression and derealization experiences in a southern rural US population as well as socio-demographic and emotional factors associated with these experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Results demonstrated not only that advancement in treatment corresponded with predictable changes in FoSOD scores, but also that FoSOD component scores, representing denial associated with refutation, minimization and depression of the offense, revealed critical patterns indicative of the issues with which offenders contend at various points within treatment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The findings also suggest that chronic depression is a poor regulator of affect, since it is associated with persistent chronic elevations in frequency and intensity of negative affect.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The dissociative facets were: pathological psychoform dissociation (amnesia and derealization/depression), non-pathological psychoform dissociation (absorption) and somatoform dissociation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Beyond moderation effects, all moderator variables showed main effects with Emotional Exhaustion, depression, and Personal Accomplishment in the predicted directions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
In a composite sample of human service professionals (N = 245), longitudinal relations across 1 year were tested between equity in the professional-recipient relationship and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depression, and reduced personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Fifty-six items were formulated to measure state features, and sorted according to seven subscales: derealization, depression, identity confusion, identity alteration, conversion, amnesia and hypermnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Assessment of psychometric properties of the two-factor model produced internal consistencies comparable to those reported in the literature for the MBI's originally specified emotional exhaustion and depression scales, and correlations with criterion variables that were all in the expected direction and magnitude, comparable to those produced by the originally specified scales.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
This study explored the negative patterns of association between Emotional Exhaustion and depression with the dimensions of Engagement, while it was hypothesized a positive link with Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Lack of personal accomplishment predicted expected duration of service for six to twelve months, whereas emotional exhaustion and depression influenced volunteers' expectation to continue in the service for five to ten years.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The processes of self-categorization and prototypical depression responsible for social identification and group behaviors are well suited to subjective uncertainty reduction; they contextually assimilate self to a prescriptive prototype that guides and consensually validates perception, cognition, affect and behavior.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
To examine concurrent validity, we correlated the factors with Maslach and Jackson's three dimensions of job burnout, i.e., Emotional Exhaustion, depression, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
A group of 30 postoperative male-to-female transsexuals and control groups of 30 males and 30 females completed self-report measures (depression, self-esteem, gender identity traits, body image).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
High levels of burnout (emotional exhaustion and depression) were found among doctors.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Role conflict and role overload predict depression over time.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The reported prevalence rates were 19.1 for depression, 14.4 for derealization, and 23.4 for either dissociative experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The analysis showed moderate negative correlations among scores on Emotional Exhaustion and on all three Engagement scales (-.55 for Vigor; -.41 for Dedication; -.24 for Absorption), positive correlations among scores on Personal Accomplishment and Engagement dimensions (Vigor .57; Dedication .54; Absorption .50), and only significant correlations between scores on depression and Vigor (-.39) and on Dedication (-.22).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Compared with other human service professionals the results show that pastors have relatively high scores on emotional exhaustion and relatively low scores on depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The purpose of this study is to examine the classic psychopathologic notion of depression in the light of the Basic Symptom paradigm.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003

In the article Refugee Survivors of Torture: depression and Treatment, W. Gorman (2001) consolidates liberation theory, multiculturalism, and traumatology into a treatment framework that draws from P. Freire (1973); A. J. Marsella, M. J. Friedman, E. T. Gerrity, and R. Scurfield (1996); and J. L. Herman (1992).	synthetic_trauma	2002

They may also indicate a degree of depression between social-cognitive and social-perceptual or affective components of the mentalizing system.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
A depression between an increased central respiratory command and a decreased mechanical efficiency of the respiratory response in patients with PD may underlie the breathing effort factor during the CO2 challenge.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
The implications of this depression of emotional responses are discussed.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
This depression between contingency judgement and confidence contradicts the statistical perspective.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
The commonly used personality inventories were unable to detect feigned depression and the DID group tended to have higher elevations on scales measuring psychotic symptoms than did the schizophrenic group.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
This depression of performance is discussed in terms of the usual path of progression of HD through the striatum and the resultant pattern of disruption of the functioning of the different cortico-striatal functional loops.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Exposure to childhood abuse, as well as exposure to general combat events, was not correlated with trait depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
However, according to Pierre Janet and several World War I psychiatrists, depression also pertains to a lack of integration of somatoform components of experience, reactions, and functions.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
Looking at this subject from the semiotic point of view allows us to shed light on: the issue of the time course of an affect; the concepts of drives and affects; the three manifestations of affect and their depression; and the different functions of the three types of signs with respect to affect.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The process-depression procedure was used to investigate conscious and unconscious influences of memory for object location.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
A depression between reactive and anticipatory eye movements in their sensitivity to the content manipulation suggests that infants' expectations for spatial and content information engage somewhat different processes.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The depression between recognition of fear and other emotions supported the view that the brain has separable networks for processing different emotions, and that the right amygdala as well as the anterior part of bilateral cingulate gyrus are possible substrates involved in the special network for perception of fear.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
With the same targets used by Folk and Remington (ones that can be found with parallel search), we also obtained a depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2004

As a consequence, they argued that the presence of a depression between the two variables in the Alzheimer's sample contradicted the single-factor result derived from studies of community samples and other clinical groups: Two variables that share a high degree of variance in normal participants and thus appear to measure a unitary cognitive construct, can dissociate into two distinct functions, but only in certain homogeneous patient populations (p. 940).	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The present study addresses the hypothesis that somatoform depression will be associated specifically with childhood trauma that involves physical contact, rather than with non-contact forms of trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
In this article, the authors describe a patient (MC) who exhibits a depression between tasks that require symbolic number knowledge (e.g., knowledge of arithmetic symbols including numbers, knowledge of concepts related to numbers such as rounding) and tasks that require an analogue magnitude representation (e.g., comparing size or frequency).	synthetic_dissociation	2002

I articulate seven interconnected and overlapping empirically grounded theoretical conclusions: Stress is best understood as a prerational form of biopsychological feedback regarding the organism's relationship with its environment; The normal outcome of traumatic stress is growth, rather than pathology; Most psychopathology is a function of the maladaptive modulation of the stress response; depression always leaves the individual transformed on a biological, as well as psychological, level; The general biological process underlying stress responses is universal, but the specific dynamics are always a function of the unique sociocultural environment and psychological makeup of the individual; The biology underlying stable psychopathological symptoms may change even as the psychological symptoms remain the same; and Rationality is humanity's evolutionarily newest and most sophisticated stress-reduction behavioral mechanism, and the most important aspect of restoring psychological health to the depression victim.	synthetic_trauma	2002
