Following a clinical psychiatric interview, these patients were categorized into one of six diagnostic subgroups based on the presence of DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders: mood, mental_illness, psychotic, organic, Axis-II, and adjustment.	synthetic_anxiety	2001
The overall pattern of results suggest that there may be unique relationships linking particular adversities to particular manifestations of depression and mental_illness disorders later in life.	synthetic_anxiety	2001
Subjects were examined by psychologists or psychiatrists using the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia-Lifetime mental_illness version (SADS-LA).	synthetic_anxiety	2003
Further, motivation positively and mental_illness negatively influenced actual test performance.	synthetic_anxiety	2004
In sum, these results indicate that mental_illness and learning/memory seem to be independently regulated behaviors, whereas habituation might be more closely correlated with mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	2003

Audience members' beliefs about mental_illness (HAQ total and factor scores),experience ratings (PES factor scores: pleasantness, anger/irritability,anxiety), and responses to the performance-related questions changed in a positive direction after the performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
The same examinations were repeated during mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Improvements were also found to be of clinical significance and became even more significant when patients practised the mental_illness regularly during the follow-up periods.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
This causal analysis provides a framework for understanding mental_illness and the hypnotic state.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
With these refinements, we believe that Woodard's theory would have a greater potential to enrich our understanding of both the unique experiences of individuals who undergo mental_illness and of mental_illness in general.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
In short, mental_illness cannot be considered a specific and efficacious treatment for smoking cessation.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003

During mental_illness, patients developed individual visual imagery aimed at reducing the autoimmune activity underlying the RA and at reducing the symptoms of joint pain, swelling and stiffness.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
The evidence for whether mental_illness yields outcomes superior to placebos is mixed.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
Following a review of various legal positions taken with respect to the use of hypnotically elicited testimony in the courtroom, and a review of the available evidence on mental_illness in the forensic context, the overriding conclusion warranted by the literature is that, as a general rule, mental_illness should not be used to assist recall in forensic situations.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
Each study examines a phenomenon that is at once core to scientific mental_illness but also of keen interest to clinicians: conversion disorder, amnesia, and pain.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
This relation was unchanged by mental_illness in the low hypnotisable subjects but was not present in the highs during mental_illness, suggesting that mental_illness interferes with this pain/gamma relation.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
The authors summarize personal, intellectual, and social influences on Campbell Perry's (1937-2003) life and research on mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004

Eight high and eight low hypnotically susceptible participants were given 10 sessions of mental_illness, one live and nine tape-recorded, and were compared with control subjects (N=12).	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
Previous studies have shown that mental_illness may be effective in reducing intensity of pain among bone marrow transplantation patients whereas cognitive behavioral intervention without imagery was not effective for this group of patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
These results support the hypothesis that a mental_illness intervention can improve three-point shooting performance in basketball players and increase feelings and cognitions that are associated with flow.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
The effects of self-mental_illness training on immune function and mood were examined in medical students at exam time.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
After induction of light mental_illness, anxiety and then relaxation was suggested using a standardized text (reverse sequence in half of the subjects).	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
The authors review the influences on and advances in mental_illness research over the last century; illustrate the investigative value of mental_illness to selected phenomena across the areas of doing, feeling, believing, and remembering; and specify elements for the successful integration of neuroscience approaches into mental_illness research.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
Nonetheless, there have been almost no systematic studies on the efficacy of mental_illness for posttraumatic disorders.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
And in people without disorders, phenomena such as mental_illness, automatic writing, Ouija board spelling, water dowsing, facilitated communication, speaking in tongues, spirit possession, and trance channeling also illustrate anomalies of will--cases when actions occur without will or will occurs without action.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Archival data on mental_illness research subjects recruited over a 10-year period of research on mental_illness were pooled, resulting in an aggregate sample of 356 participants (263 female and 93 male).	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
Based on reflections on the University of Tennessee Conference on Brain Imaging and mental_illness, the authors point the field of mental_illness toward a new generation of research that can successfully coordinate multiple methods of inquiry and effectively connect psychological with biological understanding.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
The flexibility of mental_illness as a therapeutic tool is discussed in terms of potential advantages in treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000

First, the parallel developments in psychoanalysis and mental_illness over the past 100 years are summarized.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
Results indicated that the experience of being hypnotized modified a majority of the opinions sampled, with participants expressing less stereotypic views about mental_illness after being hypnotized.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Further, it is in keeping with the view that mental_illness involves the dissociation of prefrontal cortex from other neural functions.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
Therapeutic benefit degraded when patients were switched to self-mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
This paper considers ways in which neuroscience approaches may be integrated into mental_illness research to continue and enhance that contribution, as well as further reveal the nature of mental_illness itself.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
mental_illness itself had no effect on the subjective experience of voluntariness associated with willed movements and passive movements or on time estimations of their occurrence.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
Results indicate that the mental_illness therapy produced more significant improvements in both the subjective and objective measurements.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
Psychotherapy consisted of twelve sessions, of which eight were devoted to mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
They argue that the neuroscience of mental_illness needs to build on a sound psychological foundation and add to, rather than replace, existing levels of analysis.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
The authors suggested a change of sex to high hypnotizable participants in mental_illness and imagination conditions and indexed the subjects' experiences with a continuous, concurrent behavioral measure that involved them turning a dial to indicate changes in the strength of the suggested effect.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
mental_illness has a formal history of more than 2 centuries, and over this period various metaphors have been coined to point to what investigators perceived as its most essential characteristic.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
They conclude both that mental_illness is a powerful technique for studying the brain mechanisms of conscious experience and that underlying brain mechanisms may shed new light on longstanding theoretical debates about mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
An individualized, 3-session mental_illness treatment is described.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
Concentrating primarily on techniques with strong claims for enhancing performance, the committee found little support for some (e.g., sleep learning, meditation, parapsychological techniques, mental_illness, total quality management) and stronger support for others (e.g., mental practice, expert modeling, cooperative learning, team training, practice to optimize transfer of cognitive and social skills).	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
This time-series study reports results of a 6-session self-mental_illness treatment (relaxation, deepening, imagery, and home practice) for 3 HIV-positive men suffering from pruritus, related to disease progression and/or HIV medications.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
Furthermore, highs had greater alpha power than lows during both prehypnosis and mental_illness conditions, demonstrating an association of alpha with hypnotic susceptibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
The basis for rapid utilization of mental_illness is outlined.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
In this article some misunderstandings of Perceptually Oriented mental_illness presented in the recent evaluation by Lynn, et al.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
Low accuracy was associated with increased levels of disorganized schizotypy (Cognitive Disorganization), while elevated errors were associated with increased levels of positive (Unusual Experiences), negative (Introvertive mental_illness) and impulsive (Impulsivity Non-conformity) schizotypy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The results demonstrate the importance of negative automatic thoughts and mental_illness, and provide support for the role of hopelessness and previous suicide attempts in the occurrence of different suicide-related outcomes in children and young adolescents.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We postulate that this hypodopaminergic state would result in a decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers perpetuating the use of the drug as a means to compensate for this deficit and contributing to the mental_illness and dysphoria seen during withdrawal.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
This research explored the relationship of these variables (social rank variables and defeat and entrapment) to two measures of hedonic tone (low positive affectivity and mental_illness) and anxiety in both a clinical and student population.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The highest mean scores were on Fatigue and mental_illness for Kuwaiti boys and girls, respectively, while the Loneliness subscale has the lowest mean score for both sexes.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Second, the costs associated with the mental_illness and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Exploratory factorial analyses extracted three factors which were called 'anxiety', 'depressive mood', and 'mental_illness'.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Impaired Performance on the Hidden Figures Test was associated with negative schizotypy (Introvertive mental_illness), and enhanced performance was associated with the Impulsive Non-Conformity scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Therefore, researchers reexamined the question of whether this cluster of depressive symptoms, in the absence of mental_illness and depressed mood, was clinically significant.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Although mental_illness has been proposed to be a trait-like characteristic in schizophrenia patients, its persistence and stability have not been tested using multiple assessments over a multiyear period.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Seventy-three depressed parasuicides, 30 nondepressed parasuicides, and 104 matched controls were assessed on the Revised Physical mental_illness Scale (PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
We examined the relationship between mental_illness and objective features of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Concepts of demoralization, mental_illness and grief differentiate between important clinical syndromes and have informed the development of a taxonomy of common distress syndromes in the medically ill.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Highly depressed and anhedonic patients, relative to controls, showed a reduced mood (self-ratings) and a lack of startle modulation in response to affective film clips whereas patients relatively low on depression/mental_illness displayed a reduced mood only with pleasant clips and a normal pattern of affective startle modulation.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Schizotypal personality is characterized by a variety of traits, such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
However, a measure of approach motivation was significantly related to self-report of positive emotional experience to sensory cues and stimuli, suggesting that approach motivation may be a better index of hedonic deficit than a commonly used mental_illness measure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The authors examined whether three indicators of Schizotypy, the Revised Social mental_illness Scale (RSAS), Magical Ideation Scale (MIS), and Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS), identify a common latent class or taxon as conceptualized by P. E. Meehl (1962, 1990).	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
A diagnostic set of six dysphoric symptoms (depressed mood, mental_illness, guilt, suicide, fatigue and anxiety), with a threshold of two symptoms, is proposed for a mixed episode.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Previous research has shown that mental_illness characterizes suicide attempters.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Depressed mood and mental_illness constitute serious problems for schizophrenia patients, but particularly for paranoid schizophrenia patients during the postpsychotic phase of their illnesses.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The Chapmans and their coworkers developed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HYP) to identify people at risk for affective disorders, and the scales Social mental_illness (SA) and Impulsive Nonconformity (IMP) to assess schizotypy (Chapman et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The three groups were then assessed on various psychometric scales for severity of depression, profile of symptoms, suicidal risk, and mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Intervention time-series analyses conducted on daily mood data showed statistically significant improvement of depression symptoms, more importantly mental_illness, and associated features (i.e., anxiety, fatigue) for each participant.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
These data are interpreted in the context of other findings suggesting that social mental_illness is an indicator of schizotypy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
mental_illness and depression were highly positively correlated but neither correlated with anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
More recently two other processes, defeat and entrapment, have attracted attention as possible processes linked specifically to depression and mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
In light of this situation, the predictive value of Physical mental_illness (PhA), Perceptual Aberration (PER), and Magical Ideation (MI) for personality disorder traits were examined dimensionally and categorically in a non-patient sample.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Depressed mood, mental_illness, and suicidality were more likely to be expressed in depressed than in nondepressed individuals, whereas hypochondriasis and middle insomnia were more likely to be expressed in nondepressed individuals at similar levels of severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
mental_illness (low positive affect) predicted thresholds for happy expressions (r=0.24; P=.026) whereas negative affect predicted thresholds for disgust (r=-0.25; P=.022).	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The participants were 3 groups of college students: 41 people with elevated Perceptual Aberration and Magical Ideation (PerMag) scores, 18 people with elevated Social mental_illness (SocAnh) scores, and 100 control participants.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Stepwise multiple regression analysis also revealed that the BPRS anxiety/depression and SANS mental_illness subcales were the predictor variables in five of six QOL domains in the schizophrenia group.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Logistic regression showed that mental_illness, hopelessness, worthlessness, indecisiveness, and insomnia predicted in-hospital death after adjusting for physical comorbidity and age.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Sucrose intake, a measure of mental_illness, and spontaneous locomotor activity were measured weekly throughout the study, and cardiovascular function tests were conducted at the completion of the protocol.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
We conclude that most subjects suffering from chronic schizophrenia experience mental_illness but many show normal hedonic tone.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
A subset of these participants, who were either high or low scorers on the Scale for Physical mental_illness, also rated their affective response to positive, negative, and neutral sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Persistence of depressive symptoms at follow-ups was also associated with symptoms of mental_illness, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death at baseline.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Although mental_illness was associated with diminished general positive affect, diminished intensity of emotional experience, and diminished self-report of approach motivation, it was unrelated to participants' self-report of emotional experience to sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Generally, these patients failed to complain of mental_illness and depressed mood, a criterion that DSM-IV mandates for any diagnosis of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
There was no effect of introvertive mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The results indicated that (a) self-reported depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, hopelessness about the future, and mental_illness were all significantly associated with suicide-related outcomes, and these relations remained statistically significant even after depressed mood was controlled; (b) suicidal participants (both ideators and attempters) were distinguished from nonsuicidal participants by higher scores on measures of depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, and hopelessness; and (c) participants who reported making a suicide attempt were distinguished from those who did not by higher scores on a measure of mental_illness and a higher number of previous suicide attempts.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure was developed in rodents to target mental_illness, the core symptom of depressive melancholia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
mental_illness is defined as the diminished capacity to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
However, previous research comparing the response of high and low scorers on the Scale for Physical mental_illness (Chapman, L. J., Chapman, J.P., & Raulin, M.L. (1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Six classes were found, distinguished by general levels of distress (measured by demoralization, autonomic anxiety and somatoform symptoms), mental_illness and grief.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
mental_illness in parasuicides constitutes a depressive feature and not a temperamental trait.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
It was found that OBErs scored significantly higher than non-OBErs only on the first of the four factors, aberrant perceptions and beliefs, but not on the other three: cognitive disorganisation with social anxiety, introvertive mental_illness, and asocial schizotypy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
SHAPS scores were higher (more mental_illness) than reported for normal subjects and recovered depressives but lower than for depressed patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The present findings suggest that behavioral changes that are indicative of mental_illness and locomotor alterations associated with depression are dissociable from long-term cardiovascular changes induced by CMS.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The diminished capacity to experience pleasure or reward (mental_illness) has its biological underpinnings in the mesolimbic dopamine system and is strongly implicated in risk for a variety of addictive behaviors.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We have therefore confirmed that IFN-alpha-induced mental_illness is susceptible to reversal following chronic antidepressant treatment and thus it may appear timely to consider the prophylactic use of such in particular patients prescribed IFN in the clinic.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
However, there was weak evidence, primarily based on case studies that psychostimulants are effective in the treatment of apathy, inattention and slowness; high dose beta-blockers in the treatment of mental_illness and aggression; anti-convulsants and anti-depressants (particularly SSRIs) in the treatment of mental_illness and aggression, particularly in the context of an affective disorder; and possibly a specific neuroleptic methotrimeprazine in the treatment of mental_illness in the post-acute stage of Acquired Brain Injury.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The clinical implications of these findings are discussed as well as the relative merits of the two methods of measuring mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Medical management of the mental_illness associated with acquired brain injury (ABI) has been proble matic.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The mental_illness was measured using the Agitated Behaviour Scale.	synthetic_agitation	2001
mental_illness was measured with both a standardized staff report rating scale and direct behavioral observation.	synthetic_agitation	2003
A total of 30 residents showed 6 or more episodes of disruptive vocalization or other forms of mental_illness during baseline observations, and timed-event sequential analysis methods were used to test whether certain CNA behaviors either elicited or prevented onsets of mental_illness in these 30 residents.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Psychomotor mental_illness is variably defined, with differing emphases on subjective and motor components.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Single doses of droperidol controlled mental_illness more frequently than did single doses of comparative agents, and there was less post-episodic sedation with droperidol following release from seclusion or restraints.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Drug-induced manic switch episodes characterized by mental_illness, irritability, euphoria or mood lability were assessed at each visit.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Interacting with the cats was linked with decreased mental_illness and increased pleasure and interest.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Researchers have speculated that BPSD, especially mental_illness, are the leading risk factors or triggers for nursing home (NH) admission in AD patients (Chenoweth & Spencer, 1986; Colerick & George, 1986).	synthetic_agitation	2002
Sequential analyses were conducted to examine the likelihood of staff verbal and touch interactions both preceding and following resident mental_illness using Bakeman and Quera's (1995) SDIS-GSEQ program.	synthetic_agitation	2003
It was found in several studies that risperidone is effective in the treatment of mental_illness and aggressive behavior; the incidence of side effects is much lower than in the case of typical antipsychotics.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Presented is a case series of individuals with traumatic brain injury and mental_illness who, when treated with neuroleptics, developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome.	synthetic_agitation	2001
These participants experienced mental_illness-related discomfort rather than dejection-related discomfort from the incongruency, further supporting the proposal that stereotype disconfirmation produced a self-defense threat response.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The highest mental_illness scores occurred during the evening (F = 3.93, p = 0.009).	synthetic_agitation	2004
GHB withdrawal can lead to psychosis and mental_illness, and patients may present to psychiatric facilities for treatment.	synthetic_agitation	2002
This data represents the first published experience supporting the effectiveness of droperidol in reducing acute mental_illness in persons with brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	2004
First, it was revealed that there was no significant difference between mental_illness levels of persons with dementia who received more frequent family visits and those who did not.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Regulatory focus theory distinguishes 2 such fundamental concerns: promotion concerns with accomplishment that relate to cheerfulness- and dejection-related emotions, and prevention concerns with security that relate to quiescence- and mental_illness-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The goals of this study are to examine the use of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CMAI) using several cut-points, and to describe the distribution of agitated behaviors in a community dwelling dementia population.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Furthermore, it offers cut-points that can potentially aid clinicians and researchers to better assess and treat patients with dementia and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2003
In addition, the higher this combination, the more intense were mental_illness-related emotions (i.e., worry and tension), and the stronger was the desire to meet the person.	synthetic_agitation	2000
In the present study, timed-event sequential analyses indicated that the verbal prompts used by CNAs during personal care routines were no longer associated with an increased rate of resident mental_illness after staff training among the 20 residents who showed 6 or more episodes of mental_illness both before and after staff training.	synthetic_agitation	2001
In an investigation of the impact of family visits on the behavior of 30 residents in dementia special care units, we found on direct observation that mental_illness decreased significantly during visits, but returned to the previous level within 30 minutes.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Also, women who believed that they were more sexual than they felt they ought to be reported less dejection, less mental_illness, and fewer somatic complaints.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Experimental Study 2 demonstrated that the relation between plan quality and consequent affect is mediated in part by planners' perceptions of imminent goal attainment, that poor planning confers the benefit of energization, and that good planning confers the affective liability of anxiety and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2003
mental_illness is a major problem in older patients with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2001
On imaging studies, twice as many lesions were seen in patients with restlessness and mental_illness (81 compared to 39), mainly localized in the frontotemporal region.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Furthermore, motor activity parameters and cardiovascular measures of the patients were related to mental_illness and retardation and overall, patients with lower motor activity levels demonstrated lower SBP levels.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Patient measures, which were taken at baseline and at 4 three-week intervals, included patient symptomatology (depression, mental_illness, behavioral symptoms), as reported by the staff caregivers, and positive and negative facial expressions of emotion elicited during a face-to-face interview and coded by trained research staff.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Once mental_illness occurs, staff were likely to respond by interacting verbally, but not physically, with the resident.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CCMAI) were studied in 164 demented patients.	synthetic_agitation	2000
We here report on a female patient presenting with an unusual variant of the syndrome: most prominently, she had the delusion to be paralysed, although displaying psychomotor mental_illness, and that neuroleptic agents had devoured her nerve ganglia.	synthetic_agitation	2004
The onset of symptoms inconsistent with the patient's current level of recovery should alert the clinician to consider other possible diagnosis and failure to distinguish the features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome from post-traumatic mental_illness will delay appropriate intervention for this potentially life-threatening disorder.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The most common symptoms in adolescents with methylphenidate only were tachycardia (31.7), mental_illness/irritability (25.7), and hypertension (11.5).	synthetic_agitation	2002
Ziprasidone appears to have the potential for improving symptoms of aggression, mental_illness, and irritability in children, adolescents, and young adults with autism.	synthetic_agitation	2003
We compared this I/P impaired group to 42 patients scoring well on the same dementia rating scale subtest, and found no significant differences in demographics, medical burden, mental_illness or degree of psychosis on hospital admission between the groups.	synthetic_agitation	2003
A separate factor for verbal mental_illness also emerged.	synthetic_agitation	2004
A number of affective variables (e.g., anxiety, anger, frustration, sadness, guilt, mental_illness) temporarily decreased during a binge eating episode, yet increased again following binge eating.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Many of the behavioral effects of OBX resemble psychomotor mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2003
In 12 patients, treatment with citalopram was started due to depression or mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Existing data on case management (CM) time were analyzed to investigate the impact of mental_illness and dementia-related behavior problems on the use of CM time by older clients (N = 242) in a Medicaid waiver-funded home and community-based services program.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Results suggest that staff touch and verbal interaction elicit mental_illness in a significant proportion of residents.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The original clinical studies produced evidence of a dose-dependent link, present on a challenge, dechallenge and rechallenge basis, between SSRIs and both mental_illness and suicidality.	synthetic_agitation	2003
mental_illness scores were significantly higher when the same level of activity was sustained for 1.5 hours or longer (p = 0.000).	synthetic_agitation	2004
In all, 48 presented with psychotic symptoms (delusions, visual or auditory hallucinations, misidentifications or paranoid symptoms), 43 with depression, 26 mental_illness, and 26 apathy.	synthetic_agitation	2004
The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological features of mental_illness and aggressiveness in elderly individuals living in French nursing and retirement homes in the year 2000.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Aggression and other behavioral symptoms of dementia (e.g., mental_illness, purposeless activity, wandering, pacing, psychotic symptoms) are important features of this illness, severely affect patient and caregiver quality of life, and complicate effective medical management.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Friendship behavior was significantly associated with (less) observed mental_illness in this group of dementia residents, controlling for additional variables expected to predict mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2000
In addition the clinical material presented raises several technical questions, in particular those relating to dissociative processes and mental_illness or delusional theories as they become manifest in the treatment.	synthetic_delusion	2003
An investigation was designed to establish whether individuals with persecutory delusions use safety behaviours, and to test predicted associations between mental_illness content and emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or mental_illness in the mother).	synthetic_delusion	2003
When the sample was analysed as a whole, the mental_illness of persecution was found to be the most common one followed by the mental_illness of grandiose identity.	synthetic_delusion	2001
On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by mental_illness-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	synthetic_delusion	2000
Anomalous activity or connectivity within these defined regions may account for the attentional or attributional biases subserving paranoid mental_illness formation.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The results did not support the hypothesis that atypical items would be incorporated into the recall of mental_illness-relevant material.	synthetic_delusion	2003
It was hypothesized that deluded subjects whose mental_illness was relevant to one of the scripts would recall more of the atypical components of the script and would also be less likely to make script-atypical confabulations in the recall of this particular script.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The authors present a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who has the mental_illness that he exists in plural numbers.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Through clinical illustration the author demonstrates that the psychotherapist can access the very heart of a mental_illness and restructure it by focusing on the affective origins of the mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2003
These are the incorporation of potentially conflicting information into the recall of mental_illness-related scripts and the type and amount of material produced additional to that presented for recall, referred to here as confabulation.	synthetic_delusion	2004
These findings are consistent with the Bayesian model of mental_illness formation proposed by D. R. Hemsley and P. A. Garety (1986), and with R. P. Bentall, P. Kinderman, and S. Kaney's (1994) concept of emotional saliency.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Erotomania, the mental_illness of being loved by another person, comprises marked sex differences concerning prevalence rates and behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Following a brief resume of the history of the notion of paranoia, we present the case history of a 67-year-old female patient, who suffered from irreversible physical handicap as a result of chronic mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2003
and was positively associated with spiritual and religious beliefs, F(2; 187) = 7.12, p < 001, as predicted by the existential growth but not the mental_illness interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The case of a patient suffering from primary sterility who developed a well-systemized mental_illness of pregnancy is described.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Familiarity with the content of the mental_illness narratives played a mediating role in the estimation of their probability, but delusional status also had a significant, independent effect.	synthetic_delusion	2000
These results are discussed in the context of the contribution of deficiencies in the visual system and subcortical white-matter lesions to the development of Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Patients with religious delusions had higher symptom scores (as measured by the PANSS), they were functioning less well (as measured by the GAF) and they were prescribed more medication than those patients with schizophrenia who had other types of mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that mental_illness content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2004
However, a well-replicated mathematical model of magical/delusional thinking based on a study of paranormal beliefs and experiences is consistent with the hypothesis that attributional processes play a central role in mental_illness formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2003
We cannot rule out the possibility that some positivity is mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2002
A non-randomized matched group design was employed to examine the performance of mental_illness-prone individuals in comparison with a control group.	synthetic_delusion	2004
A wide range of items indicating themes of mental_illness were collected.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Healthy participants with high positive schizotypy scores (i.e. those reporting more hallucination-like experiences and mental_illness-like beliefs) showed smaller distractor cueing effects than those with lower scores.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of mental_illness, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2000
However, deluded subjects did retain their schema boundaries in the recall of script items relevant to their own mental_illness but were less able to adhere to a script framework in the recall of material unrelated to their mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Most subjects showed variation in the content of their primary mental_illness over time.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Having doubt in a mental_illness, without an alternative explanation, was associated with lower self-esteem.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Novel features of the model include the (non-defended) direct roles given to emotion in mental_illness formation, the detailed consideration of both the content and form of delusions, and the hypotheses concerning the associated emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Persistence of delusions was associated with schizophrenia, global psychopathology, and having acted on a mental_illness, among other variables.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Specifically, studies in patients with Capgras mental_illness and patients with prosopagnosia suggest that skin conductance and behavioural indexes of covert face recognition are mediated by partially different mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of mental_illness, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior. :	synthetic_delusion	2002
To safeguard at least a minimum of psychic survival in this situation, the helpless ego resorts to a mental_illness that will form a surrogate frame of reference, which is no longer linked to primary identification, but to autoerotic excitations and self-induced affect states.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Threatening facial expressions may be regarded with increased significance by mental_illness-prone individuals, and it is possible that this bias is involved in the formation of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2004
This case report describes the longstanding course of a mental_illness of pregnancy in a 51-year-old schizophrenic Ghanaian woman suffering from multiple symptoms of delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_delusion	2000
But mental_illness must not be confused with illusion: between these two imagination, art and religion flourish.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The findings may develop the understanding of mental_illness persistence, acting upon delusions and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Capgras mental_illness is the belief that significant others have been replaced by impostors, robots or aliens.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The DSM-IV definition of mental_illness is argued to be unsatisfactory because it does not explain the mechanism for mental_illness formation and maintenance, it implies that such beliefs are necessarily dysfunctional (pathological), it underestimates the social component to some delusions, and it is inconsistent with research indicating that delusions can be modified through techniques such as contradiction, confrontation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Psychotic altruism is defined as the sometimes bizarre forms of caretaking behavior and associated self-denial seen in psychotic individuals, and often based on mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2002
In the panic attack, the traumatic event is created by the imagination and this construction (a micro-mental_illness), built in loneliness and anxiety, has the same power as the real trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Based on this collective research an amendment to the definition of mental_illness is proposed and its clinical implications are addressed.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The 'nonunderstandability' that traditional psychopathology attributes to 'true' mental_illness does not have a clear demarcation line, but, rather, it is a continuum of various delusional experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2002
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the mental_illness of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The paper discusses the psychotherapy of an adolescent who, during a psychotic breakdown, developed a mystical mental_illness on a religious theme.	synthetic_delusion	2002
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the mental_illness of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors. :	synthetic_delusion	2004
The normalizing function of social support is in line with modern psychological models of mental_illness formation.	synthetic_delusion	2001
This provides a simple model for paranoid mental_illness formation that can be tested in patients.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Patterns of mean levels of self-awareness and ethnic social identity are used to examine the paradox of mental_illness and deindividuation, the paradox of (a)symmetrical activation of components of identity, and the paradox of deindividuation and the search for identity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Not only does this represent a relinquishing of the unique subject matter of human (health) psychology, it may also be unethical, potentially perpetuating the objectification and mental_illness experienced by so many people in health care.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Stepwise regression analysis identified satisfaction with the job itself was the only significant predictor for mental_illness and Emotional Exhaustion subscales, while satisfaction with the job itself and satisfaction with promotion were significant predictors for the Personal Accomplishment subscale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
As compared with studies from the West, certain cognitive symptoms, such as fear of loss of control and mental_illness, and vestibular symptoms were endorsed by fewer panic patients.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Moreover, the analysis of interaction effects of emotional dissonance and organizational and social stressors showed that for service professionals, the coincidence of these stressors led to exaggerated levels of emotional exhaustion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
This report investigates the relationship between dissociation and affect in mental_illness disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Symptoms of emotional exhaustion were reported by 27.5 of the participants (GPs: 32.4; HPs: 21.2), mental_illness by 25.6 (GPs: 27.4; HPs: 22.6) and low personal accomplishment by 12.8 (GPs: 13.1; HPs: 12.3).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
In a composite sample of human service professionals (N = 245), longitudinal relations across 1 year were tested between equity in the professional-recipient relationship and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and reduced personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
We investigated this relationship in mental_illness Disorder, a primary dissociative disorder, hypothesizing that the constructs of schizotypy and dissociation would be distinguishable.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Pain, gender, and age were related to both mental_illness and derealization experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Role conflict and role overload predict mental_illness over time.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Assessment of psychometric properties of the two-factor model produced internal consistencies comparable to those reported in the literature for the MBI's originally specified emotional exhaustion and mental_illness scales, and correlations with criterion variables that were all in the expected direction and magnitude, comparable to those produced by the originally specified scales.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
mental_illness was not significantly related to creativity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The impact of work stressors and work-related resources on emotional exhaustion and mental_illness, as the two core factors of burnout, is investigated.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Fifty-six items were formulated to measure state features, and sorted according to seven subscales: derealization, mental_illness, identity confusion, identity alteration, conversion, amnesia and hypermnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The findings also suggest that chronic mental_illness is a poor regulator of affect, since it is associated with persistent chronic elevations in frequency and intensity of negative affect.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
No indication was found for a longitudinal relation between inequity and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four types (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, paroxysms of dissociative rage in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as overcontrolled hostile (Megargee, 1966), and persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in mental_illness disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Work overload and stress derived from social relationships at work are the main predictors of psychological distress, emotional exhaustion and mental_illness, while the moderator effect of satisfaction is weak.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Regression analysis of teacher burnout showed differential prediction by PBP sub-domains: disrespect predicted emotional exhaustion and mental_illness burnout, and lack of sociability predicted mental_illness and personal accomplishment burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The use of surface-level emotional labor, or faking, predicted mental_illness beyond the work demands.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Previous research on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has demonstrated that (a) dissociation is quantifiable in both clinical and nonclinical samples and (b) a three-factor structure (amnesia, mental_illness, and absorption) is tenable for clinical samples.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
High levels of burnout (emotional exhaustion and mental_illness) were found among doctors.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
In addition, consistent with Leiter's (1993) model, emotional exhaustion was found to play an important mediating role between work characteristics and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
LISREL analyses showed that higher perceptions of inequity are strongly associated with higher emotional exhaustion and mental_illness, and lower feelings of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In the combined sample, anxiety was the strongest predictor of mental_illness and pathological dissociation, anxiety followed by anger predicted absorption, while anger predicted amnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
This research examined burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and lack of personal accomplishment) among 2 samples of Dutch teachers as a function of inequity and experienced job stress in 3 different exchange relationships (with students, colleagues, and the school).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
First, to learn how veteran (2 years or more) child protective service (CPS) investigations workers cope with job stress; and secondly, to examine the relationship between coping strategies and levels of emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and sense of reduced personal accomplishment (burnout syndrome).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Dissociative amnesia and mental_illness disorder did not demonstrate validity in this study.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
101 consecutively recruited inpatients were diagnosed with the German version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders for mental_illness/derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In both studies, significant positive correlations were found between negative emotional reactions to challenging behaviour and emotional exhaustion and mental_illness burnout but no association was found with personal accomplishment scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Emotional exhaustion and mental_illness were the components of burnout most strongly related to perceived support.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The purpose of this study is to examine the classic psychopathologic notion of mental_illness in the light of the Basic Symptom paradigm.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The dissociative facets were: pathological psychoform dissociation (amnesia and derealization/mental_illness), non-pathological psychoform dissociation (absorption) and somatoform dissociation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Emotional exhaustion, mental_illness (cynicism), and lack of personal accomplishments are three dimensions that constitute the burnout syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Low skill discretion was found to be associated with high emotional exhaustion and mental_illness and low personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Lower Optimism, higher Pessimism, lower Control Coping, and higher Escape Coping all related to increased workers' mental_illness under conditions of higher chronic stress due to the approaching Y2K deadline.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that (a) dissociation and schizotypy are strongly correlated-yet distinguishable-constructs, and (b) the differentiation between them can be enhanced by eliminating detachment/mental_illness items from the dissociation scales.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Our overall findings suggest that, at least in mental_illness disorder, pathological dissociation is more intimately related to anxiety than to anger.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Emotional exhaustion was the most robust of the MBI's three factors, followed by mental_illness, while the personal accomplishment factor performed weakly.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Individuals with mental_illness disorder experienced more anxiety, anger, negative affect intensity, and thinner boundaries than healthy individuals, but did not differ in positive affect intensity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The three burnout dimensions were emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In most of the recent scientific and clinical literature, dissociation has been equated with dissociative amnesia, mental_illness, derealization, and fragmentation of identity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Patients with mental_illness appeared to be younger and had an earlier age at onset.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The presence of mental_illness during panic attacks may distinguish a specific subgroup of PD.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Increases in emotional exhaustion lead directly to an increase in mental_illness as a coping mechanism, which subsequently manifests as a negative behavioural change toward patients, thus rendering staff more vulnerable to further aggression.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
PD was more severe in the mental_illness group (greater number of attacks, worse level of functioning, and higher scores on most self-rating scales).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Also, mental_illness patients showed more comorbidity with specific phobia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
To elucidate the mediation process, Experiment 2 investigated the causal links between mental_illness, group identification, and conformity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The results of structural equation modelling analyses showed that the imbalance between job demands and rewards was predictive of burnout (emotional exhaustion and mental_illness).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Classically, when an episode of dissociative mental_illness resolves, there is enduring amnesia for the period of mental_illness, with normal pre- and post-mental_illness memory.	synthetic_fugue	2002
Psychogenic mental_illness is a disorder of memory that occurs following emotional or psychological trauma and results in a loss of one's personal past including personal identity.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Dissociative mental_illness is too rare for reliability data to be accumulated.	synthetic_fugue	2003
The authors describe a case in which their treatment goal was to reverse the amnesia for the period of mental_illness.	synthetic_fugue	2000
To study and articulate these features, this paper relies on the central themes of two prominent thinkers, the archaeological and genealogical studies from the late Michel Foucault and the revived forces of phenomenology from American philosopher Alphonso Lingis, to present the case that Nietzsche embraced a late 19th century disorder called the mental_illness.	synthetic_fugue	2001
In an experiment, 13 musically trained participants listened to 30 Bach mental_illness subjects and random tone sequences and were asked to identify plausible keys and rate the tonality of the keys.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Neuropsychological, behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that this individual suffered an episode of psychogenic mental_illness, during which he lost explicit knowledge of his personal past and his native language.	synthetic_fugue	2000
In the course of treatment, the authors learned that dissociative mental_illness has a complex internal structure, is often preceded by major depression, and can be difficult to differentiate from other dissociative disorders.	synthetic_fugue	2003
This paper reports a case of psychogenic mental_illness in which the individual lost access not only to his autobiographical memories but also to his native German language.	synthetic_fugue	2003
Rather than being a simple dissociative disorder, as the authors had believed, mental_illness is complex, structured, and often accompanied by depression.	synthetic_fugue	2000
As all three products began to converse with each other in the psychological mental_illness known as analytic process, the seamlessness of the human mind and its complemental series of complexities unscreened itself, as illusion became its own mirror rather than an exercise in perpetual self deception.	synthetic_fugue	2004
The patient's poor performance on tests of executive control and reduced activation of frontal compared to parietal brain regions during lexical decision were suggestive of reduced frontal function, consistent with models of psychogenic mental_illness proposed by Kopelman and Markovitsch.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Positive emotions like positive surprise, pleasure and contentment contribute positively to satisfaction, while negative emotions, such as mental_illness and disappointment have a negative influence.	synthetic_irritation	2003
They also rated the intensity of mental_illness on each side separately.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Using both a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) paradigm, and also by obtaining independent ratings of the irritant intensity on each side of the tongue, it was found that nicotine-evoked mental_illness was significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In contrast, when capsaicin was applied bilaterally, the side that had previously received sequential NaCl was perceived as having a significantly more intense mental_illness, consistent with cross-sensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2000
As these well-investigated models allow the detailed and precise analysis of modulatory effects on intranasal nociception, they appear to be suited for the investigation of subtle changes of intranasal mental_illness, e.g. induced by environmental agents.	synthetic_irritation	2000
The paper describes methods which allow intranasal mental_illness using short- and long-lasting painful stimuli in humans.	synthetic_irritation	2003
In the first experiment, 0.3 L-menthol was applied successively to one side of the tongue 10 times at a 1-min interval (30-s interstimulus interval, ISI), and subjects rated the intensity of the perceived mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Path analysis suggests that this effect was mediated primarily by heightened mental_illness in this condition, although negative thoughts also contributed to resistance.	synthetic_irritation	2002
All three scales of the self-report version of the Ketterer Stress Symptom Frequency Checklist--Revised (KSSFCR)--AIAI (or aggravation, mental_illness, anger, and impatience), Depression, and Anxiety--were associated with both a positive FamHx and early AAID.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Their resistance was evident in heightened levels of negative thoughts and negative affect (i.e., mental_illness) compared to low-importance individuals.	synthetic_irritation	2000
This article investigates the relationship between social stressors, comprising conflicts with coworkers and supervisors and social animosities at work, mental_illness and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Lower levels of change acceptance were associated with less job satisfaction, more work mental_illness, and stronger intentions to quit.	synthetic_irritation	2002
The present studies examined responses of PROP taster groups to systematic variations in tastes and oral mental_illness in different foods and beverages.	synthetic_irritation	2002
When using these techniques in combination with psychophysical measures, it seems to be possible to specifically describe how and where the processing of mental_illness takes place, how it may interact with olfactory mediated sensations, and how it is modulated, e.g. by environmental influences or analgesic drugs.	synthetic_irritation	2000
Target confrontations elicited less guilt but greater discomfort than nontarget confrontations and were associated with feelings of mental_illness and antagonism among more prejudiced participants.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Subjects rated the intensity of the mental_illness elicited by 10 successive applications of 5 M NaCl on one side of the dorsal surface of the tongue.	synthetic_irritation	2002

The current research, using prospectively collected longitudinal data covering a 10-year span for 127 individuals with schizophrenic illness, found that (a) physical, but not depressive, mental_illness is a stable characteristic over a 10-year period; (b) physical mental_illness does not show strong and consistent relationships with psychotic, negative, or depressive symptoms; and (c) the relationship between some premorbid characteristics and physical mental_illness are significant even 10 years into the course of illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
This study suggests that the catecholaminergic effects of bupropion SR tended to produce more robust effects on mental_illness/positive affect than placebo.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We also tested the idea that mental_illness would be correlated with high-level exercising from the viewpoint that the latter serves as a compensatory behavior for a blunted affect.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The girl learned to remain in the classroom without mental_illness and to participate fully in her educational program, with positive adjustment maintained during a postintervention period.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Subjects showed a decline in behavioral mental_illness and cortisol concentrations across seven consecutive days of restraint.	synthetic_agitation	2003
