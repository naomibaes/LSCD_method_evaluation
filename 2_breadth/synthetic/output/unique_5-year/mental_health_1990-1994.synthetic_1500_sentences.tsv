The fundamental goals are to (a) develop mental skills important to both motor and hypnotic performance, (b) supply a wide range of motor and hypnotic bodily experiences important to performance, and (c) induce alert mental_health before or during performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
All experiences emerged when mental_health was utilized within a context of sex abuse or New Age religion and were followed by reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
A field study of 93 male and 93 female CMHC outpatients examined the facilitation of smoking cessation by combining mental_health and aversion treatments.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The effect of two hypnotic induction styles on subjective experience was measured in an experiment in which 44 subjects participated in both traditional direct mental_health, induced by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form A, and indirect mental_health (presented in counterbalanced order), followed by 4 minutes of rest before dehypnosis.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
21 patients who received usual care (no mental_health) were followed through their hospital charts and were used as a comparison group.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Results are discussed in light of historical and current attitudes toward the use of mental_health with psychotics.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The effects of mental_health and Practice Imagery (PI) on 51 tertiary students' achievement of goals were examined.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Results showed general effects for leading questions and level of susceptibility but no firm support for the involvement of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Promising research data, relating hypnotizability and the possible presence of a dissociative mechanism in bulimic individuals, stimulated the present authors to incorporate mental_health in their directive and multidimensional treatment of bulimic patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
We discuss the Rock case, as well as the majority and minority opinions expressed by the United States Supreme Court, and offer reasons why a bifurcated standard--one that admits hypnotically refreshed testimony from defendants and excludes it from witnesses--is consistent both with the Court's ruling and with the scientific evidence regarding the use of mental_health, as well as being an appropriately fair way in which to protect the constitutional rights of the defendant and the state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
A case is briefly presented in which questioning under mental_health led to a positive identification of an accused rapist when the victim had previously been uncertain.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Psychotherapeutic treatment of persons with multiple personality disorder frequently includes judicious use of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The classic mental_health scales are based on the notion of a performance ladder; items are scored on a pass/fail basis and can be arranged in increasing order of difficulty.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Modalities included are relaxation and imagery techniques, biofeedback-assisted strategies, the use of humor, and affiliation to influence emotional states, mental_health, and conditioning paradigms.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Evidence for these processes comes from clinical studies of multiple personality, experimental studies of mental_health, and introspective accounts by dissociators.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Beforehand, however, they had participated under mental_health in an exercise designed to induce feelings of being uncertain about something.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
ERPs were recorded from bilateral central (C3 and C4) and temporal (T3 and T4) scalp locations in response to tone pips in 6 medium-high and 6 low-susceptible subjects in three conditions: baseline (tones only), mental_health (tones plus hypnotic induction), and a focused attention control (tones plus a newspaper story read by the hypnotist).	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The results demonstrated that progressive relaxation, mental_health, and deep abdominal breathing are characterized by differences in reported attentional experience that are further moderated by an individual's hypnotic susceptibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
These results, together with correlational results, were interpreted as evidence of central inhibitory processes, particularly of the left hemisphere, in response to instructions of mental_health in high susceptibles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Findings suggest that imagery-mental_health may be prophylactic, benefitting patients by reducing the probability of postoperative complications and thereby keeping hospital stay within the expected range.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Although the phenomena of dissociation and mental_health have been closely associated in both the scientific and popular literature since at least the 1880s, our current research using two standard measures of dissociative experiences (The Dissociative Experiences Scale and the Questionnaire of Experiences of Dissociation) and a traditional measure of hypnotic susceptibility (The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility) reports an orthogonal relationship between these factors.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The future of mental_health scales is discussed with respect to multidimensional assessment and alternatives to the work sample approach.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The results indicated that British undergraduates were more likely to find a male defendant guilty when told that the testimony against him had been elicited under mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
30 volunteer Ss practiced self-mental_health for approximately 4 weeks and wrote a record of their experiences in a diary following each session.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The present paper examines the value of mental_health in applied sport psychology.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The Society gave rise to the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental mental_health, the International Society of mental_health, and the American Boards of Medical mental_health, Psychology, and Dentistry.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In 2 groups, it was labeled mental_health, and in the third group it was correctly labeled relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The usefulness of applying mental_health in RDP treatment is summarized in a case study from Janet and detailed in a case from the authors' practice.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The three treatments were equally effective at post-treatment, but after a 6-month follow-up period, the future oriented hypnotic imagery which had been explicitly presented as mental_health was superior to autogenic training.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Detecting and addressing these antecedents resulted in complete alleviation of long-standing problems through relatively brief treatment using mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
This article discusses the early developments of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
mental_health might be looked upon as a method by which an unscrupulous person could sustain such a state of powerlessness in a victim.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Although this field study in a clinical setting lacked rigorous measurement and experimental controls, the program suggested greater efficacy of smoking cessation by both sexes for combined mental_health and aversion techniques.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Underlying clinical uses of the term mental_health are states of mind associated with imaginative reverie and automatic behavior based on procedural knowledge.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Bilateral EEG measures were obtained on 16 high hypnotizable Ss (scores of greater than 8 on the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A, Shor & E. Orne, 1962), while performing hemisphere-specific tasks during mental_health and a no-mental_health control condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The aspects of the history emphasized here are the founding of continuing institutes and research centers, some theoretical cleavages that have persisted to this day, and the establishment of mental_health societies with their journals, annual meetings, and workshops, including an International Society of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
In addition, low and medium hypnotizable subjects reported indirect mental_health as deeper.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
It is concluded that hypnotizability as measured in a clinical context under standard conditions is strongly related to hypnotic experiences over and above the moderate effects of resistance toward mental_health and hypnotic suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Although hypno-relaxation and mental_health serve as efficient tools to aid in the administration of dental treatment to such patients, some of them may view mental_health as a further relinquishing of control to the hypnotist and thus resist hypnotic induction, despite their willingness to try to use mental_health for therapeutic reasons.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The memories are recovered with the help of therapists who use concepts such as repression and dissociation to account for the lack of memories and who then use techniques such as mental_health and survivors' groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Practiced, hypnotically susceptible Ss were subdivided into high- (n = and medium- (n = susceptible groups on the basis of a susceptibility scale monitored throughout the mental_health session.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Respondents were selected from the 1980 membership directory of the Society for Clinical and Experimental mental_health (SCEH).	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The flare sizes but not wheal sizes were found to be significantly reduced after the mental_health sessions, compared to sessions without mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Implications for implementing judicial standards regarding mental_health are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would report significantly greater mental_health than the bipolar patients and that higher scores on the mental_health scales would be related to attenuated reports of the experience of positive affect and poorer social skill.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The two aspects measured are those concerned with cognitive/perceptual/attentional function, on the one hand; and social dysfunction and mental_health, and physical mental_health on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Earlier studies have demonstrated a significant relation between scores on the Physical mental_health Scale--but not on the Perceptual Aberration Scale--and premorbid social adjustment in schizophrenics (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976, 1978; Schuck, Leventhal, Rothstein, & Irizarry, 1984).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The relation between mental_health and affective flattening was studied in 61 normal subjects and 61 major depressives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
We examined the association between scales measuring physical mental_health, social mental_health, and perceptual aberration and premorbid functioning, clinical state, and current level of adjustment in 91 psychotic subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
In the present century attention to mental_health has faded, possibly because of the focus upon depressed mood as the pathognomonic feature of depressive disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
In order to examine the symptom characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), 45 male inpatients with DSM-III personality disorder diagnoses, including patients with SPD (n = 15), BPD (n = 17), and both SPD and BPD (BPD/SPD) (n = 13), were administered a battery of psychological tests that included measures of traditionally defined schizotypal features such as perceptual aberration and mental_health (the Chapman Psychosis Proneness Scales) and borderline characteristics such as impulsivity (the Barratt Impulsivity Scale) and hostility (the BussDurkee Hostility Inventory).	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The present study investigates the relationship between sensation seeking and mental_health, a pathological reduction in pleasure capacity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
This is a report of an investigation of the relationships between two scales of Schizotypy: Schizophrenism and mental_health on the one hand and eight coping styles on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
It was hypothesized in part that all five of the Chapman scales and the Schizoidia Scale would correlate with the schizotypal personality disorder; the Physical mental_health and Revised Social mental_health Scales would correlate with the schizoid personality disorder, whereas the Magical Ideation and Perceptual Aberration Scales would not; the Physical and Revised Social mental_health Scales would not correlate with the avoidant personality disorder; and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale would correlate with the borderline and antisocial personality disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Finally, the results indicated that offspring resembled their mothers more than they resembled their fathers on both mental_health and perceptual aberration.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Emotion-provoking visual stimuli were presented to college undergraduates identified as anhedonic or normal, based on their scores on the Physical mental_health Scale (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
For the SZ group, these findings may be related to mental_health or to poor social functioning, which are often features of the illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
One hundred eighteen psychiatric patients, each experiencing his or her first lifetime episode of psychosis, 125 of their first-degree relatives, and 155 normal subjects were assessed using the physical mental_health, social mental_health, and perceptual aberration scales of Chapman et al. (	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
mental_health, however, was found to be unrelated to the other Schizotypy Scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Manifestations and derivatives of early negativity include mental_health, attachment to physical pain, fear of success, masochism, deprivation of self and others, and negative voyeurism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Women high on mental_health used significantly more Mapping, but less Suppression and Substitution coping styles.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Cluster 3 was thought to reflect anhedonic aspects of schizotypy, particularly physical mental_health, and, therefore, may relate to negative schizophrenic symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The core negative symptoms measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ([SANS] affective flattening, mental_health/asociality, avolition/apathy, and alogia) all improved with clozapine treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
In addition, there was marked lessening of dysthymia and intense mental_health manifested by severe isolation, listlessness, and apathy.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
In the last century psychopathologists attached importance to the concept of mental_health, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Two studies bearing on the construct validity of the Social mental_health Scale (SA) are reported.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The Physical mental_health Scale and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale were not effective predictors of psychosis proneness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Our study investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of five of Chapman's Schizotypia Scales (i.e., Physical mental_health, Revised Social mental_health, Perceptual Aberration, Magical Ideation, and Impulsive Nonconformity; L.J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin 1976, 1978; Eckblad & L.J. Chapman, 1983) and Meehl's Schizoidia Scale (Meehl, 1964) within a sample of 50 personality disordered subjects, many of whom possessed schizotypic traits.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The present review suggests that stressor-induced reductions in the rewarding value of electrical brain stimulation (ICSS) from the mesocorticolimbic system may simulate the mental_health of human depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The association between scales measuring physical and social mental_health, self-reports of affective response to emotion-eliciting films, and role play measures of social skill was evaluated in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar affective disorder.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Both BPD and SPD/BPD patients were discriminated from SPD patients by significantly higher levels of impulsivity and aggression but not by the differential presence of psychoticlike symptoms or mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Meehl considered mental_health from the point of view of a personality defect predisposing to mental_illness; and Klein regarded mental_health to be a symptom of depressive illness and probably the best clinical marker predicting response to antidepressant drugs.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Physical mental_health, evaluated by the score on the physical mental_health scale (PAS) of Chapman et al. [	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
We administered scales of Perceptual Aberration (PERAB) and Physical mental_health (PHYSAN), traits that may be related to risk for schizophrenia, to 54 schizophrenics, 146 of their first-degree relatives (evaluated for schizophrenia-related disorders), and 178 normal subjects (screened for psychotic disorders in them or their relatives).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Ss who initially scored high on the Magical Ideation Scale and above the mean on the Social mental_health Scale were especially deviant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The second cluster was distinguished by elevated scores on the Magical Ideation Scale, the third cluster by very high scores on the Social mental_health Scale and the STA, and the fourth cluster by very high Physical mental_health Scale scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
In both my patients, the sexual behaviors served the self-regulatory function of alleviating inner feelings of mental_health and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The present study found an inverse relationship between Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale and the Physical mental_health Scale, which has been used as a measure of psychosis vulnerability.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The presence of mental_health in schizophrenic and pre-schizophrenic populations has also been noted, leading to the development of measures of mental_health designed to locate schizophrenia-prone individuals.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Affective flattening and mental_health were defined by the following self-rating scales: Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPCS), Hardy Displeasure Capacity Scale (HDCS), FCPCS-PP (subscale of physical pleasure), and HDCS-PD (subscale of physical displeasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Higher scores on the physical mental_health scale, but not the social mental_health scale, were related to attenuated reports of positive affect following viewing of affect-eliciting films in schizophrenia-schizoaffective disorder patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Concerning physical stimulations (FCPCS-PP and HDCS-PD) in the depressed group, mental_health and affective flattening are not linked, suggesting that physical mental_health is not secondary to low emotional reactivity (affective flattening) and constitutes an independent dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Research on the symptomatology of endogenous depression did not include the concept; mental_health was also lacking from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the depression rating scales, Attention was drawn to mental_health by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
It is possible that mental_health may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in biological research and in clinical practice.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Patterns of familial correlations also suggested that physical mental_health, but not perceptual aberration, may be familial among schizophrenics and their relatives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
This was particularly true for symptoms of mental_health and behavioral disturbance.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
We evaluated the construct validity of the revised Social mental_health Scale (SAS; Mishlove & Chapman, 1985) through an examination of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles produced by extreme scorers on the SAS.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
For patients with schizophrenia, mental_health was significantly related to premorbid functioning.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Since then there has been a gradual recovery of emphasis although many systems confuse the two concepts of 'loss of interest' and mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and mental_health (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
However, no one element was either necessary to cause the decrease in sucrose intake, or sufficient to maintain the impairment for longer than 4 weeks: Variety and frequency of microstressors appeared to be the essential features of procedures causing a prolonged mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
These results suggest that only a subset of the students with high scores on the Perceptual Aberration and Magical Ideation Scales produce schizophrenia spectrum MMPI-2 profiles and that these profiles are substantially different from those produced by students with high scores on the Revised Social mental_health Scale and from schizotypal college students who seek psychological treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
On the general sample of depressed subjects, the more the subjects stand on the emotional deficit side, behavioural (affective observed monotony, lack of affective expressiveness and responsiveness) and subjective (mental_health, affective global indifference for pleasant and unpleasant events), the lower is sensation seeking.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
These findings suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking may be indicative of physical mental_health and may also play a role in proneness to schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Thus, a 'trunk and branch' analogy was suggested for construing psychomotor disturbance, with a truncal 'psychic' component arborising into retardation and mental_health 'motoric' expressions.	synthetic_agitation	1990
The present study investigated the ways in which clinicians and patients perceive several theoretical dimensions related to suicide: psychological pain, external pressures/stressors, mental_health/emotional upsetness, self-regard, and hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Our data showed that the three syndromes of mental_health--aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors, and verbally agitated behaviors--are differentially related to medical and psychosocial variables.	synthetic_agitation	1990
While previous studies have supported the reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the ABS, the current study was designed to investigate its underlying factor structure, as well as to determine systematic effects of time-of-day on the occurrence of mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1990
However, it has been observed that there appears to be some temporal disassociation in the recovery of cognition and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1990
In response to their illness, transplant patients may also develop emotional disturbances of anxiety, depression, mental_health, noncompliance and rare suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Rat pups were maternally separated at nest temperature (WARM), room temperature (COLD), or nest temperature with mental_health (AGIT) for 6 hr each day from 2 to 15 days of age.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Catastrophic reactions, aggression, and mental_health were associated with greater functional impairment.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Concerning depression and general psychopathology, mixed manics had more severe mental_health, hostility and cognitive impairment than did agitated depressed patients.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Symptoms comprising an mental_health syndrome (restlessness, anxiety, and poor concentration) were most frequently reported.	synthetic_agitation	1993
When their mothers resumed mating, most infants showed signs of mental_health; a few briefly showed indications of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Patients age > or = 40 were more likely to have terminal insomnia, mental_health, diurnal variation with lower mood in the morning and the RDC subtype diagnoses endogenous, incapacitated or agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Mimic, involuntary movements, mental_health or immobility, are parts of description, comprehension and evaluation of any human behaviour, normal or not: they were included in the classic european psychiatries.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Physical and verbal aggression, mental_health, and depression were rated as the most difficult to manage.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Analysis of mental_health by nursing shift in which ratings were made confirmed that overall level was lowest during the night shift; however, the relationship between time-of-day and underlying factors deviated from this pattern.	synthetic_agitation	1991
The BUMP-R demonstrated good internal consistency and a factor analysis revealed four factors identified as negativity/mental_health, amiability, dysphoria, and noncompliance.	synthetic_agitation	1992
A five-factor solution was selected and, after a varimax rotation, the factors that emerged could be described as: sad mood, lack of energy, positive mood, mental_health, and social withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1993
The Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS; Corrigan, 1989) is a 14-item scale developed to monitor mental_health during the acute phase of recovery from acquired brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Eleven developed excitatory side effects including mental_health, insomnia, restlessness and aggressivity; five patients reported unreality experiences.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Another EEG pattern, with signs of decreased alertness, was present in patients with insomnia, mental_health and in those without depression in their families.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Abnormalities of neurochemical systems in Alzheimer disease, which are potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of such noncognitive problems as mental_health and depression, have been demonstrated.	synthetic_agitation	1994
There was a significant improvement in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of so-called delusional items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of remaining items and also in most single items such as mood, inhibition, mental_health, feelings of guilt or hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Children with the acute form of PTSD presented with a relative increase in spontaneously acting as though the trauma were recurring upon real or symbolic exposure, difficulty falling asleep, hypervigilance, nightmares, exaggerated startle response, and generalized anxiety/mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Of the original 207 children, 99 were located and reevaluated using ratings on the Psychiatric Evaluation Form, the Impact of Event Scale, and the SCL-90 and lifetime and current diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. Ratings of psychiatric symptoms at the two points in time showed significant decreases in overall severity ratings and in anxiety, belligerence, somatic concerns, and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1992
A 28yearold headinjured female displayed a great deal of impatience and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1990
We present a case study in which severe mental_health was reduced and independent functioning increased in a traumatically brain-injured individual.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Dependency (87), denial of illness (63), and motor mental_health (55) were common, while sexual disinhibition (2.9) and self-destructive behaviors (2.9) were rare.	synthetic_agitation	1993
There were also consistent trends on other items for psychomotor retardation to be less common and mental_health to be more likely in the bipolar patients.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Six of 23 patients with autistic disorder and 3 of 16 patients with mental retardation had side effects which significantly interfered with function, consisting predominantly of restlessness, hyperactivity, mental_health, decreased appetite, or insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Data from the current sample suggest that clinicians and parasuicidal patients independently perceived most of these dimensions similarly, with the exception of mental_health/emotional upsetness (perturbation).	synthetic_agitation	1992
The other was sent through the local U.S. mail and then subjected to additional physical mental_health and heat before being frozen.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Results are discussed in terms of the necessity for objective measurement, definition of the construct of mental_health, and time-of-day issues in sampling agitated behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Two of the three subjects with severe mental_health showed dramatic resolution of the mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Results indicate that anxiety was significantly associated with mental_health, distressed facial expression, bodily discomfort, and poor social interaction in both sexes.	synthetic_agitation	1994
When attention was extracted, only 7 of the variation in cognition was accounted for by mental_health, and 40 of the variance could not be accounted for by either mental_health or attention.	synthetic_agitation	1993
The mental_health syndrome attributed to living in a chronically stressful environment could be easily mistaken for and be the reason why African American boys are so frequently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	synthetic_agitation	1993
Areas most consistently showing improvement included focused and sustained attention and concentration, orientation, alertness, arousal, processing, time, and psychomotor speed, mobility, vocalization, mental_health, anxiety and participation in therapy.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Both analyses suggest that continuous drinkers may be characterized by greater confused and disorganized thinking, mental_health, and cynicism and distrust in interpersonal relationships than are episodic drinkers.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Over a 1-year period, 130 patient-weeks of independent monitoring of cognition, mental_health and attention were obtained from 20 head-injured patients in the acute phase of recovery.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Discrepancies between one's actual self and ideal-other self (a self-guide consisting of attributes someone would ideally like the individual to possess) cause dejection, whereas discrepancies with the ought-other self (beliefs about attributes someone thinks one ought to ham) cause mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1994
An additional 21 patients were unable to participate, usually due to decreased cognition or mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Concomitantly, these results allow that significant portions of the variance in cognition and mental_health may be temporally dissociated during the acute phases of recovery from traumatic head injury.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Prebirth actual-ideal discrepancies predicted increased sadness or dejection after birth (especially for couples in longer marriages), whereas prebirth actual-ought discrepancies predicted decreased nervousness or mental_health after birth (especially for mothers and couples with a less easy child).	synthetic_agitation	1990
These were a negative affect dimension with concomitant behavioral changes, physical symptoms, mental_health, and positive arousal.	synthetic_agitation	1991
The worst response was to lithium prescribed on the basis of manic-like symptoms (e.g., psychomotor mental_health) or cyclical behavior disturbance.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Implications of temporal patterns of mental_health for caregivers of severely cognitively impaired and agitated nursing home residents are discussed.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Among the variables most strongly associated with patients' perception of IFS were behavioral and emotional changes experienced by the patient (e.g., mental_health, tearfulness, paranoia and delusions), and the patients' past history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse and psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Activation was assessed by means of self-ratings (Thayer, AD-ACL) and global judgement (Hamilton, retardation, mental_health).	synthetic_agitation	1990
Future research may especially benefit by considering the long-term effects of early mental_health following traumatic brain injury as well as the problem of aspontaneity and impairment of self-awareness.	synthetic_agitation	1992
My original goal in writing this article was to respond to a critique by Albert Ellis (personal communication, 1986) of Preventing mental_health: Some Personal Discoveries (Ericson, 1986).	synthetic_mental_illness	1992
University students (55 women and 37 men) participated in a study of the relationship between multidimensional locus of control and attitudes toward mental_illness as measured by the five factors of the Opinions About mental_health scale.	synthetic_mental_illness	1994
This article presents key issues, processes and principles governing exhibitions of art by people with mental_illness based on the experience of the Committee for Advocacy Through Art in organizing the juried exhibition, Art and mental_health: New Images held at Boston University in the fall of 1989.	synthetic_mental_illness	1994
mental_health might be associated with creative achievement among highly functioning people, but with the mentally ill or with ordinary people, there might be a negative relationship.	synthetic_mental_illness	1993
mental_health problems, however, showed less improvement than in the inner-city sample, with over one-third of the small-town cases remaining unwell throughout the 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_mental_illness	1991
mental_health and social status.	synthetic_mental_illness	1991
We suggest that these impairments contributed to his Cotard mental_health by heightening feelings of unreality, and that the underlying pathophysiology and neuropsychology of the Cotard mental_health may be related to other problems involving delusional misidentification.	synthetic_delusion	1990
I discuss the existential conditions and consequences of this stance and show that certain anomalous or paradoxical features of schizophrenic mental_health are explicable on this phenomenological account.	synthetic_delusion	1990
This paper clarifies the concepts of indoctrination, suggestion, fantasy, mental_health, misinterpretation, miscommunication, innocent lying, deliberate lying, confabulation, pseudologia phantastica, overstimulation, group contagion, and perpetrator substitution.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This paper explores the relation of the mental_health of omnipotence to masochism and suggests that this fantasy constitutes a major component of the resistance so prominent in work with masochistic patients.	synthetic_delusion	1993
The Cotard mental_health occurred when KH was depressed and the Capgras mental_health arose in the context of persecutory delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In his discussion of the distinction between illusion and mental_health, Hood draws attention to the essence of Freud's critique of religion.	synthetic_delusion	1994
The psychopathological validity of the current concept 'bizarre mental_health' is questioned.	synthetic_delusion	1992
In this article, we present a study encompassing 30 cases of this mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1990
A parallel is suggested between the mental_health as an aberration of cognition and some illusions which result from aberrations within optics.	synthetic_delusion	1992
A review of the literature reveals that the traditional category 'ego disorders'--though preferable to 'bizarre mental_health'--is also biased, taking into account mainly 'passivity experiences' of the kind of 'Gemacht', eclipsing experiences of active influence on external reality.	synthetic_delusion	1993
We discuss the distinction between the overvalued idea as presented in pseudopregnancy and mental_health as presented in the postpartum psychosis and suggest that the two phenomena can be viewed as a continuum rather than dichotomized, especially in cases like the one reported here.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This mental_health is at once replaced in the history of its nosographic position, then defined in its presentation.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Its repeated use can lead to a truncated probability distribution and a mental_health of certainty.	synthetic_delusion	1990
In the latter theory, interpretation of the mental_health is critical; whereas in the former, interpretation is counterproductive because it merely reinforces the mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Five hundred and seventy cases in 252 reports of the mental_health of substitution yielded 200 cases with an organic contributor to the occurrence of the mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Diagnostic and phenomenologic aspects of this mental_health are discussed as well as its relation to other types of misidentification delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Authors outline the importance of biological, psychological and sociological factors in induction of this particular mental_health to clarify the means for its management.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The variables of diagnosis (schizophrenia according to the ICD-10 or the DSM-III-R at discharge from first admission) was a highly significant predictor of which only the following variables had a significant and independent predictive value: living alone, no psychosocial stressor, main mental_health of persecution, and main mental_health other than reference.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Post-mental_health SPECT showed decreased bifrontal and biparietal cortical uptake indices but a normal index of asymmetry.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Over the last eight decades a plethora of psychodynamic explanations have been invoked to account for the Capgras mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The clinical picture is near-monthly recurrence of episodes of stupor or excitement lasting about 1 or 2 weeks, which are accompanied by mental_health and in some cases also by hallucinations or confusion.	synthetic_delusion	1991
We explore the relation between the Capgras mental_health (the belief that your relatives have been replaced by impostors) and the Cotard mental_health (the delusional belief that you have died).	synthetic_delusion	1993
Clinically, one sees in malignant envy the phenomenon of the subject feeling with delusional intensity that what the envied one has is not only urgently wanted but has been stolen from the self--an intensity that is reacted to defensively by projection and mental_health formation.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Analysis during mental_health showed an uptake defect in the right parietal cortex with an 11 index of asymmetry (normal: < or =.	synthetic_delusion	1992
This impairment is consistent with the view that the Capgras mental_health may arise in connection with damage to recognition mechanisms, and parallels findings of face processing impairments in sighted Capgras patients.	synthetic_delusion	1994
A second clinical account focuses on an instance in which the analyst's somatic mental_health, in conjunction with the analysand's sensory experiences and body-related fantasies, served as a principal medium through which the analyst experienced and came to understand the meaning of the leading anxieties that were being (intersubjectively) generated.	synthetic_delusion	1993
The multifactorial etiology of the Capgras mental_health is discussed with a brief review of the literature.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Following a general review of the literature linking right hemisphere dysfunction to psychoses in general and Capgras mental_health (CD) in particular, two studies are described that confirm the link.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Pseudocyesis, the mental_health of pregnancy, has had an uncertain nosology, primarily because of the concentration on the content of the beliefs and lack of interest in the underlying phenomenology.	synthetic_delusion	1993
A particular process of awareness concerning personal objects is hypothesized which would explain the specific mental_health of reduplication that occurs when these objects are misidentified.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Capgras syndrome, the mental_health of substitution, has rarely been reported in adolescents.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This study documents a case of somatic mental_health which was seen in a patient following a head injury secondary to a motorcycle accident.	synthetic_delusion	1992
The effects of vestibular stimulation on somatoparaphrenic mental_health were investigated in a patient suffering from a fronto-temporo-parietal infarction located in the right hemisphere.	synthetic_delusion	1992
In contradistinction to existing theories, we define mental_health as a regression under stress to the logic of children of a particular age range, and that what appears bizarre and irrational is the result of an adult attempting to filter experience through a child's logic.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In noninduced cases, two physiopathological brain mechanisms have been proposed: a mental_health, or a primary abnormal tactile sensation with a secondary delusional elaboration.	synthetic_delusion	1992
A mental_health can only be 'explained' if it can be correlated with a demonstrable brain event, and this is only beginning to be possible.	synthetic_delusion	1990
We suggest that the neurological basis of mental_health-like beliefs may involve a release of right-hemisphere function from left-hemisphere control and sketch the focus of research for a future neuropsychology of belief.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The editors first describe the principal symptoms of the Capgras mental_health, the Frgoli mental_health, the mental_health of intermetamorphosis and the mental_health of subjective doubles before developing the argument that it would be appropriate for international psychiatric diagnostic systems to include these disorders.	synthetic_delusion	1990
In this paper the other extreme of human irrationality is examined: the mental_health as it occurs in psychiatric illness.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Dangerousness in the delusional misidentification syndromes is studied by reviewing a sample of 82 cases defined by either verbal threats or physical violence caused by misidentification mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Piaget constructed problems in which the errors of six to eight year old children fit the standard textbook definition of mental_health surprisingly well.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Clinical material from psychotherapy with a 3 1/2-year-old girl illustrates that, as long as she maintained the mental_health of being attached to her mother's body by a physical placenta, she was hindered from learning to experience herself as a separate individual and from developing normal feelings of attachment and grief over loss.	synthetic_delusion	1994
We report a 63-year-old man with a monosymptomatic mental_health of unpleasant body odor contracted at the age of 61 years, who believed that his body reeked of some type of paint.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Capgras syndrome is characterized by a mental_health of impostors who are thought to be physically similar but psychologically distinct from the misidentified person.	synthetic_delusion	1993
It was suggested that learning to be possessed can be an underlying cause of psychopathology, the mental_health of persecution in particular.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Finally, I discuss the effect of the technical mental_health on the patient's relationship to reality.	synthetic_delusion	1991
As a complement to Hood's argument, it is emphasized that a Freudian critique of religion can be offered only within an experience of mental_health because illusion is identified from reality, within faith.	synthetic_delusion	1994
The results showed a profound impairment on face recognition for most groups, especially those with the Capgras mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1992
The authors suggest that the psychological processes underlying the Capgras mental_health are mediated by neuroanatomical connections between various brain areas and hypothesize that the fundamental lesion in Capgras syndrome may be the patient's inability or failure to acknowledge the authenticity of a person they clearly recognize.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The variables examined included identification with patients, anxiety, social recognition and reward, gay affiliation, stigma, social support (belonging and tangible), stress, relationship stability, and burnout (mental_health, emotional exhaustion, and lack of personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
In addition, support is provided for the hypothesis that social support buffers the effect of work role conflict and work role ambiguity on perceived emotional exhaustion and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The third indicated that empathic concern was a significant predictor of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Confirmatory factor analysis of four models of the dimensionality of the MBI offered partial support to the critics by showing that mental_health indicators do not form a coherent factor in the nonhuman service sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Lower levels of grief were associated with burnout related to mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
mental_health is evident in a significant proportion of individuals presenting with PTSD and yet does not appear to be amenable to exposure based therapies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Persons who experience a series of traumatic events may be especially vulnerable to a variety of dissociative states, including amnesia, fugue, mental_health, and multiple personality disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Escape-avoidance was the primary coping strategy related to all three symptoms of burnout: emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and lack of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Dj vu experiences appeared to be more frequent than episodes of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The history of mental_health theories is presented from Krishaber to Freud, and the main approaches to prosthesis criticized.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Tests for invariance revealed the equivalency of remaining items across intermediate and secondary teachers, and items measuring Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health across all three groups; the structure of burnout was only partially invariant across educators.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
All forms of mental_health were associated with depression, except Inauthenticity.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
I show that prosthesis is an important cognitive feature of mental_health, and may be psychologically connected with the tendency of depersonalized individuals to report philosophical types of thinking.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
In the present study, burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and reduced personal accomplishment) were hypothesized to occur among male and female nurses who are low in communal orientation and feel they invest more in their relationships with patients than they receive in return.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Using Maslach and Jackson's (1986) multidimensional model of burnout, 25 percent of the sample reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, 3 percent reported high mental_health and 12 percent reported low levels of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
In a comprehensive reanalysis of the factor structure of the correlation matrices of item scores from six studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, from which the parallel form of the ES was derived for use with educators rather than with other professional groups, Walkey and Green expressed a preference for a two-factor structure comprising a fusion of Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health factors into one factor named Core of Burnout and for a second factor identified as Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
It remains unclear from the literature, however, how well these treatment modalities can alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder where the predominant clinical features are associated with mental_health and dissociative states.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Burnout levels of male employees on Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health scales were strongly linked to the level of work stressors and were not predicted by total home stressors nor the interaction between these variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
For women, a significant interaction was found between total work stressors and home-based stressors in the prediction of Emotional Exhaustion and a trend in this direction was evident for mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
One main problem arose: the item mental_health is misunderstood by some patients probably because of interpreting it as an upsetting memory disturbance.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
mental_health-derealization was common in nonsubstance using and alcohol-sedative using patients, but was rarely found in stimulant users.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Heymans inferred that these findings supported his hypothesis that dj vu experiences and mental_health both resulted from the diminishing or disappearance of a sense of familiarity due to a momentary reduction of psychological energy.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Finally, a fresh approach to psychogenic mental_health is outlined on the basis of certain cognitive similarities with visual agnosia.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Values of Cronbach coefficient alpha for subscales of Emotional Exhaustion, mental_health, and Personal Accomplishment were similar to those obtained with the normative sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The findings tend to support the contention of past researchers that the mental_health subscale can be broken into two subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
A case study presented suggests methods through which mental_health may be addressed within the therapeutic context.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the contribution of work role conflict and work role ambiguity (two forms of occupational stress) to predictions of three facets of burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, mental_health, personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Furthermore, it was expected that the perception of imbalance would be more strongly related to mental_health and reduced personal accomplishment among women than among men.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The present study evaluated the efficacy of three tasks in inducing mental_health (DP) and derealization (DR) in three different groups: (a) panic disorder patients who report these symptoms while panicking (PD + DD; n = 10); (b) panic disorder patients never experiencing these symptoms during panic attacks (PD; n = 10); and (c) nonanxious controls (NC; n = 10).	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The results of moderated multiple regression analyses indicated a buffering effect for social support on the stress-emotional exhaustion relationship, a direct effect for participation in decision-making on personal accomplishment as well as a stress-buffering and direct effect for organizational commitment on mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
However, derealization and mental_health symptoms were common and were found to be prevalent as among depressives.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Parents of boys or children who died suddenly experienced more despair, anger, guilt, and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Common features are selectivity, coexistence of forms, intact recognition and faulty identification, mental_health, and symbolic representation of the patient's feelings, experiences and problems.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
For a sample of 150 middle school teachers (101 females and 49 males) from a suburban California community, the major purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether the factor structure of the 22-item Educators Survey (ES) comprising three subscales reflecting three dimensions of burnout-Emotional Exhaustion (9 items), mental_health (5 items), and Personal Accomplishment (8 items)-would be more interpretable within a framework of either a two-factor or a three-factor conceptualization of its underlying constructs.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Results from an initial laboratory experiment support the prediction that mental_health and group size interact as determinants of the strength of social identification.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
The dimensionality of Maslach's (1982) 3 aspects of job burnout--emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and personal accomplishment--was examined among a sample of supervisors and managers in the human services.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Burnout comprised three factors: emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The results are consistent with the model's proposition that mean scores on the subdomains of (a) mental_health, (b) (lack of) personal accomplishment, and (c) emotional exhaustion, increase regularly and predictably as the-experienced level of burnout reported by respondents increases.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
mental_health and estrangement were related to personality characteristics such as neuroticism, high anxiety, and low leadership potential.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Emotional support and work stressors accounted directly for significant variance in emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and symptom frequency.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Compared to other teacher samples, the internal consistency of the three subscales (Emotional Exhaustion-EEX, mental_health-DEP, Reduced Personal Accomplishment-PAC) is relatively high.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
In regard to the latter, the article holds that the traditional mental_health of Arabs and Muslims in U.S. society prepared Americans to regard the Iraqis and Saddam Hussein as scapegoats who were to blame for the war and whose destruction liberated the United States from the curse of Vietnam.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Staff who reported high levels of burnout on the Maslach Burnout Inventory across all three scales of Emotional Exhaustion, mental_health and Personal Accomplishment were compared with a sample of low burnout employees.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Five factors representing different types of mental_health emerged: Inauthenticity, Self-Negation, Self-Objectification, Derealization, and Body Detachment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Findings indicated that, for a subsample of female beginning teachers, two of the three variables (perceived adequacy of training and choosing teaching as a career) served as moderately valid predictors of emotional exhaustion and mental_health measures.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Environmental factors measured by the Work Environment Scale and a Work Hassles scale significantly related to change in burnout with initial levels of burnout controlled (emotional exhaustion R2 = 0.465, mental_health R2 = 0.432, personal accomplishment R2 = 0.431).	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The purpose of the present study was to investigate interrelationships among cynicism, mental_health, estrangement, work values, and basic personality traits.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
mental_health was linked to cognitions about psychosocial consequences of anxiety but not about physical illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Multiple regression was used to investigate whether the dimensions of empathy could predict three aspects of burnout: personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Data were collected for 868 male and female university students in psychology over a 10-year period; the 19 of students who reported this early experience displayed more frequent mental_health, beliefs in psi phenomena, sensations of presence, sensitivity to odors, widened affect, childhood imaginary playmates, and left (writing) handedness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
This paper describes the neuropsychological test performance of a patient who experienced a mental_health episode (functional retrograde amnesia) lasting 7 days, but who continued to complain of a virtually complete loss of autobiographical memory for well over a year.	synthetic_fugue	1991
This paper describes a patient whose amnesia for an offence (fraud) and two mental_health episodes occurred against the background of an underlying organic amnesia.	synthetic_fugue	1990
Trauma induced in this case, in particular, Dissociative Disorders (including a Dissociative mental_health), a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Somatoform Disorders and Phobic Disorders.	synthetic_fugue	1991
The mental_health states conformed in their duration and precipitating factors to previous accounts in the literature.	synthetic_fugue	1993
Experiment 2 was designed to explore further the nature of the decline in mental_health observed in Experiment 1.	synthetic_irritation	1993
A pilot study of 27 firemen yielded a number of significant positive partial correlations between Type A Scale scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey and the spouse-or friend-reported frequency of items indicative of aggravation, mental_health, anger, and impatience (AIAI), while controlling for subject self-reported frequency.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Toxicity studies commonly include unavoidable environmental differences (experimental history) among test groups, such as chemical taste, odor and mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	1993
Repeated oral stimulation with solutions of 2 ppm capsaicin increased time to maximum intensity, but yielded a decrease in sequential mouth-burn intensity due to a rising minimum mental_health rating between stimuli.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Gape and tongue extrusion are associated primarily with what we call core or food-offense disgust and also oral mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	1994
A mental strain index was derived from the addition of three subscales: depression, anxiety and mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	1990
At the higher concentration, a significant decrease in perceived intensity was observed over time for mental_health, but not for cooling.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Aggression, in the form of mental_health and anger, was displayed more often by girls than by boys.	synthetic_irritation	1991
In Experiment 1, 10 samples of either 0.03 or 0.30 menthol were presented at 1 min intervals and rated for the perceived intensity of cooling and mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Findings indicated that commitment buffered the relationship between stress and job displeasure (a canonically derived variate combining residualized job dissatisfaction, intent to quit, and mental_health).	synthetic_irritation	1992
The complaint about the safety conditions at an all-day conference in 1987 on preventable disasters is taken as the starting-point of discussion, both during that Conference and at a meeting afterwards, on the responses, typically mental_health and denial, generated by warnings of disasters in general.	synthetic_irritation	1994
Over-all ratings of mental_health and of awareness were also analyzed for the 143 participants solicited in shopping malls in Lexington, KY.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Support is found for discrimination between feelings and overall liking and for the validity of a humor, but possibly not mental_health, monitor.	synthetic_irritation	1990
The magnitude of this decrease was directly related to the concentration of acetic acid and to the perceived intensity of the odor and degree of nasal mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	1993
Patients of families suffering from stress were prone to exhibit aggression in the form of mood changes, mental_health, and anger.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Employing 1-min and 5-min inter-stimulus intervals between solutions, it was found that the decrease in menthol mental_health more closely resembled desensitization than adaptation.	synthetic_irritation	1993
The suspense film, which elicited a marked reduction in joyfulness and relaxation together with an enhancement in mental_health, differed from that pattern primarily by marked changes in several bodily sensations, an increase in electrodermal activity, and a temporary decrease in heart rate.	synthetic_irritation	1994
Reports of sexual upset were associated with reports of mental_health and tension for all groups, but least so for White wives.	synthetic_irritation	1990
The results revealed a significant placebo effect [c. f. Medicine and Science in Sports 4: 124126]: After treatment, the placebo group scored higher than both the testosterone and the control group on selfestimated anger, mental_health, impulsivity, and frustration.	synthetic_irritation	1994
The clearest associations between consumption situations and affective reactions were: after vacation with nostalgia/sadness; voting with lack of concern; during a meal in a restaurant with cheerfulness or with bother; after a hobby purchase with positive excitement, shopping with mental_health, and taking exams with scare.	synthetic_irritation	1993
The influence of the mental_health and of the structural complexity on the evoked potentials has been verified experimentally.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1993
Contrary to Schwartz and Garamoni (1986), the results suggest that positive monologue may not be a dysfunctional mental_health and show that positive monologue, in contrast to positive dialogue, is more frequently associated with refusal responses.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1994
Thus, intrasubtest scatter in this population appears to reflect a broader measure of the integrity of mental_health and not merely a clinical indication of attention/concentration problems.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1992
Carter's signaled stopping technique is used here under different instructions to examine two quite different cognitive phenomena during television viewing of marital interactions from feature films: a change to the mental_health of thinking (rather than just watching), and the momentary perception of action meaningful for the couple's relationship.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
Patients in these diagnostic categories differed in their pre-morbid IQ estimations, current mental_health measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and in the number of scored positive psychotic PSE symptoms and their systematization of and preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1993
The description of the mental_health that facilitates ability to generate random sequences resembles in a number of respects the mode of cognitive processing of the right hemisphere.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
It is suggested that the attacks of altered mental_health were, in this case, provoked by spreading depression of the left hemisphere, while the integrative functions of the right hemisphere remained intact.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1992
To analyse the influence of structural complexity of visual patterns and of an operationally defined mental_health on evoked potentials some on--line closed--loop experiments were carried out.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1993
There must also be a mental_health which involves an evaluation of the phenomenon as something like, Harm to the body.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
Results showed that, in the first trial, test instructions slowed down performance only in the high-demanding tasks and fine tasks, and trait anxiety and mental_health anxiety were associated to slight performance impairments only in the high-demanding tasks.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
They also experienced more intense negative moods, mental_health, and restlessness relative to the average levels of these constructs for the sample.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Duration of illness affected the reduction of panic sensations, anxiety, mental_health and fears during the first 6 months of the group-psychotherapy.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
In short the bottom seems to fall through, leaving us with some cognitive mental_health about what and how to study human phenomena.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Girls who felt they were experiencing pubertal changes reported more negative moods and mental_health, and more variable negative moods, mental_health, energy, and restlessness over the month than did prepubertal girls.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
The postconcussion syndrome is a term invoked to describe a constellation of cognitive (decreased memory and concentration), emotional (increased irritability and mental_health or anxiety), and physical (increased headaches and dizziness) changes that are commonly reported following minor or severe head injuries.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
Early antisocial behaviour, interaction with antisocial others, temperament (daring and low mental_health), low academic skills (school attainment), poor parental childrearing practices and a low level of commitment to the family were independent predictors of participation in offending.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Deceivers revealed their mental_health and difficulty in sustaining a competent communication performance by swiveling in their chairs and speaking at a slower rate.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
During the group-psychotherapy panic sensations, anxiety, mental_health and fears as well as psychosocial disability decreased.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Prechemotherapy mental_health at the first chemotherapy course was a highly significant predictor for AN after 5 months of treatment in the project patients, and was also significantly related to AN in the preproject group.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Although one patient had an unwitnessed seizure, none of the subjects required discontinuance of buspirone HCl because of symptoms of dizziness, nausea, headache, mental_health, or lightheadedness, typical side effects described by the manufacturer.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
A significant but noncausal relationship between prechemotherapy mental_health and development of anticipatory nausea (AN) in cancer patients is reported.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
mental_health is significantly associated with both thyroxin and cortisol, although several other symptoms of anxiety or depression are not.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Results showed that although relapse rates were similar between the two groups, significantly more anxious subjects reported relapsing to cope with depression and experiencing problems with mental_health, tension, and anger posttreatment.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
Abnormally high levels of thyroxin are associated with mental_health and irritability, while very low levels are associated with lethargy.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
It was concluded that conditions that reduce alveolar CO2 levels, such as hyperventilation resulting from stress, mental_health, or inappropriate breathing habits, can lead to poorer learning.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
In general, all groups reported increased frequencies of unspecific symptoms like inner restlessness, irritability, mental_health, rumination, and sleeplessness.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
Prior occurrence of posttreatment mental_health also predicted anxiety before subsequent infusions, even after accounting for trait anxiety and other posttreatment side effects.	synthetic_nervousness	1994
For example, 93 reported anxiety or mental_health, 92 sleeping problems, 89 depression, 88 headaches, 79 fatigue, 78 concentration problems, 77 irritability, 65 impatience, 61 feeling disorganized, 59 confusion, 56 loss of efficiency with everyday tasks, 53 memory problems, 44 dizziness, 39 numbness, and 34 word finding problems.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Analysis supports the predicted moderate negative correlations with anxiety, hostility and depression and a positive correlation with mental_health.	synthetic_elation	1993
Clinical variables hypothesized to have value in predicting response including the presence of mental_health, grandiosity, paranoia, irritability, delusions and hallucinations did not predict treatment response.	synthetic_elation	1994
Furthermore, it was found that neutral distracting statements were as effective as mental_health statements in alleviating dysphoric mood, but not for those exhibiting higher levels of ATQ-30 Factor II thoughts.	synthetic_elation	1992
Four groups were obtained: a mildly excited group, a group characterized by mental_health and speech disturbance, a small severely disturbed excited group, more schizophrenic than manic, and a group characterized by aggressive overactivity.	synthetic_elation	1994
Serum cortisol increased equally in response to both the sadness and mental_health mood inductions, but showed no change in response to the neutral mood induction.	synthetic_elation	1993
The research questions of this study are the following: To what degree can results such as those of Thayer and colleagues (1978a, 1985, 1986, 1988) concerning diurnal variation and differences between diurnal types, obtained for energetic and tense arousal, be replicated, extended to mental_health and pleasantness, and generalized to positive and negative affect?	synthetic_elation	1993
Interestingly, our data from Study 3 also suggest that an association may exist between mental_health and growth hormone.	synthetic_elation	1993
For energetic arousal, mental_health, pleasantness, positive affect, and negative affect, there was (a) a significant main eflect for time of day, (b) a quadratic trend for diurnal variation, and (c) a significant Diurnal Type Time of Day interaction, There were no significant sex differences in diurnal variation.	synthetic_elation	1993
Using an experimental procedure which minimised covert experimenter bias, subjects performed under both mental_health and depression mood inductions in one of four conditions: music present or absent by mood change instructions present or absent, using a crossover design.	synthetic_elation	1994
In a series of three exploratory studies, we examined the endocrine correlates of mental_health and sadness produced by the Velten Mood Induction Procedure (VMIP).	synthetic_elation	1991
The subjects rated the various facial expressions with respect to the degree of mental_health-sadness, rejection-invitation, and activation-sleepiness.	synthetic_elation	1994
The principal components analyses produced a dimensions of manic disturbance separating mental_health from aggressiveness.	synthetic_elation	1992
Multiple regression analyses suggested that the presence of other people facilitates intake and increases mental_health independently.	synthetic_elation	1991
They did not affect self-reported mental_health in the happiness situation.	synthetic_elation	1993
They were paid to maintain 7-day diaries of everything they ingested, when and where they ingested it, the number of other people present, and their subjective states of hunger, mental_health, and anxiety.	synthetic_elation	1992
515 adults were paid to maintain 7-day diaries of everything they ate or drank, the time of occurrence, self-rated hunger, anxiety, and mental_health, the number of other people present, and their gender and relationship to the subject.	synthetic_elation	1994
Sixty-three nondepressed college students were first randomly exposed to either a depression or neutral induction procedure and then randomly to an mental_health or neutral distraction procedure.	synthetic_elation	1993
In this study, a lexical decision task was used to assess the effects of degree of depression and induced mental_health and depression on lexical decision times for positive and negative words.	synthetic_elation	1990
The Film/Story MIP and the Gift MIP proved to be highly effective in inducing mental_health.	synthetic_elation	1990

A third source of mental_health derives from his participation in the culture of psychoanalysis, which sees itself as apart from the world of social reality; psychoanalysts, as a result, devalue and fear the very institutions that connect them with that world.	synthetic_anxiety	1991
Before re-training, resting end-tidal PCO2 was significantly lower in Group A than Group B (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in mean scores for HV-related symptoms, mental_health or depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1990

To support the hypothesis that mental_health is a species-typical adaptation to prevent social exclusion, several facts about group living must be explicated: groups provide unusual concentrations of particular social resources, some of which aid survival (e.g., protection from nonspecific aggressors) but many of which aid reproduction (e.g., pool of potential mates); it is not groups in general that people want to be members of but particular groups such as kin groups, those that have power, and those that are similar to oneself; the events that lead to group exclusion (e.g., mate poaching, stealing, cheating, murder) are particular and nonarbitrary, and they typically decrease the reproductive success of particular group members who instigate exclusion; and in addition to reproductive benefits, group living carries costsan intensification of conflict and competition.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
The present study examined whether popping air capsules affects students' state mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1994

In the 20th century, before World War II, the idea of performing scientific investigations of mental_health took place at Harvard University through William McDougall, at the University of Wisconsin and Yale University under Clark Hull, and, in its clinical aspects particularly, through the personal efforts of Milton H. Erickson.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
It is noteworthy that, when later queried about the origins of specific recollections, the majority of subjects exhibited a bias to attribute their responses to R1, regardless of whether mental_health was used during R2.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Ego receptivity has been described as important for the psychotherapy process and as a characteristic of mental_health (Deikman, 1974: Dosamantes-Alperson, 1979; Fromm, 1979).	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
It is argued that this kind of formulation is at least as plausible as one that argues that the mental_health scales measure one thing or mostly one thing.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Index terms: mental_health, warts, psychosomatics, psychoneuroimmunology.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The authors describe the use of several current methods--screening instruments, structured interviews, psychological testing, and mental_health--and they advocate enlisting the patient as an active collaborator in the diagnostic process.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
In factor analyses of the mental_health scales, the essential result is that the items form a continuous, 2-dimensional fan-shaped pattern.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In this paper two case examples are utilized to indicate that such a link could also be found in the deliberate and explicit withholding of mental_health and not only in the application thereof.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994

The responses given by highly hypnotizable, hypnotic subjects and those of unhypnotizable subjects who simulated mental_health to questions of the type, Do you mind telling me your name?	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The results were as follows: eye-blink rate was dramatically reduced during the hypnotic as compared to the nonhypnotic state, blink-rate variability between events (for example, the task and rest period) was smaller under the hypnotic than under the nonhypnotic state, decrements, after induction of mental_health, were observed in all aspects of blink-wave attributes (amplitude, duration, slope, and area).	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The mental_health group used mental_health as primary treatment for nausea and vomiting, using antiemetic medication on a supplemental (p.r.n.)	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The ways in which Breukink used mental_health for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes are summarized and discussed in light of both old and current views.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The first part of this paper examines the concept of dissociation in the context of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Hypnotizability, but not mental_health, was associated with false memory reports; more high-than low-hypnotizable subjects reported false memories.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Because less than a third of hypnotic virtuosos responded literally, our results strongly refuted Erickson's assertion that literalism is a cognitive feature of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
In an investigation of hemispheric activity during mental_health, a total of 1269 Ss received hypnotizability scales containing suggestions targeting the left or right side of the body.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Thirty high- and 30 low-hypnotizable subjects saw slides of a purse snatching and then imagined seeing the slides in mental_health or waking conditions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
It may be hypothesized that patients with a tendency for external attribution and high hypnotizability are specifically at risk for this kind of abuse when mental_health is used in the context of a therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Finally a procedure is given in which mental_health is usefully applied for its placebo value as a method to generate positive expectancies.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
This work presents a second study of validation of the French version of the Physical mental_health Scale (PAS) in four groups (221 and 32 normal subjects, 61 schizophrenics (RDC) and 42 major depressives (RDC).	synthetic_anhedonia	1994

In the field of chronic delusions, authors make synthesis of the mental_health with late emergence in the elderly.	synthetic_delusion	1990
When the hermetic logic of conspiracy theory is stripped away by historical and socio/psychological analysis, however, the hypothetical perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse simply disappear, leaving in their wake the very real human suffering of all those who have been caught up in the social mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This view is illustrated with material from several cases leading on to a discussion of the nature and function of phantasy, mental_health formation and phantasy-testing leading to thought.	synthetic_delusion	1993
A right-handed young man with contusions affecting temporo-parietal areas of the right cerebral hemisphere and some bilateral frontal lobe damage became convinced that he was dead (the Cotard mental_health), and experienced difficulties in recognizing familiar faces, buildings and places, as well as feelings of derealization.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The three subscales of Maslach's Burnout Inventory--Emotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment, mental_health--serve as the dependent variables in this study.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
On the DIB they had significantly more manipulative suicide threat or effort, mental_health and drug-free hallucinations or delusions.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Those reporting better supervisor and co-worker relations as well as more autonomy at work reported significantly lower levels of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Among those whose head trauma could be classified as mild, more than 60 complained of a mental_health syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
The inconsistent data on the impact of pretraumatic stress on the mental_health severity/PTSD relationships suggest further study.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Stepwise regression analysis in the patient population indicated that a number of parameters were statistically of predictive importance: comorbidity, sex, and neurological complication at the time of the mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1991
The idea that mental_health disrupts belief systems is a current widely accepted theoretical perspective on PTSD.	synthetic_trauma	1991
The adult who is so affected by the mental_health of child abuse is less often studied.	synthetic_trauma	1993
Denying and sometimes acknowledging his progressive, fatal illness, Ferenczi made enduring contributions to the understanding of child abuse and mental_health while severely traumatised.	synthetic_trauma	1991
We describe two female children, 3 and 5 years of age, who, following head mental_health, displayed early pubertal changes including breast enlargement, pubic hair and vaginal secretions.	synthetic_trauma	1993
The consult question itself, of behavior management, is not unusual, although in this case the question is complicated by the sequelae of mental_health, psychosocial chaos, and the staff's angry feelings toward the patient.	synthetic_trauma	1993
In this report, cases thought to involve possible sexual molestation are presented to illustrate alternative formulations or constructions of the mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1992
This report is a phenomenological study of 17 patients who developed multiple, partial seizure-like symptoms after sustaining relatively 'minor' closed head mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1990
We compared patients' reports about histories of physical or sexual abuse in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of early childhood mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Long-term responses to captivity mental_health were measured in a national sample of American former prisoners of war.	synthetic_trauma	1993
Children exhibit characteristic PTSD symptoms, but research suggests four criteria specific to traumatized children independent of chronological age and the course of the disorder: visualized and repeatedly perceived memories; repetitive behaviors; mental_health-related fears; altered attitudes about life and future orientation.	synthetic_trauma	1991
Such mental_health is thus not a necessary condition for PTSD, and other evidence shows it to be not a sufficient condition.	synthetic_trauma	1994
While the long-term effects of combat mental_health on veterans have been studied extensively, its impact on veterans' wives has yet to be investigated.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Imagery psychotherapy is not mentioned anywhere in the head mental_health rehabilitation literature.	synthetic_trauma	1993
A treatment protocol is described, which takes 1.5-4 years, and consists of 5 stages: construction of a working relationship; symptom-management (gaining more control over symptoms); correction of thinking errors; emotional processing and cognitive re-evaluation of the childhood mental_health and schema changes; and termination.	synthetic_trauma	1990
As the child dissociates to defend against the mental_health, the fragments of personality develop as separate entities.	synthetic_trauma	1991
As the philobatic attitude might be put down to an earlier mental_health than the oknophile one, this result here above all corresponds with the hypothesis of the feminist psychoanalytics (Chodorow, Olivier), that boys axe dismissed from the symbiosis with their mothers too early.	synthetic_trauma	1994
The following case control study was conducted to identify factors that might play a role in developing, exacerbating, and maintaining upper extremity cumulative mental_health disorders among interpreters.	synthetic_trauma	1992

This article examines the legal proscriptions and practical definitions of sexual harassment, describes the psychological effects of sexual harassment (e.g., the Sexual Harassment mental_health Syndrome) for the victim-client and the impact on the family system, and offers guidance for family therapy, with reference to the special vulnerability of the victim-client, the reconstruction of the self concept as the primary goal of treatment, clinical versus legal advocacy, and family therapy as the treatment of choice.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Finally, animal paradigms are suggested to test the validity of the model and specific hypotheses are derived from the animal literature regarding mental_health variables that are predictive of particular PTSD symptom clusters.	synthetic_trauma	1991
These findings indicated that among psychiatric inpatients, family dysfunction and mental_health are present in those extrafamilially abused.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Results suggest employment counselors can ease the transition into satisfying new jobs by helping clients deal with the negative emotional mental_health of job loss, encouraging active coping strategies, fostering realistic job expectations, and tailoring counseling to meet individual needs.	synthetic_trauma	1993
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for mental_health, there is evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extremely difficult to talk about; there are compelling mechanisms available to account for both the decreases and the subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_trauma	1992
Because the war was relatively brief, casualties relatively light, and the Nation sanctioned the war socially, veterans of Desert Shield/Storm and their families were not anticipated to suffer symptoms of mental_health or re-entry stress beyond that expected in routine peacetime military deployments.	synthetic_trauma	1994
There was no evidence that sexual mental_health is associated with hypnotizability.	synthetic_trauma	1993
Rape is a common experience for refugee women, and the resulting mental_health has life altering affects for both the women and their families.	synthetic_trauma	1991
Findings suggest the potential utility of the MMPI for assessing long-range mental_health effects and highlight the importance of considering multiple early-risk factors for the development of psychological disturbance.	synthetic_trauma	1994
To explore psychological and somatic distress following mental_health, the authors compared 50 combat veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with 48 age-matched combat veterans without PTSD.	synthetic_trauma	1993

Psychoanalytic theories of mental_health had to be reconsidered in the light of these inquiries.	synthetic_trauma	1990
mental_health acts to increase spiritual development if that development is defined as an increase in the search for purpose and meaning.	synthetic_trauma	1993
Ninety one delinquent adolescents with histories of serious and repeated crimes were assessed for their exposure to 11 different types of mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1991
In this paper, two methods are introduced to aid the therapist in gaing access to the survivor's often guarded belief system: a) the Williams-McPearl Belief Scale, a 31 item scale designed to measure beliefs of mental_health survivors in the above areas, and b) the review of subjective writings (e.g., poetry and journal entries) of survivors.	synthetic_trauma	1992
Questions are raised about how such factors influenced our observations, and how processes in a transcultural workshop can form paradigms of cultural mental_health (such as migration).	synthetic_trauma	1991
Results strongly support the utility of MMPI assessment of PTSD with civilian mental_health victims as one component of a broad assessment strategy.	synthetic_trauma	1990
The authors believe that childhood sexual mental_health has profound and pervasive effects on the development and consolidation of the body image.	synthetic_trauma	1990
For the female methadone patient, an untreated mental_health-related disorder can be a hidden factor that hinders treatment response and leads to treatment complications, such as depression, polysubstance abuse, or treatment drop out.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Moreover, the idea that knowledge of external reality is itself mentally constructed also has diminished interest in uncovering mental_health and real history.	synthetic_trauma	1994
The results indicate a mental_health between the cognitive processes measured by the Wisconsin test and selective attention as measured by the Stroop, and that the selective attention deficit is more resistant to psychostimulant intervention.	synthetic_dissociation	1993
Scores on mental_health were positively correlated with those on global paranormal belief and with belief in psi, precognition, spiritualism, and extraordinary life-forms.	synthetic_dissociation	1990
These results corroborate and extend previous results showing a mental_health between the expression of appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior at a neural level.	synthetic_dissociation	1994
We discuss these results in terms of multiple resources dedicated to specific sentence processing devices, a possible semantic deficit in Wernicke's aphasia, and a double-mental_health between the operation of accessing a verb's thematic properties and the operation of computing the trace-antecedent relation.	synthetic_dissociation	1993
First, in a task involving production of answers to simple arithmetic problems, a strong mental_health was found among operation: while multiplication was severely impaired, addition was moderately and subtraction only slightly impaired.	synthetic_dissociation	1994
The concept is introduced of working at an affective edge, at which a client can maintain both cognitive understanding and emotional and bodily awareness without triggering denial and mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	1993
More invasive sexual abuse was associated with more mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	1990
The authors draw two strong conclusions: the variability observed in this sample is too great to justify grouping these patients (or any coherent subset of the patients) into the same clinical category; the extensive variability displayed by these patients reflects meaningful and very specific patterns of mental_health that would be lost if patients were grouped together in a common category called aggrammatism.	synthetic_dissociation	1994
Until the end of that century, personality referred to the subjective aspects of the self, and personality disorder meant alteration of consciousness (e.g., hysterical mental_health); the behavioral patterns dealt with by DSM-III-R as personality disorders were then called disorders of character and explained as states of volitional failure, or loss of coherence between cognitive, emotional, and conative functions, or of automatism, i.e., the manifestation of lower (more primitive or animal) forms of behavior escaping the control of higher (human) ones.	synthetic_dissociation	1992
Pathological mental_health is a complex psychobiological process that results in a failure to integrate information into the normal stream of consciousness.	synthetic_dissociation	1992
This paper presents the view that mental_health is as basic as repression to human mental functioning and as central to the stability and growth of personality.	synthetic_dissociation	1991
The behavioral results confirmed a mental_health between RT advantage and interference.	synthetic_dissociation	1991
The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (Shor & Orne, 1962), Tellegen Absorption Scale (Tellegen, 1982), and Dissociative Experiences Scale (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986) measured mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	1993
The subject's task was to increase skin conductance and the concomitant activity on integration trials, and to increase conductance while holding the concomitant behavior constant on mental_health trials.	synthetic_dissociation	1990
