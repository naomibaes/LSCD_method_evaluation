The hypothesis that delusions are characterised by a failure of authorship, which is a dimension of self knowledge, deserves to be empirically tested because (a) it has the potential to account for the distinction between endorsing a mental_illness and endorsing a framework belief; (b) it contributes to a philosophical analysis of the relationship between rationality and self knowledge; and (c) it informs diagnosis and therapy in clinical psychiatry.	synthetic_delusion	2008
A patient with mental_illness of pregnancy as an early feature of FTLD/MND is presented to illustrate the need to consider neurodegenerative disease as well as primary psychiatric disorder as the underlying cause of this striking symptom.	synthetic_delusion	2007
The mental_illness that the usual passage of time has been changed and that time has been interfered with or is repeating itself is rare.	synthetic_delusion	2009
These behaviours have the consequence that they are likely to prevent the processing of disconfirmatory evidence and will therefore contribute to mental_illness persistence.	synthetic_delusion	2007
YP experienced verbal-auditory hallucinations, a mental_illness of alien control and hetero-aggressive behaviour.	synthetic_delusion	2007

Dissociative amnesia that encompasses one's entire life and identity is a rare disorder, as is dissociative mental_illness.	synthetic_fugue	2008
This paper reports a study based upon the case of the patient NN who suffered from a complete loss of autobiographical memory and awareness of identity subsequent to a dissociative mental_illness.	synthetic_fugue	2006
NN's loss of self-related memories was mirrored in neurobiological changes after the mental_illness whereas his semantic memory remained intact.	synthetic_fugue	2009
Although NN still claimed to suffer from a stable loss of autobiographical, self-relevant memories 1 year after the mental_illness state, a proportionate improvement in underlying fronto-temporal neuronal networks was evident at this point in time.	synthetic_fugue	2006
Neuropsychological, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that NN suffered from a selective retrograde amnesia following an episode of dissociative mental_illness, during which he had lost explicit knowledge and vivid memory of his personal past.	synthetic_fugue	2008
This occurred after variable events: state of mental_illness, road accident, post-traumatic headache.	synthetic_fugue	2006
In support of humane, neurobiologically informed treatment of patients with dissociative amnesia, we present excerpts from 2 post-event interviews with a patient who suffered and recovered from an episode of dissociative amnesia and mental_illness.	synthetic_fugue	2006
The events triggering FRA varied widely: mild to severe head injury, road accident without head injury, seizure, dissociative mental_illness, BDZ overdose, posttraumatic headache, syncope, migraine attack, acute distress.	synthetic_fugue	2005
It allows four possible variations of integration: non-integrated experience--perceptions about an object/event are either not perceived or they remain at the sensory level: traditional dissociative states, amnesia, depersonalisation etc; variably integrated experience--activation of information of a specific valence about an object blocks activation of information of contrasting valence: splitting; alternatively integrated experience--experience is integrated into a specific, limited active self-representation: mental_illness and multiple identity states; dis-integrated experience-the ongoing experience of innate drives and needs is no longer consistently activated in the core self-representation: repression and isolation.	synthetic_fugue	2006
The nose wrinkle is predominantly associated with irritating or offensive smells, the mouth gape and tongue extrusion with distaste and oral mental_illness, while a broader range of disgust elicitors including aversive interpersonal contacts and certain moral offenses are associated primarily with the upper lip curl.	synthetic_irritation	2009

PDS scores were significantly related to scores from the HAD total scale (r=.64), HAD mental_illness (r=.61) and HAD depression (r=.39) subscales, and EORTC QLQ-C30 emotional functioning (r=.56) and global health state (r=.44).	synthetic_anxiety	2005
Concerns about the untruthfulness of positive selfstatements led clients to generate several possible resolutions, namely, to examine flaws in negative selfstatements, to realise that there is more than one realistic way to construe things, to consider the evidence in the form of reduced mental_illness, to consider manageable steps, and to seek interpersonal validation of positive selfstatements.	synthetic_anxiety	2006
Hoarding participants also reported more interpersonal difficulties than community volunteers, but they did not differ significantly from nonhoarding participants with an mental_illness or mood disorder.	synthetic_anxiety	2005

Two subjects randomly assigned to a mental_illness condition received suggestions that the 2nd trial was more difficult and the last trial was less difficult than the first trial.	synthetic_hypnosis	2005
Although mental_illness has been found to be an empirically effective treatment for many medical problems, when mental_illness practitioners do not practice in these medical sites then patients do not have access to effective hypnotic interventions for cotreatment of medical problems.	synthetic_hypnosis	2007
Additional qualitative and quantitative studies are needed to assess the place for mental_illness/hypnotherapy in child psychiatry.	synthetic_hypnosis	2008
mental_illness treatment often improves irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the costs and reliance on specialized therapists limit its availability.	synthetic_hypnosis	2005

mental_illness is a potentially valuable cognitive tool for neuroimaging studies.	synthetic_hypnosis	2008
These findings suggest that mental_illness may have use in facilitating the treatment effects of CBT for posttraumatic stress.	synthetic_hypnosis	2009
None of the published studies have compared mental_illness to an equally credible placebo or minimally effective pain treatment, therefore conclusions cannot yet be made about whether hypnotic analgesia treatment is specifically effective over and above its effects on patient expectancy.	synthetic_hypnosis	2005
Study participants also reported a variety of both symptom-related and nonsymptom-related benefits from mental_illness treatment, including decreased pain, increased perceived control over pain, increased sense of relaxation and well-being, and decreased perceived stress, although no single benefit was noted by a majority of participants.	synthetic_hypnosis	2006
A number of practical issues are presented surrounding the use of mental_illness in the context of English soccer and with athletes in general.	synthetic_hypnosis	2005

A 3-month home-treatment version of a scripted mental_illness protocol previously shown to improve all central IBS symptoms was completed by 19 IBS patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	2008
Further, it aims to provide a theoretical rationale for the use of mental_illness with cancer populations in the whole spectrum of illness/treatment trajectory in several clinical contexts.	synthetic_hypnosis	2005
We show that the induction of mental_illness can reduce anterior default mode activity during rest without increasing activity in other cortical regions.	synthetic_hypnosis	2007
Body-oriented techniques, mental_illness and imaginative methods can be useful instruments in the treatment of alexithymic patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	2008
mental_illness is a negative prognostic indicator in schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
Substance abuse, psychiatric symptoms, mental_illness, and social adjustment were assessed at baseline and study endpoint.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Research suggests that stress-induced mental_illness is a possible mechanism underlying the association between stress and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
A week-long experience-sampling study found that people high in social mental_illness were more likely to be alone.	synthetic_anhedonia	2005
Logistic regressions demonstrated that CA subjects were more likely to experience high levels of trait anxiety, physical mental_illness and sensation seeking than the controls.	synthetic_anhedonia	2005
Consistent with the tripartite framework, the extent of this positive self-judgment bias was significantly and uniquely related to depression-specific symptoms, with the positive bias reducing as mental_illness severity increased across three different symptom measures.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
By age, the youngest participants tend to score higher on the Physical mental_illness and Hallucination subscales.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
In primary analyses, mental_illness had a unique positive relationship with PTSD's emotional numbing symptoms and minimal relationships with other PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
Implicit aberrant salience was found to load onto its own factor, which was associated with elevated Introvertive mental_illness schizotypy, replicating our previous finding.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Depression in schizophrenia and mental_illness may overlap, and it could therefore be difficult to clinically differentiate them, especially in acute schizophrenia patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Research shows that individuals with schizophrenia report symptoms of mental_illness when assessed by interview or questionnaire.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
To clarify the role of social dysfunction in schizotypy, this study examined the relationship of social anxiety and social mental_illness in 364 young adults.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
Obstacles were categorized into the following 6 themes: comorbid disorders (i.e., anxiety, conduct, attention problems, and learning disorders); severe depressive symptoms (i.e., mental_illness and hopelessness); self-harm and suicidal ideation; school refusal; interpersonal factors, and; treatment noncompliance.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
They were tested and observed for a depression-like behavior (mental_illness).	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
The objective of the current work was to study the psychometric properties of the Revised Physical and Social mental_illness Scales in non-clinical young adults.	synthetic_anhedonia	2008
This study evaluated whether psychiatric outpatients with a past stimulant use disorder in full remission for >/= 2 months (STIM+, n = 204) and those with no history of stimulant use disorder (STIM-, n = 2070) differed in the prevalence of current mental_illness and amotivation.	synthetic_anhedonia	2008
In this study, we used the HSP and 'postpartum' withdrawal to investigate the impact on sucrose consumption, a model of mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
In the low estradiol group, the SANS scores, except for mental_illness-Asociality and Avolition-Apathy, were significantly higher than those in the normal estradiol group.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Internalizers were uniquely characterized by mental_illness and depressed mood; externalizers by antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and anger/aggression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
In addition, these findings may have implications for the role of these receptors in the incidence and treatment of depression since the intake of sucrose has been used as an index of mental_illness in animal models of depression and antidepressant efficacy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2005
Cognitive flexibility is relevant to symptoms of BD involving dysfunctional reward systems (e.g., excessive goal-directed activity and pleasure-seeking in mania; mental_illness in depression).	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
By contrast, affective flattening and mental_illness were associated with fewer list misattributions of the high-frequency words.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
Because it is a brief scale it seems to be a very useful instrument for measuring mental_illness in clinical and research settings.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
Compared to the 12-item version, GHQ-20 provides additional fourth factor of mental_illness, suggesting some discriminative power.	synthetic_anhedonia	2005
The tripartite model conceptualizes symptoms of depression and anxiety in three groups: low positive affect and mental_illness, which is specific to depression, somatic arousal, which is unique to anxiety, and nonspecific general distress.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
Within the suicide attempter group, HVA/5-HIAA ratio was significantly associated with the Suicide Intent Scale (SIS), but not with the MADRS scale or the Chapman Scale of mental_illness indicating that the HVA/5-HIAA ratio may be a biomarker of suicide intent.	synthetic_anhedonia	2005
Four weeks of exposure of male, Sprague-Dawley rats to mild unpredictable environmental stressors resulted in mental_illness which was operationally defined as a reduction in sucrose intake without a concomitant effect on water intake.	synthetic_anhedonia	2005
It is claimed that the model induces mental_illness in the animals, a core symptom of depression in humans.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
These humoral responses to CMS, associated with mental_illness as an index of depression in the rat, are likely to be associated with neurohumoral mechanisms that may contribute to adverse cardiac events.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
In previous studies, we have noted indications of altered sympathetic drive to the heart in rats that exhibit mental_illness, an operational sign of depression induced by subjecting the animals to a series of mild and unpredictable stressors (chronic mild stress (CMS) rodent model of depression).	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
Chronic social isolation produced mental_illness, measured by reduced sucrose intake and sucrose preference relative to the control animals.	synthetic_anhedonia	2008
They administered measures of working and episodic memory, self-report mental_illness questionnaires, and several types of emotional stimuli to 49 individuals with schizophrenia and 47 control participants.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
mental_illness, the inability to experience pleasure, is a major endophenotype of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2008
Upon examining the incremental validity of appetitive functioning (i.e., mental_illness, emotional numbing) over and above aversive functioning (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyper-arousal PTSD symptoms) variables, greater emotional numbing increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, and greater mental_illness increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with additional anxiety disorders and to a lesser extent, psychotic disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Therefore, 32 cannabis abusers (CA) and 30 healthy controls completed a battery of self-reports measuring depression (BDI-13), anxiety (STAI-Y), alexithymia (TAS20; BVAQ-B), mental_illness (PAS; SAS), and sensation seeking (SSS).	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
As predicted, higher levels of social mental_illness were associated with increased time alone, greater preference for solitude, and lower positive affect.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia score correlated with both physical mental_illness and social mental_illness ratings.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
mental_illness was significantly correlated with a reduced response bias.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
On inclusion, they completed the Physical mental_illness Scale as well as the Beck Depression Inventory, and the positive and negative symptoms were rated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006
Changes in hedonic status were indexed for three weeks following a three week baseline period using two standard behavioral measures of mental_illness: sucrose intake and preference and thresholds for brain stimulation reward.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
The confirmatory factor analyses conducted indicated that schizotypy is organized in four factors: mental_illness, Aberrant Beliefs, Distorted Information Processing, and Social Paranoia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2006

Mean changes from baseline to endpoint were examined for items on the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CMAI) and BEHAVE- AD.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Notably, improvements versus placebo were seen in individual activities of daily living and behavior, particularly mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Item Response Theory analyses compared patterns of depressive symptoms across groups and specifically evaluated somatic symptoms (fatigue, change in weight or appetite, psychomotor mental_illness/retardation, and sleep disturbance) as indicators of depression.	synthetic_agitation	2009
The scores of restlessness and psychomotor mental_illness were significantly correlated with the age at transplantation (r = .269, p = .04 and r = .324, p = .01, respectively), the total score of medical comorbidity (r = .273, p = .02 and r = .257, p = .04, respectively), role limitation due to emotional problems (r = -.26, p = .03 and r = -.25, p = .04, respectively) and mental_health (r = -.277, p = .02 and r = -.252, p = .04 respectively).	synthetic_agitation	2005
This study aimed to explore the presence of restlessness and psychomotor mental_illness and their relation with morbidity of patients after renal transplantation.	synthetic_agitation	2006
Theoretical considerations suggest that increasing estrogenic activity or reducing androgenic activity could reduce mental_illness and aggression in dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2008
These symptomatic differences between postpartum and other depressives suggest the need to include mental_illness/restlessness and impaired concentration/decision-making among screening questions for postpartum depression.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Restlessness and psychomotor mental_illness are frequent and can impose high degrees of morbidity on renal transplant recipients.	synthetic_agitation	2009
It was hypothesized that being rejected should produce a sense of social loss and lead to more prevention-focused responses, including withdrawal from social contact, thoughts about actions one should not have taken, and increased feelings of mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2006
Case study information ( n = of individualized music therapy sessions resulted in a 100 decrease of 2 identified mental_illness behaviors, 71 decrease in one identified behavior, and 11 decrease in one behavior.	synthetic_agitation	2005
These symptoms were depressed mood, pathological guilt, suicidal tendency, anhedonia, psychomotor mental_illness, psychic and somatic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms (fatigue).	synthetic_agitation	2008
mental_illness was assessed by the Agitated Behaviour Scale (ABS) prior to the administration of ziprasidone, after two weeks of initiating treatment and at the moment of discontinuing ziprasidone.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Following 10 weeks of restraint free environment, his Cohen Mansfield mental_illness Inventory score declined from 60 (moderate behavioral problems) to 38 (minimal problem behaviors), indicating a significant reduction in mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Data from both studies fully support the fundamental predictions of self-discrepancy theory: Ought self-discrepancies were uniquely related to mental_illness but not dejection, whereas ideal self-discrepancies were uniquely related to dejection but not mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2006
When the individual withdrawal symptoms were examined, depressed mood, psychomotor mental_illness, vivid, unpleasant dreams, and fatigue were associated with more frequent reporting of some of these outcomes.	synthetic_agitation	2005
olanzapine, intramuscular, orally disintegrating tablet, mental_illness, psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Verbal fluency correlated with mental_illness (r = -0.341).	synthetic_agitation	2008
Significant advantages for duloxetine were not achieved at any visit for mental_illness, somatic anxiety, or weight loss.	synthetic_agitation	2006
The authors predicted that internal versus external causal attributions for self-discrepancies should moderate the relationship between self-discrepancies and emotions, resulting in more refined predictions for both mental_illness- and dejection-related emotions and for two additional types of emotion, namely, anger-related and discontent-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2009
The program was based on an understanding of the contributing factors to mental_illness and anxiety, the nursing home environment as it relates to behavior, and the offering of resident-driven recreational activities.	synthetic_agitation	2009
The presence and duration of mental_illness were the strongest predictors of non-compliance with splinting (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively).	synthetic_agitation	2006
A total of 25 cases of NMS occurring in patients with delirium or mental_illness were identified.	synthetic_agitation	2007
mental_illness levels decreased over time and the overall cognitive outcome measures showed significant improvement when comparing the beginning of treatment with the end.	synthetic_agitation	2008
In Study 1, 284 undergraduate participants completed the ISDI to measure ideal-own and ought-own self-discrepancies along with measures of dejection, mental_illness, cheerfulness, and quiescence.	synthetic_agitation	2009
In a range of relationships, ideal relational discrepancies were associated with dejection and ought relational discrepancies with mental_illness (Study, associations moderated by relationship type.	synthetic_agitation	2006
A method of estimating delirium-mental_illness risk in dementia patients (DRN method) is described.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Results support the moderating effects of regulatory foci on the impact of negative anticipated emotions: Anticipated mental_illness induces more favourable action evaluations under a prevention focus; and anticipated dejection leads to more favourable action evaluations under a promotion focus.	synthetic_agitation	2009
People (N =112) completed measures of self-discrepancies and emotions (dejection, mental_illness, positive affect, and negative affect).	synthetic_agitation	2008
On item level, childhood delirium is characterized by a more acute onset, more severe perceptual disturbances, more frequent visual hallucinations, more severe delusions, more severe lability of mood, greater mental_illness, less severe cognitive deficits, less severe sleep-wake cycle disturbance, and less variability of symptoms over time.	synthetic_agitation	2006
In addition, the emergence of certain side-effects (e.g., mental_illness, insomnia) or the persistence of some initial baseline symptoms (e.g., anxiety, insomnia) may lead to premature discontinuation from monotherapy in the absence of concomitant use of augmenting pharmacological options targeting these symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	2006
In this study, the development and trial of the Mahoney Pain Scale, which aims to assess pain in advanced dementia and distinguish it from mental_illness is described.	synthetic_agitation	2008
This highlights a specific clinical gap in the management of hand injuries against a background of mental_illness and cognitive impairment.	synthetic_agitation	2008
The assumption is that psychological practice should be based on certainty, something that is to my mind a mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Results revealed that hallucination-proneness was positively and significantly associated with mental_illness-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2007
We investigated the influence of mental_illness-proneness on identity and expression memory for angry and happy faces.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The outpatients also had higher scores of BEHAVE-AD subscales in mental_illness/paranoid ideation, affective disturbance, and global rating of severity.	synthetic_delusion	2008
We argue that recent cognitive and neurophysiological evidence favours an endorsement model of the mental_illness of alien control.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The mental_illness-prone group showed a higher JTC bias which proved relatively robust across variants.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Although cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) can be effective in reducing delusional thinking in schizophrenia, many patients are considered poor candidates, typically because of a lack of distress from the mental_illness and resistance or low motivation to challenge its validity.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Results are discussed as they relate to reasoning, psychosis and mental_illness-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2007
The potential brain basis of Cotard mental_illness is discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Thus our study, although at preliminary level, suggests that the presence of T allele of the 102T/C polymorphism in patients with Alzheimer's disease is associated with both increased presence of mental_illness symptoms and treatment-resistance to second generation antipsychotic drugs.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Basic to Freuds essay on Jensens romance is that Zoe/Gradiva figures there not just as a proxy psychoanalyst but as a Hermes type of psychopomp accepting the young archeologists dream-mental_illness, while leading him firmly via this underworld into facing erotic feelings he had totally displaced from life to ancient art.	synthetic_delusion	2008
These findings suggested that confabulations in remembering the past and planning the future were affected by psychiatric symptoms such as mental_illness and aggression.	synthetic_delusion	2009
These theme words were either depression-related (i.e., loneliness) or mental_illness-related (betrayal) or had a positive (holidays) or neutral (window) valence.	synthetic_delusion	2006
It reviews many of Freud's insights, contending that although some, such as his understanding of the mechanism of paranoia and the manner by which a mental_illness of persecution is converted into a religious mental_illness of grandeur, have stood the test of time, others, such as the causal relationship he proposes between homosexuality and paranoia, do not.	synthetic_delusion	2005
This study focuses on the psychometric characteristics of a self-report instrument, the mental_illness and Voices Self-Assessment (DV-SA) questionnaire, to assess delusions and auditory hallucinations from the clients' perspective.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Recently, these findings have been incorporated into a number of cognitive models that aim to explain mental_illness formation, maintenance and content.	synthetic_delusion	2005
The words in each list were associated with a central but unmentioned theme word that was either depression-relevant (i.e., loneliness), mental_illness-relevant (betrayal), positive (holidays), or neutral (window).	synthetic_delusion	2006
We report here an investigation of attributional style in a 24-year-old woman with Cotard mental_illness (LU).	synthetic_delusion	2005

Stable schizophrenia patients (n=96) were assessed for disorganization, mental_illness and hallucination symptoms rated from the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms.	synthetic_delusion	2007
The erotomanic mental_illness disappeared in the third month of the euthymic state.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Cotard's syndrome is a psychotic condition that includes mental_illness of a supernatural nature.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The influence of such motivational factors on delusions, which are instances of pathological misbelief, has tended however to be neglected by certain prevailing models of mental_illness formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Thus, whilst accepting that second-stage cognitive disruption has a part to play in explaining the Capgras mental_illness, the emphasis here is placed on the role played by the patient's changing phenomenal content and its congruence with the delusional belief.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The discrepancy between selfperceptions and perceptions of coworkers indicate that competitors especially may have a selfbeneficial mental_illness about the effectiveness of their behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The implications for understanding of the role of self-referent information processing biases in mental_illness formation are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The findings support the notion that subclinical delusional ideation is linked to a self-reference bias, which is evident in the sort of everyday thinking that people engage in when forming or evaluating their beliefs and which may contribute to mental_illness formation.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The present study examined the jumping to conclusions reasoning bias across the continuum of delusional ideation by investigating individuals with active delusions, mental_illness prone individuals, and non-mental_illness prone individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Although current models of mental_illness converge in proposing that delusions are based on unusual experiences, they differ in the role that they accord experience in the formation of delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2006
During development of a scale for measuring delusions, it was found that people who acted violently on their most important mental_illness were more likely to have modified that belief after a mild form of challenge to it.	synthetic_delusion	2005
By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the mental_illness then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Recently, a number of philosophers have argued that Maher's analysis of mental_illness doesnt work when applied to the Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2005
A secondary aim is to examine if NFC is related to the mental_illness-associated reasoning process of 'jumping to conclusions'.	synthetic_delusion	2009
It asks whether believing wholeheartedly in the possibility of authenticity might be a form of self-mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2007

Further, high levels of anxiety, worry and catastrophising were associated with high levels of persecutory mental_illness distress and with the persistence of delusions over 3 months.	synthetic_delusion	2005
We propose that such a disturbance could result in an unstable identification process, vulnerable to discrepancies in perceptual, emotional, or memory input caused by psychotic or organic mental states, thus resulting in a breakdown of the identification process that inevitably leads to a mental_illness of denial of identity, or to a mental_illness of 'doubles'.	synthetic_delusion	2005
The fact that individuals can form a community based on the content of a potentially delusional belief presents a paradox for the DSM diagnostic criteria for a mental_illness, and suggests the need to revise and revisit the original operational definition in the light of these new technological developments.	synthetic_delusion	2008

Further, the potential influences of level of traumatic impact and mental_illness were assessed.	synthetic_dissociation	2009
It was based on structural mental_illness theory (O. Van der Hart, E. R. S. Nijenhuis, & K. Steele, 2006), which postulates that when people encounter traumatic events that they cannot integrate into their ongoing mental lives, their personalities may divide into 2 distinct action systems: the apparently normal part of the personality (ANP; involving systems that manage functions of daily life) and the emotional part of the personality (EP; involving systems related to the traumatic memory).	synthetic_dissociation	2007

The proposed study aims to investigate whether mental_illness-defined as a disturbance or alteration of the usually integrated functions of identity, memory or conscious can be depicted within drawings of the traumatic event drawn by survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_dissociation	2008
This double mental_illness was tested using a go/no-go paradigm with computer-paced fast and slow conditions and a self-paced condition.	synthetic_dissociation	2007
The findings support the idea that (clinically significant) mental_illness is relatively uncommon in alcohol-dependent patients.	synthetic_dissociation	2007
Regulation of play was very disordered in children with autism, with breaking off, mental_illness and instability of actions.	synthetic_dissociation	2008
This study is part of a larger project that examined mental_illness in a student sample in the Philippines.	synthetic_dissociation	2007
The tendencies of mental_illness in the body image of anorexics which we found must be seen in the sense of a specific body image disturbance which differs significantly from the body-experience profile of IvF-patients.	synthetic_dissociation	2006
Fixed or functional, they are essential constituents to neurophysiological processes, such as association, mental_illness, resp.	synthetic_dissociation	2005
Both analyses indicated that an interaction between physical neglect and the S/S genotype of the 5-HTT gene significantly predicted mental_illness in patients with OCD.	synthetic_dissociation	2009
This 4-year prospective study (N=662) of victims of a fireworks disaster examines the independent predictive value of peritraumatic mental_illness for self-reported intrusions, avoidance reactions, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity at both 18-months (T2) and almost 4-years postdisaster (T3).	synthetic_dissociation	2005
Results indicated that some dissociative complaints indeed predicted increased scores on the trauma ratings, while other manifestations of mental_illness were negatively correlated with perceived trauma ratings.	synthetic_dissociation	2006
Post-traumatic stress symptoms were only indirectly associated with attention problems via mental_illness.	synthetic_dissociation	2005
