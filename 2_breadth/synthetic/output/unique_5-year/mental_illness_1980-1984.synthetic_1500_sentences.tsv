The case presentation focuses upon the formal qualities of the patient's communications, many of which were amalgamations of profoundly incompatible elements, particularly a subtle destructiveness which parasitized seemingly impartial reports about her mental_illness.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1984
Careful history of this phenomenon can contribute towards better understanding of a defendant's mental_illness at the time of the alleged offense.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1980
The analyzing instrument has two constituents: a voluntary and controlled, situation-specific and goal-specific regressed mental_illness in the analysand and a near-identical one of the same nature in the analyst.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1984
Projective testing is tentatively defined as a mental_illness, a temporary but adaptive collusion shared between tester and subject which involves the former inviting the latter to modify a sample of reality.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1980
In our opinion, the formless, psychically non-structuralized impulses of genital-oedipal sexuality tend to awaken an inner mental_illness at any stage of life in which the infantile primitive dynamics, helplessness and readiness to destroy, are again repeated.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1982
It is suggested that collaboration is normally based on an apparently paradoxical mental_illness which I call mutual intention.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1982
In agreement with the study by Hines, employee motivation, mental_illness and job satisfaction were still seen by perssonel managers as areas of concern for industrial psychologists Although it is considered that the role of the Australian industrial psychologist will alter primarily as a result of technological changes, management will still need to be convinced of the benefits of those new skills which are developed as a result of such changes.	synthetic_morale	1981
The results lent strong support to the notion that both productivity and mental_illness can be increased by means of organization development techniques.	synthetic_morale	1984
Social reconstruction variables were found to have stronger correlations with mental_illness measures than were demographic variables such as age and social class.	synthetic_morale	1980
The under benefited women also had a higher mean mental_illness score than the over benefited women.	synthetic_morale	1980
The personal, interactive format of the live program has made the show a unique and effective tool for reaching patients, helping individual patients accept different aspects of their care, teaching the children about the hospital, and simply boosting mental_illness through making each child a part of the program.	synthetic_morale	1984
The predicted positive correlation was obtained between mental_illness and frequency of social interaction with persons outside the institution, but men's friendships within the institution were not related to mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1984
Low tangible support and emotional support, in addition to certain life events, were independently related to depression and negative mental_illness; informational support was associated with positive mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1983
Specifically, those equitably benefited women had a higher mean mental_illness score than over benefited women.	synthetic_morale	1983
Pre- and post-evaluation of students' school mental_illness showed no significant changes in Target group attitude toward school.	synthetic_morale	1983
Results suggest that acceptance of oneself as old is related to poorer cognition, functional health, self-esteem, attitudes toward others, ego strength, and mental_illness, as well as to higher incidence of maladjustive behavior and passive mastery style.	synthetic_morale	1984
Predictors of high mental_illness among the widows differed from those for the nonwidowed.	synthetic_morale	1981
The pattern of interrelations among measures of reminiscence, mental_illness, and activity level do not support prevailing views of the adaptive significance of reminiscence.	synthetic_morale	1984
The results suggest that integrating individuals with varying levels of cognitive ability can improve the function of the severely impaired without adversely affecting those less impaired and can positively impact the mental_illness of the group leader.	synthetic_morale	1983
Finally, we discuss how the present hypothesis has an important implication for understanding self-esteem and mental_illness in the elderly.	synthetic_morale	1982
The group structure is designed to encourage the staff to ventilate their concerns, receive constructive feedback, bolster mental_illness, and improvepatient care.	synthetic_morale	1982
Workload achieved was significantly correlated with mental_illness scores.	synthetic_morale	1981
And, unexpectedly, the frequency of interaction with friends for those without stressful events is not found to significantly influence the level of mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1981
This paper is a replication and extension of Carey's study of mental_illness as an aspect of the adjustment of the widowed.	synthetic_morale	1980

A similar pattern of relationship was found between mental_illness and Ward Atmosphere Ideal-Real discrepancies.	synthetic_morale	1982
The present study compared social network size and three types of perceived social support--tangible, emotional, and informational--in relation to stressful life events, psychological symptoms and mental_illness, and physical health status in a sample of 100 persons 45-64 years old.	synthetic_morale	1983
Before and after the visitation period, all subjects were given four tests of cognitive functioning (vocabulary, matrices, memory, problem-solving), three tests of mental_illness (Life Satisfaction Index A; Philadelphia Geriatric Center mental_illness Scale, self-perceived health), and were rated by nursing home activity directors on mental_illness, program participation, alertness, sociability, and physical condition.	synthetic_morale	1983
Key variables from the Kuypers and Bengtson social reconstruction model were operationalized to investigate their relationship to selected measures of mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1980

Boredom and monotony are generally conceded to be negative factors that can have adverse effects on mental_illness, performance, and quality of work.	synthetic_morale	1980
Then available literature is reviewed for evidence that continuity is in fact characteristic of the aging process and for indications that it is positively related to mental_illness in old age.	synthetic_morale	1982
145 participants in three types of programs for elderly persons were compared on leisure activities, attitudes toward leisure, social contacts, mental_illness, and demographic variables.	synthetic_morale	1981
The first of the two scales comprised items exclusively related to health concern, and the second was a more concentrated measure of poor mental_illness than the MMPI Depression scale.	synthetic_morale	1983
When such resources diminish, remaining activities take on added significance for maintaining mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1984
Previous research has found no relationship between the mental_illness of the elderly and frequency of interaction with children.	synthetic_morale	1980
In contrast to previous studies reporting that there is little relationship between grandparenthood experience and life satisfaction, current findings indicate that grandparenthood serves a compensatory function with respect to life satisfaction and mental_illness, particularly for those individuals who are most deprived and who have fewest sources of satisfaction.	synthetic_morale	1980
Next, measures of participation in these lifestyles are included as intervening variables in a multivariate causal analysis of the social determinants of individual mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1983

The results show that replacing paper documents with VDTs need not adversely affect the comfort and mental_illness of office workers.	synthetic_morale	1982
These results revealed that: the mental_illness/anxiety dimension was independent of cognitive competency; newly admitted nursing home residents who perceived themselves as internally controlled (felt that their behavior could affect change) were rated high by others in behavioral competency; self-rating scales apparently measure something independent of the other tests and the ratings by others.	synthetic_morale	1982
Providing support for the hypothesis, the set of six qualitative assessment variables explained 14 of the total variance in life satisfaction, the criterion of mental_illness, when entered at the final stage of the analysis.	synthetic_morale	1980
It was hypothesized that qualitative assessments would make a significant contribution to mental_illness after the application of controls for background influences and activity participation.	synthetic_morale	1982
This strategy has major implications for teaching methods, curriculum, tracking, extra-curricular activities and staff mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1981

The criterion variable, mental_illness, is examined within the context of friend role competence and both face-to-face and phone contact with friends.	synthetic_morale	1980
Specifically, reminiscence was not found to be positively related to mental_illness or negatively related to activity level, nor was it found to mediate between activity level and mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1982
As expected, men who reported overall change in frequency of social interaction scored substantially lower on the PGC mental_illness Scale than those who perceived no change.	synthetic_morale	1982
Personality dimensions included three measures of locus of control and one measure each for achievement motivation, anxiety, and mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1980

Female volunteers (N = 100) between the ages of 60 and 79, who were living in the community and were relatively well functioning, were administered The Rotter Level of Aspiration Test, The Life Satisfaction Index A, The Philadelphia Geriatric mental_illness Scale, The Internal-External Scale, and The Health Locus of Control Scale.	synthetic_morale	1980
Factor analysis of the Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI (FAM) identified factors of Absence of Distress, Depression, Low mental_illness, Feminine Interests, Somatization, and Extroversion.	synthetic_morale	1984
Innovation appears to be a function of an open organizational structure and high staff mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1980
A detailed clinical case illustrates the procedure of hypnotherapy in treating an extreme case of sexual mental_illness.	synthetic_abulia	1981
They point out the negative aspect of the behaviors noted: mental_illness, apathy, selfdenial, passiveness, and especially the failure to recognize the very special syndrome, that is no pure psychosis, nor actual neurosis, not even dementia that is well-known by the neuro-surgeons, badly-known by the experts and forgotten in the tables.	synthetic_abulia	1983
Sexual mental_illness is described as a pathological condition where sexual desire is depressed or absent.	synthetic_abulia	1984
Congruent externality does manifest a significant positive correlation with mental_illness, but this correlation is low.	synthetic_depression	1984
Results indicated that the high stress group showed pre to post changes on anxiety, mental_illness, symptoms, and EMG, while low stress showed no change.	synthetic_depression	1983
At a conference convened by the Clinical Research Branch, Division of Extramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, these findings were reviewed and some of the factors impeding movement towards a more complete and integrated view of the functioning of neurobiological systems in patients with mania or mental_illness were identified.	synthetic_depression	1981
Results indicated that the inclusion of nonpathological items in the D scale did not lead to greater predictive validity of mental_illness criteria.	synthetic_depression	1984
The second study examined possible sex differences in the self-labeling of mental_illness, attitudes toward seeking help for mental_illness, and actual help-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_depression	1983
Diagnosis of the child's mental_illness was made on the basis of DSM-III criteria.	synthetic_depression	1981

The correlations between self-esteem and mental_illness were significant (.34 to .75) for both measures of mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1984
Data for different age samples and for both sexes are presented for use in the evaluation of the significance of anxiety and mental_illness levels in patients presenting with these symptoms.	synthetic_depression	1981
The notion of sex differences in mental_illness is well documented in the clinical literature.	synthetic_depression	1984
In comparison to males, females reported significantly more medical and psychiatric symptomatology, including mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1983
Three hypotheses regarding the possible etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, anxiety and mental_illness) is isomorphic, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day increases in emotionality; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) increased headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) increased affect.	synthetic_depression	1983
This study tested whether learned helplessness could be induced using noncontingent positive reinforcement (nickels), and in addition provided a differential test of Seligman's versus Lewinsohn's model of mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1980
These results are interpreted as confirming the second component of Beck's negative cognitive triad but as failing to support the presence of the cognitive distortion of overgeneralization in mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1983
The Zung Self Rating mental_illness Scale (SDS) and a Kinetic Family Drawing (KFD) task were administered to hospitalized depressives who met the DSM-III criteria for Major mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1980
Persons with higher scores on mental_illness in both groups showed less responsiveness of their lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin and to allogeneic cells.	synthetic_depression	1983
Analysis indicates that these behaviors are often associated with stress, anxiety, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1984
These symptoms may require, at least initially, a management approach not necessarily in the best interest of treatment of the underlying mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1984
All patients were classified according to ICD-9 and the group of depressions was further classified according to the Newcastle Rating Scales for mental_illness (Carney et al.	synthetic_depression	1981
Predictably subjects who faked well had significantly lower scores than either of the other two experimental groups, however there was no difference between the Fake Well and Control group on the GHQ total or the Somatic and mental_illness scales.	synthetic_depression	1980
This study examined the effects of induced elation and mental_illness on the interpersonal problem-solving efficiency of normal college students.	synthetic_depression	1982

Studies of aphasic patients using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron computed tomographs have shown areas of metabolic mental_illness in the left hemisphere larger than the area of infarction noted on CT.	synthetic_depression	1983
Although hopelessness has been postulated as the primary mediator that links mental_illness and suicide, empirical evidence has produced varied results.	synthetic_depression	1980
Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals and severity of mental_illness assessed using the Hamilton mental_illness rating scale.	synthetic_depression	1980
The rather weak connection between psychosomatic disorders and social stressors was noteworthy in comparison with the potent association between the psychiatric symptoms of anxiety/mental_illness and stressors.	synthetic_depression	1981
An earlier age of onset in patients with postpartum mental_illness was the only variable that was significantly different between groups.	synthetic_depression	1983
This factor must therefore be carefully considered in biochemical and therapeutic investigations into mental_illness, and may account for the seasonal variation in mental_illness and suicide that have been reported by many investigators.	synthetic_depression	1982
The findings revealed that: (a) anxiety and mental_illness marked a single adjustment factor; (b) self-esteem mediated the relationships between instrumentality, expressiveness, and adjustment, such that when the variance due to it was removed, neither instrumentality nor expressiveness accounted for significant variance in Anxiety-mental_illness; (c) the Short BSRI index of expressiveness behaved differently from the other indices and more like that of the PAQ; (d) instrumentality and expressiveness interacted significantly, such that instrumentality was positively associated with adjustment for those with low or average expressiveness and expressiveness was positively associated with adjustment only for those with low or average instrumentality; and (e) men high in instrumentality and low in expressiveness reported slightly higher adjustment than androgynous men.	synthetic_depression	1981
A strategic approach to mental_illness is outlined.	synthetic_depression	1983
Implications for the issue of the possible existence of a clinical syndrome of mental_illness in children were discussed.	synthetic_depression	1984
Moreover, the similarity of the factorially derived dimensions confirmed the cross-age and -sex generality of the syndromes known as unforthcomingness, hostility, and mental_illness, and provided reasonable support for the utility of the syndrome of inconsequence, although it was apparent that inconsequence stands as more a composite of underlying factor dimensions reflecting hyperactive and attention-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_depression	1981
The results are discussed in terms of the effects of frustration on direction of aggression; it is also suggested that the findings may be relevant to the revised learned helplessness model of mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1981

One states that mental_illness is a motivational deficit, where motivation equals a person's expectancy of an outcome multiplied by the value of that outcome.	synthetic_depression	1983
Subjects randomly assigned to elation, neutral, or mental_illness mood induction procedures completed an interpersonal problemsolving task.	synthetic_depression	1984
To further explore the personality characteristics and examine disciplinary attitudes manifested by abusive mothers (AMs), 20 AMs receiving Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) and 20 nonabusive, ADC mothers were administered the Family Concept Inventory, a measure of self-esteem (California Test of Personality), selected items from the MMPI reflecting mental_illness/apathy and resentment/ agression, measures of reward- and punishment-oriented disciplinary stance, a series of seven Eriksonian developmental conflict scales, and selected stimuli from the TAT.	synthetic_depression	1981
Implications of these results for future research on anxiety and mental_illness were discussed.	synthetic_depression	1980
Adolescent women appear to be different from women over 30 who have been reported to show significantly increased state anxiety and mental_illness during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle.	synthetic_depression	1981
By vigorously working through the relevant factors with the appropriate methods of intervention, mental_illness, in my experience, lends itself very well to brief psychotherapy most of the time.	synthetic_depression	1984
Published reports of toxic mental_illness during treatment with methylphenidate are rare.	synthetic_hallucinosis	1981
Parts II and III present the relatively infrequent categories of typical dream bizarreness and demonstrate that (a) in departing from realism dreaming tends toward a delirium--visual mental_illness and cognitive clouding--and seems distinct from schizophrenic, psychedelic, or meditative states and (b) if dream anomalies show a symbolic transformation process, then the roots of that process are visual-spatial, not verbal-propositional.	synthetic_hallucinosis	1984
Two cases are described and it is suggested that methylphenidate-induced mental_illness is more common than has been appreciated.	synthetic_hallucinosis	1984
Lateralization of paroxysmal EEG features was studied with reference to MMPI personality measures (Blackburn's Impulsivity and Sociability and Welsh's mental_illness), legal diagnosis, type of offence, and relationship to victim.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
The data suggest that (a) future studies which give patients more positive expectations and reduce their mental_illness about recovery may improve their recovery and (b) the types of patients most in need of preoperative psychological support would be those who have higher trait mental_illness, vigilant coping behaviors, or an internal locus of control.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Divergent creative problem-solving did not significantly increase state mental_illness, perhaps because the employed subjects were students and may have felt more comfortable with divergent problems than the average population.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
In the first canonical variate, size overestimation and subjective body image distortion were both associated with MMPI scales reflecting somatization, mental_illness, and atypical thinking; in the second variate, size overestimation alone was found to be associated with introversion and depression, while subjective body image distortion aligned with somatization and atypical thinking.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Some individuals exhibit significant and sustained periodicities in their self-reports of physical well-being, mood, hours of sleep, mental_illness and cognition.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
The effectiveness of two different relaxation procedures was compared in treating snake anxious people who expressed mental_illness primarily in a somatic or a cognitive manner.	synthetic_anxiety	1984

The students' predictions significantly differed by test mental_illness; the predicted score was inversely related to test mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
Results generally confirmed hypotheses made by the E that Autobiographical Recollections was the superior method for inducing and altering depression and mental_illness in a population that included both sexes.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
The arena of play can be characterized by four characteristics that facilitate the development of the analogs to adult work: play provides the opportunity for children to learn, develop, and perfect new skills that buildcompetence; play is the child's natural mode to master mental_illness from overwhelming experiences of everyday life, which builds thecapacity to cope with the environment; play helps build the ego's capacity to mediate between unconscious and conscious realities, which enhancesego strength; and play repeats or confirms a gratifying experience that fuels a child'sinvestment in life.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
The purpose of this study was to compare regular and irregular or non-attenders for dental check-ups on a number of variables, including sex and age, self and family dental mental_illness, and previous dental experience.	synthetic_anxiety	1984

STAI A-State and A-Trait mental_illness scores were significantly higher than standard scores for all patients other than young cancer patients.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
This was interpreted as being consistent with a view that both cognitive and behavioural variables influence social mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
We think that we have collected a certain amount of arguments in support of the following hypothesis: Without assuming if it is in itself the cause of neuroses, the way of being and of thinking in this world, characteristic of our times' positivistic technico-industrial culture seems to promote a more or less artificial and unconscious anti-mental_illness behaviour leading to the psychosomatic syndromes.	synthetic_anxiety	1984
The results confirmed the hypothesis that high state mental_illness would be associated with poor mathematics achievement; trait mental_illness showed no significant relationship to achievement.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Subjects were examined with a psychological test battery including personality questionnaires (Giessen, STAI), pregnancy attitude scales (SSG = pregnancy, sexuality and birth questionnaire; mental_illness frustration selfrating scale for pregnancy (= SAFS), and a test for autonomous imbalance (VELA).	synthetic_anxiety	1982

who defined themselves as either high or low in self-perceived religiosity exhibited less death mental_illness than individuals in the medium range.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
Client mental_illness was found to function as a moderator variable on treatment effectiveness.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
Affected monkeys, although able to correctly match, would not consume the food pellet reward, showed signs of mental_illness, and performed only 25 of the usual 200 problems offered each day.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
The results indicated that there was no decrease in test mental_illness levels except in the case of third grade boys, but appeared to cast some doubt upon the construct and content validity of both scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Others have advocated the diagnosis of discrete psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, or mental_illness disorder.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
The two groups did not differ in heart rate; however, in State mental_illness and Emotional Lability, the group of good perceivers had significantly higher scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
The design was 2 (competition/no competition) X 3 (competition trait mental_illness), with state mental_illness and performance as the major dependent variables.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Examined the applicability of EMG biofeedback to alleviating subjectively experienced test-taking mental_illness along with the effects of relaxation training on locus of control.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
The three groups showed significant decreases in mental_illness after the activity.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
Theoretical and empirical efforts concerning cognitive processes associated with mental_illness have typically emphasized either cognitive deficits (i.e., reduced learning, memory, and task performance) or cognitive excesses (i.e., increased self-focused, ruminative thought).	synthetic_anxiety	1981
Aggression was observed during the hospital stay by 58 of the patients followed closely by bizarre behavior (55) and mental_illness (53).	synthetic_anxiety	1984
The interaction of impulsivity and mental_illness in the performance of perceptual-motor tasks is also reflected in psychophysiological measures; differences in impulsivity are more evident with electrocortical measures and differences in mental_illness are reflected in ANS measures while performing the tasks.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
The state-mental_illness items from the State-Trait mental_illness Inventory were administered prior to and following the treatment/control conditions.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
The hypothesis that individuals with greater mental_illness would believe more strongly in the efficacy of Laetrile was supported.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
It was theorized that separation mental_illness related mechanisms hinder children's ability to fully profit from preschool experiences.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
mental_illness, insecurity and lack of skill in establishing appropriate relationships prevented workers obtaining adequate bases for evaluation and for effectuation of treatment.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
These findings support the contention that situational trait mental_illness is a multi-dimensional phenomenon.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
We argue that methodological problems preclude this conclusion, and a modification of Houston's experiment was designed to test the idea that internal subjects do not interpret their arousal as mental_illness because their arousal facilitates performance, while defensive external subjects interpret their arousal as mental_illness because it hinders performance.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
Reduction in subjective feeling of mental_illness was observed with both CO2/O2 and air intake.	synthetic_anxiety	1983
treatments for test mental_illness were investigated using 155 undergraduate volunteers.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
Maladaptive coping and trait mental_illness also demonstrated independent additive effects on felt stress and job satisfaction over and above that of all four stressors.	synthetic_anxiety	1984
The depressive patients reported significantly more symptoms (global neuroticism, mental_illness, somatization, and hostility) than controls.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
The factors found among the 17 variables were: I. mental_illness; II.	synthetic_anxiety	1981
In conclusion, cognitive psychology paradigms are discussed in terms of their application to the assessment and treatment of mental_illness disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1984
The emotional effects of muscle relaxation are only one of many sources of inhibition of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1982
The problems discussed refer to the assessment of mental_illness, to the definition of the mental_illness state and to the problem of unspecific drug actions and of response variability to drugs.	synthetic_anxiety	1984
We have examined the applicability of the Hamilton mental_illness Scale (HAS) and our Melancholia Scale (MES) on a group of patients suffering from cardiac disease.	synthetic_anxiety	1980
Those learning-disabled children who also experienced internal difficulties tended to score high on the Somatic Concern Scale, while behavior-disordered children typically scored high on the other Internalization scales (i.e., mental_illness, Withdrawal, etc.).	synthetic_anxiety	1982
This example is followed by an explication of the multiple principles of mental_illness which were operative in that example.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
The study indicates that self-mental_illness can produce changes in behavior and mood which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health, although paradoxically, the act of mental_illness by this technique is pressor.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Also considered here are a number of relevant studies on the use of mental_illness and biofeedback training of accommodation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
In addition, the use of mental_illness in therapy may lead to differential or intensified therapist and patient reactions, largely in the areas of countertransference and transference and in shifts in intimacy and attachment between therapist and patient.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
Some of the difficulties encountered by subjects during self-mental_illness are discussed: incomplete dissociative experiences; anxieties about self-control; doubts about the reality of the self-hypnotic state; and the possibility that negative attitudes, habits, and expectations may act countertherapeutically as posthypnotic suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
In general, facility in self-mental_illness increased with age.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
This model is compatible with recent trends in experimental mental_illness and behavior therapy, especially self-control research.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984

Clearly, his colleagues understood him to deny existence to mental_illness as a state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
This paper contributes to that end by relating his mental_illness research and theory during the years 1921 to 1933 to the developing behavioral orientation of his learning theory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
In a fourth condition, the Oedipal paramnesia was presented to Ss who had been instructed by coexperimenters to simulate mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980

Literature on this topic is reviewed, and important problems in conducting clinical research on mental_illness for hemophilia are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981
The essence of the phobic experience is not unlike that of the event of mental_illness, and the phobic experience might be a spontaneously occurring panic-filled trance-like or dissociative experience.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981
For those who are responsive to mental_illness, the experiences can be unusual and involving.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
Several myths concerning mental_illness emerged (e.g., mental_illness is a passive state, there are sex differences in hypnotizability, posthypnotic amnesia is inevitable, and there is automatic obedience to the hypnotist).	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
They were asked under mental_illness to speak in the different mental states, such as resting tensed and relaxed periods with either strong or weak voice and in various tempos.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Of the 24 patients who accepted mental_illness, 19 were highly hypnotizable.	synthetic_hypnosis	1980
From this premise it follows that what goes on in the relationship prior to mental_illness probably has an influence on the mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
A course in mental_illness which is given to the residents in anes-thesiology was evaluated in a clinical pilot study designed to assess the effectiveness of the course.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982

The authors present a new method of interweaving hetero-hypnotic psychotherapy and self-mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1982
Attempts to produce age regression and positive or negative hallucinations are markedly more successful in hetero-mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
However, their relatively modest relationships with measures of psychopathology suggested that the pleasure-deficits they measure best may not be as characteristic of psychiatric conditions as that reflected by the mental_illness Interview.	synthetic_anhedonia	1984
Subjects were selected by high or low scores on two questionnaire scales measuring physical mental_illness (PA) and body image distortion (BI).	synthetic_anhedonia	1984

Patients with pervasive mental_illness and autonomy of depressed mood (endogenomorphic depressives) were treated first with the noradrenergic agent desipramine (DMI), then, if still depressed, such patients were randomized double-blind to continued DMI or clomipramine (CMI), a primarily serotonergic agent.	synthetic_anhedonia	1980
The high degree of relationship between mental_illness and introversion, long suggested by clinicians, is confirmed and discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1984
Such positive Digit Span scatter seems to be a correlate of an interpersonal detachment syndrome characterized by superficial relationships and mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1981
The Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin (1976) Social and Physical mental_illness scales demonstrated superior reliability and more correlations with pleasure-seeking ratings than the other scales, at least before correction for attenuation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1981

Increases in negative affect, activity level, heart rate, night wakings, and crying characterized the hospital period as one of mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1981
The results of this analysis suggested a two factor orthogonal model of well-being: one factor reflecting fatigue, emotional fragility and confusion (worn-out) and the other tension, anxiety and mental_illness (up-tight).	synthetic_agitation	1984
On admission there was a more pronounced connection between anxiety and psychomotor mental_illness, on discharge between anxiety and psychomotor retardation.	synthetic_agitation	1984
The high-IT depressed patients, on the other hand, showed preponderance in the items 'guilt', 'suicide', 'insomnia', 'mental_illness', 'anxiety psychic', 'loss of insight', 'depersonalization' and 'paranoid symptoms'.	synthetic_agitation	1981

These changes were more consistent with an interpretation of induced mental_illness, tension and fear than with an interpretation of despair.	synthetic_agitation	1983
Although his failure has been most commonly attributed to scientific and medical conservatism, there were a number of other factors which appear to have been of importance, including the general atmosphere of Paris, political mental_illness that became associated with his work, and sexual innuendoes that arose from the exotic nature of treatment in his famous clinic.	synthetic_agitation	1980
Although 29 and 290 nmoles/min Bt2cGMP caused mental_illness and no increase in feeding, only normal behaviors were observed with the 2.9 nmole/min dose.	synthetic_agitation	1984
Although both drugs supported the pattern of increased mental_illness-related CRs, only the lithium-paired flavors elicited chin-rub CRs (Experiments 1, 3, and.	synthetic_agitation	1982
In the doctors; ratings Italian patients scored higher for variables referring to motor retardation and hypochondriasis, and Swedish patients for variables referring to inability to feel and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1980
However, her loss of memory for recent events lasted more than ten days and was accompanied by psychomotor mental_illness and transient alteration of sexual behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1983

Administration of beta-CCE (2.5 mg/kg) to chair-adapted, male rhesus monkeys (7-9 kg) elicited a behavioral syndrome characterized by extreme mental_illness, head and body turning, distress vocalization and other behaviors which might be termed 'anxious'.	synthetic_agitation	1984
In total, 16 pathological behaviors were coded and the most frequent (postural deviance, pace, mental_illness, hyperactivity, withdrawal, foot shake/body sway, leg swing) were selected in order to determine variation in frequency of these behaviors as a function of the following variables: area within hospital, week of hospitalization, distance between the focal subject and his/her nearest neighbor, number of people in an area, and time of day.	synthetic_agitation	1984
Compared to psychomotor retardation, psychomotor mental_illness appears to be seen more frequently in women, older patients, and individuals who have a late onset to their illness.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Rarely an incoherent state of mental_illness or stupor could be observed.	synthetic_agitation	1982
Lastly, older depressives (relative to younger ones), particularly neurotic ones, show the following pattern of adjustment: Less alienation, less vigor, less confidence in skills, poorer work history, less abuse of alcohol or drugs, more social constriction, more mental_illness, and fewer household management skills.	synthetic_agitation	1981

In addition, those with mental_illness alone appeared to have a better and faster response to electroconvulsive therapy.	synthetic_agitation	1984
A combination of both characteristics occurred in depressive patients with symptoms such as mental_illness, tension, and hypochondria.	synthetic_agitation	1983
The current context contains data concerning the current state of the patient and the hospital unit and represents immediate limitations (e.g. organic brain syndrome) and pressing needs (e.g. mental_illness requires immediate sedation).	synthetic_agitation	1983
The group of patients with disturbances of perception had a positive family history for affective illness (p less than 0.025), a smaller number of previous depressive episodes (p less than 0.05), a greater frequency of delusional thinking (p less than 0.001) and psychomotor mental_illness (p less than 0.05).	synthetic_agitation	1983
At higher dose levels, injections of morphine into the same structures produce behavioral mental_illness resembling the dissociated REM sleep described by Jouvet and which is not blocked by naloxone.	synthetic_agitation	1982
The further analysis revealed a differential relationship of the amine metabolite concentrations to some prominent symptoms: mental_illness was significantly dependent only on the HVA level while disorientation and hallucination seemed to be determined mostly by the serotonin metabolite 5HIAA in the CSF.	synthetic_agitation	1981
Results of a factor analytic procedure suggest that the LRS contains four affective dimensions: Depletion, Isolation, mental_illness, and Dejection.	synthetic_agitation	1983

Excessive use of analgesics may produce salicylism, sometimes marked by mental_illness and hallucinations.	synthetic_agitation	1983
Symptoms range from confusion and mental_illness to coma.	synthetic_agitation	1982
Classical psychoanalysis has stated that religion is a mental_illness, a view not shared by the majority of the American public.	synthetic_delusion	1980
If religion is a mental_illness, then to share a mental_illness with a patient or to impose a delusional belief system on a patient would constitute unethical behavior on the part of the therapist.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The locating of the elements (the signifiers) of such symbolic dysfunction is essential because the mental_illness attempts to repair this defect in the representational order.	synthetic_delusion	1984
A critique is offered, showing how these theories fail to account for several important clinical phenomena found in patients with the Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The morbid positive induction of these subsystems stimulates mental_illness formation.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The psychodynamic explanations for the Capgras mental_illness are reviewed.	synthetic_delusion	1983

The development of mental_illness is favorised by a non-control of the dialogical structure of the language under social pressures.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The authors believe that Christianity is not a mental_illness; therefore, to share the Christian faith with a patient whose ethical belief system is the same as the therapist's is ethical if the patient has indicated a willingness to explore this area of life.	synthetic_delusion	1984
In endogenous psychosis one observes an order in the morbid inhibition of the subsystems of A.B.S. An attempt is made to analyse the relations in M.D.P. as one aspect of mental_illness formation.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The work of the analysis consistants of attempting, on the basis of the signifiers put forward by the mental_illness, to assist the psychotic in his reconstitution of symbolic order.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The function of hallucinatory mental_illness often appears to make up for successive frustrations, sexual and affective insufficiency or sensorial isolations, and then avoids too painful suffering to the patient.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The results are that mental_illness and suicide attempt are subject to a communicative principle, whereas suicide is subject to an anticommunicative principle.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The hypothesis that the cultural mental_illness among alcoholics--that one drink makes a drunk--is critical in determining how the individual copes with a slip was examined in a sample of 82 outpatient alcoholics taking part in an abstinence-based alcohol-recovery program.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The mental_illness is the access road to this work in psychosis just as the dream is the royal road to the unconscious in the neurosis.	synthetic_delusion	1984
Two clinical cases (an asexuation mental_illness, an agressive misogyny) show the systemic interrelations in one of their sides only.	synthetic_delusion	1981
mental_illness, attempted suicide and suicide are represented as phenomena of pathological communication by means of system theory.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The psychodynamic theory of the Capgras mental_illness is reviewed and critiqued.	synthetic_delusion	1980
Our numerous observations that the act of suicide leading to death is never carried out in a state of mental_illness are interpreted within the framework of the communication model presented here.	synthetic_delusion	1983
Phenomenic, dynamic and clinical aspects are specially emphasized and a case of somatic mental_illness is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The Messiah mental_illness is discussed in more detail, with a historical example from the 17th century.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The author tries to explain patho-psychophysiocally some aspects of mental_illness formation in maniac-depressive psychosis (M.D.P.).	synthetic_delusion	1982
A new explanation is offered based on the findings in a large series of schizophrenics with the characteristic mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1981
Using the communication model of orienting behavior the pathological phenomena of mental_illness, suicide attempt and suicide are dealt with in a communication-theoretical framework.	synthetic_delusion	1983
A psychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of a mental_illness, infestation by parasites, is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1983
The most obscure part of the personality, the non-self, is the origine of a mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1980
All things which if properly dealt with and if we want to avoid the traps of authoritarianism or of the narcissistic mental_illness will lead us in the interest of others, to the most realistic modesty.	synthetic_delusion	1983
This hypothesis is based on findings in a series of fourteen schizophrenic patients with the typical mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1983
On this basis, the relationship of mental_illness to suicide attempts and to suicides is examined.	synthetic_delusion	1983
No evidence was found to suggest that the cultural mental_illness, as measured by the Schaeffer questionnaire, was a factor in predicting postslip drinking behavior.	synthetic_delusion	1982
The present clinical-looking of the P.H.C. allows to establish that: the mechanisms used by the mental_illness have been little altered through time, the themes taken are impregnated by late scientific discoveries and with present socio-political context, the frequency of evolution to encysted forms have increased with modern chemical therapeutics.	synthetic_delusion	1982
Whereas the immediate experience would involve dream-like sequences, terror, perceptual changes, mental_illness, vestibular alterations, auditory sensations, and profound meaningfulness, post-episodic effects would include amnesia, time loss, confabulation, crisis suggestibility, and electroconvulsive shock symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	1980
The results were explained using the model proposing that individuals experiencing continued mental_illness or derealization episodes suffer from a more generic anxiety or phobic-anxiety based disorder labeled phobic-anxiety mental_illness syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
The present study assessed the prevalence and characteristics of mental_illness phenomena in a nonclinical population.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
In each of the two rotated factor matrices empirical support was obtained for the presence of three a priori (hypothesized) dimensions of Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness, and Personal Accomplishmentconstructs around which three MBI subscales had been designed.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
The present study was designed to assess whether individuals reporting experiences of mental_illness or derealization experience higher levels of anxiety than those subjects not reporting these experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
The split in the ego between consciousness and unconsciousness which sometimes eventuates in fetishism can also be clinically manifested in sleep disturbances, mental_illness, dej vu and a variety of alterations in the sense of reality.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
No significant sex differences were noted but relationships between years of experience of mental_illness and intensity, frequency, and number of experiences were significant.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
221 undergraduates volunteered to complete questionnaires on mental_illness and derealization and the IPAT Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
Undergraduate students (N = 388) responded to a questionnaire soliciting information regarding the experience of mental_illness, age at onset, number, frequency, duration, and intensity of mental_illness experiences, level of pleasantness/unpleasantness, diminution of experiences with and without professional assistance, and relation of mental_illness to other factors.	synthetic_depersonalization	1983
The responses to the MBI produced the three factors previously named by Maslach as Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
Results of this analysis indicated that when employed with teachers, the MBI measures the same basic constructs or factors as those identified through studies in the helping professionsEmotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
Teachers with more students tended to produce higher scores on the mental_illness scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
Of the Ss, 34 reported mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
Analysis indicated that subjects experiencing mental_illness or derealization scored higher on the anxiety scale than those not reporting these experiences, while subjects who reported both mental_illness and derealization scored the highest.	synthetic_depersonalization	1980
Three subscales emerged from the data analysis: emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
The author reviews a number of neurotic disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, the phobic anxiety-mental_illness syndrome, depressive neurosis, and psychophysiologic disorders, with regard to the effectiveness of various classes of psychopharmacologic agents and the current understanding of the pharmacologic basis for their therapeutic effects.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981

However for teachers, mental_illness separated into a job related and student related factor.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
A psychogenic mental_illness lasting six days occurred in a 15yearold girl living with her mother, sister, and stepfather.	synthetic_fugue	1983
The argument between situational and psychodynamic interpretations of mental_illness is reviewed briefly, and a family systems interpretation of the present case is offered.	synthetic_fugue	1982
The mental_illness was of the most complete type the patient assumed a new identity; spoke a foreign language she had studied in school; regressed to an earlier period in history; radically altered her dress and grooming; and showed skills, interests, and personality features she had not shown before.	synthetic_fugue	1983
Compared to their counterparts under no humor conditions, subjects listening to humor passages felt more vigorous and less fatigued, experienced less mental_illness and annoyance, and reported greater involvement and interest in these sessions.	synthetic_irritation	1982
The subjective questionnaire indicated that CO significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the subjects' confidence concerning their performance on the vigilance task, as well as causing significant (p < 0.05) mental_illness of the eyes and throat.	synthetic_irritation	1984
Fathers had higher mental_illness and spoiled ratings, and lower care for ratings, than mothers.	synthetic_irritation	1984
Therapists responses to suicidal patients include: anxiety, increased interest, restraint, mental_illness, avoidance, denial, and passivity.	synthetic_irritation	1984
Oral mental_illness was induced by rinses with capsicum oleoresin and with piperine, constituents of red and black pepper, respectively.	synthetic_irritation	1983
mental_illness and aggression is absent among the New Guinean babies.	synthetic_irritation	1982
Factor analysis of the remaining 27 items yielded two interpretable factors, labelled Entertainment and mental_illness-Boredom.	synthetic_irritation	1983
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures correlated with self-reports of job strains (satisfaction, mental_illness, depression, physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_irritation	1983
In Experiment 1, 50 microencapsulated odorants were rated as to their intensity, pleasantness, mental_illness, coolness, and familiarity, and two procedures for releasing them were compared.	synthetic_irritation	1980
Abnormal results were found in 43 patients (19), leading to diagnoses of reflex sympathetic dystrophy, nerve root mental_illness, and thoracic outlet syndrome.	synthetic_irritation	1982
Participants also reported less anger, mental_illness, and desire to change the other in response to open expression of differences.	synthetic_irritation	1984
did not change baseline levels, the prolactin levels after electrical mental_illness without seizure were about the same as those following a genuine seizure; atropine apparently facilitated stress-induced prolactin release.	synthetic_irritation	1981
Electrically induced seizures were followed by temporary elevations in serum prolactin over baseline in rats, while electrical mental_illness made no change.	synthetic_irritation	1982
In 1965, questionnaire data were obtained for 1,353 inhabitants of a Yugoslavian town on the following variables: blocked expression of feelings and needs; psychosocial stress in the form of either lasting depression and hopelessness or lasting anger and mental_illness; harmonization and idealization, with negation of self; rational orientation with repression of emotions; psychopathological symptoms; explosive behavior, including exposure to adverse environmental conditions, abuse of medicines etc, ignoring signs of illness, hyperactivity.	synthetic_irritation	1981

Difficult infant cries received higher mental_illness and spoiled ratings; were rated as more grating, arousing, piercing, etc.;	synthetic_irritation	1983
Application of the novel scaling technique magnitude matching, whereby persons judged the perceived magnitude of various levels of an irritant, odorant, and tone in the same session, implied that smokers actually perceive mental_illness less keenly than nonsmokers.	synthetic_irritation	1981
These aspects of endogenous blinks are related to mental_illness variables.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1980
Because the individual's involvement with a substance has taken place during the crucial developmental phase of adolescence, and because the use of drugs alters one's perception of one's social, emotional and mental_illness, any experience during this time must, by necessity, be distorted.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1981
High mental_illness and/or trait anxiety was found to be associated with more preoccupation and performance denigration as well as taking less of an analytic attitude toward the situation.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1982
Variables such as age, mental_illness and length of stay had no effect upon the continence level at the end of the programme, whereas there was a clear association between the initial level of incontinence and the end results.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1982
Both rate and duration of growth exceeded that reported in dermatological literature, suggesting that autonomic activity associated with anxiety and mental_illness are correlated with physiological changes precipitating hair loss.	synthetic_nervousness	1984

Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal trigers a mental_illness of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of sufficient severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually experiences a loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of depression.	synthetic_trauma	1981
