Steady-state plasma levels of clonazepam were significantly correlated with daily doses (rs = 0.795, P < 0.005) and therapeutic concentrations ranged between 6.5-83.9 micrograms/l. At the onset of therapy, the clinically titrated loading dose resulted in plasma concentrations within the narrow range of 18.9-34.0 micrograms/l. These results support the potential value of clonazepam in the short-term management of acute mania; the initial control of anxiety was achieved with plasma drug levels in a remarkably narrow range as compared with the further control of mania.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Management of anxiety was equally distributed between environmental manipulation, formal behaviour care plans and medications.	synthetic_agitation	1999

All skilled nursing facilities (SNF) in the state of Connecticut were surveyed to determine the number of residents with a primary diagnosis of brain injury, the incidence of anxiety among these residents, and management strategies utilized for anxiety in these residents, including consultation with brain injury specialists.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Many nursing home residents are candidates for antipsychotic pharmacotherapy for dementia-related behavioral disturbances that include physical anxiety and aggression, verbal outbursts, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Three such scales, the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia (C-BRSD), and the Cohen-Mansfield anxiety Inventory (CMAI), are useful in clinical trials.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Improvement in anxiety was significantly more prominent (P < 0.001) among fluoxetine-treated than among placebo-treated patients.	synthetic_agitation	1999
However, the discrepancy between the ratings was statistically significant only for Language Disorder, Higher Cognitive Deficits, Memory Disorder, Dementia, and Apraxia, and not for anxiety, Need for Routine, Depression, and Disorientation scales.	synthetic_agitation	1999

A multi-factorial model of anxiety formation and maintenance incorporating a data-gathering bias and attributional style, together with other factors (e.g. perceptual processing, meta-representation) is consistent with the current evidence.	synthetic_delusion	1999
One explanation for anxiety formation is that they result from distorted appreciation of complex stimuli.	synthetic_delusion	1996
Beliefs in possession or demonic influence are not confined to delusional disorders and should not be qualified as a mere anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1997
However it appeared that only a few contents of anxiety are frequent in both countries.	synthetic_delusion	1997

Behavioral and self-report data indicated that virtuosos experienced a transient anxiety about their sex that was compelling and resistant to challenge.	synthetic_delusion	1997
The significance of formal discontinuity evident in delusional perception authorized the psychiatrist to pause on the threshold of anxiety without making allowances for the disastrous lack of comprehension so typical of delusional perception, which in turn must be studied from an interpersonal perspective, not as if it were an aseptic object in a laboratory.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Subsequently, there was personality change, memory-impairment and the persisting 'anxiety' that he had been involved in an earlier car-accident.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The probable dynamics that lead to this anxiety are then discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1998
A few case reports on the anxiety of pregnancy can be found in the published literature.	synthetic_delusion	1999

A non-randomized matched groups design was employed enabling the performance of the anxiety prone individuals to be compared to that of a control group.	synthetic_delusion	1999
From the clinical and evolutionary perspective, it is unclear why a anxiety should merit, simply because of its nihilistic content, a special brain location or presage chronicity.	synthetic_delusion	1995

Analyses indicated the effects of feeling spurned on anxiety and also the benefit of emotional support; however, no evidence was obtained for he proposed buffering effect of emotional support.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Although within self-categorization theory it may be argued that the discrepancy is a function of a salient social self that perceptually discounts the personal self, it can also be argued that anxiety allows for the cognitive possibility of perceiving similar amounts of personal and group discrimination.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
We assessed three components of burnout of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion; anxiety (DP); and personal accomplishment, as well as natural killer cell activity (NKCA) and NK cell subsets in 42 male workers.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995

Stepwise (forward) multiple regression analyses indicated that scores for collective efficacy accounted for only 6.3 of the variance in the intensities of anxiety anxiety and only 22 of the variance in the positive affect experienced prior to the rugby match.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
These hypothesised direct effects on social judgements were subsequently incorporated into a broader statetrait model of the social judgement process, whereby direct and indirect effects of personality and cognitive traits, along with positive affective states and information-processing demands (i.e. anxiety), were also hypothesised to influence social judgements.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Three hundred and eight subjects reported their trait levels of introversion-extraversion and need for cognition, and were subsequently induced into an affective state (content, happy, surprise, or neutral) and a anxiety (heuristic or substantive information processing).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Stepwise regression analyses controlling for player characteristics revealed that attentional control and goal-setting strategies contributed to lower anxiety anxiety, attention control and imagery/ relaxation strategies resulted in lower somatic state anxiety, and attention control and positive self-talk contributed to increased state self-confidence.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996
The technique allows opinions regarding anxiety to be statistically based.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996

Twenty-seven percent of the suicidal cases met operational criteria for anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1997
The results suggest that anxiety in AD is not severe and is unrelated to patient self-awareness of illness.	synthetic_depression	1997
Specificity was very high (0.97) but sensitivity low (0.18), indicating that a majority of those with a CIDI-defined depressive episode in the past 6 months were not recognised at a single screening using the CIS-R. Even so, the CIS-R has proved at least as good as any pencil and paper questionnaire in identifying cases for nested case-control studies of adolescent anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1998

All forms of interpersonal dependency are related positively with N. Exploitable and submissive dependency are increasingly negatively correlated with C and O, whereas love dependency is positively correlated with C and O. Implications regarding the assessment of dependency and multifactor models of dependency are discussed, and hypotheses for future research linking dependency and anxiety are proposed.	synthetic_depression	1999
We describe the development and validation of a 25-item Adult Children of Alcoholics Tool (ACAT) in three separate studies: (a) The ACAT was administered to a normative student sample and a clinical outpatient sample to develop a scale with satisfactory reliability and criterion validity; (b) these findings were replicated with a sample of social work students and another clinical sample, providing further construct validation with other measures of current mental_health functioning (e.g., anxiety, internalized shame), and family of origin characteristics; (c) using a third student sample, the ACATwas found to be significantly correlated with the Adult Children of Alcoholics Index, suggesting measurement of a similar but not identical construct.	synthetic_depression	1997
However, patients with HIV infection did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for major anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1995
Outcome and efficacy expectancies explained anxiety via emotion-oriented coping but did not explain impaired mobility range either directly or indirectly.	synthetic_depression	1997
The N dimension for the recovered patients at Time 2 was at least 1 standard deviation above that of a normative sample, suggesting that N may be a predisposing factor for major anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1997
LISREL analysis of the model shows that psychological well-being (self-esteem) is a much stronger predictor of suicidal ideation than physical well-being (physical symptoms), especially when anxiety is introduced as an intervening variable in the model.	synthetic_depression	1996
The CIS-R had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.49 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.91 for CIDI anxiety in the past 6 months.	synthetic_depression	1999
The Schwab-Gilleard anxiety Scale is a short self-report index for assessing anxiety in elderly people.	synthetic_depression	1997
Specificity to anxiety suggests that low self-concept should be associated with low PA, whereas its inclusion in the proposed criteria for mixed anxietydepression (Zinbarget al.	synthetic_depression	1995

Although no differences in problem-focused coping were found, mothers of adults with mental_illness used more emotion-focused coping, which predicted greater maternal anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1995
Personal and professional role traits that predicted a positive therapeutic attitude were high scores on social desirability or self-monitoring and low scores on thanatophobia and anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1999
This study compares 26 subjects with this disorder to 20 non-DPD subjects who have similar histories of longstanding early-onset anxiety on three personality measures, the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), NEO-Five Factor Inventory, and Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ).	synthetic_depression	1995

The results indicate, as predicted, that people with more optimism towards life are less prone to anxiety and loneliness.	synthetic_depression	1995
anxiety was unrelated to age or apolipoprotein E genotype.	synthetic_depression	1996
However, in practical investigations, many factors associated with anxiety, apart from the hypnotic induction itself, might lead to memory enhancement compared with standard police interviews.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Although there was a general trend of differential item difficulty levels across the 2 administration conditions, a variety of results (descriptive characteristics, reliability, and validity) point to the similarity of behavioral and subjective responses to anxiety in the 2 conditions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
In light of this response, and considering both the scientific importance of being able to identify the presence of anxiety and the fact that catalepsy may account for up to eight of the other indications of anxiety in use, it is relevant to inquire into the reliability and validity of catalepsy tests.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Acceptance of anxiety by professional organizations has been followed by alternating periods of interest and indifference.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999

After this period, the study was unblinded, and all the patients were treated for an additional 3 months with anxiety with active suggestions of improvement.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Course graduates were concerned that the widespread mythology and strong feelings surrounding the term anxiety eclipsed its empirical validation and its practical uses and was a significant barrier to interest in learning hypnotic techniques; 75 thought that the term should be de-emphasized in continuing medical education communications.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
An alternative perspective is that for some participants, anxiety alters the experience of retrieval such that items generated during retrieval attempts are more likely to have the qualities (e.g., perceptual fluency, vividness) usually associated with remembering.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Results showed that, when automatism through anxiety was implicated as well as duress, the defendant offering the plea was judged less responsible, however, he was not judged less guilty than when duress alone was the defence.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999

These results suggest that anxiety in the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia has no specificity but appears independent of coexisting depression and covaries with several characteristics of depression (retardation, cognitive distortions).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Affect recognition abilities, an important component of successful social functioning, were examined in two groups of schizotypal subjects who were identified by the Perceptual Aberration/Magical Ideation and Physical anxiety Scales (PABS, MIS, PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Two-year stability of Physical anxiety (PhA), Perceptual Aberration (PER), and Magical Ideation (MI) scale scores and their relation to personality disorder traits were examined.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
anxiety was rated by the Physical anxiety Scale of Chapman (PAS), the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale-Physical Pleasure (FCPCS-PP), and the social interest subscale (SIS) of the Nurse Observation Scale for Inpatients (NOSIE-30).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
L.A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model that groups symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 subtypes: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of somatic tension and arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety, and symptoms of anxiety and low Positive Affect that are specific to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
anxiety and Somatic Arousal were significantly less valid measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Contrarily to what is evidenced for major depressives and for healthy subjects, the depressive symptomatology correlates with anxiety in deficit schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Patients with high anxiety did not show this asymmetry, whereas patients with low anxiety showed an intermediate asymmetry.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
No correlation was found between anxiety and visceral perception; however, anhedonics were significantly different from normals across several measures of heart rate, self-report, and facial expressions in response to emotion-eliciting slides, with anhedonics consistently showing emotional hypo-responsiveness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
However, self-report of anxiety was found also to be subject to the influence of defensiveness, and neither the depression inventory nor the anxiety measure was significantly related to parent and physician ratings of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Analysis revealed that depression in medical patients was best distinguished by symptoms of anxiety, low positive affect, and physiological hyperarousal, whereas syndromal depression in psychiatric inpatients was specifically characterized by negative cognition symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Reduced consumption of sucrose or saccharin solutions by CMS rats has been used as a putative measure of anxiety, typical of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
As a consequence, Rado and Meehl placed anxiety at the heart of their schizophrenia theories.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
A search for more restricted forms of schizophrenia characterized by severe anxiety is needed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
A principal components analysis with varimax rotation indicated that (a) rare but not bizarre and atypical word associations were related to creativity; (b) rare word associations that were bizarre, isolated, and atypical were positively related to psychoticism and to psychopathic deviation; (c) long reaction time and repetition of the stimulus word before responding were related to suspiciousness, and (d) the P scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) tapped some features of social anxiety, social deviance, and mild antisocial behavior.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Negative schizotypy, narrowly defined as social anxiety, was related only to divergent thinking, whereas a more general measure of negative schizotypy, psychoticism, was related to creative personality and perception.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
anxiety was a helpful clue for diagnosing depression in patients who denied depressed mood.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
anxiety and sensation seeking were respectively defined by two reliable rating scales: Physical anxiety Scale of Chapman (PAS), Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale (SS form V -40 items).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Our findings support the view that physical anxiety is a construct distinct and separate from alexithymia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
L. A. Clark and D. Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and anxiety (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
The second hypothesis tested was that optimism, self-esteem and a positive mood state at the time of test taking will also be negatively related to physical anxiety, or individual differences in the ability to experience pleasure from everyday activities or situations.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Victims scored highest in internalizing behavior and also psychosomatic symptoms, and they themselves reported anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These results are not readily understood within the theoretical framework of the CMS model of anxiety and imply instead that both the neural and psychological correlates of motivation may be less susceptible to modulation by the effects of CMS than the free consumption of sweet solutions.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The aim of the present study is to present a model of depressive vulnerability centered on anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
This study was designed to evaluate patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for major depressive disorder using three diagnostic approaches, to assess the Beck Depression Inventory as a screening instrument for major depression, and to examine the association of anxiety with a diagnosis of major depression in ESRD patients who deny depressed mood.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Four symptoms: anxiety, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation had acceptable utility for the diagnosis of mixed states.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
The NRMs group scored significantly higher than the non-religious, but not the religious group, on the factor of Introvertive anxiety, which measures negative symptomatology, suggesting that this factor may be related to religion rather than NRMs per se.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments have been used to treat the behavioral or non-cognitive symptoms, such as anxiety, in Alzheimer's dementia.	synthetic_agitation	1995
These results suggest that low-dose propranolol should be further studied for treating aggression or anxiety in demented patients.	synthetic_agitation	1999
In all three cases, therapy attendance stabilized at a high level, disruptive behaviour decreased, and anxiety was maintained at a moderate to low level.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Assessment of anxiety in pharmacological studies should include consideration of the specific meaning to the agitated behavior for the older person and for the caregiver, along with an evaluation of the consequences of the behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Controlling for individual differences in mood levels, multilevel regression analyses showed that events were followed by increases in negative affect (NA) and anxiety (Ag) and by decreases in positive affect (PA).	synthetic_agitation	1998
Neither delusions nor anxiety predicted greater treatment response.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Three general approaches are used to assess anxiety: informant ratings, observational methods, and technological devices.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The behavioral symptoms seen in patients with dementia are diverse, ranging from anxiety to hallucinations and paranoid delusions.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Whether anxiety is part of the underlying course of depression or iatrogenic complicates treatment planning.	synthetic_agitation	1998

Forty-five percent of these 39 facilities had brain-injured residents who met the definition of anxiety presented in the survey.	synthetic_agitation	1996
In addition, anxiety, psychiatric, and side-effects symptoms decreased significantly in both groups.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Data derived from this large series of clinical trials suggested no evidence that either fluoxetine or TCAs induced psychomotor anxiety at rates exceeding the natural course of the disorder over time (placebo cohort).	synthetic_agitation	1998
Correlation analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence for three dimensions of psychological well-being: engagement-apathy, happy sad mood, and calm-anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Side effects noted were increased blood pressure (N = and subjective restlessness/anxiety (N =.	synthetic_agitation	1999
All three individuals were noted to have a depressive illness which was notable by the prominence of symptoms of irritability, anxiety and aggression.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Two dimensions of student teacher behaviour have been extracted: the active-passive-dimension, describing the degree of intensity of a student teacher's actions when transferring (verbal) messages to the pupils; and the anxiety-harmony-dimension, defining the degree of tension the student teacher arouses in the relationship between teacher and pupils.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Scales differ according to the source of information (e.g., caregiver versus patient), type of behavior assessed (e.g., mood, anxiety, or delusions), origin of the scale (i.e., imported from psychiatry, adapted from psychiatric scales, adapted from scales for neurologic conditions, or developed specifically for dementia), and anticipated application of the tool (e.g., behavioral characterization, longitudinal follow-up, or differential diagnosis).	synthetic_agitation	1998
The correlation between caregiver reports and professional assessments was highest for anxiety, intermediate for psychosis, and lowest for depression.	synthetic_agitation	1998
The suicide attempters revealed an increase in psychomotor anxiety until the discovery of the suicide and a decrease thereafter, whereas the anxiety of the nonsuicidal patients continued to increase from the start to the end of the film.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Apathy, anxiety, mood disturbances, irritability, disinhibition, delusions, aberrant motor behavior, and abnormalities of sleep and eating are common in AD.	synthetic_agitation	1998
This survey study defined the prevalence of brain-injured residents in Connecticut's SNF, and examined management strategies for anxiety in this patient population.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Tools developed to measure anxiety are either too unreliable, or else reflect this conflict of definition and are not comparable.	synthetic_agitation	1995
All studies found that goal attainment yielded greater cheerfulness-dejection responses when promotion focus was stronger and greater quiescence-anxiety responses when prevention focus was stronger.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Later anxiety, aggression and disinhibited behaviors may appear.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The second category is moderating approaches, which can be used in the acute phase of ABI recovery for management of severe behavioural episodes that may be associated with conditions present at this time, such as anxiety and confusion.	synthetic_agitation	1997
These two cases suggest that gabapentin may cause anxiety in cognitive impaired patients.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Ten patients presenting anxiety and anger outbursts at various stages following a severe closed head injury, were treated in a prospective open trial with carbamazepine, with doses ranging from 400 to 800 mg per day, during 8 weeks.	synthetic_agitation	1998
In these patients, disruptions of circadian rhythms can be severe enough to increase mental decline, anxiety during the day, and restlessness at night.	synthetic_agitation	1995
In addition, psychomotor anxiety was rated at several points during the film.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Belief in demonic influence has repeatedly been described as a anxiety in schizophrenic patients.	synthetic_delusion	1997
A woman, LB, while in recovery from a viral encephalitis, exhibited a anxiety for place, which led her to insist that she was at home, in spite of compelling evidence to the contrary.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Mean duration of anxiety was 3.0 +/- 4.6 years (median: 1 year).	synthetic_delusion	1995
In both countries persecution was the most frequently mentioned content of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1995
This review describes two clinically significant face processing deficits, prosopagnosia and Capgras anxiety, and provides new knowledge about the face recognition process by a convergence of empirical findings.	synthetic_delusion	1996
It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and diminished personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Finally, contrary to hypothesis 4, it turned out that high identified group members evaluated self and ingroup more independently than lows which contradicts the idea of anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
The level of anxiety was related only to general support whereas a personal accomplishment factor was related to both types of support.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Masculine gender role stress was related to emotional exhaustion and anxiety for both male and female professionals, whereas feminine gender role stress was related to similar burnout dimensions for male professionals only.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
In terms of moderator effects, the results indicated that high NA experienced greater anxiety from co-worker support than low NA.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Two hundred and fifty-nine female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30 recruited from college campuses completed self-report measures assessing sexual and physical abuse in childhood as well as current perceptual impairments (reality distortion, uncertainty of perceptions, hallucinations and delusions, and psychoticism) and dissociation (amnesia, absorption and imaginative involvement, and anxiety and derealization).	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Especially with regard to the attitudinal components of burnout, i.e., anxiety and Personal Accomplishment, secondary school teachers reported higher scores than elementary school teachers.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
anxiety; 2.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, anxiety, a sense of relieving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
The results showed that: organizational stressors were more prevalent than task-related stressors; compared to other service jobs, police officers report a particular profile on the three scales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)?a relatively low level of emotional exhaustion,an average level of anxiety, and a high level of personal accomplishment; burnout is associated with a lack of reciprocity between investments and outcomes in the relations that officers have with citizens, colleagues and their organization; and burnout is positively related to attitudes towards use of violence and the use of violence during the officers' duty.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and Jackson 1986), which yields scores on three sub-scales; emotional exhaustion, anxiety and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
In contrast, but also according to the authors' predictions, anxiety and personal accomplishment were not associated with job demands.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995

Although hemispheric activation on hypnotic challenge may depend in large part on the kind of task the challenge might involve, several general aspects of anxiety might be more appropriately seen as left-rather than right-hemisphere brain functions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Controlled studies provide less dramatic but empirically sound support for the use of anxiety with this problem.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
This relationship carries a power differential, present in most therapeutic relationships, but accentuated by anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
However, whereas high hypnotizable participants produced substantial numbers of confident recall errors (i.e., intrusions) independent of the use of anxiety, low hypnotizable participants exposed to hypnotic procedures reported significantly more intrusions than their counterparts in the waking condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Contrary to their conclusions, evidence that the rate of hidden observer response (like other hypnotic responses) varies with the wording of instructions does not contradict neodissociation theory; rather, it underscores the fact that anxiety entails social interaction as well as alterations in conscious awareness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
In addition, anxiety appeared to enhance facial recognition accuracy for participants who were low in anxiety, but not for those high in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997

Based on Wegner's (1994) ironic process theory, it is argued that this pattern of results is inconsistent with theories of anxiety that propose that hypnotized individuals intentionally engender responses while remaining unaware of their sustained, deliberate effort.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
This illusion of familiarity would account for the higher levels of confidence that are so frequently observed in hypnotic recall, and adopting this perspective should lead to even greater caution in the use of anxiety as an aid to retrieval.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
