The author notes that the Freudian psychoanalytic view of religion has become a saturated concept that causes psychoanalysts to abuse the complexity of the religious experience.	synthetic_disregard	1995
In this article it is suggested that this method seems questionable for several reasons: it seems to abuse the way that the English writing system operates; it does not consider the multisensory nature of language functioning; it ignores the particular difficulties of dyslexic learners.	synthetic_disregard	1997
Both social support and abuse mediated the relationships between stress and marital quality of life.	synthetic_disregard	1997
The results indicate a number of areas in identifying and reporting cases of child maltreatment which teachers may abuse.	synthetic_disregard	1997
A recent review of the Continuous Performance Task (CPT) as a research tool by Corkum and Siegel, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 34, 1217-1239, 1993, is criticized for insufficient covering of the relevant literature, abuse of the question of differentiation among clinical groups, and inadequacy of explanations of Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in terms of arousal, activation, and effort.	synthetic_disregard	1998
Decision makers, however, often commit the base-rate fallacy, that is, they underweight or abuse base-rate information and defer instead to case-specific information, even when it is irrelevant to the decision.	synthetic_disregard	1999
An inclination was found among students to minimize social and cultural factors as risk factors and to abuse signs that did not contain explicit signals of danger as characteristics of maltreated children.	synthetic_disregard	1998
There was also an almost total abuse for and antagonism towards the tutorial system.	synthetic_disregard	1996
This paradoxical effect of abuse instructions was not observed for participants presented with otherwise equivalent, nonemotional evidence.	synthetic_disregard	1997
A series of experiments investigates a phenomenon we call goal neglect: abuse of a task requirement event though it has been understood and remembered.	synthetic_disregard	1995
The only condition in which extinction was partially reduced was when the instructions called for total abuse of the right stimulus.	synthetic_disregard	1997
On the one hand, clinicians are urged to be more rigorous and analytical when assessing a client, to abuse their intuitions and instead utilise explicit rules and algorithms.	synthetic_disregard	1996
Although subjects were instructed to abuse changes in scale, recognition performance was reliably better for the untransformed objects.	synthetic_disregard	1998
Difficulties in the work, and obstacles to change, appeared to derive from: the therapists' tendency to abuse problems in the relationship; not enough work focused on separation and negative, hostile feelings.	synthetic_disregard	1996
Because of this there is a tendency to abuse the immediate relationships within the school community, which serve as a basis for moral and spiritual development.	synthetic_disregard	1999
The reasons for this abuse or avoidance are explored.	synthetic_disregard	1995
These results demonstrate the perceptual element of received support and abuse as well as the importance of considering the provider's perspective.	synthetic_disregard	1999
Despite the judge's instructions that they abuse the information, jurors' verdicts were affected significantly by the information, unless the jurors were made suspicious about the motives underlying the introduction of this information.	synthetic_disregard	1998
Constructivist epistemology, in particular, is seen as oppositional to behaviour-based instruction and scientistpractitioner intervention, and its abuse for empiricism is cause for concern that ineffective practices will be maintained.	synthetic_disregard	1999
The 1934 return to legal prosecution represented the recovery of two traditions: the radicals' abuse for issues of sexual freedom and tsarist legal custom.	synthetic_disregard	1998
TRAUT classifies autisms as stemming from either an arrant abuse for the blot shapes (HYPO), an inordinate attention to unusual blot areas (HYPER), or an endorsement of counterfactual relationships among blot areas (RELER) included among Exner's Unusual Verbalizations.	synthetic_disregard	1997
It is not infrequent in a longitudinal setting to abuse sampling considerations, which can be very unfortunate.	synthetic_disregard	1995
A longitudinal study examined perceptions of received and provided social support and abuse among members of 248 infertile and fertile married couples.	synthetic_disregard	1997
Stories reflecting care, togetherness, adaptability, reconstruction, and humorwere positively linked to satisfaction, whereas those portraying abuse, hostility, chaos, divergent values, and personality attributeswere negatively related to individuals feelings about their family.	synthetic_disregard	1995
Therefore, the biases may have been due to self-advantageously biased estimates of this optimum, rather than to a total abuse of the collective interest.	synthetic_disregard	1997
Though correlations between CONVEX tests were weak, the common element that these tests did share was closely related to g and to a phenomenon we call goal neglect, or abuse of a known task requirement.	synthetic_disregard	1995
The writer considers why some patients present an apparent commitment to the work of therapy, through regular and reliable attendance at sessions, whilst seeming to abuse or attack anything of value in the therapy.	synthetic_disregard	1998
The article questions current biological research in the behavioral field for both its reductionistic thinking as well as its abuse of the developmental process.	synthetic_disregard	1995
In self-deception persons accept false beliefs through a motivated abuse for countervailing evidence.	synthetic_disregard	1999
The results indicate important areas in detecting cases of child maltreatment which students from the four disciplines may abuse.	synthetic_disregard	1999
These limitations include (a) its lack of any explicit motivational principle, (b) its reliance on a purely selfevident connection between the crucial responsibility beliefs and anxiety or distress, (c) its omission of a plausible account of important qualities of obsessivecompulsive phenomena, such as their compulsiveness and repetitiveness, and (d) its abuse for proximal etiological factors in the occurrence of the intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_disregard	1998
Thus, for participants exposed to emotionally charged incriminating evidence, the impact of this evidence was enhanced by instructions to abuse it.	synthetic_disregard	1998
In particular, the whole sample denied negative emotions, such as abuse, annoyance, and irritation, and did not report positive emotions, such as attraction or curiosity.	synthetic_disregard	1996
Previous research has shown that sometimes simulated jurors abuse inadmissible evidence, and sometimes they do not.	synthetic_disregard	1995
In selfdeception persons accept false belief through a motivated abuse for countervailing evidence.	synthetic_disregard	1995
It requires the researcher to approach informants who are in art therapy as an anthropologist entering another culturewith respect, humility, and a willingness to abuse their professional biases as much as possible.	synthetic_disregard	1998
Standard decision theoretic models abuse the phenomenon of interpersonal dependency of preferences.	synthetic_disregard	1995

Self-reports of loudness, abuse and other distressing effects were monitored from pretreatment to four months follow-up.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
Judgments of abuse appear to be more context dependent whereas loudness judgments may reflect a perceptual process more closely related to physical aspects of the signal.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
An abuse and a distraction index were formed on the basis of a factor analysis.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
The individual estimated loudness and abuse of tinnitus are registered as well as a general emotional status.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
Further data based on 166 patients demonstrate that tinnitus abuse was to some extent different from patterns of general psychological complaints, although there were medium intercorrelations with depression.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
Visual appearance also explained relatively high portions of neighbouring, but only on the abuse dimension.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
Reactions to persistent abuse were studied with a new laboratory method.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
Hostility and monitoring were positively and significantly correlated with abuse extent (r = .34, r = .31, respectively).	synthetic_annoyance	1999
abuse and discomfort during exposure to high-frequency noise from an ultrasonic washer have been examined in the experiments carried out with 10 subjects.	synthetic_annoyance	1999

If subjects are instructed to judge the abuse of an auditory signal, they may respond differently than if asked to judge its loudness.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
Significant results indicated increased hassles, particularly in the 24 premigraine hours; psychological arousal (increased irritability, abuse, and tenseness), predominantly from 60 to 24 hours before the attack; repeated fatigue in the 60 premigraine hours, with a peak immediately before the attack; and a sharp decrease in sleep quality in the night preceding the attack.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
Several situational dimensions were found to have a robust effect on abuse extent crossculturally.	synthetic_annoyance	1996
Significant predictors of tinnitus abuse were (a) continuous tinnitus without intervals, (b) hearing loss, (c) increasing tinnitus loudness over time, (d) poor maskability, (e) history of sudden hearing loss, and (f) associated craniomandibular disorder.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
Finally, hostility was negatively correlated with abuse variability.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
Two Canadian student samples (N = 73 and N=79) completed a questionnaire to determine the effects of nine situational dimensions on abuse extent.	synthetic_annoyance	1996
Eight situational dimensions conceptually related to harm (damage, correctability, investment), control/information (intentionality, expectedness, agent, preventability) and social context (audience) consistently affected abuse extent.	synthetic_annoyance	1996
Concerning the group therapy, many of our patients reported an increase of the pretherapeutical estimation of tinnitus loudness and -abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
Information about responses to noise and factors that might affect abuse were collected in questionnaires.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
A withinsubject design tested the effects of situational dimensions (e.g. damage, intentionality), on abuse extent, and a correlational design tested the relation between individualdifference traits and abuse extent and variability.	synthetic_annoyance	1996
A standard escalation sequence was found, which involved the following order of tactics: requests for termination of the abuse, impatient demands, complaints, angry statements, threats, harassment, and abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
Results assessed at pre-and post-treatment showed decreased abuse and increased coping with tinnitus.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
A reduction of tinnitus loudness and abuse after individual and group therapy is seen directly.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
abuse was found mainly to be related to sound level, self-rated necessity of the noise, hearing status and sex.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
There is a paucity of theory pertaining to social surveys of abuse and community noise.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
abuse variability was defined as difference in abuse extent between severe and mild provocations.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
The problem which thus becomes apparent can be now be handled by reconstructing the exterior events (interactions) and by the symbolic presentation of the interior perception (abuse, anger, rage).	synthetic_annoyance	1999
The most critical noise sources for the abuse response were other machines than those used by oneself, whereas telephone signals had the largest effect on distraction.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
This study wished to replicate previous findings on the effects of situational factors on abuse extent of Israeli students in Canadian students, and to examine the roles of trait hostility and monitoring in abuse extent and variability.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
Regulatory decisions concerning abuse and community noise should be more valid when based on a deeper understanding of the theoretical basis of the empirical data.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
A new psychophysical model addresses data concerning resident abuse in sites exposed to various maximum noise levels and different numbers of noise events.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
No significant difference between abuse and discomfort was observed.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
The negative correlation between hostility and abuse variability may reflect cognitive and/or response biases.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
The argument identifies a number of psychological and physical variables that may influence abuse reactions to community noise.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
Reciprocal understanding of meaning between label and expression was found for disgust but not for contempt (abuse was the preferred label for the contempt expression and anger expressions were preferred as exemplars of contempt).	synthetic_annoyance	1998
In addition, their perceptions of neighbouring were measured with the Multidimensional Measure of Neighbouring (MMN), which taps supportive acts of neighbouring, neighbour abuse, neighbourhood attachment, and weak social ties.	synthetic_annoyance	1998
After a short exposure during which the subjects rated their abuse and discomfort, a broad-band noise was matched to the ultrasound.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
The difference between the two studies is that the subjects in 1994 were asked to scale loudness while the present subjects were asked to scale abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
Federal policy problems are related to the government's reliance on limited data from a dose-response model and the neglect of key psychological issues such as individual differences in reactions to environmental noise, the psychological factors that mediate abuse and that identify subgroups that may need protection from stress-related health effects, and the relationship of perceived control to public response.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
The matchings indicated, however, that the A-weighting, i.e., the traditional rating technique used for noise evaluations, overestimated the high-frequency sound when evaluating abuse and discomfort.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
As the ages of the target children increased, role expectations for the siblings became more alike in some ways (e.g. affection and aggression) but less alike in others (e.g. respect and abuse).	synthetic_annoyance	1998
Analyses showed that ultrasound causes considerable abuse and discomfort even for the lowest exposure levels.	synthetic_annoyance	1995
It is a major antecendent of noise abuse reactions, and is assessed by obtaining responses to one or several rating-scale items.	synthetic_annoyance	1997
The present study examined the usefulness of personal variables: noise abuse, and components of the protection motivation theory (R. W. Rogers, 1983) along with social-organizational factors in explaining hearing protection device (HPD) use among Israeli manufacturing workers.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
The factors emerged as theoretically meaningful dimensions tapping the concepts of supportive acts of neighboring, neighbor abuse, neighborhood attachment, and weak social ties.	synthetic_annoyance	1999
The most powerful predictors of HPD use were perceived self-efficacy (for long-term HPD use), perceived susceptibility (to hearing loss), and noise abuse, together explaining 48 of the outcome variance.	synthetic_annoyance	1999

The history of racial abuse provides powerful projection highways that can be used to maintain these internal splits.	synthetic_exploitation	1995
Even examples of conscious abuse of the cooperative principle by unscrupulous actors help to prove the cooperative principle precisely because there is a principle that can be easily exploited.	synthetic_exploitation	1995
Because of racial prejudice, economic abuse, and negative stereotypes, group forces have been especially detrimental to the personality development of people of color.	synthetic_exploitation	1997
The former effect is attributed to the abuse of elasticity (Guiard, 1993).	synthetic_exploitation	1997
Recent social science research suggests that individuals with intellectual disabilities and/or mental_illness are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse, yet it is rare for successful prosecutions to occur where the complainant has some form of mental impairment.	synthetic_exploitation	1996

These alternative living arrangements reflected the women's powerlessness and the high levels of sexual abuse and degradation of women in the inner-city crack culture.	synthetic_exploitation	1999
I contend that the interplay between those who focus their research on the so-called genetic inferiority of some groups and the resultant policy recommendations coming from such arguments must be viewed in the context of racial stratification, gender inequality, class abuse, and public discourse on who is intellectually able and who is not.	synthetic_exploitation	1995
Subjects who cannot fully participate in informed-consent processes are especially vulnerable to abuse.	synthetic_exploitation	1999

But such relationships, especially of a sexual nature, may lead to violations of confidentiality and objectivity, abuse, psychological damage, and educational distortions.	synthetic_exploitation	1996
A low value of the latter measure was considered to reflect the adoption of a cyclical movement regime facilitating the abuse of elastic properties of muscles and tendons during execution.	synthetic_exploitation	1997
High scorers reported experiencing more interpersonal abuse, greater depression, lower self-esteem, more externalizing attitudes, and less control in relationships than low scorers.	synthetic_exploitation	1996
Writers about the labour process tend to emphasize the issue of labour abuse and gender and race discrimination but, to some extent, seem to overlook the problem of ageism in work and employment.	synthetic_exploitation	1999
Also, as expected, loss aversion heightened abuse: when the others were cooperative, a give dilemma generated less cooperation than a take dilemma.	synthetic_exploitation	1997
The present findings provided strong cross-cultural support to previous Western studies that found females with mild mental retardation of high risk to sexual abuse and in need of specially designed prevention program to enhance their competency against sexual victimization and abuse.	synthetic_exploitation	1998

Focus groups are relatively naturalistic and so avoid the charge of artificiality; they offer social contexts for meaning-making and so avoid the charge of decontextualization; and they shift the balance of power away from the researcher toward the research participants and so avoid the charge of abuse.	synthetic_exploitation	1995
While feminism now encompasses a variety of theories of gender and strategies for change, there remains the need for a common core of beliefs centering around women's oppression, subordination, abuse, and the need for transformation.	synthetic_exploitation	1999
The ability to balance these two tendencies can be considered fundamental to successful adaptation within a social unit because co-operation may be essential in raising offspring, competing with other groups or in generating resources, whereas egoistic behaviour may protect the individual from abuse or otherwise enhance reproductive success.	synthetic_exploitation	1999

Discriminatory treatment is defined in terms of limited job related opportunities and exposure to sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1996
Results indicate that sexual abuse influences both proximal and distal work-related variables (e.g., job satisfaction, work withdrawal, job withdrawal) and psychological outcomes (e.g., life satisfaction, psychological well-being, distress).	synthetic_harassment	1995
We administered to a sample of undergraduates the ambivalent sexism inventory along with the fact patterns in two abuse cases and asked them to make legally relevant decisions under either the reasonable woman or person standard.	synthetic_harassment	1998
However, little research has addressed the effects that an increased public awareness of sexual abuse has had on employees of organizations, including college and university instructors.	synthetic_harassment	1997
Existing research indicates that sexual abuse is a frequent form of victimization of women, affecting around half of all women, with verbal abuse being more common that nonverbal abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1997
In the abuse condition, subjects told four stories without abuse, and then told four more stories with abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1999
This study addressed three sources of variability in the perception of sexual abuse: the gender of the observer, the gender combination of the harasser and victim, and the role relationship between the harasser and victim.	synthetic_harassment	1998
Using the sexual addiction model, attachment theory, trauma research, and theory and research on incestuous behavior, sexual abuse is explained as escalating cycles of trauma reenactment.	synthetic_harassment	1999
