Overall, these data suggest that when using depression questionnaires to assess the prevalence of depression in OSA, questionnaires that have a lower proportion of symptom overlap between OSA and depression, as well as a higher proportion of anxiety symptoms, reduce the likelihood of overestimating the prevalence of depression in OSA.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
Deficits in memory have been suggested as an influential mechanism of anxiety, because while pleasant experiences may be enjoyed inthemoment, the cognitive processes involved in reporting anticipated or remembered enjoyable experiences is thought to be impaired.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
The present results suggest novel neural models of anxiety in MDD, vigilance-withdrawal behaviors in SAD, and poorer outcome in MDD-SAD.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016

Yet, psychometric data on anxiety measures in adolescents are absent.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
Participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms had significantly higher mean anxiety scores and anxiety sensitivity scores and lower mean distress tolerance total scores compared to participants without clinically significant depressive symptoms (p < 0.001).	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
At time 1, temperament and character explained 47 of the psychological QoL variance; self-directedness was the strongest predictor of higher QoL, while harm avoidance and introverted anxiety predicted worse QoL. At the 1-year follow-up, self-directedness remained the most important predictor of psychological QoL. Individuals reporting PE can show psychological QoL when they are high on self-directedness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017

Many studies did not report whether psychotic symptoms in MD-psych patients were mood-congruent or mood-incongruent; hence it is unclear whether the type of anxiety increases suicide risk.	synthetic_delusion	2019
When the state identified as a problem self-state is an abuser/protector self-state, complications often involve the profound nature of transferencecountertransference enactments between patient and therapist, the anxiety of separateness, chronic and acute threats of suicide, negative therapeutic reactions, and the evocation of intense negativity.	synthetic_delusion	2015

Somatic symptom disorder was associated with misidentification and preoccupation with normal bodily sensations such as hunger, bladder filling, borborygmi, rhinorrhea, and reflux; excessive concern over the incompletely understood meaning or source of pain or other symptoms; and Cotard syndrome or the anxiety that unidentified somatic symptoms signify death or deterioration.	synthetic_delusion	2018
We believe a spectral model will add emphasis to the continuity of experience and help to better understand how one type of psychotic symptom may interact with another, and put forward the argument that the experience of TI itself is not sufficient to classify as a anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Moreover, the severity of delusions in study 1 and anxiety-proneness in study 2 were significantly correlated with vividness, emotional intensity, and centrality of memories of anxiety-like experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2017

The burnout dimensions showed high scores in Emotional Exhaustion (38.95), in anxiety (23.68) and in lack of Personal Accomplishment (23.16), along with the presence of moderate to high levels of distress (54.21).	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The results show that workload positively affects emotional exhaustion, whereas social support negatively affects anxiety, thus further corroborating the health impairment process and motivation process as assumed by the job demands-resources (JD-R) model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
anxiety, a dissociative subtype characterized by disconnection between oneself and ones body and/or thoughts, may further explain the role of dissociation in NSSI.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Symptoms of dissociation, including dissociative amnesia, anxiety, and derealization, commonly develop in individuals subject to chronic and repeated trauma during development.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
The prevalence of dissociative disorders was as follows: 18.5 dissociative disorder not otherwise specified, 14.8 dissociative amnesia, and 3.7 anxiety disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
PD patients scored higher on items suggesting common forms of derealization and anxiety, perhaps suggesting secondary and defensive psychological processes, while lacking indicators of more profound ipseity disturbance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Four hypotheses were studied: (H1): burnout (i.e. emotional exhaustion, EE, and anxiety, DP) will be positively associated with suicidal tendency; (H2): will be negatively related to physical health (i.e. large number of physical symptoms and long-lasting impairment); and (H3): positively linked to addictive behaviours (i.e. addiction to alcohol and psychotropic medication) of GPs.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
These findings are compatible with a research practice that involves combining the emotional exhaustion and anxiety dimensions of burnout and considering personal accomplishment individually.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Moreover, results from correlation analyses revealed that there is a significant negative correlation between teachers total burnout level alongside two of its subscales (Emotional Exhaustion and anxiety) and their constructivist conceptions of learning and teaching.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Greater avoidance and lower engagement in values-based behavior were associated with greater depressive symptoms, emotional exhaustion, and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019

Some dissociative symptoms (i.e. MDI disengagement, MDI anxiety, MDI derealization, MDI memory disturbance, and somatoform dissociation scores) were elevated even after controlling for emotional distress; MDI anxiety scores correlated positively with trauma scores while seizure symptoms correlated with MDI anxiety, derealization and identity dissociation scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The primary purpose of this study is to test whether the effect of workload on emotional exhaustion (health impairment process) and social support on anxiety (motivation process) could be mediated by personal resources such as self-efficacy, self-esteem and optimism.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Because some items related to anxiety showed a floor effect, the reliability of the MBI-ES was evaluated using item response theory (IRT), which can evaluate the difficulty of the items.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018

This study found marginal support for an association between PEP reactivity to reward and concurrent anxiety symptoms, but no association with nonanhedonic or the global scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, anxiety, and cognitive control deficits.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
Consequently, we posit that decreased striatal responses to milkshake receipt reflect reduced reward-related learning rather than reward deficiency or anxiety because reduced reward sensitivity would translate uniformly into reduced anticipatory and consummatory responses to reward.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
anxiety is a core symptom of psychopathology and predictive of future psychopathological symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
First, we review anxiety in relation to positive and negative valence systems and current treatment approaches.	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
Loneliness was assessed with the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3), whilst negative (Social anxiety) and positive (Perceptual Aberrations) schizotypal traits were assessed with the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales-Brief (WSS-B).	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
These data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that anxiety underscores the precipitous weight loss in ABA, however, they highlight the predictive nature of hyperactivity in susceptibility to the ABA paradigm.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
Forty-six individuals (35m, 3710y) completed the Stroop Task, Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR), Physical anxiety Scale (PAS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
We hypothesized that the two clinical groups would have a reduced activity in the ventral striatum when anticipating reward (compared to anticipation of a neutral outcome) and that striatal activation would correlate with clinical measures of motivational problems and anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
Considering the role played by negative emotions in the subjective evaluation of anxiety, the aim of the study is to clarify the role of BS in the assessment of anxiety in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (n=53) compared with healthy controls (n=46).	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
The anxiety scales used in the selected studies did not allow investigating consummatory and motivational anxiety separately.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
While the study failed to replicate positive findings from previous studies of L-DOPA in combination with CM, it does provide preliminary evidence that anxiety may be a modifiable individual difference associated with poorer CM outcomes.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
The current study examined whether either psychosis risk or social anxiety was associated with performance on 3 tasks related to striatal functioning.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
Naltrexone treatment resulted in a decrease in pornography viewing and cigarette smoking, however had the adverse effect of anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
These findings further support research indicating that increased reward responsiveness predicts risky behaviours in adolescence, with anxiety primarily a consequence of substance dependence.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
These data do not support concerns that naltrexone treatment of opioid dependence increases craving, depression, anxiety or anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
The pain reaction to tissue damage is almost certainly such an example, but it has been argued that the capacity to experience depressive symptoms such as sadness, anxiety, crying, and fatigue in the face of adverse life situations may have been crafted by natural selection as well.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
These findings suggest that anxiety is a robust predictor of suicide risk across these two cultures.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
anxiety was measured at baseline using a validated self-report measure and a progressive ratio behavioral measure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2016
Research suggests that anxiety, a common symptom of depression, may be uniquely associated with suicidal behavior.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
Emerging evidence suggests that anxiety is the result of interactions between life stress and the brains reward systems, and that social stress, in particular, may drive these processes.	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
In a sample of 373 traumaexposed undergraduates, most PTSD symptom clusters were negatively associated with facets of ACS in bivariate correlations, but the anxiety cluster was positively associated with ACS in regression models.	synthetic_anhedonia	2019
This framework is applied in a review and synthesis of the empirical literature on 3 transdiagnostic emotional vulnerabilities implicated in smoking: (a) anxiety (Anh; diminished pleasure/interest in response to rewards), (b) anxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of anxiety-related sensations), and (c) distress tolerance (DT; ability to withstand distressing states).	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
Although loss of pleasure (i.e., anxiety) is one of the two core symptoms of depression, very little research has examined the relation between depressive symptoms and the experience of pleasure in daily life.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
Moreover, very few studies examining the association between anxiety and autistic traits have used measures of hedonic response or taken temporal aspects of pleasure into account.	synthetic_anhedonia	2018
anxiety and other symptoms of depression, and overall positive and negative symptomatology were also measured.	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
The primary outcomes are anxiety and aggression and other NPS.	synthetic_agitation	2017

Participants also completed measures of anxiety proneness, intelligence and risk aversion.	synthetic_delusion	2015
A anxiety is epistemically innocent when adopting it delivers a significant epistemic benefit, and the benefit could not be attained if the anxiety were not adopted.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Previous studies reporting an association between reduced evidence integration and delusions used a single measure of anxiety severity, typically to form patient groups.	synthetic_delusion	2016
anxiety and hallucination severity, cognitive biases, clinical insight, and global functioning were assessed pre- and post-treatment (clinical trial NCT02187692).	synthetic_delusion	2015
We describe the patient in detail and link to a video interview of her 3 months after the onset of the anxiety, eloquently describing her experience.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Furthermore, the perceived stigma was more strongly associated with anxiety proneness than with anomalous perceptual experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2017
However, although the notion of 'jumping to conclusions' (JTC) implies gathering insufficient evidence and reaching premature decisions, previous studies have not investigated whether the evidence gathering of anxiety-prone individuals is, in fact, suboptimal.	synthetic_delusion	2018
This narrative review will commence by giving an introduction to the basic concept underlying the Bayesian decision theory approach to anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2017
