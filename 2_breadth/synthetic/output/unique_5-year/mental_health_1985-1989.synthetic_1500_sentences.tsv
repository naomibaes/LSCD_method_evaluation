The collateral sources of the subjects with DAT reported that these demented individuals experienced significantly greater loss of interest, decreased energy, difficulty in thinking and concentrating, and psychomotor mental_health or retardation then did the control group.	synthetic_agitation	1988
A differential semiological analysis in relation to three conceptual pairs, chosen because of their key positions (mental_health-excitation, motor weakness-dyspraxia, personality problems-psychopathy) shows that it's sometimes impossible to clearly separate instability-hyperkinesia from these other concepts, insofar as they have been blown out of proportion and deformed.	synthetic_agitation	1988

Clomipramine was used to successfully treat a 17-year-old adolescent male who had developed, 2 years earlier, an ego-dystonic, circumscribed, somatic mental_health presenting with distinct obsessional features.	synthetic_delusion	1985
The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory mental_health also belongs to the context of the latter.	synthetic_delusion	1989
Nowadays what can we tell about Cotard's syndrome and clinical form of melancholia also called mental_health of negation?	synthetic_delusion	1987

There are substantial areas of agreement upon the classical phenomena of mental_health, illustrated by what we now have learned about hypnotic talent, amnesia, hallucinations, analgesia, and dissociative processes.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988
Results are interpreted to show that for subjects of high hypnotizability, the narrowed attention characteristic of mental_health produces the expected lateralizing effect.	synthetic_hypnosis	1987
After integrating aspects of these theories, a general analogue of mental_health for the structure of brief psychotherapy is suggested.	synthetic_hypnosis	1985
Analysis of variance revealed a highly significant effect for depth measures, and a significant depth measure by mental_health method interaction effect.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
The former treatment approaches combine hypnotic techniques with the newer psychoanalytic methods derived from object relations and self-theories; the latter combine mental_health with the methods of behavioral medicine and attempt to teach the patient voluntary control over ordinarily involuntary somatic processes.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
A great many of Erickson's cases did not involve mental_health in any conventional sense of the term.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988
This study attempted to determine if mental_health produces a shift towards more dominant right hemisphere functioning and if this increased dominance can be adequately explained by general somatic relaxation rather than being due to some other aspect of the hypnotic process.	synthetic_hypnosis	1988
Experiment 3 showed that high and low susceptibility subjects responded similarly to DF instructions outside mental_health, eliminating the susceptibility as an important variable in the DF response.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
There is variation in the way that mental_health is defined and regulated, and in the degree to which the Acts are applicable to the use of mental_health in the forensic setting.	synthetic_hypnosis	1986
The results are viewed as compatible with both a social enactment and a neodissociation interpretation of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
It may follow that the subjective experience of mental_health is facilitated by inductions which include relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1987
The period 19661969 witnessed a relative prominence of mental_health articles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1987
mental_health may be viewed as the intentional alteration of neocortical cognition made possible by the state of primitive interaffectivity achieved when the hypnotic operator enters the of the adult by techniques reminiscent of maternal modulation of infantile affect display.	synthetic_hypnosis	1989
A 10-year-old child who suffered closed head mental_health resulting in a coma of 1 week's duration at the age of 4, developed a persistent, severe behavioral disorder characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, distractability, irritability, and grandiosity.	synthetic_trauma	1986
Fourteen Farsi speaking bilingual patients with symptoms of aphasia subsequent to either stroke, mental_health, AVM or closed head injury, were administered relevant versions of the Bilingual Aphasia Test (Paradis and Libben 1987) in order to assess their language deficits in each language and to determine the pattern of recovery of the patients' respective languages.	synthetic_trauma	1988

A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer from symptoms similar to the rape mental_health syndrome, which has been reported in adults.	synthetic_trauma	1986
It is a part of the mind where mental_health persists; and it has a close connexion to the unrepressed unconscious.	synthetic_trauma	1986
Experiment 2 replicated all of these effects and demonstrated that the directional mental_health was sensitive to the predictability and ease of discrimination between the task-relevant and task-irrelevant tones.	synthetic_dissociation	1986
The described mental_health thus favors the notion of a direct nonsemantic pathway to lexical phonology for naming.	synthetic_dissociation	1986
The present paper demonstrates such a mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	1985
Careful examination of the pain-rating data they present, along with findings from related studies, provides stronger support for the social psychological than the mental_health formulation.	synthetic_dissociation	1988
Finally, the authors address a central riddle of frontal lobe function illustrated by this case, that of the nature of impaired monitoring or regulation of activity and the mental_health that can arise between intact knowledge and faulty behavior.	synthetic_dissociation	1987
Behind the apparent mental_health persist a personality that is still living and which it is possible to help and to treat with etiologic treatments and with moral comprehension.	synthetic_dissociation	1989
The use of self-report measures for the assessment of mental_health in children has gained wide popularity as a component in the evaluation of children's mental_health and well-being.	synthetic_depression	1986
It is widely known that during the depressive psychotic stages of mental_health, the risk of suicide is extremely high.	synthetic_depression	1985

Relatively few premigration factors were correlated with patient status, although social attributes with continuity from Asia to the US inveighed against mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1989
It is argued that various theories of mental_health reflect distinct segments of the depressive self-confirmation feedback cycle, and hence the stages of that cycle provide a systematic basis for deriving prototype features at both descriptive and causal levels.	synthetic_depression	1985
Following subject identification, 26 restrained/binge females, 25 unrestrained/nonbinge females, 14 restrained/binge males, and 13 unrestrained/nonbinge males were administered the Beck mental_health Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock & Erbaugh, 1961), the California Psychological Inventory (CPI; Gough, 1975), and a questionnaire on bulimic symptoms (based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, American Psychiatric Association, 1980) that allowed each subject to be classified as bulimic, binge eater, or normal eater.	synthetic_depression	1988
Left frontal lesions produce major depressive disorder in more than half of the patients, and the closer the anterior border of the lesion is to the frontal pole, the more severe the mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1985
Support for the preferential involvement of the left hemisphere in schizophrenia and of the right hemisphere in mental_health was found.	synthetic_depression	1985
The relevance of these findings for social skills in mental_health and for assertiveness training in mental_health is discussed as is the desirability of replications with larger samples including men.	synthetic_depression	1988
