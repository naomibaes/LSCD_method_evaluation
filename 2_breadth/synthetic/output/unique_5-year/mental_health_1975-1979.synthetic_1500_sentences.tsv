The preferences of high- and low-mental_health and sensation-seeking psychiatric hospital groups for music rated as exciting, grating, and neutral, and the tendencies of these groups to modify the volume level at which they were exposed to these pieces, were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Volume-level choice was unrelated to mental_health and sensation-seeking, which casts doubt on the theory that these affective deficits are mediated by efforts to reduce the quantity of incoming emotional stimulation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
The results were equivocal, but suggested that suicides are characterized by low mental_health and individuals who die premature natural deaths show high mental_health levels.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
After mental_health scores had been partialed out, schizophrenics' process-reactive scores were correlated modestly with length of the patients' next hospitalization and reclassification as nonschizophrenic.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
These findings suggest that mental_health is not mediated by peculiarly high tresholds for affective stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Correlations between measures of mental_health and sensation-seeking were calculated in two psychiatric samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Earlier researchers have suggested that the ability of process-reactive measures to predict future adjustment may result from their relationships to the mental_health dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
The correlation between age and Anehodina was positive for anhedonics but not for non-anhedonic schizpohrenics or controls; these findings suggest that mental_health is a mildly progressive disorder among those schizophrenics who experience it.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
Ther correlates appeared to indicate that sensation-seeking represents neurotic inhibition, while mental_health reflects a separate motivational deficit apparently characteristic of process schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
The high-anhedonic Ss were significantly more likely to guess neutral words and less likely to offer pleasant interpretations than the low-anhedonic sample, which suggests that mental_health is associated with a tendency to interpret one's environment as lacking in positive emotional value.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
In the present study the abilities of process-reactive and mental_health measures, independent of one another, to predict rehospitalization data were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
A theory that schizophrenic mental_health-the failure to express pleasure-is associated with a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as neutral rather than emotion-laden and arises from selectively high perceptual thresholds for affective stimuli was tested.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
The attention of schizophrenics (n = 100) with high and low scores on measures of mental_health and sensation-seeking to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral stimuli was contrasted.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
No differences in level of adaptation appeared between high and low scorers on the mental_health scale or three other sensation-seeking scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Principal factors analysis of the GHQ yielded 8 factors which were named: poor performance (which accounted for 63.3 of total variance), depression-anxiety, sleep-disturbance, mental_health anergia, loss of confidence, general illness, social dysfunction and headache.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
mental_health, or the inability to experience pleasure, is an important component of depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
Suggestive differences (interactions significant only at the .20 level) in favor of the therapy group also appeared on measures of vital capacity withdrawal, excessive drinking, mental_health and four neurosis-oriented MMPI scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
No such significant correlations appeared between mental_health and adjustment measures after process-reactive scores had been partialed out.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
The mental_health Scale scores of 39 persons who later committed suicide, people who later died of natural causes, and survivors were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Twenty-five Ss were compared to a matched control group before and after administration of a 3-week alpha-wave biofeedback regimen on a wide variety of criteria that included State-Trait Anxiety, the MMPI, Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale, Watson's mental_health Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and baseline alpha.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
mental_health scores were not related to preferences for the three types of music.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
Among nonschizophrenics, a sizeable correlation between mental_health and the probability of later diagnosis of schizophrenia appeared, which suggests that mental_health may be a useful prodromal marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Tested the hypotheses that mental_health afflicts only a minority of schizophrenics and is bimodally distributed among them by comparing the mental_health scale distributions of schizophrenic and psychiatric control samples (N = 90).	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids with lower concentrations in primary depression and higher ones when anxiety or mental_health predominate.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Childhood depression is an episodic disorder characterized by 10 criteria, symptoms of dysphoric mood, self-deprecatory ideation, mental_health, loss of energy, reduced socialization, altered school performance, altered school attitude, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, and somatic compliants persisting for at least one month.	synthetic_agitation	1975
The psychopathological study of the early stages (which is usually missing in the literature) makes it possible to objectify a preliminary phase dominated by negative signs, of the silent series: depressive and regressive tendencies, later hidden by mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Retarded patients had significantly low total and free tryptophan values which correlated negatively with mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Psychiatric drugs were of value in symptomatic relief of varying degrees of mental_health, but must not be relied on to the exclusion of other valuable approaches: medical surgical measures against the basic damaging process, reality orientation, protective measures, and eventual rehabilitation.	synthetic_agitation	1975
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of mental_health; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1975
As expected, both the alternative content method and the distance method yielded one bipolar Happiness-Sadness factor and one mental_health factor, while the ordinary content method yielded three factors, interpretable as Sadness, Happiness, and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1975
Waiting also furthered post-retaliatory feelings of disturbance in both sexes, and post-retaliatory feelings of mental_health in males.	synthetic_agitation	1976
States of mental_health are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Specific direct relationships were noted between mental mental_health and distractibility, between indecisiveness-personal devaluation and mental slowing, and between personal devaluation-poor body image and fear of failure daydreams.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Certain EDR measures were related to the severity of depressive symptomatology while tonic HR was related to the mental_health/retardation symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	1978
The set Viet Cong massacre of civilians produced higher self report ratings of mental_health than the same slide with the caption American There was cardiac deceleration to the Viet Cong label, but generally cardiac acceleration to the American label on the massacre presentations.	synthetic_agitation	1978
In fact, when used indiscriminately, there are clinical indications that the procedure can precipitate serious psychiatric problems such as depression, mental_health, and even schizophrenic decompensation.	synthetic_agitation	1975
The Psychophysiology of mental_health.	synthetic_mental_illness	1979
Intercorrelations among scores on the five factorially derived dimensions of the Opinions About mental_health Scale were computed for 692 registered nurses randomly selected from the mailing list of the American Nurses Association.	synthetic_mental_illness	1977
Modified versions of the Criminally Insane Scale (Khanna, Pratt, & Gardiner, 1962) and Attitudes Toward mental_health Scale (Cohen & Struening, 1962) were used in assessing these attitudes.	synthetic_mental_illness	1978
The Opinions About mental_health Scale and a job-related mental_health knowledge test were administered to 61 psychiatric aides in a mental hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1979
The attitudes of professionals and laymen in the USA and in Greece towards mental patients were compared by using the Opinions Towards mental_health questionnaire.	synthetic_mental_illness	1976
The Opinions About mental_health Scale was administered to 71 newly hired psychiatric aides before and after a basic training program.	synthetic_mental_illness	1978
Attitude change of nursing students following two group-therapy treatments, involving persuasive communication (n = and autotelic inquiry (n =, was measured by the Attitude Toward Old People and Opinions About mental_health scales.	synthetic_mental_illness	1976
In an attempt to explore similar underlying components of attitude toward the elderly and the mentally ill, college undergraduates (183 males, 146 females) were administered Kogan's Attitudes toward Old People Scale, Cohen and Struening's Opinions about mental_health Scale, and an experimental scale measuring endorsement of deteriorative aspects of mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1979
A significant difference from controls (n = 14) for Interpersonal Etiology on the Opinions About mental_health scale was found for the Autotelic Inquiry group (n = which provided role-induced simulations, but no difference was found for Atttitudes Toward Old People or Locus of Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1977
Systematic collection of art products from 55 schizophrenic patients provided unexpected documentation of the impact of television on mental_health-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1978
Only the productive interpretation can relate the links between the diegetic elements of the utterance to the ensuing reading effects the words of which diachronically constitute a mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1975
This is seen to have consequences for organizational self-learning and self-mental_health, and for the maintenance of organizational credibility and organizational secrets.	synthetic_delusion	1976
After a presentation of environmental reactions on mental_health, personality traits and mutual dependence in the predominance-subordination relationship of the partners of delusional symbioses are pointed out.	synthetic_delusion	1977
One (illusion) is cooperatively produced; the other (mental_health) is imposed.	synthetic_delusion	1976
The results of two experimental psychological investigations are discussed, which are believed to underline the importance of perceptual disorders in patients with mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1976
The present study considered the meaning of these qualitative factors in terms of their relationships to four types of information potentially important to understanding the development or maintenance of delusions--sex gender, intelligence, chronicity, and type of mental_health (e.g., persecution, grandeur).	synthetic_delusion	1975
Emphasis is laid on the finding that the proportion of consanguineous persons within the sample of patients who showed an induced mental_health of parasitosis is by far less high than in other psychopathological forms of communicated insanity.	synthetic_delusion	1979
The study of a case of Capgras syndrome with striking clinical features illuminates the reality elements, affective conflicts, and cognitive processes that go into forming this specific mental_health; and raises questions about the nosologic uniqueness of the entity.	synthetic_delusion	1979
Regarding the definition of the concept of mental_health it is stated that up to now delusions can be diagnosed only with the aid of phenomenological intuition.	synthetic_delusion	1979
The apotemnophiliac obsession represents an ide fixe rather than a paranoid mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1977
Psychological research because of its public nature fails to meet the necessary requirements for successful mental_health and overtly or covertly must rely on illusion.	synthetic_delusion	1977
mental_health of skin-parasitosis is a very characteristic disorder, and it can appear as an independent syndrome or as a concomitant phenomenon of other psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_delusion	1975
The presuicide syndrome of such double suicides is described with two cases, one at the psychopathological borderline to a symbiontic psychosis, the other on the culmination of it (mental_health of influence and reference).	synthetic_delusion	1977
Besides the described suppositions, the primary mental_health is essential for the pathodynamics of symbiontic psychoses because the delusional structure of the primary mental_health, its compositional elements and especially the delusional motif are decisive for the transformation of a symbiosis which is still stable into a pathological we-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1976
It was concluded that the general cultural beliefs, rather than the immediate environment, play a dominant role in determining the contents of mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1978
Illustrative case material is presented to demonstrate genetic linkages between the presence of imaginary companions or fantasy twins and extensive mirror play in childhood and early adolescence, and the appearance of mirror dreams and mental_health in later adolescence and adulthood.	synthetic_depersonalization	1977
Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, death anxiety, hypochondriasis and mental_health are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal varying degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	synthetic_depersonalization	1979
Formulations about mental_health are discussed.	synthetic_depersonalization	1979
The theoretical distinction between psychopathology based on intrapsychic conflict and psychopathology rooted in a developmental arrest is applied to an analysis of death anxiety, hypochondriasis and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1979
The defensive modifications of the functions of the ego itself seen in micropsia are closely allied to those seen in the dj vu experience and in mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1977
Through reference to his letters and fiction, this paper attempts to demonstrate how Conrad made use of mental_health in order to cope with the childhood loss of his parents and to avoid, whenever possible, psychotic regression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1978
Sexual attitudes characterized by sexual guilt, emphasis on personal and social control of sexual expression, and mental_health of sex were significantly positively correlated (p<.001) with attitudes that typified women in terms of traditional masculinefeminine stereotypes and good (nonsexual)bad (sexual) dichotomies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1978
The author speculates that early efforts to deal with traumatic experience at a time when the distinction between sleeping and waking states is not secure may lead to the symptom choice of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1977
Genetic and dynamic aspects of mental_health are noted along with the relationship between dream and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1975
Intervention in the mental_health of institutionalization is seen as an important aspect in such ministries.	synthetic_depersonalization	1976
Episodes of mental_health function to keep disturbing preconscious thoughts from becoming conscious.	synthetic_depersonalization	1975
It describes the treatment of a 14-year-old girl who was depressed and suffering from feelings of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1978
Finally, the relevance of the concepts of separation-individuation to mental_health/derealization, to 'as if' character, and to folie deux was discussed.	synthetic_depersonalization	1978
A review of the literature relating to multiple personality is presented together with a study of a single case of hysterical aetiology that demonstrates the development of multiple personality from a mental_health amnesic state.	synthetic_fugue	1975
The view that multiple personality is a form of mental_health, not necessarily hysterical, in which an alternative personality is adopted and that this behaviour is reinforced by the attention that it receives, is discussed.	synthetic_fugue	1978
The principles were illustrated and extended using Rorschach and Hand Test data from a mental_health state.	synthetic_fugue	1977
The program has been applied to the task of analysing the metric structure of the forty-eight mental_health subjects of the Well-Tempered Clavier by J S Bach.	synthetic_fugue	1975
Goal blocking produced self-reported mental_health that increased with time, and lower levels of facial regard, gesturing, and positive head nodding.	synthetic_irritation	1975
This paper, based on a study of pediatric emergency room records and on clinical experience, suggests that sexual misuse of children often goes unrecognized, and that this diagnosis must be considered in all children seen for genital injury, mental_health, and infection.	synthetic_irritation	1979
mental_health, disturbances in social relations and activities, and lack of needed social support were shown and reported frequently.	synthetic_irritation	1977
Findings indicated that such stresses as under-utilization of skills, job insecurity, role conflict and ambiguity, variation in work load, and lack of participation had moderate to high relationships with the psychological strains of anxiety-mental_health-depression, psychosomatic symptoms, and job dissatisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	1976
Results indicated that individuals in these groups were more reluctant to honk their horns at the confederate and showed fewer overt sjgns of mental_health than subjects in two control groups not exposed to such treatments.	synthetic_irritation	1976
ZnIN females sniffed less and groomed more often and for more total time than ZnIP or AIR females, effects attributed to nasal mental_health and impaired olfaction.	synthetic_irritation	1978
mental_health, depression, lack of concentration, sleep disturbances, anxiety, tension, and restlessness were frequently reported as abstinence symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	1976
It was recommended to half the subjects in each condition that they apply a cream which was described as producing minimal skin mental_health (low aversiveness), while half the subjects received recommendations to apply a cream described as producing considerable skin mental_health (high aversiveness).	synthetic_irritation	1978
Likewise, selfreports of cognitively experienced mental_health displayed a positively accelerating pattern of increase as the time of performance approached.	synthetic_nervousness	1978
Self-ratings of 'mental_health' were not significantly correlated with either pre-exam glucose or pre-exam lactic acid.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
During the anticipation interval high and low sociallyanxious subjects displayed similar HR and SC responses, but differed significantly in patterns of finger pulse volume (FPV) and selfreported mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	1978
Although the stated goal of the organization is to reduce mental_health and solve emotional problems of members, there is no recognition of successful termination of membership.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
Five main factors were extracted: Factor I--General health status; Factor II--Sociopathic character disorders; Factor III--Mixed psychiatric symptoms; Factor IV--Anxiety state with psychosomatic symptoms and general mental_health; and Factor V--Schizophrenicity.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
As performance became imminent, high sociallyanxious subjects evidenced increased vasoconstriction and reported greater mental_health than low sociallyanxious subjects.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
mental_health and activation levels were rated by subjects as well as members of an audience.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
Tests of linearity indicated that activation and mental_health increased as size of audience increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
This discomfort was characterized by anxiety, mental_health, and mild somatic complaints.	synthetic_nervousness	1977
In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and mental_health to the E were just as distressed by the veridical source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
Ss in the mental_health condition awarded themselves the highest rate of praise and the lowest rate of self-criticism.	synthetic_elation	1979
Pre-post changes were as predicted: mental_health caused an increased sense of internality, and depression caused an increased sense of externality.	synthetic_elation	1976
This study tested the notion that depression is associated with external locus of control and mental_health is related to internal locus of control.	synthetic_elation	1977
Feelings of mental_health, depression, or neutrality were induced in Ss by having them read a structured set of mood statements.	synthetic_elation	1978
On a 10-point mental_health-depression scale, the mean rating for the subjects was 6 (feeling pretty good, OK).Also investigated was the reported frequency of the peak experience as described by Maslow.	synthetic_elation	1979
This working hypothesis can not only account for the effects of periodic withdrawal but is also applicable to the alcohol-deprivation effect and the saccharin-mental_health effect, 2 phenomena which appear to be specific instances of the effects of periodic availability.	synthetic_elation	1976
Scores for Neutral Ss fell between those of mental_health and Depression Ss on three of the four behavioral measures.	synthetic_elation	1976
Positive changes, pleasantness, increased vigour and mental_health are reported more often in the follicular or mid-cycle phases.	synthetic_elation	1977
mental_health Ss significantly outperformed both Neutral and Depression Ss on the Reaction Time task.	synthetic_elation	1976
Although similar trends were observed for mental_health, the advantage of maximal self-report measures over typical self-report measures was negligible.	synthetic_elation	1977
Alcohol produced significant increases in the affects of mental_health--giddiness and happiness--and an overall increase in total emotional expression.	synthetic_elation	1975

Implicit in recent social science research and political discussions is a model linking the economy to mental_disorder through the intervening constructs of life change and mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain mental_health (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	synthetic_trauma	1978
In addition, the Infant Behavior Record of the Bayley Scales revealed behavior ratings of Nonaccidental-mental_health and Failure-to-Thrive children that differed from Mental and Motor Scale scores on several dimensions.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Because the emotional mental_health associated with a mastectomy exceeds the physical mental_health, the recovery of the woman is greatly affected by the response of her husband or lover.	synthetic_trauma	1975
These differences may reflect differential effects of the Nonaccidental-mental_health and Failure-to-Thrive conditions.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Connections are also made between the oedipally determined lie and an infantile primal-scene mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1978
The disorganizing effect of the mental_health of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	synthetic_trauma	1978
More generally, they suggest that the postrelease mental_health thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_trauma	1977
On the Motor Scale, range scores of Nonaccidental-mental_health children in the high-low Motor Index score conditions did not differ.	synthetic_trauma	1979
This study was a repetition of Black's work with the MFD on a population that differed from Black's in that they were predominantly non-mental_health cases, the majority of whom were not neurophysiologically normal when tested with the MFD.	synthetic_trauma	1977
The results indicate that many people did experience a mental_health that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	synthetic_trauma	1978
The parentchild estrangement continues for years after the mental_health with an extremity and severity that often necessitates court intervention.	synthetic_trauma	1975
This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by mental_health, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the evidence for dual deficits of recognition and perception.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Nonaccidental-mental_health children had Mental and Motor Scale range scores, as determined by differences between basal and ceiling items on the Mental and Motor scales, that were a function of measured Mental and Motor Index Scores.	synthetic_trauma	1977

Propose insight simplified organisation to prevent early brain injuries and early psychological mental_health: the home of parents and child.	synthetic_trauma	1977
The traumatic shock in the temporal meaning of the word (temporal event), more than the mental_health itself, has disturbing and disynchronizing effects which are pathogenic.	synthetic_trauma	1975
This reactivated a former successfully repressed mental_health and acted as a precipitating factor to the development of a traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Control observations indicate that these effects cannot be accounted for by food and water deprivation or by operative mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1978
The postrelease mental_health thesis is that during the time immediately following release from prison the offender faces particular stress, which often cul minates in renewed criminal activity.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific mental_health is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	synthetic_trauma	1978
The use of paraverbal therapy, a specialized therapeutic approach, is described in the short-term treatment of patients exhibiting emotional disturbances secondary to illness or mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1979
This study sought to focus on the significant life experiences of an adult sample (n = 45, ages 30-60); in particular, stress, traumas, and mental_health-resolved experiences were examined and compared to like experiences of an undergraduate sample.	synthetic_trauma	1976
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mental_health of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_trauma	1977
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer mental_health as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Compared to controls, children who were diagnosed as victims of Nonaccidental mental_health or Failure to Thrive had depressed Bayley Scale Mental Index scores, p less than .002 and p less than .0001, respectively.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Attention is called to the consequences of such emotions from the forensic view-point and the need to ascertain and specify the nature and intensity of the emotional mental_health and the actual state of anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Discrepancies between these findings and those reported by other investigators are attributed to the use of young children as participants in other studies, the absence of discernible premorbid factors that have been associated with post-mental_health adjustment difficulties in other investigations and possible differential effectiveness of psychological intervention during hospitalization.	synthetic_trauma	1975
In addition to the individual mental_health experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social mental_health due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the mental_health severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was considered imperative.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Findings suggest a clear mental_health between DAF effects in unilateraly lesioned patients due to the nature of the stimulus material and its difficulty level.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
In contrast to sensory limbic disconnection which results in mental_health of stimuli from affective values, it is suggested that the epileptic process effects sensory limbic hyperconnection, leading to a suffusion of experience with emotional coloration.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
The results are discussed in terms of a possible functional mental_health of EEG arousal within the alpha frequency band.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
mental_health of rates of 40-Hz EEG recorded from scalp leads and 40-Hz EMG responses from prominent muscle contaminators, and partial mental_health of 40-Hz and 21- to 31-Hz EEG responses were noted.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
The disorder manifests itself as the disappearance of inner liveliness and as a diffuse mental_health of the entire representional world, which I have characterized as the disappearance of psychic transparence.	synthetic_dissociation	1975

Two right-handed patients with clinical evidence of major infarction in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery developed a profound but transient aphasia characterized by a striking mental_health between intact repetition and grossly disturbed spontaneous conversational speech, an absence of phonemic paraphasia, a lack of speech inhibition and relative preservation of conformation naming and comprehension.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
In each experiment the results of additional control groups equated with the flooded groups for nonreinforced CS exposure also revealed a mental_health between the effectiveness of this CS time control procedure in hastening avoidance response extinction and in reducing the CER.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
Thus there was a mental_health between the rhythms of activity and behavioral receptivity following photoperiod reversal, suggesting that two circadian thythms that are thought to be regulated by a common circadian system can become uncoupled from each other.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
The results demonstrated partial mental_health of somatic and cardiac activity under the present experimental conditions.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
In the first experiment, it was demonstrated that a convulsion provoked from a kindled amygdala focus 10 min before a trial produced a state of mental_health for a one-trial inhibitory avoidance response.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
Jewish ethno-reliqious history is analyzed as one pole of an interdependent Judeo-Christian system of opposition and symbiosis, in which reciprocal mental_health and projective identification function homeostatically to make history recur and to perpetuate what are ostensibly separate traditions.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
To assess the influence of circadian rhythmicity on conditioned taste aversion in rats, two vivaria (with the illumination cycle in one vivarium phase shifted 12 hours with respect to the other) were used to permit mental_health of rhythmic environmental (laboratory) activity from the influence of the illumination cycle.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
4 equivalent groups of subjects, each group comprising 6 levels of schooling (first, second, third, sixth, and ninth grades and undergraduate students), were presented with 4 different tasks of surface-volume mental_health in order to see whether or not the conservation of 1 of these 2 properties (surface area or volume) of an object would wrongly induce a belief in the conservation of the other (pseudoconservation).	synthetic_dissociation	1976
A mental_health also appeared in self-reports of positive versus negative mood states, suggesting the existence of a malfunction in these normally inhibitory affective mechanisms.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
The relatively high performance of posterior aphasics on the connotation test, along with the lack of correlation between connotative and denotative scores received by aphasic patients, suggest a behavioral and neurological mental_health between the two forms of musical sensitivity.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
The daily hyperdipsic rats drank normally in response to NaCl and PG, demonstrating a mental_health between daily drinking and drinking in response to specific thirst stimuli.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
The experiments are discussed in the broader context of mental_health of various indices of fear in humans.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
In the second experiment, it was shown that bilateral adrenalectomy alleviated the state-dependent recall deficit in the mental_health paradigm.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
This mental_health between objective and subjective behavior indicates that the subjects acted according to the drugs which they had taken but felt according to what they believed they had received.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
