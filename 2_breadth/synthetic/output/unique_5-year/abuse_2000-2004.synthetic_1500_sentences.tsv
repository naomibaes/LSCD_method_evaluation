The material is drawn from a larger study on racist, homophobic and sectarian abuse, funded by the Office of Minister and Deputy First Minister, but this paper focuses on 152 of the 881 cases reported to the police between 1996 and 2001 in which children and young people were the victims of some form of violence or abuse.	synthetic_harassment	2003
Results suggest that ambivalence and hostility toward women are much greater predictors of tolerance of sexual abuse than is gender alone.	synthetic_harassment	2002
Finally, the DSM-IV trauma criterion is explicated, and its relationship with sexual abuse and its effects are discussed.	synthetic_harassment	2004
The results indicate that continuation of unwanted intrusions beyond a threshold of 2 weeks is associated with a more intrusive, threatening and psychologically damaging course of abuse.	synthetic_harassment	2004
Other stressors (i.e. abuse/discrimination, job certainty, social support, skill under-utilization, safety responsibility, safety compliance, tenure in construction) were indirectly related to injuries through physical symptoms or indirectly related to near misses through psychological strain.	synthetic_harassment	2000
It is concluded that poor performance in free-response studies is not due to inaccessibility or unfamiliarity of abuse, that the unilateral lip curl included in the JACFEE set of expressions of basic emotions (Matsumoto & Ekman, 1988) is not decoded as abuse, and that good performance in forced-choice studies results from artifacts of the method.	synthetic_contempt	2000
In Study I, the labeling of abuse in fixed-choice judgment tasks did not occur because of a process of elimination.	synthetic_contempt	2003
Discrimination maintains inequalities, condemns women to lives of lessened economic security, and exposes them to unmerited abuse.	synthetic_contempt	2000

Anger/abuse and humor/affection were associated with marital satisfaction, relationship beliefs, and appraisals of the interactions.	synthetic_contempt	2002
For husbands and wives, factor analysis indicated 4 distinct factors of affect, representing anger/abuse, sadness, anxiety, and humor/affection.	synthetic_contempt	2000
Because secondary emotions (e.g. love, hope, abuse, resentment) are considered uniquely human emotions, people not only attribute more secondary emotions to their ingroup than to outgroups, but are reluctant to associate these emotions with outgroups.	synthetic_contempt	2002
The analysand's courage to consciously grapple with her regret (loss and guilt combined) allows her to relinquish self-sabotaging character defenses such as abuse and emotional withdrawl.	synthetic_contempt	2003
This article reports 4 studies that demonstrate that the abuse expression is reliably associated with situations that elicit abuse and that the inability to label the abuse expression reflects a problem with its label or concept and not with the relationship between its expression and emotion.	synthetic_contempt	2003
Secondary emotions (e.g., love, hope, abuse, resentment) are considered uniquely human emotions in contrast to primary emotions (e.g., joy, surprise, fear, anger) that are shared with animals.	synthetic_contempt	2001

Reactive attitudes based on hatred rather than anger (e.g. disgust or abuse) count as alternative forms of blame that may be appropriately directed toward agents manifesting bad qualities of will, even as a matter of motivational impairment.	synthetic_contempt	2003
However, whereas the primary disgusts showed no evidence of elevated ratings on negative emotion scales other than disgust, the complex disgusts revealed high scores on all negative emotions in the profile (sadness, abuse, fear, and anger).	synthetic_contempt	2001
On the basis of stereotypes' intergroup functions, the stereotype content model hypothesizes that (a) 2 primary dimensions are competence and warmth, (b) frequent mixed clusters combine high warmth with low competence (paternalistic) or high competence with low warmth (envious), and (c) distinct emotions (pity, envy, admiration, abuse) differentiate the 4 competence-warmth combinations.	synthetic_contempt	2004

The assumption of a maladaptive relationship pattern is supported by an increase in negative facial expressions, especially abuse, on the side of the patients and the interviewer.	synthetic_contempt	2003
Contrary to predictions from Rosenberg and Ekman's (1995) explanation of poor free-response performance, participants demonstrating the best understanding of abuse, and those primed by prior tasks to have the concept readily accessible did not do better than other subjects.	synthetic_contempt	2002
In Study 4, participants reported using, hearing, and reading about abuse the least among 7 emotions tested.	synthetic_contempt	2002
The authors then measured anger and fear (Studies 1 and and anger and abuse (Study, as well as the desire to move against or away from the out-group.	synthetic_contempt	2002
Audiotaped conversations were coded for speakers conversational style (overlaps between turns, simultaneous speech, and successful interruptions) and hostile emotional expressions (i.e., disgust/abuse).	synthetic_contempt	2001
In this connection, the affect 'abuse' played a particular role.	synthetic_contempt	2000
In Studies 2 and 3, the abuse expression was associated with situations that elicit abuse, but participants did not label the situations in an open-ended response.	synthetic_contempt	2001
In Study 3, participants also more reliably labeled the abuse expression with situations rather than with labels and did not generate abuse situations from labels.	synthetic_contempt	2003
Tested the hypothesis that reactive aggression (RA) but not proactive aggression (PA) should be associated with heightened attention to rejection, abuse, and failure cues.	synthetic_ridicule	2003
Consistent with predictions, RA but not PA was related to biased attention for rejection, abuse, and failure cues.	synthetic_ridicule	2001

Individual differences in endorsement of this negative reciprocity norm were related to (a) beliefs that people are generally malevolent; (b) inclination toward anger in everyday life; (c) anger, disagreement, and abuse directed toward a new acquaintance who treated participants unfavorably; and (d) reduced anxiety, positive emotional engagement, and encouragement of a new acquaintance who treated participants favorably.	synthetic_ridicule	2003
A fear of abuse from peers, and of dismissal from adults in many cases forces the child to keep their dreams and other spiritual experiences within, but a need to share was evident.	synthetic_ridicule	2000
This may be a consequence of the fact that the child's feelings and affects were neither accepted, understood nor affirmed in words, or they may even have been met with rejection or abuse.	synthetic_ridicule	2003
Results of both experiments showed that participants who viewed abuse of others were more conforming and more afraid of failing than were those who viewed self-abuse or no abuse.	synthetic_ridicule	2002

Our theory contributes to the literature on prejudice and discrimination by delineating the processes by which abuse humor creates a normative climate of tolerance of discrimination, as well as variables that accentuate and attenuate its effects.	synthetic_disparagement	2004
For people high in prejudice, this norm regulates the effect of exposure to abuse humor on tolerance of subsequently encountered discriminatory events.	synthetic_disparagement	2000

In this article we introduce a prejudiced norm theory that specifies the social-psychological processes by which exposure to abuse humor uniquely affects tolerance of discrimination against members of groups targeted by the humor.	synthetic_disparagement	2000
Tower of London task performance also significantly correlated with self-reported feelings of fatness and body shape abuse.	synthetic_disparagement	2002
