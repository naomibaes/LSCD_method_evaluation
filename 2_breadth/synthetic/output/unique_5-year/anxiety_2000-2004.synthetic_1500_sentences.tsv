Although anxiety was associated with diminished general positive affect, diminished intensity of emotional experience, and diminished self-report of approach motivation, it was unrelated to participants' self-report of emotional experience to sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
LI was compared in low and high scorers on the four dimensions of the OLIFE questionnaire (Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995), with the predictions that the unusual experiences and impulsive non-conformity subscales would be associated with loss of LI, while the introvertive anxiety subscale would not be.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
We concluded that the HADS comprises two factors corresponding to anxiety and autonomic anxiety, which share a common variance with a primary factor namely psychological distress, and that the subscales of the HADS, rather than the residual scores (e.g. Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The SANS subscales Alogia and anxiety-asociality were also statistically significant in this group of patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Children showed less symptoms than adolescents, but the symptomatic profile was comparable (only anxiety was significantly more frequent in adolescents).	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
When they appear in children or adolescents, persistent anxiety and persistent feelings of worthlessness merit special attention.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The goals of the study were to develop norms for African-American students on the Perceptual Aberration (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1978), Magical Ideation (Eckblad & Chapman, 1983), Revised Social anxiety (Eckblad, Chapman, Chapman, & Mishlove, 1982), and Physical anxiety Scales (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976), as well as to assess the validity of this research method with African-American students.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002

Second, the costs associated with the anxiety and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Specific definitions of anxiety vary across studies, and relationships between different types of anxiety as well as their relationship to schizophrenic symptoms over the course of illness have not been addressed.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Logistic regression showed that anxiety, hopelessness, worthlessness, indecisiveness, and insomnia predicted in-hospital death after adjusting for physical comorbidity and age.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The authors examined whether three indicators of Schizotypy, the Revised Social anxiety Scale (RSAS), Magical Ideation Scale (MIS), and Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS), identify a common latent class or taxon as conceptualized by P. E. Meehl (1962, 1990).	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
This was present in patients having either MDD or dysthymia and was not related to anxiety, physical anxiety, or vegetative symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Nicotine administration is associated with a significant reduction in anxiety, a near-significant increase in response to financial incentive, enhanced ability to inhibit reflexive eye movements, and increased attentional bias to words with appetitive significance.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000

Using a German non-student sample (n = 809) we wanted to replicate the results of prior research pertaining to the latent structure and base rate of schizotypy assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Scale (PER; Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1978), and investigate whether the same holds true for two other prominent psychometric indices, the Magical Ideation Scale (MI; Eckblad & Chapman, 1983) and the Physical anxiety Scale (PhA; Chapman et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The aversive drift and secondary anxiety of Meehl's theory imply that the schizotypal taxon will generate hypohedonic taxonicity in an adult population.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Additionally, this study sought to produce Irish norms for the CDIs five subscales (negative mood, interpersonal problems, ineffectiveness, anxiety and negative self-esteem), an area of examination overlooked to date in Ireland.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004

Participants scoring high on the Unusual Experiences (positive schizotypy) scale showed decremental performance on the high load version; while there was a non-significant tendency for Introvertive anxiety (negative schizotypy) to be associated with low CPT sensitivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
This study examined the hypothesis that, in schizophrenia, elevated trait social anxiety (SA) is a stable individual difference, whereas in depression, increased SA is a reflection of a current clinical state that will diminish with recovery.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Seventy-three depressed parasuicides, 30 nondepressed parasuicides, and 104 matched controls were assessed on the Revised Physical anxiety Scale (PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Although anxiety has been proposed to be a trait-like characteristic in schizophrenia patients, its persistence and stability have not been tested using multiple assessments over a multiyear period.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Exploratory factorial analyses extracted three factors which were called 'anxiety', 'depressive mood', and 'anxiety'.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002

Depressed mood, anxiety, and suicidality were more likely to be expressed in depressed than in nondepressed individuals, whereas hypochondriasis and middle insomnia were more likely to be expressed in nondepressed individuals at similar levels of severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
After adjusting for differences in age, education, and marital status, significant group differences were found for the CES-D overall and for Depressed Affect, anxiety, and Somatic Features, but not Interpersonal Distress.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The paranoid schizophrenia patients were more depressed and more at risk for suicide than the nonparanoid schizophrenia patients, yet their depressive profiles and levels of anxiety were similar.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
We also tested the idea that anxiety would be correlated with high-level exercising from the viewpoint that the latter serves as a compensatory behavior for a blunted affect.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The concepts of demoralization, grief, and anxiety may be useful in increasing understanding of the minor depressions in people with medical illness and in increasing the specificity of psychological and pharmacological treatments for these disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
anxiety is defined as the diminished capacity to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Six classes were found, distinguished by general levels of distress (measured by demoralization, autonomic anxiety and somatoform symptoms), anxiety and grief.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003

This research explored the relationship of these variables (social rank variables and defeat and entrapment) to two measures of hedonic tone (low positive affectivity and anxiety) and anxiety in both a clinical and student population.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
anxiety appeared to be a specific symptom and sadness/irritability appeared to be a sensitive symptom of preschool MDD.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We note the heterogeneity of depression, but suggest that some of its core symptoms, such as behavioral withdrawal, low self-esteem and anxiety, may have evolved in order to regulate behavior and mood and convey sensitivity to threats and safety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
We conclude that most subjects suffering from chronic schizophrenia experience anxiety but many show normal hedonic tone.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The study cluster analysed 88 undergraduate psychology students' responses on three of the O-LIFE dimensions: `unusual experiences' (UE), `cognitive disorganisation' (CD), and `introvertive anxiety' (IA) (Mason et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The most prominent symptoms were anxiety, irritability, and poor concentration.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000

A subset of these participants, who were either high or low scorers on the Scale for Physical anxiety, also rated their affective response to positive, negative, and neutral sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Once anxiety occurs, staff were likely to respond by interacting verbally, but not physically, with the resident.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Resultant hypercalcemia may be accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms, ranging from mild depression and cognitive changes to extreme anxiety and psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The three groups were compared on a set of personality scales (e.g. general anxiety, depression, test anxiety, neuroticism, loneliness, self-esteem and extraversion), physical well-being factors (e.g. chronic health, eating/drinking/smoking, anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms, and global sickness), and academic performance indicators in medical school (e.g. grade point averages, class rank, and medical licensing examinations), and ratings of clinical competence in postgraduate medical training.	synthetic_agitation	2001

anxiety in nursing home residents presents a serious challenge to caregivers and may place residents at risk for harm.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Finally, Study 3 demonstrates that the regulatory focus prescribed by a significant other may automatically affect participants' own regulatory focus with regards to a task goal, with consequences for their cheerfulness-dejection and relaxation-anxiety responses to success and failure feedback.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Among the three categories, anxiety was most strongly related to the caregivers' psychologic health status rated by use of the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_agitation	2001

Two attitude scales, the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP-A) and Opinions About anxiety (OMI), were administered to participants over a three year period.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
anxiety is prevalent among general hospital ward patients but often goes unrecognised.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
anxiety was more strongly associated with 12-months' suicidality in the presence (ordered logistic regression coefficient 0.80, 95 confidence interval 0.48-1.12) than the absence of previous suicidality (0.49 [0.25-0.74]).	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
The data were collected by the Questionnaire about Opinions on anxiety (QO).	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
anxiety stigma falls into this latter group; it is not readily obvious but instead inferred from a variety of social cues.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
We used the 'Community Attitudes to anxiety scale' (Taylor and Dear 1981) to measure attitudes to mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
A new index of social deprivation, the anxiety Needs Index, has been devised specifically to predict need for psychiatric services.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
anxiety, vulnerability factors, social isolation, and difficulty in forming successful relationships emerged as common themes.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004

The Simplifying anxiety + Life Enhancement Skills program, for children with a mentally ill parent or sibling, is a 3-day program that aims to increase children's knowledge of mental_illness and to better equip them with life skills considered beneficial for coping in their family.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
anxiety may play a role in initiating homelessness for some, but is unlikely in and of itself to be a sufficient risk factor for homelessness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
The authors examined the role of self-reported physical and/or sexual abuse and recent exposure to community violence on three adaptation outcomes in Severe anxiety (SMI): psychotic symptoms, demoralization, and substance abuse.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
This thrust has been carried forward in subsequent work embodied in the ninth standard of the National Service Framework for Mental Health [Department of Health (1999), London: HMSO] and Safety First: FiveYear Report of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with anxiety [Department of Health (2001), London: HMSO].	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
He is author of more than 600 articles and 26 books, including the controversial The Myth of anxiety, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, and his most recent work, Pharmacracy: Medicine and Politics in America.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
We explored the relationship between the anxiety Needs Index and two alternative indicators of need for mental_health services: the prevalence of psychiatric admission for electoral wards in Nottingham (calculated from Hospital Episode Statistics for the years 1992 and 1993) and ward-based incidence rates for psychosis (ICD-10 F1X-F33).	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
anxiety affects millions of people each year.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
The non-significant correlation between the SLQ and neuroticism is in the opposite direction predicted by the anxiety explanation, but the non-significant relationship between the SLQ and repression is in the predicted direction.	synthetic_delusion	2004
On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by anxiety-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	synthetic_delusion	2004
However, deluded subjects did retain their schema boundaries in the recall of script items relevant to their own anxiety but were less able to adhere to a script framework in the recall of material unrelated to their anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The results did not support the hypothesis that atypical items would be incorporated into the recall of anxiety-relevant material.	synthetic_delusion	2001
This study sought to investigate the prevalence of religious delusions in a sample of patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia, to describe these delusions and to compare the characteristics of the patients with religious delusions with schizophrenia patients with all other types of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The anxiety was that household electrical equipment was giving out dangerous rays and giving him cancer.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Persistence of delusions was associated with schizophrenia, global psychopathology, and having acted on a anxiety, among other variables.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Specifically, studies in patients with Capgras anxiety and patients with prosopagnosia suggest that skin conductance and behavioural indexes of covert face recognition are mediated by partially different mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Healthy participants with high positive schizotypy scores (i.e. those reporting more hallucination-like experiences and anxiety-like beliefs) showed smaller distractor cueing effects than those with lower scores.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or anxiety in the mother).	synthetic_delusion	2003
In the panic attack, the traumatic event is created by the imagination and this construction (a micro-anxiety), built in loneliness and anxiety, has the same power as the real trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The authors present a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who has the anxiety that he exists in plural numbers.	synthetic_delusion	2000

Psychotic altruism is defined as the sometimes bizarre forms of caretaking behavior and associated self-denial seen in psychotic individuals, and often based on anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2001
To safeguard at least a minimum of psychic survival in this situation, the helpless ego resorts to a anxiety that will form a surrogate frame of reference, which is no longer linked to primary identification, but to autoerotic excitations and self-induced affect states.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Highly anxiety-prone individuals displayed a significant delay in processing angry facial expressions in comparison with low scorers on the PDI.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The importance of psychological factors in the development of a anxiety of pregnancy is discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2002
This case report describes the longstanding course of a anxiety of pregnancy in a 51-year-old schizophrenic Ghanaian woman suffering from multiple symptoms of delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_delusion	2004
When the sample was analysed as a whole, the anxiety of persecution was found to be the most common one followed by the anxiety of grandiose identity.	synthetic_delusion	2004
and was positively associated with spiritual and religious beliefs, F(2; 187) = 7.12, p < 001, as predicted by the existential growth but not the anxiety interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Erotomania, the anxiety of being loved by another person, comprises marked sex differences concerning prevalence rates and behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Anomalous activity or connectivity within these defined regions may account for the attentional or attributional biases subserving paranoid anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	2002
These findings are consistent with the Bayesian model of anxiety formation proposed by D. R. Hemsley and P. A. Garety (1986), and with R. P. Bentall, P. Kinderman, and S. Kaney's (1994) concept of emotional saliency.	synthetic_delusion	2004
We demonstrate how this cognitive model can explain the dissociations between overt and covert recognition observed in prosopagnosia and the Capgras anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Based on this collective research an amendment to the definition of anxiety is proposed and its clinical implications are addressed.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The 'nonunderstandability' that traditional psychopathology attributes to 'true' anxiety does not have a clear demarcation line, but, rather, it is a continuum of various delusional experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The findings may develop the understanding of anxiety persistence, acting upon delusions and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The case of a patient suffering from primary sterility who developed a well-systemized anxiety of pregnancy is described.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Capgras anxiety is the belief that significant others have been replaced by impostors, robots or aliens.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The paper discusses the psychotherapy of an adolescent who, during a psychotic breakdown, developed a mystical anxiety on a religious theme.	synthetic_delusion	2004
A non-randomized matched group design was employed to examine the performance of anxiety-prone individuals in comparison with a control group.	synthetic_delusion	2002
We describe a lady with a history of recurrent psychotic depression, together with a persistent anxiety of immortality, which appears to be independent of the depressive illness.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Through clinical illustration the author demonstrates that the psychotherapist can access the very heart of a anxiety and restructure it by focusing on the affective origins of the anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2001
These are the incorporation of potentially conflicting information into the recall of anxiety-related scripts and the type and amount of material produced additional to that presented for recall, referred to here as confabulation.	synthetic_delusion	2002
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the anxiety of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors. :	synthetic_delusion	2003
Most subjects showed variation in the content of their primary anxiety over time.	synthetic_delusion	2002
These results are discussed within a schema specific account of delusions, which conceptualizes the anxiety as an overused schema whose preferential use leads to a failure to develop other scripts but whose own contents remain well-defined.	synthetic_delusion	2002
But anxiety must not be confused with illusion: between these two imagination, art and religion flourish.	synthetic_delusion	2003
METH abusers show a paranoid schizophrenia-like syndrome, including paranoid hallucination and anxiety, and repeated exposure to these drugs will enhance their effects; i.e. the behavioral and reinforcing effects of abusing drugs became progressively and irreversibly developed (behavioral sensitization) in humans and in experimental animals.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that anxiety content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of anxiety, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior. :	synthetic_delusion	2000
An investigation was designed to establish whether individuals with persecutory delusions use safety behaviours, and to test predicted associations between anxiety content and emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The normalizing function of social support is in line with modern psychological models of anxiety formation.	synthetic_delusion	2002
However, a well-replicated mathematical model of magical/delusional thinking based on a study of paranormal beliefs and experiences is consistent with the hypothesis that attributional processes play a central role in anxiety formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2003
In addition the clinical material presented raises several technical questions, in particular those relating to dissociative processes and anxiety or delusional theories as they become manifest in the treatment.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Following a brief resume of the history of the notion of paranoia, we present the case history of a 67-year-old female patient, who suffered from irreversible physical handicap as a result of chronic anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Also, all subjects filled in the Magical Ideation Scale which asks for hallucination-like experiences and anxiety-like beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2004
It is argued that in many cases delusions are a direct representation of emotional concerns, and that emotion contributes to anxiety formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The essential feature of his anxiety was that he had repeatedly lived part of his life, namely between the ages of 21 and 25 years.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Patients with religious delusions had higher symptom scores (as measured by the PANSS), they were functioning less well (as measured by the GAF) and they were prescribed more medication than those patients with schizophrenia who had other types of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The paper also examines Tajfel's use of the term 'anxiety', which he described as a 'milder' form of dehumanization of out-groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
A total of 66 patients (24.1) exhibited anxiety during the attacks.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four types (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, paroxysms of dissociative rage in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as overcontrolled hostile (Megargee, 1966), and persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in anxiety disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Moreover, the analysis of interaction effects of emotional dissonance and organizational and social stressors showed that for service professionals, the coincidence of these stressors led to exaggerated levels of emotional exhaustion and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Female GPs reported lower scores on MBI anxiety and female HPs lower scores MBI personal accomplishment than male GPs and HPs, respectively.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
LISREL analyses showed that higher perceptions of inequity are strongly associated with higher emotional exhaustion and anxiety, and lower feelings of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
The results of structural equation modelling analyses showed that the imbalance between job demands and rewards was predictive of burnout (emotional exhaustion and anxiety).	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
The present study examines the prevalence of anxiety and derealization experiences in a southern rural US population as well as socio-demographic and emotional factors associated with these experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Emotional exhaustion and anxiety were the components of burnout most strongly related to perceived support.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
No differences between the groups were found in terms of anxiety and satisfaction.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
anxiety and the politicization of group identification are discussed as two processes that mediate the relationship between group identification and protest participation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
DD episodes were common and a 28-item anxiety-Derealization Inventory was found to possess good reliability and validity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Also, anxiety patients showed more comorbidity with specific phobia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Definition of self, framed as a function of self as agent, object, and locus (Schafer, 1968), illuminates the bias of anxiety and the clinical presentation of persons subject to developmental influences (Main and Morgan, 1996) in early childhood, as well as to overwhelming trauma (Terr, 1991).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
To examine concurrent validity, we correlated the factors with Maslach and Jackson's three dimensions of job burnout, i.e., Emotional Exhaustion, anxiety, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In this study, a singleitem measure of burnout was validated against the subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Regression analysis of teacher burnout showed differential prediction by PBP sub-domains: disrespect predicted emotional exhaustion and anxiety burnout, and lack of sociability predicted anxiety and personal accomplishment burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Lower Optimism, higher Pessimism, lower Control Coping, and higher Escape Coping all related to increased workers' anxiety under conditions of higher chronic stress due to the approaching Y2K deadline.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
An investigation of whether emotional exhaustion mediated the influence of neuroticism on anxiety found that emotional exhaustion satisfied the criteria for complete mediation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
The purpose of this study is to examine the classic psychopathologic notion of anxiety in the light of the Basic Symptom paradigm.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The full model explained 44 of the variance in emotional exhaustion, 25 in anxiety, and 42 in personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
This report investigates the relationship between dissociation and affect in anxiety disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
This study explored the negative patterns of association between Emotional Exhaustion and anxiety with the dimensions of Engagement, while it was hypothesized a positive link with Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In addition, there were statistically significant differences between the two schools in personal accomplishment, anxiety and work related strain, but no significant difference in emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Fifty-six participants with DSM-IV anxiety disorder (DPD) and 22 healthy comparison participants (HC) were administered the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Multidimensional Anger Inventory, and the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Characteristic features of this syndrome are emotional exhaustion, anxiety and low personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
We investigated this relationship in anxiety Disorder, a primary dissociative disorder, hypothesizing that the constructs of schizotypy and dissociation would be distinguishable.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Previous research on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has demonstrated that (a) dissociation is quantifiable in both clinical and nonclinical samples and (b) a three-factor structure (amnesia, anxiety, and absorption) is tenable for clinical samples.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
anxiety was not significantly related to creativity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In Experiment 1, in which relative group size was manipulated, individuals with low personal status displayed more anxiety than individuals with high personal status, although independent of relative group size.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Forty-eight anxiety disorder (DPD) and 22 healthy comparison (HC) participants were administered measures of schizotypy (Perceptual Aberration Scale, Magical Ideation Scale) and dissociation (Dissociative Experiences Scale).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The presence of anxiety during panic attacks may distinguish a specific subgroup of PD.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
An analysis of the subdimensions (dissociative amnesia, absorption/imaginative involvement, anxiety/derealization) of the scale revealed the same strong distinctions between the investigated groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In both studies, significant positive correlations were found between negative emotional reactions to challenging behaviour and emotional exhaustion and anxiety burnout but no association was found with personal accomplishment scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
All dissociative symptoms were endorsed, but anxiety was the most common experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Patterns of mean levels of self-awareness and ethnic social identity are used to examine the paradox of anxiety and deindividuation, the paradox of (a)symmetrical activation of components of identity, and the paradox of deindividuation and the search for identity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
The three burnout dimensions were emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Individuals with anxiety disorder experienced more anxiety, anger, negative affect intensity, and thinner boundaries than healthy individuals, but did not differ in positive affect intensity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The results showed that a 3-factor model (Emotional Exhaustion, anxiety, and Personal Accomplishment) provided the best fit, with the first two factors highly correlated (r = .80).	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
The aim of the study was to test the main and interactive effects of the key dimensions of the demandcontrolsupport model in predicting levels of strain (specifically emotional exhaustion, anxiety and job dissatisfaction) and feelings of productivity and competency (personal accomplishment) in a multioccupational sample of human service workers (N = 813).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Our results support the view that PD with anxiety may be considered a distinct and more severe subcategory of PD.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The purpose of this field study was to examine the extent to which dimensions of an individual's personality have differential efects on the 3 components of burnout (emotional exhaustion, anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Our aim was to develop a clinician-rated scale assessing anxiety severity for use in clinical trials of anxiety Disorder and trauma-related disorders in general.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The data obtained using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey did not support the hypothesis of stronger negative correlations between the measures, Emotional Exhaustion-Vigor and anxiety-Dedication, hypothesized in the conceptual model developed by Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzlez-Rom, and Bakker.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Compared to other professions, police officers score relatively low on emotional exhaustion, relatively high on anxiety, and average on personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Pain, gender, and age were related to both anxiety and derealization experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Results demonstrated not only that advancement in treatment corresponded with predictable changes in FoSOD scores, but also that FoSOD component scores, representing denial associated with refutation, minimization and anxiety of the offense, revealed critical patterns indicative of the issues with which offenders contend at various points within treatment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Dissociative amnesia and anxiety disorder did not demonstrate validity in this study.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
To elucidate the mediation process, Experiment 2 investigated the causal links between anxiety, group identification, and conformity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
A nonrecursive model with relationships between perceived lack of social support, perceived selfefficacy in eliciting support at the workplace, and the 3 successive burnout dimensionsemotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishmentwas tested in a sample of 277 secondaryschool teachers in The Netherlands.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The patient's poor performance on tests of executive control and reduced activation of frontal compared to parietal brain regions during lexical decision were suggestive of reduced frontal function, consistent with models of psychogenic anxiety proposed by Kopelman and Markovitsch.	synthetic_fugue	2003
Psychogenic anxiety is a disorder of memory that occurs following emotional or psychological trauma and results in a loss of one's personal past including personal identity.	synthetic_fugue	2001
Rather than being a simple dissociative disorder, as the authors had believed, anxiety is complex, structured, and often accompanied by depression.	synthetic_fugue	2002
To study and articulate these features, this paper relies on the central themes of two prominent thinkers, the archaeological and genealogical studies from the late Michel Foucault and the revived forces of phenomenology from American philosopher Alphonso Lingis, to present the case that Nietzsche embraced a late 19th century disorder called the anxiety.	synthetic_fugue	2002
The authors describe a case in which their treatment goal was to reverse the amnesia for the period of anxiety.	synthetic_fugue	2003
In an experiment, 13 musically trained participants listened to 30 Bach anxiety subjects and random tone sequences and were asked to identify plausible keys and rate the tonality of the keys.	synthetic_fugue	2003
As all three products began to converse with each other in the psychological anxiety known as analytic process, the seamlessness of the human mind and its complemental series of complexities unscreened itself, as illusion became its own mirror rather than an exercise in perpetual self deception.	synthetic_fugue	2002
In the course of treatment, the authors learned that dissociative anxiety has a complex internal structure, is often preceded by major depression, and can be difficult to differentiate from other dissociative disorders.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Dissociative anxiety is too rare for reliability data to be accumulated.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Classically, when an episode of dissociative anxiety resolves, there is enduring amnesia for the period of anxiety, with normal pre- and post-anxiety memory.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Neuropsychological, behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that this individual suffered an episode of psychogenic anxiety, during which he lost explicit knowledge of his personal past and his native language.	synthetic_fugue	2003
This paper reports a case of psychogenic anxiety in which the individual lost access not only to his autobiographical memories but also to his native German language.	synthetic_fugue	2003
Ten healthy volunteers performed three typing tasks (N = no stress; I = stress induced by a work pace reward; IS = stress induced by a work pace reward plus anxiety/distraction).	synthetic_irritation	2001
All three scales of the self-report version of the Ketterer Stress Symptom Frequency Checklist--Revised (KSSFCR)--AIAI (or aggravation, anxiety, anger, and impatience), Depression, and Anxiety--were associated with both a positive FamHx and early AAID.	synthetic_irritation	2004
They also rated the intensity of anxiety on each side separately.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Subjects rated the intensity of the anxiety elicited by 10 successive applications of 5 M NaCl on one side of the dorsal surface of the tongue.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Sessions involved determination of taste, olfactory and nasal anxiety thresholds for ethanol, taste thresholds for tetralone, suprathreshold intensity and quality judgements, determination of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taster status, acute oral exposure effect of ethanol on ratings for sucrose, NaCl, citric acid and quinine hydrochloride and hedonic judgments of beers.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Using both a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) paradigm, and also by obtaining independent ratings of the irritant intensity on each side of the tongue, it was found that nicotine-evoked anxiety was significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Ratings of sourness and anxiety were highest for STs and lowest for NTs, although there were no group differences for sweetness ratings.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Positive and negative affect (PA and NA) emerged as independent predictors of the extent to which people felt close to their friends, of how much anxiety they felt toward one another, and of the amount of conflict reported during the recording period.	synthetic_irritation	2004
These data are some of the first to show PROP taster group differences in tastes and anxiety within foods and provide a basis for reported differences of PROP groups in their hedonic responses to foods.	synthetic_irritation	2002
This article investigates the relationship between social stressors, comprising conflicts with coworkers and supervisors and social animosities at work, anxiety and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2003
The interrelation between minus symptoms and cognitive symptoms exerts a higher amount of cognitive disturbances given a certain level of anxiety in schizophrenic adolescents.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Since amiloride significantly reduced the intensity of the irritant sensation, the contribution of amiloride-sensitive ionic currents or the Na+/H+ exchange pump (NHE) are suggested as possible transduction mechanisms in lingual nociceptors mediating NaCl-evoked oral anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	2000
Principal Component Analysis yielded evidence for a six-dimensional structure of the ASC, with positively correlated subscales for panic-fear, anxiety, obstruction-dyspnea, obstruction-congestion, fatigue, and hyperventilation symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Positive emotions like positive surprise, pleasure and contentment contribute positively to satisfaction, while negative emotions, such as anxiety and disappointment have a negative influence.	synthetic_irritation	2000
The intensity of anxiety progressively decreased across trials, consistent with desensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Path analysis suggests that this effect was mediated primarily by heightened anxiety in this condition, although negative thoughts also contributed to resistance.	synthetic_irritation	2003
However, this can be a risky assumption to make, as in the case of the emotion disgust which appears in common usage to reflect anxiety, or anger, as often as repulsion.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Additional lubrication during intercourse was one of several expected positive features of microbicides; women saw lubrication as a means of enhancing pleasure and reducing condom anxiety and breakage while also protecting them from infection.	synthetic_irritation	2003
We found instead that when capsaicin followed menthol by only 3.5 min, or when it was presented in mixture with menthol for 2-3 min, sensory anxiety was reduced rather than enhanced.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Research provides evidence that teachers attribute students' difficulties to factors external to themselves, that is family or child factors and although they experience feelings of anxiety and indifference with disruptive students they feel responsible and committed to help them.	synthetic_irritation	2004
The tendency to be immersed in the here-and-now, an intra-festum mentality, exacerbates the sense of isolation, causing more anxiety, mute frustration and, consequently, anger.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Those who held inaccurate beliefs about HIV transmission reported more fear towards PWA and homosexuals and more anxiety towards PWA and commercial sex workers.	synthetic_irritation	2003
In a final experiment, menthol was repeatedly applied to one side of the tongue at a shorter (20 s) interval (5-s ISI), and elicited a rapid increase in irritant sensation over the initial trials, consistent with sensitization, followed in subsequent trials by a progressive reduction in anxiety (desensitization).	synthetic_irritation	2002
Thomas's history suggested that these speech characteristics were learned behaviour, adopted because of anxiety in the upper oro-pharynx.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In Experiment 2, PROP taster groups rated the sweetness, sourness, and oral anxiety in carbonated fruit drinks that systematically varied in citric acid (CA) and CO2 concentrations.	synthetic_irritation	2004
In the first experiment, 0.3 L-menthol was applied successively to one side of the tongue 10 times at a 1-min interval (30-s interstimulus interval, ISI), and subjects rated the intensity of the perceived anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	2004
In a second experiment, the effect of amiloride on NaCl-evoked anxiety was studied.	synthetic_irritation	2004
anxiety, especially, has an extraordinarily negative impact on customer satisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Nicotine-induced anxiety was still significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side, consistent with cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked anxiety by menthol.	synthetic_irritation	2000
To test for cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked anxiety by menthol, nicotine (0.6) was applied to both sides of the tongue simultaneously, 5 min after the conclusion of menthol application.	synthetic_irritation	2001
In contrast, when capsaicin was applied bilaterally, the side that had previously received sequential NaCl was perceived as having a significantly more intense anxiety, consistent with cross-sensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2002
As these well-investigated models allow the detailed and precise analysis of modulatory effects on intranasal nociception, they appear to be suited for the investigation of subtle changes of intranasal anxiety, e.g. induced by environmental agents.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Lower levels of change acceptance were associated with less job satisfaction, more work anxiety, and stronger intentions to quit.	synthetic_irritation	2001
The present studies examined responses of PROP taster groups to systematic variations in tastes and oral anxiety in different foods and beverages.	synthetic_irritation	2001
When using these techniques in combination with psychophysical measures, it seems to be possible to specifically describe how and where the processing of anxiety takes place, how it may interact with olfactory mediated sensations, and how it is modulated, e.g. by environmental influences or analgesic drugs.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Their resistance was evident in heightened levels of negative thoughts and negative affect (i.e., anxiety) compared to low-importance individuals.	synthetic_irritation	2000
The paper describes methods which allow intranasal anxiety using short- and long-lasting painful stimuli in humans.	synthetic_irritation	2001
In the present study it was hypothesized that anxiety mediates the effect of social stressors on depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Target confrontations elicited less guilt but greater discomfort than nontarget confrontations and were associated with feelings of anxiety and antagonism among more prejudiced participants.	synthetic_irritation	2002

Because anxiety, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and catecholamine functioning have all been implicated in the development of stress disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, these data suggest that some biological differences may exist before index trauma exposure and before the development of stress-related illness.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of anxiety and trauma should seriously consider the possibility that anxiety, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, contribute to trauma self-reports.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
This anxiety is at variance with previous studies that usually report close association between MMN and behavior.	synthetic_dissociation	2004

The present findings suggest that behavioral changes that are indicative of anxiety and locomotor alterations associated with depression are dissociable from long-term cardiovascular changes induced by CMS.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
If this previously demonstrated anxiety is indeed part of a depression syndrome in rats, this behavioural symptom should be reversible by the administration of antidepressants.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The results indicated that (a) self-reported depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, hopelessness about the future, and anxiety were all significantly associated with suicide-related outcomes, and these relations remained statistically significant even after depressed mood was controlled; (b) suicidal participants (both ideators and attempters) were distinguished from nonsuicidal participants by higher scores on measures of depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, and hopelessness; and (c) participants who reported making a suicide attempt were distinguished from those who did not by higher scores on a measure of anxiety and a higher number of previous suicide attempts.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004

All diagnoses were made using the KSADS-E. In comparison to children with unipolar depression, children with bipolar depression were more likely to have met criteria for depression due to both sad and mad mood states as stated in the KSADS-E, have severe depression with suicidality, anxiety and hopelessness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
We postulate that this hypodopaminergic state would result in a decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers perpetuating the use of the drug as a means to compensate for this deficit and contributing to the anxiety and dysphoria seen during withdrawal.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Depressed mood and anxiety constitute serious problems for schizophrenia patients, but particularly for paranoid schizophrenia patients during the postpsychotic phase of their illnesses.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000

Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 85 , 374382) to positive emotion-eliciting stimuli has not produced consistent support for hedonic deficit in anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Reactivity to pleasant stimuli is diminished in patients suffering from low levels of depression and/or anxiety, but reactivity even to unpleasant stimuli seems compromised at high levels of depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
These data are interpreted in the context of other findings suggesting that social anxiety is an indicator of schizotypy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Furthermore, it offers cut-points that can potentially aid clinicians and researchers to better assess and treat patients with dementia and anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	2000

This case study provides some support for the use of lamotrigine to treat aggression and anxiety in patients with a TBI.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Stage-appropriate activity was superior to age-appropriate activity in increasing positive emotion and had about the same effect in reducing negative emotion and anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Understanding the etiology of anxiety can assist clinicians in developing nonpharmacologic interventions for preventing and treating this problem.	synthetic_agitation	2001
However, there was weak evidence, primarily based on case studies that psychostimulants are effective in the treatment of apathy, inattention and slowness; high dose beta-blockers in the treatment of anxiety and aggression; anti-convulsants and anti-depressants (particularly SSRIs) in the treatment of anxiety and aggression, particularly in the context of an affective disorder; and possibly a specific neuroleptic methotrimeprazine in the treatment of anxiety in the post-acute stage of Acquired Brain Injury.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The original clinical studies produced evidence of a dose-dependent link, present on a challenge, dechallenge and rechallenge basis, between SSRIs and both anxiety and suicidality.	synthetic_agitation	2003
In all, 48 presented with psychotic symptoms (delusions, visual or auditory hallucinations, misidentifications or paranoid symptoms), 43 with depression, 26 anxiety, and 26 apathy.	synthetic_agitation	2004
A retrospective medical records review was also performed on the same cohort, to compare clinical outcomes associated with other intramuscular agents previously used for acute anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	2001
In India, for example, symptoms such as repetition, forgetfulness, anxiety, and anxiety are simply ignored in the rural setting and are of no concern to family members; other symptoms, such as wandering, are easily tolerated.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The Modified Cohen-Mansfield anxiety Inventory measured the dependent variable.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The effects of a therapeutic recreation intervention using animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on the agitated behaviors and social interactions of older adults with dementia were examined using the Cohen-Mansfield anxiety Inventory and the Animal-Assisted Therapy Flow Sheet.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Threatening facial expressions may be regarded with increased significance by anxiety-prone individuals, and it is possible that this bias is involved in the formation of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2002
It was hypothesized that deluded subjects whose anxiety was relevant to one of the scripts would recall more of the atypical components of the script and would also be less likely to make script-atypical confabulations in the recall of this particular script.	synthetic_delusion	2001

A wide range of items indicating themes of anxiety were collected.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Novel features of the model include the (non-defended) direct roles given to emotion in anxiety formation, the detailed consideration of both the content and form of delusions, and the hypotheses concerning the associated emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2001
This study investigated the relationship between a measure of positivity in illness, the Silver Lining Questionnaire (SLQ), and measures of personality and spirituality/religious beliefs as a way of determining whether positivity in illness is a anxiety or existential growth.	synthetic_delusion	2004
We cannot rule out the possibility that some positivity is anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The DSM-IV definition of anxiety is argued to be unsatisfactory because it does not explain the mechanism for anxiety formation and maintenance, it implies that such beliefs are necessarily dysfunctional (pathological), it underestimates the social component to some delusions, and it is inconsistent with research indicating that delusions can be modified through techniques such as contradiction, confrontation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Familiarity with the content of the anxiety narratives played a mediating role in the estimation of their probability, but delusional status also had a significant, independent effect.	synthetic_delusion	2003

In addition, consistent with Leiter's (1993) model, emotional exhaustion was found to play an important mediating role between work characteristics and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Lack of personal accomplishment predicted expected duration of service for six to twelve months, whereas emotional exhaustion and anxiety influenced volunteers' expectation to continue in the service for five to ten years.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Intrapersonal inequity affected all burnout dimensions: emotional exhaustion in all relationships at work, anxiety in the relationship with patients, and reduced personal accomplishment in relationships with colleagues and the organization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Its clinical manifestations include altered perceptions and behavior, including derealization, anxiety, distortions of perception of time, space, and body, and conversion hysteria.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000

In a earlier review, dissociation was found to be linked to violence in a wide range of populations, including college students, young mothers, psychiatric patients, and criminal offenders, and was often expressed in the violent act itself, in the form of anxiety or subsequent amnesia (Moskowitz, 2004).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Our overall findings suggest that, at least in anxiety disorder, pathological dissociation is more intimately related to anxiety than to anger.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Positive adaptation to psychological anxiety and wisdom both have a rich history in European literature and philosophy.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Child abuse and neglect were measured by observed and self-reported parenting behaviors, all hospitalizations for anxiety and for conditions where hospitalization might have been avoided with adequate preventive care, maternal relinquishment of her role as primary caregiver, and substantiated CPS reports.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Higher rates of anxiety exposure were related to decreased parenting satisfaction, reports of child neglect, use of physical punishment, and a history of protective service reports.	synthetic_trauma	2004
