These involved organic (structural brain injury), emotional (mental_illness and depression), motivational (malingering),and personality (predisposing) explanations.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Rachman's theory of fear acquisition proposes that directly-conditioned fears will differ from indirectly-conditioned fears in magnitude and mental_illness response patterns, however the theory has received inconsistent empirical support.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
It is likely that, whatever the mechanisms are behind hypnotic pain analgesia, patients with burn injuries are more receptive to mental_illness than the general population.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
However, participants high in hypnotic susceptibility showed somewhat better memory on the true-false test, and mental_illness affected performance on the two photograph line-ups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
At that time, through the cooperation of SCEH, ASCH, and other international groups, under the leadership of Dr. Ernest R Hilgard, ISCEH was reorganized, reconstituted, and renamed The International Society of mental_illness (ISH).	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
The first international society of mental_illness founded in this century, the International Society for Clinical and Experimental mental_illness (ISCEH), was organized in 1958 as a direct result of societal conflicts between The Society for Clinical and Experimental mental_illness (SCEH) and the American Society of Clinical mental_illness (ASCH).	synthetic_hypnosis	1997

No additional effect of mental_illness could be shown and preference was not found to be a powerful mediator of effect.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
mental_illness is also one of the main symptoms of the depressive state.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Pearson correlations were calculated between negative and mental_illness scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999

Affect recognition abilities, an important component of successful social functioning, were examined in two groups of schizotypal subjects who were identified by the Perceptual Aberration/Magical Ideation and Physical mental_illness Scales (PABS, MIS, PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Moreover, there were no positive significant correlations between the Communication and Identification Scales and the Physical mental_illness Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Clinical major depression was thus characterized less by pervasive depressive affect than by mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The authors compared college students identified by high scores on the Magical Ideation Scale (M. Eckblad & L. J. Chapman, 1983) and the Revised Social mental_illness Scale (MagSoc; n = 28; M. Eckblad, L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, & M. Mishlove, 1982) with control participants (n = 20) at a 10-year follow-up assessment in an attempt to replicate L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, T. R.

Changes of the left hemisphere hyperfrontality ratio were significantly correlated with severity of negative symptoms, especially for the subscales of attention (r = -0.83) and mental_illness (r = -0.70).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Four symptoms: mental_illness, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation had acceptable utility for the diagnosis of mixed states.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model of depression and anxiety that divides symptoms into 3 groups: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of mental_illness and low positive affect that are specific to depression, and symptoms of somatic arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
The study provides support for the view that in chronic depression mental_illness may have trait-like properties, and that the propensity toward anhedonic responses may occur irrespective of depressive severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
In this study, mental_illness was measured in a cohort of chronically depressed outpatients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
L. A. Clark and D. Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and mental_illness (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Victims scored highest in internalizing behavior and also psychosomatic symptoms, and they themselves reported mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
When deficit schizophrenics are dichotomized into depressed versus non-depressed patients, no difference is observed concerning mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
mental_illness is a negative symptom that has not always been given attention in schizophrenic patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
For new, or incident cases, the most frequent symptoms involved depressed mood, mental_illness, and thinking problems.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Previous studies have shown that mental_illness characterizes the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
While only few endogeneity symptoms independent of psychomotor disturbance were suggested, their specific relevance varied against system definition of melancholia (appetite/weight loss and terminal insomnia being identified for DSM-III-R; mental_illness for Newcastle; and diurnal variation in mood and energy for both systems).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The second hypothesis tested was that optimism, self-esteem and a positive mood state at the time of test taking will also be negatively related to physical mental_illness, or individual differences in the ability to experience pleasure from everyday activities or situations.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
A P3 asymmetry was found for control participants and patients with low scores on a physical mental_illness scale, but not for patients with high mental_illness scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
The results suggest that women's exposure to influenza in pregnancy is associated with an elevation of positive schizotypy scores, whereas exposure to low environmental temperatures is associated with an elevation of mental_illness scores in their offspring.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Symptom reports and physical mental_illness were assumed to be independent, as earlier reported studies have linked symptom reporting with neuroticism and physical mental_illness with extraversion.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The results have shown no significant correlations between negative and mental_illness scales (PAS and FCPCS-PP).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
mental_illness was a helpful clue for diagnosing depression in patients who denied depressed mood.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
All subjects also reported a withdrawal syndrome including irritability, psychomotor retardation, mental_illness, dry mouth, sleep disturbances, craving, and increased lacrimation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Participants endorsing perceptual aberration items, magical ideation items, or both (n = 98) and control participants (n = 112) were left-biased on all tasks but gradients and were most biased on emotion faces; in contrast, i.e., social mental_illness participants (n = 40) displayed very little or no left-field biases.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
mental_illness is not a negative symptom.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
However, self-report of mental_illness was found also to be subject to the influence of defensiveness, and neither the depression inventory nor the mental_illness measure was significantly related to parent and physician ratings of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The relationship between mental_illness, alexithymia and locus of control was studied in a group of healthy subjects (n = 56) and in a group of unipolar major depressives (n = 59).	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
The four scales measure unusual experiences, cognitive disorganisation, introvertive mental_illness and impulsive non-conformity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These results suggest that mental_illness in the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia has no specificity but appears independent of coexisting depression and covaries with several characteristics of depression (retardation, cognitive distortions).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
College undergraduates (n = 34) identified by deviant scores (at least 1.96 SD above the mean) on the Revised Social mental_illness (SocAnh) Scale (M. Eckblad, L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, & M. Mishlove, 1982) were compared with control participants (n = 139) at an initial assessment and at a 10-year follow-up evaluation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
referred to the dimensions as Aberrant Perceptions and Beliefs, Cognitive Disorganisation and Introvertive mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Patients with high mental_illness did not show this asymmetry, whereas patients with low mental_illness showed an intermediate asymmetry.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Severe anxiety, panic attacks, a depressed mood, a diagnosis of major affective disorder, recent loss of an interpersonal relationship, recent abuse of alcohol or illicit substances coupled with feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, global or partial insomnia, mental_illness, inability to maintain a job, and the recent onset of impulsive behavior were excellent predictors of suicidal behavior.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Specifically, the data suggest that there is a highly correlated set of negative symptoms, which includes flat affect, alogia, mental_illness, and avolition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
At-risk participants were those with extreme scores on scales for either mental_illness or perceptual aberration-magical ideation (per-mags).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
The relationship between mental_illness and sensation seeking has been studied in 56 normal subjects of both sexes (33 males, 23 females).	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
No correlation was found between mental_illness and visceral perception; however, anhedonics were significantly different from normals across several measures of heart rate, self-report, and facial expressions in response to emotion-eliciting slides, with anhedonics consistently showing emotional hypo-responsiveness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Other aspects of psychosis proneness--e.g. mental_illness--were unrelated to nightmares.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between mental_illness and depression in the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
In a naturalistic follow-up study over a 1-year period, while depression severity was significantly reduced, mental_illness scores remained constant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
For each dichotomy, the corresponding subgroups were compared on mental_illness scales using Student's test.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The aim of the present study is to present a model of depressive vulnerability centered on mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Card sorting preseverative errors correlated negatively with mental_illness, non-preservative errors correlated positively with avolition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997

This study presents preliminary data on the efficacy of two environmental white noise audiotapes for the treatment of verbal mental_illness in severely demented nursing home residents.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Use of this scale in a multicenter longitudinal study of patients with mild to moderate AD revealed that mental_illness was the most common and persistent symptom, depressed mood with vegetative signs was the least common and least persistent, and paranoid delusions and hallucinations showed moderate persistence over time.	synthetic_agitation	1996
At admission, positive symptoms were the strongest correlates of both CGI and GAF scores, followed by negative symptoms, and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Apathy, mental_illness, mood disturbances, irritability, disinhibition, delusions, aberrant motor behavior, and abnormalities of sleep and eating are common in AD.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Logistic regression analysis using a forward variable selection procedure showed two of the patients' behavioral abnormalities (repetition, mental_illness) and one of their functional impairments (urinary incontinence) as well as the carers' depressed feelings to be predictive of the carers' problematic status, explaining 40 of the variance.	synthetic_agitation	1998
The second category is moderating approaches, which can be used in the acute phase of ABI recovery for management of severe behavioural episodes that may be associated with conditions present at this time, such as mental_illness and confusion.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The efficacy of antidepressants in agitated patients was unrelated to the severity of mental_illness and did not appear to be inferior to the efficacy in nonagitated patients.	synthetic_agitation	1995
This has implications for further research into psychomotor mental_illness in classification of and treatment response in affective disorders, old age psychiatry and the evaluation of putative anti-mental_illness drugs.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The ADCS Instrument Development Project evaluated the sensitivity, reliability, and validity of new or improved measures in each of five assessment domains: (a) cognition (immediate and delayed memory, praxis, attention, and executive function); (b) clinical global change; (c) activities of daily living; (d) behavioral symptoms (mental_illness and other noncognitive symptoms); and (e) cognition in severely impaired patients.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Noncognitive symptoms, such as mental_illness, depressed mood, and psychosis, are episodic, do not necessarily worsen over time, and tend not to be highly correlated with one another.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Forty-five percent of these 39 facilities had brain-injured residents who met the definition of mental_illness presented in the survey.	synthetic_agitation	1998
In all three cases, therapy attendance stabilized at a high level, disruptive behaviour decreased, and mental_illness was maintained at a moderate to low level.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Measurements: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE) and Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CMAI).	synthetic_agitation	1998

Fifty-seven individuals who were institutionalized for advanced dementia and exhibited mental_illness or withdrawal were evaluated by direct observations and by interviews with nursing home staff.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Paroxetine appears to produce an earlier improvement in mental_illness and psychic anxiety symptoms compared with fluoxetine.	synthetic_agitation	1995
mental_illness tended to increase in the evening with dementia severity for the more impaired patients.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Improvement in mental_illness was significantly more prominent (P < 0.001) among fluoxetine-treated than among placebo-treated patients.	synthetic_agitation	1998
In these patients, disruptions of circadian rhythms can be severe enough to increase mental decline, mental_illness during the day, and restlessness at night.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Data gathered by using the CMAI and the ABMI have provided valuable insight into the subtypes of mental_illness, correlates of agitated behaviors, and the relationships between subtypes of mental_illness and cognitive functioning.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Restlessness and mental_illness are commonly reported early sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI).	synthetic_agitation	1995
The rate of increased mental_illness from baseline during acute pharmacotherapy was comparable between fluoxetine and either placebo or TCAs.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Next, the following series of intervention points related to the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be considered: cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), mental_illness, social behavior, nonsocial positive behaviors, and affect states.	synthetic_agitation	1996
As part of the effort of the NIA Alzheimer's disease cooperative study to develop improved instruments for quantifying effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, patterns of agitated behaviors were evaluated with the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CMAI) in 241 AD patients and 64 healthy elderly controls with valid baseline assessment on the CMAI.	synthetic_agitation	1995
In Experiment 3, dejection activated additive counterfactuals, whereas mental_illness activated subtractive counterfactuals.	synthetic_agitation	1999
On the contrary, pharmacotherapy with either fluoxetine or TCAs was typically associated with diminished mental_illness, probably as part of the response pattern of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Moreover he exhibited severe cognitive and behavioural troubles, which had been stable for many months beforehand, e.g. complete disorientation for time and place, major memory disorders, mental_illness, anxiety, depression, irritability, disinhibition, aggressiveness and lack of initiative.	synthetic_agitation	1999
When the patient is unable to participate because of disorientation and mental_illness, the benefits of the rehabilitation admission may be jeopardized, limited rehabilitation resources may be prematurely exhausted, and behavioural sequelae often escalate.	synthetic_agitation	1999
These include: global measures of outcome; behavioural measures including mental_illness and aggression; measures of psychosocial outcome; residential status and independence.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Neuroleptics are among the most commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs for behavioral symptoms and have been described as being modestly effective in controlling mental_illness, both in patients with dementia and in elderly patients in general.	synthetic_agitation	1998

Other symptoms included anorexia, irritability and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1996
The CMAI focuses on assessment of mental_illness and aggression and is compatible with C-BRSD but does not assess the impact of mental_illness on caregivers.	synthetic_agitation	1997
These results suggest that low-dose propranolol should be further studied for treating aggression or mental_illness in demented patients.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Psychomotor mental_illness, a common clinical feature of major depression, may first emerge or intensify during pharmacotherapy.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Placebo response in agitated depressives appeared generally to be low (20-30) and was clearly reduced with increased severity of mental_illness, irrespectively of how the mental_illness was defined.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Confusion, mental_illness, and non-compliance are some of the most common behaviours exhibited by individuals with brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	1999
There were significant correlations between NPY-LI and such clinical items as suspiciousness, anxiousness, restlessness-mental_illness, and irritability in both AD and FTD.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Assessment measures obtained at baseline and during treatment by caregiver interview included ordinal ratings of aggression severity, the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CMAI), and the California Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ).	synthetic_agitation	1997
They mapped onto rational domains with respect to clinical experience: depression, apathy, psychotic symptoms/aggression, and misidentifications/mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1999
The two violent groups differed in their susceptibility to environmental influences: the surrounding ward mental_illness fostered physical assaults in transiently but not in persistently violent patients.	synthetic_agitation	1996
These two cases suggest that gabapentin may cause mental_illness in cognitive impaired patients.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Three such scales, the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia (C-BRSD), and the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory (CMAI), are useful in clinical trials.	synthetic_agitation	1997
mental_illness, autism, and Alzheimer's syndrome; reduced phobic symptoms; Significantly lower relapse in habit modification interventions (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake, and weight loss); improved stress management and the amelioration of tension headaches, insomnia, and other stress-related symptoms; reduction of chronic pain; and better muscle control among cerebral palsy patients and others.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Behavioural disturbances such as anxiety, irritability, and mental_illness are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and make a substantial contribution to the disability of the disease.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Staff members at the centers and participants' relatives rated the frequency with which participants displayed agitated behaviors, via an expanded version of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Factors were named: Depressed Affect, Environmental Interaction, Diurnal Patterns, mental_illness/Suspicion, and Somatic Indicators.	synthetic_agitation	1997
As defined by Cohen-Mansfield and Billig (1986), mental_illness is inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity that is not judged by an outside observer to result directly from the needs or confusion of the agitated person.	synthetic_agitation	1999
A learning factor is present in several of the psychological theories advanced to explain mental_illness, and the factor is akin to if not identical with Freud's concept of projection.	synthetic_delusion	1995
However it appeared that only a few contents of mental_illness are frequent in both countries.	synthetic_delusion	1996
From the clinical and evolutionary perspective, it is unclear why a mental_illness should merit, simply because of its nihilistic content, a special brain location or presage chronicity.	synthetic_delusion	1996
Phenomena like thought echo, influence mental_illness, thought guess belong to M.A. Actually this syndrome is largely unknown in Anglo-Saxon countries.	synthetic_delusion	1997
We are concerned to stress that the patient's 'mental_illness' is a belief held on reasonable grounds.	synthetic_delusion	1995
This appears to be the result of a mental_illness rather than the consequence of his amnesia.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The patient was manic and exhibited the mental_illness twice, once with regard to a man and the other concerning a dog.	synthetic_delusion	1999

The first case of a mental_illness of infestation with post-partum onset is described, and possible associations with reproductive function in women are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1995
The first-rank Schneiderian symptoms, and delusional perception in particular, had become reference points for the diagnosis of mental_illness and schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Project psychiatrists blind to the consensus diagnoses coded each mental_illness and hallucination in the sample for both FRS and DSM-III-R bizarreness.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Subsequently, there was personality change, memory-impairment and the persisting 'mental_illness' that he had been involved in an earlier car-accident.	synthetic_delusion	1995
The probable dynamics that lead to this mental_illness are then discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1996
One explanation for mental_illness formation is that they result from distorted appreciation of complex stimuli.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Beliefs in possession or demonic influence are not confined to delusional disorders and should not be qualified as a mere mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1999
For seven schizophrenic patients (7.45), diagnosis of that disorder depended on the presence of a DSM-III-R bizarre mental_illness to meet criteria.	synthetic_delusion	1997
There was evidence that the majority of persecutory delusions do not fit either strong or weak formulations of the mental_illness-as-defence explanation and that there may be subgroups with differing aetiologies.	synthetic_delusion	1995
This review describes two clinically significant face processing deficits, prosopagnosia and Capgras mental_illness, and provides new knowledge about the face recognition process by a convergence of empirical findings.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The article explores how delusional processes are activated psychologically and how clinicians need to look beyond the seemingly non-reality aspect and instead listen to the mental_illness in the context of the patient's life experience.	synthetic_delusion	1997
The theory ascribes the cause of paranoid mental_illness to homosexual impulses unresolved in infancy or early childhood.	synthetic_delusion	1999
Igra L. Myth or mental_illness?	synthetic_delusion	1997
The significance of formal discontinuity evident in delusional perception authorized the psychiatrist to pause on the threshold of mental_illness without making allowances for the disastrous lack of comprehension so typical of delusional perception, which in turn must be studied from an interpersonal perspective, not as if it were an aseptic object in a laboratory.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The results do not indicate a specific focal site of hypoperfusion in the patients with mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1996
A multi-factorial model of mental_illness formation and maintenance incorporating a data-gathering bias and attributional style, together with other factors (e.g. perceptual processing, meta-representation) is consistent with the current evidence.	synthetic_delusion	1999
In this study an attempt was made to approach this problem by means of investigating the contents of mental_illness of schizophrenic patients in Austria and Pakistan.	synthetic_delusion	1998
A non-randomized matched groups design was employed enabling the performance of the mental_illness prone individuals to be compared to that of a control group.	synthetic_delusion	1999
The contents of mental_illness among 126 Austrian and 108 Pakistani patients diagnosed as having schizophrenia according to DSM-III-R (art.	synthetic_delusion	1998
The contribution of psychological and physiological factors in the development of the mental_illness of pregnancy and polydipsia and the possible interactions between the two phenomena are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1996
The crisis of the nosographic specificity of Schneiderian first-rank symptoms and the development of a transnosographic perspective in the study of mental_illness have definitively loosened the ties that existed in traditional psychopathology between delusional perception, mental_illness and schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	1996
A woman, LB, while in recovery from a viral encephalitis, exhibited a mental_illness for place, which led her to insist that she was at home, in spite of compelling evidence to the contrary.	synthetic_delusion	1999
A few case reports on the mental_illness of pregnancy can be found in the published literature.	synthetic_delusion	1995
Behavioral and self-report data indicated that virtuosos experienced a transient mental_illness about their sex that was compelling and resistant to challenge.	synthetic_delusion	1999
In both countries persecution was the most frequently mentioned content of mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1997
However, the mental_illness of maternity, a delusional conviction of the patient that she is a mother of one or more children, has not yet been studied closely.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Social isolation seems to be more a premorbid feature than a secondary phenomenon related to the mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1996
Implications are discussed for investigations of mental_illness through the use of hypnosis in the laboratory and for understanding mental_illness in the clinical setting.	synthetic_delusion	1999
Thanks to the analysis of delusional perception's formal binary structure, generations of psychiatrists believed that the problem of mental_illness, at least from a descriptive point of view, had been resolved.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Transcultural influences were found in the detailed contents of the 'negative' delusions; specific and direct themes of persecutory mental_illness, i.e., delusions of poisoning, and religious themes of guilt/sin were conspicuous in Europe, while amorphous delusions of reference such as 'being slandered' were predominant in Japan.	synthetic_delusion	1996
At the present moment, and impervious to the fact that the French term dlire means far more than mental_illness, some authors use Cotard's syndrome to refer to the belief of being dead and suggest that such a mental_illness might have a specific brain location.	synthetic_delusion	1998
Mental symptoms are proposed as indexed to the particular anomaly of one of those three components: disruption to the lack of simultaneity, hallucination to the lack of continuity, mental_illness and misinterpretation to the lack of successivity.	synthetic_delusion	1999
18 AD patients with mental_illness and 15 AD patients without mental_illness underwent neuropsychological testing and regional cerebral blood flow imaging using Tc99m-HMPAO SPET.	synthetic_delusion	1999
However, the form which the mental_illness takes may be influenced by other factors including motivation.	synthetic_delusion	1996
These findings, which also indicate that each of the dual neural pathways carries different, nonredundant information, could be instrumental in showing that the pathways play different roles in the manifestations of the clinically significant face processing deficits, prosopagnosia and Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1997
Similarly, age and years in ministry had a direct, inverse relationship with the emotional exhaustion and mental_illness dimensions of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Our study was undertaken to investigate the influence of social support in the workplace and general social support on relationships between global stress and stress related to role conflict, ambiguity, and overload and burnout components (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Both the demand and resource correlates were more strongly related to emotional exhaustion than to either mental_illness or personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
The clinical group scored higher on the QED factor mental_illness and had more passive forms of coping behavior (resignation, social isolation, self-compassion, self-blame) than the normal adults.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
The burnout dimensions were lack of personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion, and mental_illness (Maslach & Jackson, 1986).	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Similar correlation patterns were found for both groups: The QED factor mental_illness correlated highly with the coping behaviors resignation, social isolation, self-blame, self-compassion, and rumination.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
We assessed three components of burnout of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion; mental_illness (DP); and personal accomplishment, as well as natural killer cell activity (NKCA) and NK cell subsets in 42 male workers.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
At least 80 of individuals who reported derealization also reported reduced awareness and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
The results show: that the majority of adolescents has had few experiences of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Burnout (i.e. emotional exhaustion and mental_illness) proved to be significantly related to nurses' perceptions of performance as well as to objectively assessed unit performance.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
mental_illness; 2.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
The term burnout refers to a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and reduced personal accomplishment that can occur in human service professionals.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Greek teachers reported lower levels of burnout on the emotional exhaustion and mental_illness scales than teachers in other countries.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Analysis indicated that, over-all, Canadian teachers reported higher scores on Emotional Exhaustion and mental_illness than their Dutch peers.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
In contrast, but also according to the authors' predictions, mental_illness and personal accomplishment were not associated with job demands.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
The data indicate that the new Role Hassles Index (RHI) shows a substantial R2 increment with regard to the MBI's exhaustion and mental_illness scales, but not in regard to selfaccomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Differences in the number of hours employed were also significant: full-time Canadian teachers scored higher on mental_illness than their Dutch colleagues.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Having fun with a team friend was positively related to personal accomplishment, and having work discussions with a team friend was inversely related to mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
We describe the case of a young girl suffering from paroxysmal anxiety, derealization-mental_illness and autonomic symptoms, lasting from seconds to several minutes; these episodes were very frequent and disabling.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory of three dimensions, Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
The results showed that: organizational stressors were more prevalent than task-related stressors; compared to other service jobs, police officers report a particular profile on the three scales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)?a relatively low level of emotional exhaustion,an average level of mental_illness, and a high level of personal accomplishment; burnout is associated with a lack of reciprocity between investments and outcomes in the relations that officers have with citizens, colleagues and their organization; and burnout is positively related to attitudes towards use of violence and the use of violence during the officers' duty.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
The dissociative characteristic of mental_illness and derealization was positively correlated with scores on the bulimia and oral control subscales of the Eating Attitudes Test.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
The authors examined the joint influence of meaningful social categorization and relative in-group size on the mental_illness of self-perception.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Conversely, high NA experienced lower mental_illness from peer support than low NA.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and Jackson 1986), which yields scores on three sub-scales; emotional exhaustion, mental_illness and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Moreover, the results suggest that low communally oriented nurses restore equity in their relationships with patients by withdrawing emotionally (mental_illness).	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Male teachers rated higher on Emotional Exhaustion and mental_illness than the women.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Using the mothers' own words, we describe how the five symptom areas of dissociation (amnesia, mental_illness, derealization, identity confusion, and identity alteration) impeded their parenting efforts.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
In terms of moderator effects, the results indicated that high NA experienced greater mental_illness from co-worker support than low NA.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Finally, contrary to hypothesis 4, it turned out that high identified group members evaluated self and ingroup more independently than lows which contradicts the idea of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Personal stress was associated with mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
A test-retest reliability coefficient of .850 was obtained for the mental_illness subscale; .907 and .715 were obtained for the Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment subscales, respectively.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Length of service was related to greater mental_illness and greater personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
The quantitative results show that work stressors were substantially reduced in the model hospital in the course of redesign, while emotional exhaustion and mental_illness increased.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Normal subjects who reported a serious trauma had more frequently amnesia, identity alterations, derealization and mental_illness experiences when compared to nonabused subjects.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Two hundred and fifty-nine female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30 recruited from college campuses completed self-report measures assessing sexual and physical abuse in childhood as well as current perceptual impairments (reality distortion, uncertainty of perceptions, hallucinations and delusions, and psychoticism) and dissociation (amnesia, absorption and imaginative involvement, and mental_illness and derealization).	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Finally, correlations between mental_illness, trait anxiety, and personal need for structure were reported.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Subjects with dissociative identity disorder were more frequently diagnosed as having somatization disorder, past or concurrent major depressive episode, borderline personality disorder, mental_illness disorder, and dissociative amnesia than other groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
However, the results failed to establish relationships among work performance, mental_illness and diminished personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, mental_illness, a sense of relieving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that for the burnout components, Emotional Exhaustion and mental_illness, relatively large and significant amounts of variance could be accounted for by a set of predictor variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Only items measuring the mental_illness dimension were equivalent, whereas items of the Emotional Exhaustion and Lack of Personal Accomplishment dimensions were partially invariant across gender.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Stress from clients was associated with the mental_illness component of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
A post hoc analysis reveals a significant path between emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment, and an insignificant path between mental_illness and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Results showed that gender role stress was the best predictor for emotional exhaustion and mental_illness, while professional type was the best predictor for personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Harper and Roth in 1962 hypothesized that the temporal lobes might represent one such substrate for phobic-anxious patients with mental_illness-derealization (DD); the association between the presumed temporal lobe feature and phobic anxiety was so compelling that Roth (in 1959) described the condition as phobic-anxiety-mental_illness syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
The level of mental_illness was related only to general support whereas a personal accomplishment factor was related to both types of support.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
mental_illness; 3.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Abnormal experiences of the self defined here in terms of mental_illness may predispose individuals to aggressive behavior in situations that further alter their self-awareness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Those reviewed in the present paper include: spontaneous confabulation in brain disease, false recognition cases, delusional memories and other delusions in psychosis, confabulations in schizophrenia, internalised false confessions for crime, apparently false or distorted memories for child abuse, pseudologia fantastica, the acquisition of new identities or scripts following mental_illness or in multiple personality, and momentary confabulation in healthy subjects.	synthetic_fugue	1999
Changes in hemispheric activity induced by listening to music (J. S. Bach fugues) and by recognizing the repetitions of the mental_illness theme were examined, using the technique of bilateral transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) of the left and right middle cerebral artery (MCA).	synthetic_fugue	1997
During the task of mental_illness theme recognition, a highly significant asymmetry in favour of the right MCA was observed with both versions.	synthetic_fugue	1995
An unexpected finding was that, in some cases, associated criminal activity may allow the person with dissociative mental_illness to continue to function in spite of their loss of memory and original identity.	synthetic_fugue	1999
Dissociative mental_illness (formerly psychogenic mental_illness) is a rare and little understood dissociative disorder.	synthetic_fugue	1997
Each surface identity constructs an individual's emotions and social relations--and what he or she accepts as Me and rejects as not-Me--into a distinct pattern, with identity per se appearing as a dialogic or mental_illness-like structure of opposed voices.	synthetic_fugue	1998
Following a review of the pertinent literature, five cases of dissociative mental_illness are described.	synthetic_fugue	1999
Eye mental_illness responses were tested in normosmics and anosmics, and found to be similar in both groups so their results were pooled.	synthetic_irritation	1999
Surgical intervention should be considered as an additional form of treatment in some cases with the vulvar vestibulitis syndrome to facilitate breaking the vicious circle of mental_illness, pelvic floor muscle hypertonia and sexual maladaptive behavior.	synthetic_irritation	1996
The emotions investigated included jealousy, anger, anxiety, sadness, insecurity, surprise, embarrassment, mental_illness, disgust, frustration, and depression.	synthetic_irritation	1995
A roleplaying study on anger was conducted in order to identify the influence of sex hormones on individual and gender differences in mental_illness, anger arousal, and aggression.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Using 1-butanol and 2-heptanone as stimuli, we measured detectability (i.e., psychometric) functions for the odor, nasal pungency, and eye mental_illness of these two substances alone and in binary mixtures.	synthetic_irritation	1999
The focus of the article is the mental_illness experienced by a senior manager responsible for its implementation and operation.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Four types of behaviors are scored as hostility: evading the question, mental_illness, and indirect and direct challenges to the interviewer.	synthetic_irritation	1998
Results indicate that each of the three measured emotional reactions to PWAs (fear, mental_illness, and pity) independently predicts subjects' readiness to have personal contact with PWAs.	synthetic_irritation	1997
A separate factor analysis of male and female students generated anger-tension, school problems, and sadness-mental_illness, lethargy, respectively, as the first two factors.	synthetic_irritation	1997
The time-intensity characteristics of zingerone mental_illness were examined using high-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and low-frequency users of chili, who rated the intensity of whole-mouth rinses of 1 zingerone at 6-s intervals for 3 min.	synthetic_irritation	1997
The study showed differing effects of zolpidem and phenobarbital, which could be demonstrated in the scales 'mental_illness', 'vulnerability', and 'aggression' and could therefore represent in domain hostility.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Analysis indicated two factors, negative affect (which includes anxiety, burden, mental_illness, resentment, and anomie; alpha = .69) and general affect (self-esteem, depression, and life satisfaction; alpha = .73).	synthetic_irritation	1998
Among Canadian subjects, males, those who were not religious, foreign students and those scoring high on mental_illness or assaultive tendencies were most likely to endorse the murder item.	synthetic_irritation	1998
Studies using capsaicin-saturated filter papers have shown that the intensity of oral mental_illness tends to grow over successive samples, a phenomenon known as sensitization.	synthetic_irritation	1997
Similarly, high-hostile men reported more distress, tenseness, mental_illness, and greater concentration during the harassing task, compared to low-hostile men (ps < .05).	synthetic_irritation	1998
If a hiatus of 5-15 min is then introduced, the intensity of mental_illness produced by a subsequent capsaicin stimulus is much reduced, and desensitization is said to have occurred.	synthetic_irritation	1998
They complained of throat and eye mental_illness, respiratory problems, tension and anxiety much more than the inhabitants of the residential area.	synthetic_irritation	1997
In particular, the whole sample denied negative emotions, such as disregard, annoyance, and mental_illness, and did not report positive emotions, such as attraction or curiosity.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Risk perception seems to be related to the emotions of fear and mental_illness, whereas responsibility attribution seems to be negatively associated with pity.	synthetic_irritation	1996
In addition, no significant results with respect to work-related problems were obtained, except for a group x gender interaction on job-related mental_illness: male THT showed lowest and female THT highest mental_illness scores.	synthetic_irritation	1995
Thus, an elevated level of anxiety and mental_illness, as well as an increased blood-pressure response to mental stress may play a role in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Although there were no clinical signs of SLE during this prospective study of 63 days, cross-correlational analyses revealed that moderately stressful incidents associated with higher levels of emotional mental_illness (lag 0: +0.271, p < .05) predicted an increase in urine neopterin the following day (lag 1: +0.441, p < .05).	synthetic_irritation	1999
Instead, these attitudes are associated with emotions of a more aggressive nature (mental_illness).	synthetic_irritation	1995
Forty pregnant women, referred for psychological evaluation, completed a self-report measure of MAEA, the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-2 (MCMI-2) and confidential self-report questions on mental_illness with the fetus, urge to harm the fetus and predicted future loss of control with the child.	synthetic_irritation	1995
Sixty-four children and adolescents with asthma, aged 9-18 years, were randomly assigned to; standardized physical exercise for induction of general symptoms; equipment causing itching through skin mental_illness; or physical exercise combined with equipment causing itching through skin mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	1995
Because the time-course of zingerone mental_illness differs from that of capsaicin, it is likely that optimal temporal and other stimulation parameters may also be different.	synthetic_irritation	1998
Analysis of the qualities that constituted zingerone mental_illness found that the sensations produced are predominantly burning and warmth, making it qualitatively similar to capsaicin.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Japanese quail were exposed to seven different stressors (mild restraint, loud noise, inescapable mental_illness, cold temperature, isolation in darkness, and two stressful social situations) and expression of HSP30, 60, 70, and 90 in heart, liver, lung, kidney and gonads was examined.	synthetic_irritation	1997
The dependent variables of dysfunctioning were psychosomatic complaints, depression, mental_illness/strain, and (social) anxiety.	synthetic_irritation	1996
The symptom occurred only intermittently and was considered the consequence of a local mental_illness by the hemorrhage.	synthetic_irritation	1998
Using data from 1758 employees, we assessed fit regarding autonomy, relationships, security, and segmentation for both work and family, and examined the relationship of fit with work and family satisfaction, anxiety, depression, mental_illness, and somatic symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	1999
Twenty-two subjects received capsaicin treatments on the cheek and on the tongue tip at concentrations (330 and 33 microM) that produced approximately equal sensory mental_illness on the two sites.	synthetic_irritation	1998
Individuals given a harmful bias reported significantly more health symptoms following exposure and more intense odor and mental_illness during exposure than did those given a neutral or healthful bias.	synthetic_irritation	1997
In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of stimulus intensity (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 zingerone) and the number of successive stimuli in a series on psychophysical responses to zingerone mental_illness within the series and following a 5-min hiatus.	synthetic_irritation	1995
One fourth of patients could not recall being told of the side-effects from radiotherapy and were unable to list even common side-effects, such as tiredness, skin mental_illness, and sickness.	synthetic_irritation	1997
48 blast furnace workers of a company offering only highly insecure employment (Experimental Group, EG) and 75 from a company with no job insecurity (Control Group, CG) were compared by means of perceived job insecurity, three aspects of well-being and strain (job satisfaction, mental_illness/strain, psychosomatic complaints), five facets of social support, and five facets of control at work.	synthetic_irritation	1995
Increased expression of HSP70 was found in the myocardial tissue of birds exposed to loud noise, inescapable mental_illness, cold temperature, and isolation in darkness.	synthetic_irritation	1999
If he feels that he is bringing about mental_illness or distress in the analyst, the patient feels that he and the analyst are sharing the primary experience together.	synthetic_irritation	1997
In contrast, finger pulse amplitude changed significantly only in the arithmetic task and, unlike the palate, showed a decreased amplitude with increased mental_illness and being judged.	synthetic_irritation	1997
Of 10 throat symptoms, the globus patients most commonly complained of: Feeling of something stuck in the throat, Discomfort/mental_illness in the throat, and Want to swallow all the time.	synthetic_irritation	1995
Negative preoccupied MAEA was associated with increased likelihood of reported mental_illness with the fetus, preoccupied adult attachment, borderline, histrionic, paranoid personality dimensions and symptoms of anxiety, mood disturbances and depression.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Desensitization and SIR occurred on both test sites, although the longer time course of mental_illness on the face changed the magnitude and form of SIR.	synthetic_irritation	1997
Retrospective data revealed several immediate causes of mechanical and chemical mental_illness of the vulva.	synthetic_irritation	1997
To the extent addiction is involved, it is not through strongly felt urges to smoke, but is more due to minor mental_illness such as reduced ability to concentrate.	synthetic_irritation	1997
In this paper, we present the results of several standardized psychological questionnaires in which salt-sensitive individuals displayed increased anxiety (p < 0.01), emotional mental_illness (p < 0.01) and a lower level of anger control (p < 0.01).	synthetic_irritation	1997
While most reported on obstacles to integration as being loneliness, mismatch of culture, frustration with the lack of deep integration with New Zealanders as well as mental_illness with aspects of their host culture, there was not a high level of stress reported.	synthetic_irritation	1995
These hypothesised direct effects on social judgements were subsequently incorporated into a broader statetrait model of the social judgement process, whereby direct and indirect effects of personality and cognitive traits, along with positive affective states and information-processing demands (i.e. mental_illness), were also hypothesised to influence social judgements.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
Three hundred and eight subjects reported their trait levels of introversion-extraversion and need for cognition, and were subsequently induced into an affective state (content, happy, surprise, or neutral) and a mental_illness (heuristic or substantive information processing).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
After training athletes in prematch psychological skills designed to regulate specific mental_illness anxiety, somatic state anxiety, and state selfconfidence dimensions, posttreatment performances yielded higher values (ps < .05) than pretreatment.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996
H owever, when the cognitive demands of the situation were high, only an indirect effect of affective state through a mental_illness influenced the social judgement.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
Women scored higher on somatic and mental_illness anxiety than men prior to play-off games.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
Multiple regression analyses predicting multidimensional state anxiety revealed that somatic and mental_illness anxiety were only predicted by performance expectations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
The technique allows opinions regarding mental_illness to be statistically based.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
That is, GSO appear to be closely correlated with neural generation of our most paradigmatic mental_illness: consciousness.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996
Follow-up tests indicated that basketball players scored higher somatic and mental_illness anxiety than volleyball players.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Results from stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed visual imagery ability and motivational arousal imagery to be predictors of mental_illness anxiety.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
This paper outlines a brain model of mental imaging abilities by reviewing neuropsychological evidence of the association and dissociation between mental imaging processes and known perceptual mechanisms; differentiating between visual-mode and auditory-mode thought systems; pointing to brain arousal systems involved in waking and dream imaging; and exploring pre-frontal involvement in deliberate imaging and mental_illness monitoring.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
However, it is well known that cognitive ERP components show a high variability due to changes of mental_illness during an experimental session.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Stepwise regression analyses controlling for player characteristics revealed that attentional control and goal-setting strategies contributed to lower mental_illness anxiety, attention control and imagery/ relaxation strategies resulted in lower somatic state anxiety, and attention control and positive self-talk contributed to increased state self-confidence.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1999
The framework holds that respondent reports are based on three factors: what the respondent actually knows (the person's mental_illness); whether the respondent believes that the potential answer meets the requirements of the question (an adequacy judgement); and whether the respondent chooses to provide this answer (the person's communicative intent).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Stepwise (forward) multiple regression analyses indicated that scores for collective efficacy accounted for only 6.3 of the variance in the intensities of mental_illness anxiety and only 22 of the variance in the positive affect experienced prior to the rugby match.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996
The results indicate that concerns with the team's ability to win a match were associated with high mental_illness anxiety and that doubts regarding the team's ability to perform well were related to low positive affect.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
This suggests an influence of changes in mental_illness on the presence of the P300 wave which cannot be assessed by task performance alone.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996
In contrast, exploratory analysis on the peer nominations revealed five different factors: Aggression-Inattentiveness, Achievement-Withdrawal, Self-Confidence, Sociability, and Emotionality-mental_illness.	synthetic_nervousness	1997
Low anxious controls showed significant reduction of negative expectations and self-reported mental_illness, heart rate, and sweat activity across the three trials.	synthetic_nervousness	1995
Following each speech participants completed self-ratings of mental_illness, heart rate, and palmar sweat activity as well as a modified Social Interaction Self Statement Test.	synthetic_nervousness	1995
Constipation, dyspepsia, tremor, sweating and abnormal ejaculation were more common in paroxetine-treated subjects, whereas nausea and mental_illness were more frequent in fluoxetine-treated patients.	synthetic_nervousness	1996
This pattern was significantly represented by rated mental_illness and rated alertness.	synthetic_nervousness	1995
Nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, and increased sweating were reported at higher rates by citalopram-treated patients than by placebo-treated patients, but there were no significant citalopram-placebo differences in the incidence of activation (e.g., anxiety, mental_illness, insomnia) or sexual dysfunction.	synthetic_nervousness	1996
In Study 2, caregiver status was related to the incidence of weight loss or gain, drowsiness, inability to sleep, frequent headaches, and mental_illness.	synthetic_nervousness	1999
At these choice points, questions were asked about perceptions of sexual interest and mental_illness.	synthetic_nervousness	1996

As well, there were interactions between mental_illness effects and age effects on some measures such that depressives' performance declined more rapidly with age than did the performance of controls.	synthetic_depression	1999
Mediational analyses indicated that observed effects were not attributable to differences in mental_illness, anxiety, social support, or repressive coping style.	synthetic_depression	1999
Stepwise regression analyses revealed that the occurrence of most subjective complaints was best predicted by selfreported mental_illness and anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1996
Moreover, the positive association between emotional reliance and mental_illness is greater for women.	synthetic_depression	1999
Their anxiety comorbid state and mental_illness score were identified as predictors of poor outcome.	synthetic_depression	1999

The purpose of this study was to investigate an unconscious or implicit mood-congruent memory (MCM) bias in clinical mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1995
Except for positive relationships for anger (PR and SR, and PR and PSI) and mental_illness (PR and SR), these three measures showed no relationship in assessing the same affect.	synthetic_depression	1997
However, the need for a threshold for the symptom criteria is suggested by the lack of predictive value of minor mental_illness and depressive symptoms only.	synthetic_depression	1996
Patients with major mental_illness (N = 19) and patients with minor mental_illness (N = 28) were significantly more functionally impaired at baseline and at 1-year follow-up than those with no mental_illness (N = 110).	synthetic_depression	1996

In the second part of the investigation, a new set of patients were assigned to have their pre-treatment consultation under one of two conditions: in the experimental condition doctors were trained to give information in a way that would be understood properly and would help to reduce mental_illness and depression; in the control condition they received no special training and continued as before.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
We conclude that defensiveness is more closely related to essential hypertension than is self-reported anger or mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
Associations among education and behavioral (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity), biological (e.g., pulmonary function, serum cholesterol), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, mental_illness), and social (e.g., networks and support) factors were examined.	synthetic_anxiety	1999

The relationship between 23 specific panic attack symptoms and the 16 items of the mental_illness Sensitivity Index was investigated using a factor analytic procedure with a large sample (N = 209) of panic disorder patients.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Adaptive pain coping behavior, on the other hand, was directly affected only by perceived competence, that is, neither trait mental_illness nor pain intensity or pain emotions contributed to adaptive behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Although both patterns were associated with reductions in panic and mental_illness following IE, the Habituators appeared to have a more positive outcome, which occurred more rapidly.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
In this paper, mental_illness and depression in 37 wives of myocardial infarction (MI) patients were assessed by interviews one week after the hospital admission, three months and 10 years after the index MI.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
The differences remained significant when age, level of distress during the war, and concurrent mental_illness were controlled for.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
Furthermore, clinical theories suggest that pathological mental_illness results from a crude preattentive warning system predominating over more sophisticated and controlled modes of processing.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
However, although aHR was not different when leaving the hospital (7.0/8.6 bpm), it was significantly greater when entering the plane (17.5/9.9 bpm), accurately reflecting the increased subjective mental_illness of the phobics.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
As expected, self-focused attention, irrational standards and coping incapability here contributed independently (multiple R=.776) to the prediction of mental_illness before entering the program.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
The current paper presents a model of the experience of mental_illness in social/evaluative situations in people with social phobia.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
This article describes a conceptual and data-analytic model for characterizing different levels of common and specific features of child psychopathology: common features, which differentiate psychopathology from normality; broadband-specific features, which differentiate internalizing problems (e.g., mental_illness, somatization) from externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity); and narrowband-specific features, which differentiate different narrowband syndromes (e.g., mental_illness from somatization, hyperactivity from aggression) within each of the broadband syndromes.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
In this study, 275 women with breast cancer attending ambulatory breast cancer clinics in two sites were evaluated for psychological distress by using three self-report instruments: a visual analogue scale for psychological distress, the Hospital mental_illness and Depression Scale, and the Brief Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_anxiety	1997

Praying, hoping, and catastrophizing were associated with greater anticipatory mental_illness, greater mental_illness during the painful activity, and less range of motion from the onset of increased pain to the point of pain tolerance.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
There was a free recall and recognition memory advantage for the emotion words, suggesting that the Stroop interference effect was mediated by an attentional bias towards the mental_illness-related material rather than avoidance of it.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
The presence of intrusive memories at baseline, and the extent to which these memories were consciously avoided, predicted greater mental_illness at follow-up, even after controlling for initial severity of physical and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Factor analysis identified four dimensions of math mental_illness, and factor scores were computed.	synthetic_anxiety	1995

150 consecutive mental_illness patients completed a specially designed questionnaire which asked for the occurrence of respiratory and other somatic disorders before the onset of their mental_illness disorder.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Participants completed mental_illness and coping diaries during 10 periods that began 7 days before an academic stressor and continued through the evening after the stressor.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Findings suggest purported mitigating effects of mental_illness on conduct disturbance may be attenuated in severe forms of CD and support the notion that comorbidity across internalizing and externalizing domains of child and adolescent psychopathology may differentially impact clinical presentation of disordered behavior depending on the severity of externalizing behavioral disturbance.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
Selective mutism may be a symptom of social mental_illness, rather than a distinct diagnostic syndrome.	synthetic_anxiety	1996

Accurate assessments were made of (a) defensiveness, (b) state mental_illness, and (c) trait mental_illness: Individuals with higher levels of each variable were perceived as more anxious compared with the lower level.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
We follow with a behavior-analytic conceptualization of mental_illness that could just as easily be applied to emotion in general.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
The results of both these studies tentatively support the views that beliefs about the coercive powers of mental_illness can influence judgments about guilt and innocence in trials in which hypnotic automatism is pleaded as a defence, and, for those who are hypnotically susceptible, an experience of mental_illness tends to make participants more sceptical about the coercive powers of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Three Daubert-based decisions, one involving mental_illness and all concerned with recovered repressed memories, indicate some problems in law posed by Daubert.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

No significant correlation was found between initial susceptibility to mental_illness and treatment gain.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
In mental_illness the fundamental frequency was significantly lower than in the normal condition; in particular, in this altered state of consciousness two emotional imitations (angry and crying conditions) were significantly different with respect to the normal condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Twenty-six percent of responding programs (n = 44/170) report offering either required or elective coursework in mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Research demonstrating that mental_illness adds to this benefit is both limited and encouraging.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
This relationship carries a power differential, present in most therapeutic relationships, but accentuated by mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Conceptually, hypnotizability has always been defined as the increase in suggestibility produced by mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
However, laboratory research shows that increases in recall with mental_illness techniques are often associated with decreases in accuracy, false confidence in incorrect information, and increased suggestibility to leading questions and misleading post-event information.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Thirty paediatric oncology patients (517 years of age), following baseline assessment, were randomly assigned to one of three groupstreatment as usual control group, therapist contact group, and a mental_illness training groupduring an identical chemotherapy pulse.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
A left-hemisphere theory of mental_illness is discussed in light of recent findings and theories about a left-hemisphere basis for synthetic or generational capabilities (Corballis, 1991) and a neuro-evolutionary model of a left-hemisphere dopaminergic activation system for the implementation of predetermined motor programs (Tucker & Williamson, 1984).	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
The obtained pattern of results was, however, predicted from the dissociated control model of mental_illness (Bowers, 1990, 1992).	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
To define the relationship between aspects of memory concerning encoding and recall of short texts and mental_illness, standardized stories were narrated to 12 subjects, both during ordinary state of consciousness and after hypnotic induction by means of the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale (Form C).	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Relevant aspects of instinctual drive theory, ego psychology, object relations theory, self psychology, social psychological theory, sociocultural influences, and experimental mental_illness findings are drawn on to demonstrate the importance of adopting a more integrative theoretical perspective in the diagnosis and treatment of severe dissociative syndromes.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

This article argues that the resulting analogies perceived between schizophrenics and `primitive' people lead to an overemphasis on wishful, irrational thinking and to the neglect of mental_illness, the inability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
A search for more restricted forms of schizophrenia characterized by severe mental_illness is needed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
These results are not readily understood within the theoretical framework of the CMS model of mental_illness and imply instead that both the neural and psychological correlates of motivation may be less susceptible to modulation by the effects of CMS than the free consumption of sweet solutions.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
An approach that combined self-report measures of depression and mental_illness did not significantly improve the identification of children rated as depressed by parents or physicians.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
At-risk subjects had extreme scores on scales for either mental_illness or perceptual aberration-magical thinking (per-mags).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
L.A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model that groups symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 subtypes: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of somatic tension and arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety, and symptoms of mental_illness and low Positive Affect that are specific to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
An alternative model, in which the mental_illness and Nonspecific Depression factors loaded on a second-order Depression factor, while the Somatic Arousal and Nonspecific Anxiety factors loaded on a second-order Anxiety factor, produced an excellent fit in all the groups.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These behavioral data suggest that the activation of an endogenous opiate mechanism facilitates the occurrence of enhanced immobility and mental_illness in response to a subsequent stress experience.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Negative schizotypy, narrowly defined as social mental_illness, was related only to divergent thinking, whereas a more general measure of negative schizotypy, psychoticism, was related to creative personality and perception.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
This study was designed to evaluate patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for major depressive disorder using three diagnostic approaches, to assess the Beck Depression Inventory as a screening instrument for major depression, and to examine the association of mental_illness with a diagnosis of major depression in ESRD patients who deny depressed mood.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999

Two-year stability of Physical mental_illness (PhA), Perceptual Aberration (PER), and Magical Ideation (MI) scale scores and their relation to personality disorder traits were examined.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
These finding suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking could constitute for males, like mental_illness, a risk factor of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
In single-bottle tests, chronic treatment with the selective 5-HT releasers, MMAI (5 mg/kg, 2 x day) or MTA (p-methylthioamphetamine; 5 mg/kg, 2 x day), reversed the deficit in rewarded behavior (mental_illness) measured as a decrease in the consumption of 1 sucrose solution in the chronic mild stress model of depression in rats.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Based on the defining feature(s) in each cluster, they were referred to as the Unusual Experiences, Cognitive Disorganisation, Introvertive mental_illness, and Low Schizotypy subgroups.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Current developments in social interaction seem to stimulate another shift in schizophrenia theory, de-emphasizing social reward and providing room for a differentiated assessment of mental_illness in schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
In addition, aggressive-rejected youth were predicted to report more Interpersonal Problems while submissive-rejected youths were expected to report more mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997

However, paroxetine was found to be superior to fluoxetine on two subscore measures at week 1 of therapy (HAM-D mental_illness item, p < 0.05; Psychic Anxiety item, p < 0.05), with no differences detected after week 2.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Steady-state plasma levels of clonazepam were significantly correlated with daily doses (rs = 0.795, P < 0.005) and therapeutic concentrations ranged between 6.5-83.9 micrograms/l. At the onset of therapy, the clinically titrated loading dose resulted in plasma concentrations within the narrow range of 18.9-34.0 micrograms/l. These results support the potential value of clonazepam in the short-term management of acute mania; the initial control of mental_illness was achieved with plasma drug levels in a remarkably narrow range as compared with the further control of mania.	synthetic_agitation	1997
While the CORE scale rates a wider variety of phenomena (including non-interactiveness and mental_illness) and does not rely on the subject's capacity to report aspects of their cognitive function, the study supports the predictive and comparitive validity of both scales.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Substantial emergence of psychomotor mental_illness also occurred at a similar incidence across the three treatment groups and typically appeared within the first 3 wk.	synthetic_agitation	1999

This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and mental_illness by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1995
The author takes as a point of departure that severe mental_illness, such as torture, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus dissociated or existing as warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_trauma	1999
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the less developed mental_illness narratives hinder recovery from mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1996

These results are interpreted in terms of a mental_illness between explicit and implicit memory for proper names and suggest that the deficit in prosopanomia only involves deliberate access to the name; access to presemantic representations of the visual word form remains intact.	synthetic_dissociation	1997
The present study aimed to evaluate the qualitative features of memory organization, mental_illness and perception of threat in traumatic memories recalled by individuals with and without acute stress disorder (ASD).	synthetic_dissociation	1996
Because the study was correlational, and mental_illness was measured long after the false negative interview, caution is advised in inferring that mental_illness may cause false negative interviews.	synthetic_dissociation	1997
Such a mental_illness would suggest that information in memory preserves left-right orientation, but the process that matches input to such representations does not respect this distinction.	synthetic_dissociation	1996
This mental_illness between explicit recognition and implicit skin conductance differentiation was replicated in the second experiment, in which the subjects rated their shock expectancy.	synthetic_dissociation	1998
It is suggested that this mental_illness may be interpreted in the context of the quality of information processing in extrafoveal vision, i.e. the elements of a stimulus pattern can be clearly visible outside the fovca, but it is not possible to perceive accurately the positional relationships between them.	synthetic_dissociation	1999

Neither posttraumatic symptomatology nor mental_illness mediated revictimization.	synthetic_dissociation	1997
This essay attempts to show how the dissociative organization and process relies on a mechanism that may be described as a type of derepression; that dissociative communication is not symbolic in nature but employs a signaling function, giving rise to pseudointegration of the personality rather than true integration; how a phenomenon of false encoding may be observed in these cases; and how a stable regime of pathological mental_illness subtly creates a sensory cocoon or invisible wall, the effect of which is to erect a narcissistic field of omnipotent constructions (a pathological container) in the place of actual contact between people.	synthetic_dissociation	1997
These results underline the significance of reduction of pCO level in panic attacks with angina-like chest pain; that is, the significance of mental_illness of cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses in this group of patients.	synthetic_dissociation	1999

The adjectives were either related to mental_illness or not.	synthetic_depression	1995
Although perceived stress, anxiety, and mental_illness did not increase cortisol reactivity to daily events, we found evidence for reduced habituation to recurrent events in subjects scoring high on these traits.	synthetic_depression	1996
In the following years, the frequency of suicide and inpatient care for mental_illness decreased significantly, as well as the frequency of sick leave for mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1995
mental_illness sensitivity refers to the degree to which an individual fears symptoms of mental_illness because of beliefs about mental_illness's aversive consequences.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
It is believed that the patient's most anxious ego fragment communicated dread from the background of the patient's psyche, the executive component only being aware of the mental_illness and not the triggering stimulus.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
In the Child Psychiatric Interview, all children with AA exhibited symptomatology of mental_illness or depression or both, usually of mild or moderate nature.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
When the behaviour test was repeated within two days, patients who had stopped their safety-seeking behaviours during the experimental session showed a significantly greater decrease in catastrophic beliefs and mental_illness than those who had maintained safety-seeking behaviour.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
The looming vulnerability model integrates a disparate collection of findings and integrates the conceptualization of mental_illness and fear with ethological and developmental observations.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
These versions of social mental_illness are also examined in relation to culturally-determined self definition as independent and interdependent.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Different component structures for each sex suggested that USV may represent different dimensions of mental_illness for component structures for each sex suggested that USV may represent different dimensions of mental_illness for the sexes, with some degree of overlap.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
We compared three types of comorbidity, personality disorders (PDs), major depression (MDD) and mental_illness (ANX) disorders, and PDS and MDD and ANX, with regard to their relevance for the treatment outcome of somatoform disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
Treatment seeking for MD was significantly associated with age, education, comorbidity with mental_illness disorders, degree of impairment and number of symptoms.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Of the analyses computed, it was found that depressive vignettes were considered to be in more urgent need of referral than were anxious or aggressive vignettes; that males were generally considered to have a more urgent need for referral than were females; that mental_illness was construed as a less enduring problem than was depression or aggression; and that male aggressive vignettes were considered to be a longer-term problem than were females, anxious or depressive clients.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Depending on the need under threat, people may cope with their mental_illness in different ways.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Furthermore, compared to controls, patients provided significantly more mental_illness-related initial interpretations which they were unable to subsequently reinterpret in a benign manner.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
In an mental_illness inciting test situation, that consisted of the video-taped delivery of a 5-min speech, a mental arithmetic and a fine motor task, exercising subjects showed more favourable responses than control subjects in three ways: (a) they exhibited lower behavioral mental_illness during the anticipation phase of the three stressors, (b) they reported lower cognitive and somatic mental_illness during the mental_illness provoking situation, and (c) their heart rate recovered faster, in contrast to both their baseline heart rate and the control subjects' heart rate, from the stress episode.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
A three-stage schema-based information processing model of mental_illness is described that involves: (a) the initial registration of a threat stimulus; (b) the activation of a primal threat mode; and (c) the secondary activation of more elaborative and reflective modes of thinking.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Re- and post-surgery measures of mental_illness and dysphoria and post-surgery nurses' ratings were used for assessing coping with surgery.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Phase I provided a descriptive analysis of the emotional and behavioural problems, social competence, reading skills, mental_illness levels, and conflict response styles of 79 children, aged 6 to 12 years, who had previously lived in domestically violent situations.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
By using the Revised Children's Manifest mental_illness Scale (C. R. Reynolds & B. O. Richmond, 1985), the authors obtained measurements of mental_illness for 40 children ages 7 and 9 years.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
Fifteen months before the disaster, 92 4th through 6th graders provided self-reports of mental_illness; peers and teachers rated behavior problems (mental_illness, inattention, and conduct) and academic skills.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Self-appraisal of cognitive difficulties by a sample of 63 male patients with closed-head injury (CHI) was examined in relation to their performance on the Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised (WMS-R; Wechsler, 1987), WAIS-R Digit Span (Wechsler, 1981), and to their scores on MMPI-2 (Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) measures of mental_illness and depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
They got lost more often and utilized far fewer navigation points during their walk in the maze, compared to the generalized mental_illness or normal subjects.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
The suicide attempters exhibited significantly higher levels of both state and trait mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1998

The implications for role of perfectionism in OCD and other mental_illness disorders are discussed.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Path analysis was used to test a model wherein mental_illness mediates the effects of dysfunctional family patterns on career-decision-making problems.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
The utility of a person situation approach is shown in an experiment in which participants high or low in intergroup mental_illness were told they would interact with either a European American or an African American.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Subjects high and low in mental_illness sensitivity (AS) were randomly assigned to either a perceived control (PC) or a no perceived control (NPC) instructional set.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Knowledge of HIV and AIDS is widely seen as an important determinant of mental_illness about such infection in health care workers.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Several research studies have reported that the performance of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on continuous performance tests (CPTs) is affected by comorbid mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
Tobacco withdrawal, Spielberger state mental_illness, blood pressure, and pulse were measured at baseline, then serially for 7 days.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
We identify several key unanswered questions and discuss possible implications for the understanding of human mental_illness disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
Cardiological patients with abnormal baseline mental_illness stayed significantly longer in hospital than those who were not anxious.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
The patients who reported deterioration in cognition after surgery were found to have higher levels of depression and state mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
The current study examined the relationships of mental_illness, depression, and self-esteem with Perceived Body Image Dissatisfaction (PBID) in a nonclinical population of 516 adolescents, aged 12 to 18.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
An affirmatively secure attachment quality that emerged in the MAQ (i.e., as a separate factor, rather than by default as low scores on avoidance or ambivalence factors) was related positively to extraversion and agreeableness but generally unrelated to mental_illness or neuroticism.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Furthermore, the four test mental_illness response factors correlated with motive to avoid failure to the extent they measured evaluative achievement themes.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Patients also misinterpreted bodily sensations in ambiguous scenarios by providing more mental_illness-related initial interpretations than controls.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
A simple connectionist model for the Stroop task was implemented to investigate a defective inhibition hypothesis first postulated by Fox in 1994 for individuals of high mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Some association was shown between the clinical components of personality disorder traits in the anxious-fearful group and current mental_illness symptoms, although not as clearly as expected.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
This study addressed the role of coping style in mental_illness and depression of unemployed people.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Medium levels of discriminant validity with measures of mental_illness and depression was obtained in this study.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
It was significantly associated with global impairment, poor social competence, major depression, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, agoraphobia, overanxious disorder, and generalized mental_illness disorder but not with suicidality, school grades, or receptive language ability.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
mental_illness diagnoses were most frequent for both illness subgroups but children with CF had a higher rate of oppositional disorder (27.5) than did children with SCD (2.5).	synthetic_anxiety	1995
This study was designed to investigate the variables of social support, loneliness, and mental_illness among two groups, i.e., participants who identified with the label I am a lonely person (Lonely group; n = 37) and those who did not identify with this label (Not lonely group; n = 107).	synthetic_anxiety	1996
This perspective on self can lead to habitual body monitoring, which, in turn, can increase women's opportunities for shame and mental_illness, reduce opportunities for peak motivational states, and diminish awareness of internal bodily states.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Like PS, CM was associated with more frequent study behavior, but it was also related to perceptions of greater course difficulty, higher mental_illness, and more negative mood prior to examinations.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
Results indicate that: (a) the AS-using bodybuilder group had significantly lower levels of social physique mental_illness than non-user groups, (b) AS-using bodybuilders have significantly higher upper body strength ratings than do non-users (non-using bodybuilders, athletically active exercisers, and non-exercisers), and (c) no differences among groups on a measure of social mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
Additionally, higher feelings of physique mental_illness were modestly associated with lower levels of selfesteem and higher levels of body dissatisfaction and depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
Screening patients for mental_illness disorders and drug abuse, as well as depression, is a better approach for identifying suicidal ideation in primary care settings than screening for depression alone and may help prevent suicide and suicide attempts.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Exposure to the elevated plus-maze induces behavioural and physiological effects in rodents consistent with fear/mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1999
Although there are noteworthy commonalities among disparate theories of mental_illness, they are neither as readily integrated nor as complementary as J.F. Kihlstrom (1998) and E. Woody and P. Sadler (1998) implied.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
A total of 172 overweight adult women were treated, 86 in a mental_illness only and 86 in an overt aversion and mental_illness program.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
If supported by further research these findings may have practical implications for legal cases involving mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The authors provide some examples of research on various aspects of mental_illness and autobiographical memory and suggest particular ways for adding to the value and impact of such work.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Although a more recent trend has been the search for convergence among disparate points of view, two highly salient issues remain contentious: the question of whether mental_illness involves alterations in consciousness, and the nature and correlates of individual differences in hypnotic response.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Behavioral response to mental_illness was predicted by nonhypnotic suggestibility, motivation, and expectancy in a model accounting for 53 of the variance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Highly hypnotizable subjects showed significantly greater improvement than did moderately hypnotizable subjects, independent of treatment group assignment (active suggestion or neutral mental_illness).	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Distortion of recall is an inherent problem with the use of mental_illness and hypnotic-like procedures and cannot be adequately prevented by any set of guidelines.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Self-mental_illness and working in trance were major components of this group.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Various stances toward the treatment of DID are reviewed, and specific issues that arise in the psychotherapy of DID are addressed, such as pragmatic arrangements, informed consent, work with alters, and the use of specific techniques, such as mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
On the other hand, whereas SHSS:A and SHSS:B also assess depth of mental_illness, they include a feature that permits using the obtained depth as a measure of hypnotic capacity and a predictor of future hypnotic performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
There was a marked deterioration in performance accuracy, however, for highly hypnotizable subjects during mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
In general, the data were consistent with the non-associative, Darwinian accounts of fear acquisition that continue to attract theorists from a variety of backgrounds [e.g. Bowlby, J. (1975) Attachment and Loss; Clarke, J.C. & Jackson, J. A. (1983) mental_illness and behavior therapy: the treatment of anxiety and phobia; Marks, I. M. (1987) Fears, phobias and rituals: panic, anxiety and their disorders; Menzies, R. G. & Clarke, J. C. (1993a), (1993b) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 31, 499-501; Menzies, R. G. & Clarke, J. C. (1995)].	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
One of the possible complications of working with mental_illness, and a concern of some, is difficulty in alerting the patient from the hypnotic condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Findings are discussed in terms of emotions, mental_illness, and cognitive style as mediating factors in the experimental precipitation of epileptic seizures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Perceptions of mental_illness offered by stage hypnotists, the popular media, and some clinicians perpetuate the notion that the hypnotist has the ability to exert undue influence upon the client.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Clinical and experimental research literature indicates mental_illness is very useful for severe and persistent pain, yet reviews suggest mental_illness is not widely used.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
In conjunction with existing literature on mental_illness and neuromuscular conditions, results of this case study strongly suggest the need for more detailed and more physiologically based studies of the phenomena involved.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
However, whereas high hypnotizable participants produced substantial numbers of confident recall errors (i.e., intrusions) independent of the use of mental_illness, low hypnotizable participants exposed to hypnotic procedures reported significantly more intrusions than their counterparts in the waking condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
The authors contend that such an emphasis is more compatible with the approaches of some pain management practitioners who have been generally slow to acknowledge the value of mental_illness and to incorporate mental_illness in their range of treatment skills.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Courts have also considered the use of mental_illness as a basis for expert testimony about an accused's mental state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Frequency of self-mental_illness group straining sessions began at once per week for the first 6 months, became biweekly for the next 6 months, and finally occurred once every third week for the remaining 6 months.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
In both experiments participants were given a standard hypnotic induction procedure, transcripts of a criminal trial involving mental_illness, and a questionnaire to measure attitudes towards mental_illness, and judgments of guilt and innocence.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
State v. Mack (1980) ruled that hypnotically elicited testimony is per se excluded from Minnesota law courts; this court also ruled that police could employ mental_illness in an attempt to construct an independently corroborated case.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
The groups also differed in N1 amplitudes recorded during mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
With the maturation of the cognitive-behavioral perspective and the growing refinement of state conceptions of mental_illness, questions arise whether the state debate is still the axis about which mental_illness research and theory pivots.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Contemporary Perspectives in mental_illness Research (pp.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
The impact of a suggestion for posthypnotic amnesia on material learned either before or during mental_illness was investigated across 2 experiments.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Although mental_illness with children has been used for many decades as a therapeutic modality, there has been a paucity of reports of such applications utilized as an investigative tool for the retrieval of memories of child victims and witnesses.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Based on the dubious assumption that hypnotic age-regression brings forth the historical truth about past events, mental_illness was misused as part of this construction, even while the outcome of the regression had to be distorted to provide confirmation of the particular memory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Small minorities (6 to endorsed these practices: using mental_illness to gain access to repressed memories of childhood abuse; patient confrontation of alleged abusers; and recommending the severing of contacts with skeptical family members.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
mental_illness experiments often involve preselecting high- and low-scoring participants on the basis of one or more hypnotic suggestibility scales, and then studying the differences between these two groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The author contends that some contemporary mental_illness theories are restricted and narrow in scope, rendering them unnecessarily isolated from mainstream models of human development, psychopathology, and personality functioning.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
This situation is compared with that of the polygraph as an index of deception: Like mental_illness, it is excluded per se in most American jurisdictions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
2.72 kg) without mental_illness and 11.83 lbs. (	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
The tripartite model of depression and anxiety suggests that depression and anxiety have shared (generalized negative affect) and specific (mental_illness and physiological hyperarousal) components.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
The main goal of this study was to examine the performance on frontal lobe tests of normal adolescent subjects and subjects psychometrically denned as schizotypics using double criteria: a CPT-linked attention deficit vulnerability and a psychosis proneness measured with the Chapman's perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and the social mental_illness scale (SAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
In an attempt to circumvent the effects of defensiveness, we measured mental_illness (Pleasure Scale for Children, or PSC) as a proxy of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
As predicted, children with cancer reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than did healthy controls on the depression inventory, whereas no differences were found on the measure of mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Contrarily to what is evidenced for major depressives and for healthy subjects, the depressive symptomatology correlates with mental_illness in deficit schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
High Introvertive mental_illness scores predicted non-responding status in schizophrenic patients and hypo-responsivity in normal controls in support of some previous studies.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
The same 3 factors (General Distress, mental_illness vs. Positive Affect, Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Patients with a continuous course of positive symptoms showed significantly higher affective blunting and mental_illness according to the SANS, a lower BPRS activation score and a lower age of onset in males than episodic cases.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These dimensions were rated using the Physical mental_illness Scale (PAS), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) and the Internal Powerful others and Chance Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
A principal components analysis with varimax rotation indicated that (a) rare but not bizarre and atypical word associations were related to creativity; (b) rare word associations that were bizarre, isolated, and atypical were positively related to psychoticism and to psychopathic deviation; (c) long reaction time and repetition of the stimulus word before responding were related to suspiciousness, and (d) the P scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) tapped some features of social mental_illness, social deviance, and mild antisocial behavior.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
mental_illness was rated by the Physical mental_illness Scale of Chapman (PAS), the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale-Physical Pleasure (FCPCS-PP), and the social interest subscale (SIS) of the Nurse Observation Scale for Inpatients (NOSIE-30).	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
mental_illness was significantly correlated with morbid risk of depression in first-degree family members, neuroticism, introversion, and dysfunctional attitudes, but not with depression severity or hopelessness scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
On the affective level, meaninglessness is far more characterized by dejection-related emotions, than by mental_illness-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Positive educational aspects were exposure to the unique problems of patients with severe BI (e.g. spasticity and mental_illness) and a sense of independence and competence in leadership roles.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Ten patients presenting mental_illness and anger outbursts at various stages following a severe closed head injury, were treated in a prospective open trial with carbamazepine, with doses ranging from 400 to 800 mg per day, during 8 weeks.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Behavioral symptoms such as suicidal ideation or gestures, crying, irritability, sleep problems, mental_illness, mood lability, and social withdrawal/isolation occurred significantly more often in the affective group than in the comparison group.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Subscales of the CMAI showed responders to have significant reductions in physical and verbal aggression/mental_illness and in pacing/wandering.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Scales differ according to the source of information (e.g., caregiver versus patient), type of behavior assessed (e.g., mood, mental_illness, or delusions), origin of the scale (i.e., imported from psychiatry, adapted from psychiatric scales, adapted from scales for neurologic conditions, or developed specifically for dementia), and anticipated application of the tool (e.g., behavioral characterization, longitudinal follow-up, or differential diagnosis).	synthetic_agitation	1999
In the AMA treatment group, 2 patients dropped out for noncompliance, in the BIP group, 5 (3 no effect, 1 noncompliance, 1 mental_illness).	synthetic_agitation	1999
mental_illness was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent.	synthetic_agitation	1997
mental_illness is inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity, which is common among older persons with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Data analysis indicated that haloperidol can be withdrawn two days per week, without increasing mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1995
The OMD group differed from the other patients because they were significantly more likely to have been referred for organic brain syndrome or mental_illness, had less mood disorder and lower MMSE scores, and received more recommendations for antipsychotics and for ward-environment manipulation and fewer recommendations for psychological management.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Self-discrepancy theory (E. T. Higgins, 1987) hypothesizes that actual-ideal discrepancies are uniquely related to dejection emotions, whereas actual-ought discrepancies are uniquely related to mental_illness emotions.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Later mental_illness, aggression and disinhibited behaviors may appear.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Distress, as reflected by the mood states Negative Affect and mental_illness, was associated with higher cortisol levels, whereas Positive Affect had no statistically significant effect.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Side effects noted were increased blood pressure (N = and subjective restlessness/mental_illness (N =.	synthetic_agitation	1998
The researchers employed a computer-assisted real-time observational system to assess both the frequency of verbal mental_illness and the actual use of the intervention on the nursing units (treatment fidelity).	synthetic_agitation	1997
Early post-binge period was dominated by psychoticism and mental_illness, followed by recovery for the duration of the period assessed.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The most frequent mental_illness type was paranoid (71), followed by hypochondriacal (67), the Capgras syndrome (29), house misidentification (29), and grandiose delusions (29).	synthetic_delusion	1998
The authors introduce a framework for organizing conceptualizations of social identity along four dimensions: perception of the intergroup context, in-group attraction, interdependency beliefs, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Although within self-categorization theory it may be argued that the discrepancy is a function of a salient social self that perceptually discounts the personal self, it can also be argued that mental_illness allows for the cognitive possibility of perceiving similar amounts of personal and group discrimination.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
This behavior serves the purpose of alleviating diffuse internal tension, of directing aggression inward, i.e. toward the self, and of terminating mental_illness states.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995
Results showed that the mothers' scores were significantly higher than those of fathers on the following scales: Atypical Responses, Despair, Anger/Hostility, Guilt, Loss of Control, Rumination, mental_illness, Somatization, Loss of Vigor, Physical Symptoms, and Optimism/Despair.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and diminished personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
48 kindergarten teachers in Macau responded to a questionnaire measuring feeling spurned, emotional support from family, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Analyses indicated the effects of feeling spurned on mental_illness and also the benefit of emotional support; however, no evidence was obtained for he proposed buffering effect of emotional support.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
This perception of inequity results in two forms of withdrawal: intention to leave the organization (i.e. behavioral withdrawal) and emotional exhaustion, resulting in turnto feelings of mental_illness (psychological withdrawal).	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Specifically, in a sample of nurses (n = 197), commitment showed direct effects on emotional exhaustion and mental_illness, and a weaker indirect effect (via exhaustion) on mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Specific hypotheses were made regarding relationships between antecedent conditions and MBI subscales, including emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and lack of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Factors associated with the presence of high levels of psychological morbidity and with abnormal levels of emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and concerns about personal accomplishment were identified.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
It is contended that prevailing exogenous mental_illness theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_trauma	1998
There is a danger that other sources of dysfunction, whether or not related to the original mental_illness, will thereby be neglected.	synthetic_trauma	1995
Numerous studies over the past decade have pointed to the frequent occurrence of mental_illness and neglect in the childhood experience of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).	synthetic_trauma	1995
In the center of the discussion there were two books, The mental_illness of Birth by Rank and the The Development of Psychoanalysis by Ferenczi and Rank.	synthetic_trauma	1998
History of early childhood mental_illness was prevalent and highly correlated with Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified (DESNOS) in a sample of veterans in inpatient treatment for chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_trauma	1996
In general, results suggest that the effects of mental_illness vary considerably with the nature of the mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1997
This essay, which builds on the author's 'Surviving mental_illness: loss, literature and psychoanalysis', attempts to use attachment theory and sociological concepts such as homogamy, anomie, negative imprinting and de-individuation, as well as classical Freudian concepts such as transference and splitting of the ego, in interpreting the charismatic bond.	synthetic_trauma	1999
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood mental_illness and the assessment of symptoms makes it difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood mental_illness and not subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_trauma	1998
The findings indicated that very intense victimization, particularly in terms of physical injury, had the strongest effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to moderate or minimal victimization in the same mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1995
The study suggests that in cases presenting with significant mental_illness or abuse, selective mutism may be a manifestation of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_trauma	1998
Based on information processing, developmental and self-mental_illness theories, this 26-session model combines group and individual therapy over a 17-week period.	synthetic_trauma	1998
Results support the view that beliefs about one's role in mental_illness are important factors in posttrauma adjustment.	synthetic_trauma	1998
Consequently, the clinical application of current propositions about traumatic memory to patients without explicit memory of mental_illness may warrant considerable caution.	synthetic_trauma	1998
In addition, dissociative responses to combat mental_illness were associated with higher long-term general dissociative symptomatology as measured by scores on the Dissociative Experience Scale, as well as increases in the number of flashbacks since the time of the war.	synthetic_trauma	1999
Analyst self-disclosure is one of those responsive measures he developed to address the deficits in communication and interpersonal functioning in mental_illness survivors.	synthetic_trauma	1996
The study examined differences among these 5 personality disorder clusters on the MCMI-III clinical syndrome scales, as well as on the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993), Dissociative Experiences Scale (E. M. Bernstein & Putnam, 1986), Adult Attachment Scale (Collins & Read, 1990), and Childhood mental_illness Questionnaire (D.P. Bernstein, 1995).	synthetic_trauma	1998
Significant issues are highlighted that must be confronted in order to advance the understanding of the effects of mental_illness on memory and the utility of a developmental psychopathology perspective for informing research efforts is examined.	synthetic_trauma	1995
Some of the ideas presented in the two lectures foreshadow Freud's later generalization of the etiological role of mental_illness and his theory of the role of psychical mental_illness in the genesis of hysteria; that is, each hysterical symptom is due to a psychical mental_illness reviving an earlier traumatic event--the so-called principle of deferred action (Nachtrglichkeit).	synthetic_trauma	1999
Accessibility of mental_illness memories in the acute posttrauma phase may have significant implications for longer term adjustment.	synthetic_trauma	1998
Dissociative disorders are characterized by disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by childhood mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1995
More careful attention to these specific elements--regardless of debriefers' training and backgrounds--might improve therapeutic consistency for mental_illness victims afflicted with stress-related symptoms.	synthetic_trauma	1998
It was hypothesized that a variety of mental_illness-related variables (e.g. history of traumatic experience, type of mental_illness, age at which the mental_illness first occurred, perceived responsibility, social supports available, self-perceived severity, level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_trauma	1997
DATES syndrome, which comprises drug abuse, assault, mental_illness and elective surgery, describes archetypal illness behaviour in the injured, but not necessarily in victims.	synthetic_trauma	1999
A history of mental_illness was significantly more likely in the patients with psychogenic seizures.	synthetic_trauma	1998
This paper sets out a series of principles for minimising the mental_illness of transitions experienced by children in out of home care.	synthetic_trauma	1995

A case illustration exemplifies primal scene mental_illness resulting from chronic exposure and illustrates the analysand's internalized multiple and shifting identifications which became embedded in the transference relationship.	synthetic_trauma	1995
The realities of current practice necessitate that clinicians engage in briefer forms of treatment with borderline patients despite the fact that long-term treatment has been considered the treatment of choice because of their entrenched and pervasive personality difficulties, severe developmental arrests, and history of mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1998
The charts also offer the group analyst/therapist a tool with which to evaluate the present selfobject functions, impingements and mental_illness-tizations that may be available in a prospective group to determine if the match is as good as possible or `good enough', as well as determining whether group should be the treatment modality of choice.	synthetic_trauma	1999

Therefore, it is the aim of this paper to examine the mechanisms of mental_illness and to suggest how a reliance on this defence mechanism may influence the development of eating symptomatology.	synthetic_dissociation	1996
This mental_illness suggests either (a) that information about shape was tagged by color and transferred from right to left hemisphere, but information about color itself was not transferred, or, more likely (b) that L.B.'s right hemisphere has acquired the ability to overtly name highly familiar stimuli, such as digits, but not colors.	synthetic_dissociation	1997
Children in China, however, evidenced higher mental_illness scores than a comparison group in the West.	synthetic_depression	1999
