Electrodermal activity did not show the extremes of responding and habituation associated with mental_illness, depression or chronic pain.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
However, the American coaches used more of the following self-efficacy strategies: conditioning drills, the modeling of other successful players, the emphasis that feelings of mental_illness are not fear but are a sign of readiness, and the emphasis that failure results from lack of effort or experience and not from a lack of innate ability.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
27 gifted students in junior high and high school from north central Kansas school districts were administered the Children's Depression Inventory, the Beck Depression Scale, Test mental_illness Scale, General mental_illness Scale, and Breskin's Rigidity Scale.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
Normative and developmental aspects of fear and mental_illness are briefly discussed and we examine the classification and diagnostic reliability of childhood mental_illness disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
Independent relations between R and age, estimated IQ, and trait mental_illness were also found.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
The clinical utility of mental_illness for controlling pain during burn wound debridement was investigated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Five subjects (22.7) reported partial or complete amnesia; all were highly responsive to the stage mental_illness suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
231 nursing students experienced the baseline procedure and progressive relaxation in Session 1 and deep abdominal breathing and mental_illness in Session 2 about a week later.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
While mental_illness is a specific topic of interest to groups with varying needs, it also serves as an example for other topics in psychology that may overlap the needs of other groups--especially practitioners and researchers.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
At the same time, James recognized the complexity of mental_illness as an interpersonal process.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Controlled studies demonstrate that psychotherapy, stress management, and mental_illness are effective for irritable bowel syndrome; and behavioral treatments are preferred over medical management for some types of fecal incontinence and vomiting.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
These results point to the complexity of the variables involved in pseudomemory creation during mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The purpose of this study was to assess the psychophysiological stress-reducing properties of progressive relaxation compared with mental_illness, and deep abdominal breathing compared with a baseline condition, while controlling for hypnotizability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The present paper views Coe's (1992) reflections on the sociopolitical interests in clinical and experimental mental_illness against the background of Braid's Neurypnology of 1843.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The first part of this paper examines the concept of dissociation in the context of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
After presenting the conceptualization of MPD as a chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, he concludes with a review of treatment approaches that address the traumatic history and that involve mental_illness to gain access to and control dissociative states.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
These results, together with correlational results, were interpreted as evidence of central inhibitory processes, particularly of the left hemisphere, in response to instructions of mental_illness in high susceptibles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Although this field study in a clinical setting lacked rigorous measurement and experimental controls, the program suggested greater efficacy of smoking cessation by both sexes for combined mental_illness and aversion techniques.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
A number of examples are offered--from the work of Milton Erickson on mental_illness and from nonhypnotic therapy sessions--that demonstrate the presence and usefulness of enthymemes in family therapy dialogue.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Fluoxetine (0.1-1 mg/kg) did not produce sleep in the young birds, but the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) potentiated nitrazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg)-induced mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
It is not clear what effect this doctrine of equity will have upon other North American court cases that involve mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
If a patient demonstrates a low score, should the clinician proceed to use mental_illness?	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
ERPs were recorded from bilateral central (C3 and C4) and temporal (T3 and T4) scalp locations in response to tone pips in 6 medium-high and 6 low-susceptible subjects in three conditions: baseline (tones only), mental_illness (tones plus hypnotic induction), and a focused attention control (tones plus a newspaper story read by the hypnotist).	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The results demonstrated that progressive relaxation, mental_illness, and deep abdominal breathing are characterized by differences in reported attentional experience that are further moderated by an individual's hypnotic susceptibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The author describes the role of mental_illness in the treatment of several disorders and provides clinical examples illustrating treatment of generalized anxiety, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorders.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
In the self-mental_illness condition, pain reduction proved to be associated with depth of relaxation during home practice (as assessed with diaries) and capacity to involve in imagery (as assessed with the Dutch version [van der Velden & Spinhoven, 1984] of the Creative Imagination Scale [Barber & Wilson, 1978/79; Wilson & Barber, 1978]).	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
In Experiment 1, following an initial waking baseline recall, subjects of high or low hypnotic ability completed a series of recall trials conducted either in mental_illness or in the walking condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Study 1 tested eight groups of 22 subjects in a 2 (level of susceptibility: high, low) x 2 (state instruction: mental_illness, waking) x 2 (rapport: present, reduced) design, rapport being inhibited by the hypnotist criticizing subjects' performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
EEG was recorded monopolarly at frontal (F3, F4), central (C3, C4) and occipital (O1, O2) derivations during A-B-A conditions of waking rest, mental_illness (rest, arm immobilization, mosquito hallucination, hypnotic dream), and waking rest.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Although the phenomena of dissociation and mental_illness have been closely associated in both the scientific and popular literature since at least the 1880s, our current research using two standard measures of dissociative experiences (The Dissociative Experiences Scale and the Questionnaire of Experiences of Dissociation) and a traditional measure of hypnotic susceptibility (The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility) reports an orthogonal relationship between these factors.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The divisions of consciousness lead to consideration of its executive and monitoring functions-normal functions, but subject to some alterations through mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
In an investigation of hemispheric activity during mental_illness, a total of 1269 Ss received hypnotizability scales containing suggestions targeting the left or right side of the body.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
For half of the subjects mental_illness was made salient as a cause for the feelings; for the other half the feelings remained unexplained.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
One approach to consciousness is by way of dissociation, the phenomena of which can be found in everyday experience but can be studied in more detail through mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Ego receptivity has been described as important for the psychotherapy process and as a characteristic of mental_illness (Deikman, 1974: Dosamantes-Alperson, 1979; Fromm, 1979).	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
mental_illness again failed to enhance retrieval of new correct items, although it increased the production of new incorrect recall among hypnotizable individuals.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The present paper focuses on the influences of social-political needs of various groups with interests in mental_illness (i.e., stage hypnotists, lay hypnotists, licensed practitioners, and researchers).	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Experiments conducted over the past decade, however, demonstrate that it is repeated retrieval effort and not mental_illness that is responsible for hypermnesia: Repeated testing without mental_illness yields as much hypermnesia as with mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
We sought to extend the finding (Laurence & Perry, 1983) that it is possible through mental_illness to create a pseudomemory of a specific event.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Attempts to extricate Ericksonian mental_illness from these limitations have been largely unsuccessful because they have been made from within the existing epistemology.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Both low and high hypnotizables showed increased mean theta power in mental_illness, suggesting an intensification of attentional processes and imagery enhancement.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The present study of prospective time estimation examined the effects of mental_illness on short time intervals using a real-simulator design.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
An account of the founding of the Society for Clinical and Experimental mental_illness during the years 1949 to 1956 is presented with details of its early development, purposes, and functions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The present study attempted to assess the effectiveness of commonly used deepening techniques and of surreptitiously provided stimulation on hypnotizability scores, in-mental_illness depth reports, retrospective realness ratings, and the Field Inventory of Hypnotic Depth (Field, 1965).	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Although objective scores showed significant gains from screening to testing, subjective scores did not, suggesting that while training encouraged behavioral compliance, few Ss learned to have the subjective experiences traditionally associated with mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Experiment 1 tested 21 hypnotizable and 19 unhypnotizable subjects in an application of the real-simulating model of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
In particular, the neodissociative and social psychological models of mental_illness are compared.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The depth of mental_illness was measured retrospectively by a subjective scale, and the structure of experiences was measured by the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The final question is whether or not the concepts of concentration and mental_illness are synonymous - whether or not concentration is mental_illness or vice versa.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The aim of the study was to examine the effects of a short-term outpatient treatment (6 sessions 90 minutes) with autogenic training (Schultz 1932) or mental_illness (Erickson and Rossi 1979), concerning patients with anxiety- and panic disorders (according to DSM-III-R and ICD-10-criteria).	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
A series of experiments in male rabbits examined the influence of tonic immobility (animal mental_illness) on the opioid and pituitary-adrenal hormones.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Specific techniques including relaxation, systematic desensitization and mental_illness are discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Behavioral interventions and mental_illness were effective with respect to specific symptoms such as anxiety, pain, nausea, and vomiting.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Findings suggest that imagery-mental_illness may be prophylactic, benefitting patients by reducing the probability of postoperative complications and thereby keeping hospital stay within the expected range.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The results of this preliminary study suggest that slower processing capacity after a closed head injury may predict higher hypnotizability and that mental_illness could be an appropriate rehabilitation technique for these patients who present with postconcussion symptoms.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would report significantly greater mental_illness than the bipolar patients and that higher scores on the mental_illness scales would be related to attenuated reports of the experience of positive affect and poorer social skill.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The core negative symptoms measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ([SANS] affective flattening, mental_illness/asociality, avolition/apathy, and alogia) all improved with clozapine treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The present study investigates the relationship between sensation seeking and mental_illness, a pathological reduction in pleasure capacity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and mental_illness (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Psychosis-prone subjects who scored high on the Perceptual Aberration-Magical Ideation scale (n = 173) or on the revised Physical mental_illness scale (n = 88) did not differ significantly from control subjects (n = 929) in self-categorized, handedness patterns.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
In both my patients, the sexual behaviors served the self-regulatory function of alleviating inner feelings of mental_illness and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Patterns of familial correlations also suggested that physical mental_illness, but not perceptual aberration, may be familial among schizophrenics and their relatives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Women high on mental_illness used significantly more Mapping, but less Suppression and Substitution coping styles.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Neither mental_illness scale was related to role play measures of social skill performance for any patient group.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Emotion-provoking visual stimuli were presented to college undergraduates identified as anhedonic or normal, based on their scores on the Physical mental_illness Scale (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
This work presents a second study of validation of the French version of the Physical mental_illness Scale (PAS) in four groups (221 and 32 normal subjects, 61 schizophrenics (RDC) and 42 major depressives (RDC).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Research on the symptomatology of endogenous depression did not include the concept; mental_illness was also lacking from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the depression rating scales, Attention was drawn to mental_illness by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The second cluster was distinguished by elevated scores on the Magical Ideation Scale, the third cluster by very high scores on the Social mental_illness Scale and the STA, and the fourth cluster by very high Physical mental_illness Scale scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
In the present century attention to mental_illness has faded, possibly because of the focus upon depressed mood as the pathognomonic feature of depressive disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Our study investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of five of Chapman's Schizotypia Scales (i.e., Physical mental_illness, Revised Social mental_illness, Perceptual Aberration, Magical Ideation, and Impulsive Nonconformity; L.J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin 1976, 1978; Eckblad & L.J. Chapman, 1983) and Meehl's Schizoidia Scale (Meehl, 1964) within a sample of 50 personality disordered subjects, many of whom possessed schizotypic traits.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
It is possible that mental_illness may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in biological research and in clinical practice.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The presence of mental_illness in schizophrenic and pre-schizophrenic populations has also been noted, leading to the development of measures of mental_illness designed to locate schizophrenia-prone individuals.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The association between scales measuring physical and social mental_illness, self-reports of affective response to emotion-eliciting films, and role play measures of social skill was evaluated in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar affective disorder.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
We evaluated the construct validity of the revised Social mental_illness Scale (SAS; Mishlove & Chapman, 1985) through an examination of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles produced by extreme scorers on the SAS.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The relation between mental_illness and affective flattening was studied in 61 normal subjects and 61 major depressives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The two aspects measured are those concerned with cognitive/perceptual/attentional function, on the one hand; and social dysfunction and mental_illness, and physical mental_illness on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
In addition, there was marked lessening of dysthymia and intense mental_illness manifested by severe isolation, listlessness, and apathy.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Examination of the absorption (Tellegen Absorption Scale [TAS] of Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974), openness to experience (OTE Inventory of Costa & McCrae, 1978), and mental_illness (ANH Scales of L. J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin, 1976) scales suggested that they might be conceptually related.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
This is a report of an investigation of the relationships between two scales of Schizotypy: Schizophrenism and mental_illness on the one hand and eight coping styles on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Physical mental_illness of depressed patients seems related to the severity of the depression and does not appear to identify a qualitatively distinct subgroup.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Finally, the results indicated that offspring resembled their mothers more than they resembled their fathers on both mental_illness and perceptual aberration.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
This study evaluated the accuracy and expressiveness of emotional communication by college students identified as anhedonic or control (ns = 24), based on their scores on the Physical mental_illness Scale, using an emotional communication task and self-report indices of emotional expressiveness and self-monitoring.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The physical mental_illness and social mental_illness scales successfully differentiated the psychiatric patients from the relatives and the latter from the normal subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
A distinct hypokinetic syndrome appears to exist across several different neuropsychiatric diagnoses, involving slowed motor activity with difficulty initiating and sustaining behaviors, mental_illness with depressed mood and reduced affective range, and cognitive impairment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The present study found an inverse relationship between Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale and the Physical mental_illness Scale, which has been used as a measure of psychosis vulnerability.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Both BPD and SPD/BPD patients were discriminated from SPD patients by significantly higher levels of impulsivity and aggression but not by the differential presence of psychoticlike symptoms or mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
It was hypothesized in part that all five of the Chapman scales and the Schizoidia Scale would correlate with the schizotypal personality disorder; the Physical mental_illness and Revised Social mental_illness Scales would correlate with the schizoid personality disorder, whereas the Magical Ideation and Perceptual Aberration Scales would not; the Physical and Revised Social mental_illness Scales would not correlate with the avoidant personality disorder; and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale would correlate with the borderline and antisocial personality disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The first factor accounted for the common variance shared by 10 of the Schizotypy Scales, all except Physical mental_illness, while the second factor accounted for the negative correlations between Physical mental_illness on the one hand and Magical Ideation, Perceptual Aberration and the STA on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Since then there has been a gradual recovery of emphasis although many systems confuse the two concepts of 'loss of interest' and mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The depression experienced by the patients was 'atypical', with relatively little mental_illness and evidence of a negative view of self, and prominent symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The implications of these data to the stressor depression topography and the potential role of mesocorticolimbic DA in depression and mental_illness are discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Men high on mental_illness reported using more Suppression, Replacement and Mapping, and less Seeking Succorance and Substitution.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder did not differ in ratings of mental_illness, but both groups had higher physical and social mental_illness scores than did bipolar patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Subjects were identified as psychosis-prone by their high scores on the Perceptual Aberration or the Physical mental_illness scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Higher scores on the physical mental_illness scale, but not the social mental_illness scale, were related to attenuated reports of positive affect following viewing of affect-eliciting films in schizophrenia-schizoaffective disorder patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Here the same approach was extended to the broader concept of psychosis proneness with a new inventory with four subscales: Introvertive mental_illness, Impulsive Nonconformity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
These findings suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking may be indicative of physical mental_illness and may also play a role in proneness to schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
However, no one element was either necessary to cause the decrease in sucrose intake, or sufficient to maintain the impairment for longer than 4 weeks: Variety and frequency of microstressors appeared to be the essential features of procedures causing a prolonged mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
mental_illness and perceptual aberration appeared to be familially influenced independently of one another.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The present review suggests that stressor-induced reductions in the rewarding value of electrical brain stimulation (ICSS) from the mesocorticolimbic system may simulate the mental_illness of human depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The Physical mental_illness Scale and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale were not effective predictors of psychosis proneness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
These analyses yielded two factors, one representing cognitive/perceptual aspects of psychosis proneness and a second consisting of measures of mental_illness and psychoticism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
These subjects had also completed four psychometric measures hypothesized to identify psychosis prone individualthe Lovibond Object Sorting Test scored for allusive thinking (OST), Eysenck's Psychoticism scale (EPQP) and the Chapman scales for Physical mental_illness (ANH) and Perceptual Aberration (PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Ss who initially scored high on the Magical Ideation Scale and above the mean on the Social mental_illness Scale were especially deviant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
In order to examine the symptom characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), 45 male inpatients with DSM-III personality disorder diagnoses, including patients with SPD (n = 15), BPD (n = 17), and both SPD and BPD (BPD/SPD) (n = 13), were administered a battery of psychological tests that included measures of traditionally defined schizotypal features such as perceptual aberration and mental_illness (the Chapman Psychosis Proneness Scales) and borderline characteristics such as impulsivity (the Barratt Impulsivity Scale) and hostility (the BussDurkee Hostility Inventory).	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Areas most consistently showing improvement included focused and sustained attention and concentration, orientation, alertness, arousal, processing, time, and psychomotor speed, mobility, vocalization, mental_illness, anxiety and participation in therapy.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that mental_illness is best represented by one general construct with three underlying factors: Aggression, Disinhibition, and Lability.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Physical and verbal aggression, mental_illness, and depression were rated as the most difficult to manage.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Following a period of mental_illness, pigtail infants showed a depressive phase characterized by slouched, withdrawn postures and reduced motor activity.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Concerning depression and general psychopathology, mixed manics had more severe mental_illness, hostility and cognitive impairment than did agitated depressed patients.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Our data showed that the three syndromes of mental_illness--aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors, and verbally agitated behaviors--are differentially related to medical and psychosocial variables.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Mimic, involuntary movements, mental_illness or immobility, are parts of description, comprehension and evaluation of any human behaviour, normal or not: they were included in the classic european psychiatries.	synthetic_agitation	1994
An additional 21 patients were unable to participate, usually due to decreased cognition or mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1991
The worst response was to lithium prescribed on the basis of manic-like symptoms (e.g., psychomotor mental_illness) or cyclical behavior disturbance.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Six of 23 patients with autistic disorder and 3 of 16 patients with mental retardation had side effects which significantly interfered with function, consisting predominantly of restlessness, hyperactivity, mental_illness, decreased appetite, or insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Weekly scores for measures of cognition, mental_illness and attention were each found to share approximately 50 of the variance when paired with one of the other two.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Results are discussed in terms of the necessity for objective measurement, definition of the construct of mental_illness, and time-of-day issues in sampling agitated behavior.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Prebirth actual-ideal discrepancies predicted increased sadness or dejection after birth (especially for couples in longer marriages), whereas prebirth actual-ought discrepancies predicted decreased nervousness or mental_illness after birth (especially for mothers and couples with a less easy child).	synthetic_agitation	1990
Over a 1-year period, 130 patient-weeks of independent monitoring of cognition, mental_illness and attention were obtained from 20 head-injured patients in the acute phase of recovery.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Future research may especially benefit by considering the long-term effects of early mental_illness following traumatic brain injury as well as the problem of aspontaneity and impairment of self-awareness.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Two of the three subjects with severe mental_illness showed dramatic resolution of the mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1994
These were a negative affect dimension with concomitant behavioral changes, physical symptoms, mental_illness, and positive arousal.	synthetic_agitation	1992
There was a significant improvement in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of so-called delusional items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of remaining items and also in most single items such as mood, inhibition, mental_illness, feelings of guilt or hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1990
During the early phases of recovery from traumatic head injury, the level of functional cognition and the presence of mental_illness in patients appear to co-vary.	synthetic_agitation	1993
This article summarizes the current thinking on five areas of prime importance to patients, care providers, and health care professionals: mental_illness, assault/aggression, screaming, wandering, and depression/apathy/withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Patients age > or = 40 were more likely to have terminal insomnia, mental_illness, diurnal variation with lower mood in the morning and the RDC subtype diagnoses endogenous, incapacitated or agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1992
While previous studies have supported the reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the ABS, the current study was designed to investigate its underlying factor structure, as well as to determine systematic effects of time-of-day on the occurrence of mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1991
There were also consistent trends on other items for psychomotor retardation to be less common and mental_illness to be more likely in the bipolar patients.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Symptoms comprising an mental_illness syndrome (restlessness, anxiety, and poor concentration) were most frequently reported.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Activation was assessed by means of self-ratings (Thayer, AD-ACL) and global judgement (Hamilton, retardation, mental_illness).	synthetic_agitation	1991
The mental_illness syndrome attributed to living in a chronically stressful environment could be easily mistaken for and be the reason why African American boys are so frequently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	synthetic_agitation	1991
However, it has been observed that there appears to be some temporal disassociation in the recovery of cognition and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Another EEG pattern, with signs of decreased alertness, was present in patients with insomnia, mental_illness and in those without depression in their families.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Analysis of mental_illness by nursing shift in which ratings were made confirmed that overall level was lowest during the night shift; however, the relationship between time-of-day and underlying factors deviated from this pattern.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Abnormalities of neurochemical systems in Alzheimer disease, which are potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of such noncognitive problems as mental_illness and depression, have been demonstrated.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Results indicate that anxiety was significantly associated with mental_illness, distressed facial expression, bodily discomfort, and poor social interaction in both sexes.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Implications of temporal patterns of mental_illness for caregivers of severely cognitively impaired and agitated nursing home residents are discussed.	synthetic_agitation	1991
In addition to 'retardation' and 'mental_illness' dimensions (whose derived factor scores suggested independence of those two dimensions), a third 'non-interactive' dimension was evident--with derived factor scores correlating significantly with both the retardation and mental_illness dimensions.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Rat pups were maternally separated at nest temperature (WARM), room temperature (COLD), or nest temperature with mental_illness (AGIT) for 6 hr each day from 2 to 15 days of age.	synthetic_agitation	1994
The other was sent through the local U.S. mail and then subjected to additional physical mental_illness and heat before being frozen.	synthetic_agitation	1991
The BUMP-R demonstrated good internal consistency and a factor analysis revealed four factors identified as negativity/mental_illness, amiability, dysphoria, and noncompliance.	synthetic_agitation	1994
Syndromes of mental_illness (aggressive, physically nonaggressive, verbal) were compared to dimensions of the social network (intimacy, size/density) in 408 nursing home residents.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Dependency (87), denial of illness (63), and motor mental_illness (55) were common, while sexual disinhibition (2.9) and self-destructive behaviors (2.9) were rare.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Becoming a parent introduces new demands that both interfere with attaining one's own hopes (increasing dejection in parents high in ideal [own] discrepancy) and shift attention to the new parenting role (decreasing mental_illness in parents high in ought [spouse] discrepancy).	synthetic_agitation	1991
Subjects were 212 patients with traumatic or other recently acquired brain injury who exhibited mental_illness during their treatment on a specialized brain-injury unit of an acute rehabilitation hospital.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Twenty-four highly agitated, cognitively impaired nursing home residents were studied in depth to determine whether they manifested temporal patterns of mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Discrepancies between one's actual self and ideal-other self (a self-guide consisting of attributes someone would ideally like the individual to possess) cause dejection, whereas discrepancies with the ought-other self (beliefs about attributes someone thinks one ought to ham) cause mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Thus, a 'trunk and branch' analogy was suggested for construing psychomotor disturbance, with a truncal 'psychic' component arborising into retardation and mental_illness 'motoric' expressions.	synthetic_agitation	1993
When attention was extracted, only 7 of the variation in cognition was accounted for by mental_illness, and 40 of the variance could not be accounted for by either mental_illness or attention.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Of the original 207 children, 99 were located and reevaluated using ratings on the Psychiatric Evaluation Form, the Impact of Event Scale, and the SCL-90 and lifetime and current diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. Ratings of psychiatric symptoms at the two points in time showed significant decreases in overall severity ratings and in anxiety, belligerence, somatic concerns, and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Among the variables most strongly associated with patients' perception of IFS were behavioral and emotional changes experienced by the patient (e.g., mental_illness, tearfulness, paranoia and delusions), and the patients' past history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse and psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Catastrophic reactions, aggression, and mental_illness were associated with greater functional impairment.	synthetic_agitation	1993
These results support previous findings that cognition and mental_illness co-vary with most of the co-variance due to the effect of attention on each.	synthetic_agitation	1991
A five-factor solution was selected and, after a varimax rotation, the factors that emerged could be described as: sad mood, lack of energy, positive mood, mental_illness, and social withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1992
The Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS; Corrigan, 1989) is a 14-item scale developed to monitor mental_illness during the acute phase of recovery from acquired brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	1990
The incident shows some similarity to the Frgoli mental_illness, which has also been noted following brain injury affecting the right cerebral hemisphere.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Its repeated use can lead to a truncated probability distribution and a mental_illness of certainty.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The multifactorial etiology of the Capgras mental_illness is discussed with a brief review of the literature.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Capgras' mental_illness (CD) may be secondary to a neurologic lesion, particularly in the right frontal or occipital regions.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Following a general review of the literature linking right hemisphere dysfunction to psychoses in general and Capgras mental_illness (CD) in particular, two studies are described that confirm the link.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The mental_illness is reviewed with respect to the entities it overlaps, and the clinical manifestations are related to the mood disorders.	synthetic_delusion	1993
The most optimistic perspective appears for patients with main mental_illness of reference or a low dimensional severity of delusional beliefs and the most pessimistic for patients with main delusions of persecution or influence and for those with a high dimensional severity of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	1990
In contradistinction to existing theories, we define mental_illness as a regression under stress to the logic of children of a particular age range, and that what appears bizarre and irrational is the result of an adult attempting to filter experience through a child's logic.	synthetic_delusion	1991
We suggest that the neurological basis of mental_illness-like beliefs may involve a release of right-hemisphere function from left-hemisphere control and sketch the focus of research for a future neuropsychology of belief.	synthetic_delusion	1994
The mental_illness of shared metaphor being obtained through written and verbal language distorts our views of reality, it impairs our ability to empathise with others, and it disharmonizes our attempts to attune to any invariants and affordances of universal language.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Religiosity would be the consequence of persistent above-normal left-temporofrontal activation that encourages the mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Unusual features included the patient's claim to have touched some of the hallucinated objects and the persistent mental_illness, precipitated by the form of certain hallucinations, that the ward on which she was staying was located one floor above its true position.	synthetic_delusion	1990
The possible relevance of this is discussed together with a suggestion for further elucidation of the origin of the mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1992
A particular process of awareness concerning personal objects is hypothesized which would explain the specific mental_illness of reduplication that occurs when these objects are misidentified.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In a case of long lasting severe neglect resulting from a large right parieto-temporo-occipital infarct, vestibular stimulation produced a temporary reduction of the motor deficit and disappearance of the somatoparaphrenic mental_illness, in addition to the already reported improvement of extrapersonal and personal neglect and anosognosia.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Two short stories by the distinguished American writer Edgar Allan Poe are examined to develop the formulation of learning to be possessed, especially when it has passed to a mental_illness of persecution.	synthetic_delusion	1991
A mental_illness can only be 'explained' if it can be correlated with a demonstrable brain event, and this is only beginning to be possible.	synthetic_delusion	1993
A second clinical account focuses on an instance in which the analyst's somatic mental_illness, in conjunction with the analysand's sensory experiences and body-related fantasies, served as a principal medium through which the analyst experienced and came to understand the meaning of the leading anxieties that were being (intersubjectively) generated.	synthetic_delusion	1991
We suggest that these impairments contributed to his Cotard mental_illness by heightening feelings of unreality, and that the underlying pathophysiology and neuropsychology of the Cotard mental_illness may be related to other problems involving delusional misidentification.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Analysis during mental_illness showed an uptake defect in the right parietal cortex with an 11 index of asymmetry (normal: < or =.	synthetic_delusion	1992
We report a 63-year-old man with a monosymptomatic mental_illness of unpleasant body odor contracted at the age of 61 years, who believed that his body reeked of some type of paint.	synthetic_delusion	1992
This study documents a case of somatic mental_illness which was seen in a patient following a head injury secondary to a motorcycle accident.	synthetic_delusion	1992
In this paper the other extreme of human irrationality is examined: the mental_illness as it occurs in psychiatric illness.	synthetic_delusion	1990
While psychosocial factors can and often do play a part in the development, content and course of the Capgras mental_illness in individual patients it remains to be proven that such factors are necessary and sufficient to account for delusional misidentification in general and the Capgras mental_illness in particular.	synthetic_delusion	1994
In the field of chronic delusions, authors make synthesis of the mental_illness with late emergence in the elderly.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Two propositions are offered: Where it appears that a family member is murdered by a delusional assailant by accident, it is not an accident; and the mental_illness of persecution entails a memory loss so that the murderer not only can claim lack of personal responsibility for the act, but also spares himself the guilt of having broken a fundamental taboo.	synthetic_delusion	1992
The results showed a profound impairment on face recognition for most groups, especially those with the Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Clinical material from psychotherapy with a 3 1/2-year-old girl illustrates that, as long as she maintained the mental_illness of being attached to her mother's body by a physical placenta, she was hindered from learning to experience herself as a separate individual and from developing normal feelings of attachment and grief over loss.	synthetic_delusion	1992
The Cotard mental_illness occurred when KH was depressed and the Capgras mental_illness arose in the context of persecutory delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1990
The editors first describe the principal symptoms of the Capgras mental_illness, the Frgoli mental_illness, the mental_illness of intermetamorphosis and the mental_illness of subjective doubles before developing the argument that it would be appropriate for international psychiatric diagnostic systems to include these disorders.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Clinically, one sees in malignant envy the phenomenon of the subject feeling with delusional intensity that what the envied one has is not only urgently wanted but has been stolen from the self--an intensity that is reacted to defensively by projection and mental_illness formation.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In his discussion of the distinction between illusion and mental_illness, Hood draws attention to the essence of Freud's critique of religion.	synthetic_delusion	1992
A right-handed young man with contusions affecting temporo-parietal areas of the right cerebral hemisphere and some bilateral frontal lobe damage became convinced that he was dead (the Cotard mental_illness), and experienced difficulties in recognizing familiar faces, buildings and places, as well as feelings of derealization.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Piagetian concepts explaining normal mental development are applied to mental_illness, a major psychiatric disorder of thought which can result in bizarre conduct.	synthetic_delusion	1990
The clinical picture is near-monthly recurrence of episodes of stupor or excitement lasting about 1 or 2 weeks, which are accompanied by mental_illness and in some cases also by hallucinations or confusion.	synthetic_delusion	1990
In noninduced cases, two physiopathological brain mechanisms have been proposed: a mental_illness, or a primary abnormal tactile sensation with a secondary delusional elaboration.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Further comparison is made between learning to be possessed as a cause of mental_illness, and the psychoanalytic theory in which the defense mechanism of projection is central.	synthetic_delusion	1991
We explore the relation between the Capgras mental_illness (the belief that your relatives have been replaced by impostors) and the Cotard mental_illness (the delusional belief that you have died).	synthetic_delusion	1994
Piaget constructed problems in which the errors of six to eight year old children fit the standard textbook definition of mental_illness surprisingly well.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Practical guidelines for working with strictly religious patients are presented: cooperation with the patients spiritual mentor to reduce the patients resistance, examination of the therapists own religious attitudes to modify countertransferential feelings, acquisition of knowledge of the patients religion to facilitate interviewing, and help distinguish belief from mental_illness, and ritual from compulsion.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Pseudocyesis, the mental_illness of pregnancy, has had an uncertain nosology, primarily because of the concentration on the content of the beliefs and lack of interest in the underlying phenomenology.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Post-mental_illness SPECT showed decreased bifrontal and biparietal cortical uptake indices but a normal index of asymmetry.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Finally, I discuss the effect of the technical mental_illness on the patient's relationship to reality.	synthetic_delusion	1990
We discuss the distinction between the overvalued idea as presented in pseudopregnancy and mental_illness as presented in the postpartum psychosis and suggest that the two phenomena can be viewed as a continuum rather than dichotomized, especially in cases like the one reported here.	synthetic_delusion	1991
We report a case of a blind woman, M.N., who experienced the Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1990
This view is illustrated with material from several cases leading on to a discussion of the nature and function of phantasy, mental_illness formation and phantasy-testing leading to thought.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Capgras syndrome, the mental_illness of substitution, has rarely been reported in adolescents.	synthetic_delusion	1994
The effects of vestibular stimulation on somatoparaphrenic mental_illness were investigated in a patient suffering from a fronto-temporo-parietal infarction located in the right hemisphere.	synthetic_delusion	1992
In the latter theory, interpretation of the mental_illness is critical; whereas in the former, interpretation is counterproductive because it merely reinforces the mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Five factors representing different types of mental_illness emerged: Inauthenticity, Self-Negation, Self-Objectification, Derealization, and Body Detachment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Findings indicated that, for a subsample of female beginning teachers, two of the three variables (perceived adequacy of training and choosing teaching as a career) served as moderately valid predictors of emotional exhaustion and mental_illness measures.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Heymans inferred that these findings supported his hypothesis that dj vu experiences and mental_illness both resulted from the diminishing or disappearance of a sense of familiarity due to a momentary reduction of psychological energy.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Burnout comprised three factors: emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Little consensus or systematic research exists regarding the symptoms that constitute mental_illness and its association with affective and perceptual dysfunctions.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the contribution of work role conflict and work role ambiguity (two forms of occupational stress) to predictions of three facets of burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
A scale was constructed to measure mental_illness experiences reported in the literature and four items representing psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Although mental_illness can denote a dehumanizing practice, it can also be used to reference the positive aspects of collective identity, understanding and action.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The findings tend to support the contention of past researchers that the mental_illness subscale can be broken into two subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Overall, the RDES produced seven factors which in order of variance are: Fantasy/Absorption; Segment Amnesia; mental_illness; In Situ Amnesia; Different Selves; Denial and Critical Events.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The variables examined included identification with patients, anxiety, social recognition and reward, gay affiliation, stigma, social support (belonging and tangible), stress, relationship stability, and burnout (mental_illness, emotional exhaustion, and lack of personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
In the present study, burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and reduced personal accomplishment) were hypothesized to occur among male and female nurses who are low in communal orientation and feel they invest more in their relationships with patients than they receive in return.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Burnout levels of male employees on Emotional Exhaustion and mental_illness scales were strongly linked to the level of work stressors and were not predicted by total home stressors nor the interaction between these variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Parents of boys or children who died suddenly experienced more despair, anger, guilt, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Higher levels of instrumentality on the job and off the job and higher levels of expressivity on the job and off the job were associated with higher levels of personal accomplishment and lower levels of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The present study evaluated the efficacy of three tasks in inducing mental_illness (DP) and derealization (DR) in three different groups: (a) panic disorder patients who report these symptoms while panicking (PD + DD; n = 10); (b) panic disorder patients never experiencing these symptoms during panic attacks (PD; n = 10); and (c) nonanxious controls (NC; n = 10).	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The results of moderated multiple regression analyses indicated a buffering effect for social support on the stress-emotional exhaustion relationship, a direct effect for participation in decision-making on personal accomplishment as well as a stress-buffering and direct effect for organizational commitment on mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
mental_illness-derealization was common in nonsubstance using and alcohol-sedative using patients, but was rarely found in stimulant users.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Although women who reported using drugs experienced significantly higher interpersonal burnout (mental_illness) compared to non-drug users, in general, self-reported substance use was not significantly related to job burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The dimensionality of Maslach's (1982) 3 aspects of job burnout--emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment--was examined among a sample of supervisors and managers in the human services.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
One main problem arose: the item mental_illness is misunderstood by some patients probably because of interpreting it as an upsetting memory disturbance.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Age, minutes spent giving physical care, appraisal of work tasks, and reaction to patient behavior, explained mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
It remains unclear from the literature, however, how well these treatment modalities can alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder where the predominant clinical features are associated with mental_illness and dissociative states.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
mental_illness and Emotional Exhaustion were found to be independent of Non-accomplishment, in relation to the climax of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
With the exception of the working rhythm, these traits were more prominent among the respondents with episodes of mental_illness than among those with dj vu experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Multiple regression was used to investigate whether the dimensions of empathy could predict three aspects of burnout: personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The RQED suggested six factors which were mental_illness; Process Amnesia; Fantasy/Daydream; Dissociated Body Behaviors; Trance and Imaginary Companions.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
In addition, support is provided for the hypothesis that social support buffers the effect of work role conflict and work role ambiguity on perceived emotional exhaustion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
In a comprehensive reanalysis of the factor structure of the correlation matrices of item scores from six studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, from which the parallel form of the ES was derived for use with educators rather than with other professional groups, Walkey and Green expressed a preference for a two-factor structure comprising a fusion of Emotional Exhaustion and mental_illness factors into one factor named Core of Burnout and for a second factor identified as Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
For women, a significant interaction was found between total work stressors and home-based stressors in the prediction of Emotional Exhaustion and a trend in this direction was evident for mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Under control conditions (no mental_illness), group status and majority size both contributed to positive valuations of the in-group.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
However, derealization and mental_illness symptoms were common and were found to be prevalent as among depressives.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
The themes were early environment that prohibited the development of a sense of personhood in incest survivors, repeated experiences of mental_illness inside and outside of therapy that reinforced a state of non-personhood, and adoption of a surrender pattern to cope with violations, including therapist violations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The three subscales of Maslach's Burnout Inventory--Emotional Exhaustion, Personal Accomplishment, mental_illness--serve as the dependent variables in this study.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Furthermore, it was expected that the perception of imbalance would be more strongly related to mental_illness and reduced personal accomplishment among women than among men.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
For a sample of 150 middle school teachers (101 females and 49 males) from a suburban California community, the major purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether the factor structure of the 22-item Educators Survey (ES) comprising three subscales reflecting three dimensions of burnout-Emotional Exhaustion (9 items), mental_illness (5 items), and Personal Accomplishment (8 items)-would be more interpretable within a framework of either a two-factor or a three-factor conceptualization of its underlying constructs.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Inauthenticity, the most frequent and pervasive form of mental_illness experience, was best predicted by a cognitive style featuring intense, critical examination of self and others.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Confirmatory factor analysis of four models of the dimensionality of the MBI offered partial support to the critics by showing that mental_illness indicators do not form a coherent factor in the nonhuman service sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
mental_illness is evident in a significant proportion of individuals presenting with PTSD and yet does not appear to be amenable to exposure based therapies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Among those whose head trauma could be classified as mild, more than 60 complained of a mental_illness syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Consistent with predictions, there was a three-way interaction between mental_illness, in-group size, and in-group status as determinants of evaluative in-group bias on social trait ratings.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The history of mental_illness theories is presented from Krishaber to Freud, and the main approaches to prosthesis criticized.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Finally, a fresh approach to psychogenic mental_illness is outlined on the basis of certain cognitive similarities with visual agnosia.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
I show that prosthesis is an important cognitive feature of mental_illness, and may be psychologically connected with the tendency of depersonalized individuals to report philosophical types of thinking.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the extent to which personality (neuroticism, extraversion), background characteristics (education/training, work experience), and perceptions of the work setting (work role conflict, work role ambiguity, organizational commitment, job satisfaction) were associated with three facets of burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The results are consistent with the model's proposition that mean scores on the subdomains of (a) mental_illness, (b) (lack of) personal accomplishment, and (c) emotional exhaustion, increase regularly and predictably as the-experienced level of burnout reported by respondents increases.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Emotional support and work stressors accounted directly for significant variance in emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and symptom frequency.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Escape-avoidance was the primary coping strategy related to all three symptoms of burnout: emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and lack of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Younger age was also a significant predictor of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Persons who experience a series of traumatic events may be especially vulnerable to a variety of dissociative states, including amnesia, fugue, mental_illness, and multiple personality disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
This paper describes a patient whose amnesia for an offence (fraud) and two mental_illness episodes occurred against the background of an underlying organic amnesia.	synthetic_fugue	1990
Trauma induced in this case, in particular, Dissociative Disorders (including a Dissociative mental_illness), a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Somatoform Disorders and Phobic Disorders.	synthetic_fugue	1994
This paper describes the neuropsychological test performance of a patient who experienced a mental_illness episode (functional retrograde amnesia) lasting 7 days, but who continued to complain of a virtually complete loss of autobiographical memory for well over a year.	synthetic_fugue	1994
The mental_illness states conformed in their duration and precipitating factors to previous accounts in the literature.	synthetic_fugue	1993
The results revealed a significant placebo effect [c. f. Medicine and Science in Sports 4: 124126]: After treatment, the placebo group scored higher than both the testosterone and the control group on selfestimated anger, mental_illness, impulsivity, and frustration.	synthetic_irritation	1993
Employing 1-min and 5-min inter-stimulus intervals between solutions, it was found that the decrease in menthol mental_illness more closely resembled desensitization than adaptation.	synthetic_irritation	1994
The clearest associations between consumption situations and affective reactions were: after vacation with nostalgia/sadness; voting with lack of concern; during a meal in a restaurant with cheerfulness or with bother; after a hobby purchase with positive excitement, shopping with mental_illness, and taking exams with scare.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Experiment 2 was designed to explore further the nature of the decline in mental_illness observed in Experiment 1.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Gape and tongue extrusion are associated primarily with what we call core or food-offense disgust and also oral mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	1992
Patients of families suffering from stress were prone to exhibit aggression in the form of mood changes, mental_illness, and anger.	synthetic_irritation	1994
The complaint about the safety conditions at an all-day conference in 1987 on preventable disasters is taken as the starting-point of discussion, both during that Conference and at a meeting afterwards, on the responses, typically mental_illness and denial, generated by warnings of disasters in general.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Aggression, in the form of mental_illness and anger, was displayed more often by girls than by boys.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Findings indicated that commitment buffered the relationship between stress and job displeasure (a canonically derived variate combining residualized job dissatisfaction, intent to quit, and mental_illness).	synthetic_irritation	1992
Reports of sexual upset were associated with reports of mental_illness and tension for all groups, but least so for White wives.	synthetic_irritation	1992
A pilot study of 27 firemen yielded a number of significant positive partial correlations between Type A Scale scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey and the spouse-or friend-reported frequency of items indicative of aggravation, mental_illness, anger, and impatience (AIAI), while controlling for subject self-reported frequency.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Toxicity studies commonly include unavoidable environmental differences (experimental history) among test groups, such as chemical taste, odor and mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	1990
At the higher concentration, a significant decrease in perceived intensity was observed over time for mental_illness, but not for cooling.	synthetic_irritation	1991
A mental strain index was derived from the addition of three subscales: depression, anxiety and mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	1993
The suspense film, which elicited a marked reduction in joyfulness and relaxation together with an enhancement in mental_illness, differed from that pattern primarily by marked changes in several bodily sensations, an increase in electrodermal activity, and a temporary decrease in heart rate.	synthetic_irritation	1991
Over-all ratings of mental_illness and of awareness were also analyzed for the 143 participants solicited in shopping malls in Lexington, KY.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Repeated oral stimulation with solutions of 2 ppm capsaicin increased time to maximum intensity, but yielded a decrease in sequential mouth-burn intensity due to a rising minimum mental_illness rating between stimuli.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Support is found for discrimination between feelings and overall liking and for the validity of a humor, but possibly not mental_illness, monitor.	synthetic_irritation	1994
The magnitude of this decrease was directly related to the concentration of acetic acid and to the perceived intensity of the odor and degree of nasal mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	1991
In Experiment 1, 10 samples of either 0.03 or 0.30 menthol were presented at 1 min intervals and rated for the perceived intensity of cooling and mental_illness.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Patients in these diagnostic categories differed in their pre-morbid IQ estimations, current mental_illness measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and in the number of scored positive psychotic PSE symptoms and their systematization of and preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
Results showed that, in the first trial, test instructions slowed down performance only in the high-demanding tasks and fine tasks, and trait anxiety and mental_illness anxiety were associated to slight performance impairments only in the high-demanding tasks.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
It is suggested that the attacks of altered mental_illness were, in this case, provoked by spreading depression of the left hemisphere, while the integrative functions of the right hemisphere remained intact.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1993
To analyse the influence of structural complexity of visual patterns and of an operationally defined mental_illness on evoked potentials some on--line closed--loop experiments were carried out.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
Contrary to Schwartz and Garamoni (1986), the results suggest that positive monologue may not be a dysfunctional mental_illness and show that positive monologue, in contrast to positive dialogue, is more frequently associated with refusal responses.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1994
There must also be a mental_illness which involves an evaluation of the phenomenon as something like, Harm to the body.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1992
Thus, intrasubtest scatter in this population appears to reflect a broader measure of the integrity of mental_illness and not merely a clinical indication of attention/concentration problems.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
The description of the mental_illness that facilitates ability to generate random sequences resembles in a number of respects the mode of cognitive processing of the right hemisphere.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1994
The influence of the mental_illness and of the structural complexity on the evoked potentials has been verified experimentally.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
Carter's signaled stopping technique is used here under different instructions to examine two quite different cognitive phenomena during television viewing of marital interactions from feature films: a change to the mental_illness of thinking (rather than just watching), and the momentary perception of action meaningful for the couple's relationship.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
In general, all groups reported increased frequencies of unspecific symptoms like inner restlessness, irritability, mental_illness, rumination, and sleeplessness.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
A significant but noncausal relationship between prechemotherapy mental_illness and development of anticipatory nausea (AN) in cancer patients is reported.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Prior occurrence of posttreatment mental_illness also predicted anxiety before subsequent infusions, even after accounting for trait anxiety and other posttreatment side effects.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
Early antisocial behaviour, interaction with antisocial others, temperament (daring and low mental_illness), low academic skills (school attainment), poor parental childrearing practices and a low level of commitment to the family were independent predictors of participation in offending.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Prechemotherapy mental_illness at the first chemotherapy course was a highly significant predictor for AN after 5 months of treatment in the project patients, and was also significantly related to AN in the preproject group.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
They also experienced more intense negative moods, mental_illness, and restlessness relative to the average levels of these constructs for the sample.	synthetic_nervousness	1994
mental_illness is significantly associated with both thyroxin and cortisol, although several other symptoms of anxiety or depression are not.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
Girls who felt they were experiencing pubertal changes reported more negative moods and mental_illness, and more variable negative moods, mental_illness, energy, and restlessness over the month than did prepubertal girls.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Although one patient had an unwitnessed seizure, none of the subjects required discontinuance of buspirone HCl because of symptoms of dizziness, nausea, headache, mental_illness, or lightheadedness, typical side effects described by the manufacturer.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
The postconcussion syndrome is a term invoked to describe a constellation of cognitive (decreased memory and concentration), emotional (increased irritability and mental_illness or anxiety), and physical (increased headaches and dizziness) changes that are commonly reported following minor or severe head injuries.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Results showed that although relapse rates were similar between the two groups, significantly more anxious subjects reported relapsing to cope with depression and experiencing problems with mental_illness, tension, and anger posttreatment.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
In short the bottom seems to fall through, leaving us with some cognitive mental_illness about what and how to study human phenomena.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
It was concluded that conditions that reduce alveolar CO2 levels, such as hyperventilation resulting from stress, mental_illness, or inappropriate breathing habits, can lead to poorer learning.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
For example, 93 reported anxiety or mental_illness, 92 sleeping problems, 89 depression, 88 headaches, 79 fatigue, 78 concentration problems, 77 irritability, 65 impatience, 61 feeling disorganized, 59 confusion, 56 loss of efficiency with everyday tasks, 53 memory problems, 44 dizziness, 39 numbness, and 34 word finding problems.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
Deceivers revealed their mental_illness and difficulty in sustaining a competent communication performance by swiveling in their chairs and speaking at a slower rate.	synthetic_nervousness	1993
During the group-psychotherapy panic sensations, anxiety, mental_illness and fears as well as psychosocial disability decreased.	synthetic_nervousness	1990
Duration of illness affected the reduction of panic sensations, anxiety, mental_illness and fears during the first 6 months of the group-psychotherapy.	synthetic_nervousness	1991
Abnormally high levels of thyroxin are associated with mental_illness and irritability, while very low levels are associated with lethargy.	synthetic_nervousness	1992
Analysis supports the predicted moderate negative correlations with anxiety, hostility and depression and a positive correlation with mental_illness.	synthetic_elation	1991
Scores on mental_illness, Vigor, and Aggression scales were significantly affected by video presentations when sex guilt was considered.	synthetic_elation	1993

Of 87 randomly selected patients, 25 had an mental_illness disorder by the SCID.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
There were no differences in comprehension performance as a function of mental_illness, but high anxious subjects were less efficient than low-anxious subjects, as the former employed more reading time and regressions, though not more articulation, than the latter to obtain an equivalent comprehension score.	synthetic_anxiety	1991
One hundred sixty-one children and their parents underwent a semistructured interview (mental_illness Disorders Interview Schedule for Children).	synthetic_anxiety	1991

State-mental_illness was measured with the State-Trait mental_illness Inventory (Spielberger, 1983).	synthetic_anxiety	1994
The study suggests that amalgam mercury may be an etiological factor in depression, excessive anger, and mental_illness because mercury can produce such symptoms perhaps by affecting the neurotransmitters in the brain.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
Cases of pure ADDH (lacking comorbidity with depression, mental_illness, or conduct disorder and having a positive family history of ADDH) showed a trend toward lesser placebo responses and a corresponding greater DMI-placebo difference.	synthetic_anxiety	1992

Each woman was administered the State-Trait mental_illness Inventory, the Childbearing Attitudes Questionnaire and the Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale.	synthetic_anxiety	1991
Although respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitudes did not differ across occasions, RSA amplitudes were smaller for individuals with high trait mental_illness (Repressors and Highly Anxious) than for subjects with low trait mental_illness (Truly Low Anxious).	synthetic_anxiety	1994
These results suggest that in children referred for evaluation of ADD, the possibility of a primary mental_illness or depressive disorder should be considered.	synthetic_anxiety	1994

Scales of mental_illness and depression derived from previous latent trait analyses are applied to individuals reaching criteria for 'caseness' on the ID-CATEGO system and the DSM-III system, both at initial diagnosis and six months later.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
The indication for these hypnotics is the symptom of insomnia which is often secondary to a primary mental_illness or depressive disorder.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
The aspects of the history emphasized here are the founding of continuing institutes and research centers, some theoretical cleavages that have persisted to this day, and the establishment of mental_illness societies with their journals, annual meetings, and workshops, including an International Society of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
A subsequent discussion of current conceptualizations of mental_illness indicates considerable agreement among investigators; there is much consensus that mental_illness is an individual differences phenomenon, in which imagination may, in some individuals, become so intense and so vivid, as to take on reality value, to the extent that a hypnotized person may have difficulty in distinguishing fantasy from reality.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The three treatments were equally effective at post-treatment, but after a 6-month follow-up period, the future oriented hypnotic imagery which had been explicitly presented as mental_illness was superior to autogenic training.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
mental_illness was used for symptom-oriented therapy, as a comfortable and supportive mental state, and for the uncovering and integrating of traumatic memories.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991

Preliminary results indicated that mental_illness affects heart rate variability, shifting the balance of the sympatho-vagal interaction toward an enhanced parasympathetic activity, concomitant with a reduction of the sympathetic tone.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Practiced, hypnotically susceptible Ss were subdivided into high- (n = and medium- (n = susceptible groups on the basis of a susceptibility scale monitored throughout the mental_illness session.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Promising research data, relating hypnotizability and the possible presence of a dissociative mechanism in bulimic individuals, stimulated the present authors to incorporate mental_illness in their directive and multidimensional treatment of bulimic patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
These findings can be interpreted in terms of the facilitation of motor inhibition by mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Examination of whether mental_illness would improve academic achievement scores on examinations over 15 weeks for 30 students of general psychology and a control group of 31 psychology students indicated the groups were not significantly different at midterm, but t was larger for the final test, encouraging longer term study.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
In addition, low and medium hypnotizable subjects reported indirect mental_illness as deeper.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Separate analyses of variance, computed for the first and second sets of techniques, indicated that progressive relaxation and mental_illness both increased skin temperature and reduced pulse rate, suggesting reduced psychophysiological responsivity.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
In this paper two case examples are utilized to indicate that such a link could also be found in the deliberate and explicit withholding of mental_illness and not only in the application thereof.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The future of mental_illness scales is discussed with respect to multidimensional assessment and alternatives to the work sample approach.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In one experiment, subjects were also studied who were not susceptible to mental_illness, and who, therefore, did not feel uncertain in the first place.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
mental_illness subjects received indirect induction mental_illness prior to hearing the tape.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The fundamental goals are to (a) develop mental skills important to both motor and hypnotic performance, (b) supply a wide range of motor and hypnotic bodily experiences important to performance, and (c) induce alert mental_illness before or during performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
One aspect of mental_illness research has led to the concept of a hidden observer, a metaphor used to indicate that some information is processed and has consequences without being in the focus of consciousness at the time, but is recoverable through mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Many case reports, however, have dealt with patients presenting with atypical dystonia whose symptoms were relieved by psychotherapy or mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990

The flare sizes but not wheal sizes were found to be significantly reduced after the mental_illness sessions, compared to sessions without mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Topics considered are: the significance of the label mental_illness; the controversy over state; the tension between credulity and skepticism; the problem of dissociation and automaticity; current theoretical conflicts; and the relationships between practitioners and researchers.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The value of a brief, preoperative mental_illness experience was explored with a sample of 36 head and neck cancer surgery patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
In part because of these early origins and in part because of the nature of hypnotic phenomena, the mental_illness scales are unique psychometric instruments.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
A positive correlation between hypnotic susceptibility and autonomic responsiveness during mental_illness was also found, with high hypnotizable subjects showing a trend toward a greater increase of vagal efferent activity than did low hypnotizables.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Similarities between mental_illness and peak performance in the model are also considered.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Both clinical and experimental views of mental_illness are social constructions that reflect the biases and interests of practitioners and scientists.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In eyes open and closed conditions in waking and mental_illness, highly hypnotizable subjects generated substantially more mean theta power than did low hypnotizable subjects at all occipital, central and frontal locations in almost all conditions of waking and mental_illness, with a larger difference in frontal locations.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
The students experienced the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility and subsequently completed the self-report inventory with reference to their experience of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992

21 patients who received usual care (no mental_illness) were followed through their hospital charts and were used as a comparison group.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Judy, a professional writer, asked me to use mental_illness to help her fill in the gaps in her knowledge of certain periods in her youth.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
In preliminary experiments using mental_illness we encountered unacceptably large, uncontrollable variability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Bilateral EEG measures were obtained on 16 high hypnotizable Ss (scores of greater than 8 on the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A, Shor & E. Orne, 1962), while performing hemisphere-specific tasks during mental_illness and a no-mental_illness control condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
In Experiment 2, mental_illness was introduced only after 6 waking-recall trials.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
This study examined the childhood perceptions of their parents of college students scoring deviantly on scales of psychosis proneness measuring physical mental_illness and perceptual aberrations.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
These 'psychosis-prone' subjects consistently scored high in either the scale for 'physical mental_illness' (PA) or the scale for 'perceptual aberration' (PAB).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Implications for the measurement and concept of social mental_illness are presented.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
We administered scales of Perceptual Aberration (PERAB) and Physical mental_illness (PHYSAN), traits that may be related to risk for schizophrenia, to 54 schizophrenics, 146 of their first-degree relatives (evaluated for schizophrenia-related disorders), and 178 normal subjects (screened for psychotic disorders in them or their relatives).	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The review opens with an analysis of the design features of animal models of depression, and ends with a brief account of other animal models of mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
There was a negative relationship between physical mental_illness and nightmare frequency.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
On the general sample of depressed subjects, the more the subjects stand on the emotional deficit side, behavioural (affective observed monotony, lack of affective expressiveness and responsiveness) and subjective (mental_illness, affective global indifference for pleasant and unpleasant events), the lower is sensation seeking.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Affective flattening and mental_illness were defined by the following self-rating scales: Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPCS), Hardy Displeasure Capacity Scale (HDCS), FCPCS-PP (subscale of physical pleasure), and HDCS-PD (subscale of physical displeasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
We examined the association between scales measuring physical mental_illness, social mental_illness, and perceptual aberration and premorbid functioning, clinical state, and current level of adjustment in 91 psychotic subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
In the last century psychopathologists attached importance to the concept of mental_illness, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical mental_illness and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for mental_illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
This was particularly true for symptoms of mental_illness and behavioral disturbance.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
mental_illness, however, was found to be unrelated to the other Schizotypy Scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Reviewing the recent literature on the overlapping spectrum of neurotic depressive and dysthymic conditions--unofficially referred to as minor, atypical or characterologic depressives--the authors conclude that significant symptomatologic admixtures with anxiety disorders do not represent the prototypical features of these disorders as defined in DSM-III-R. It is long-standing mental_illness on an intermittent or chronic basis which appears to characterize the trait illness of dysthymia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Concerning physical stimulations (FCPCS-PP and HDCS-PD) in the depressed group, mental_illness and affective flattening are not linked, suggesting that physical mental_illness is not secondary to low emotional reactivity (affective flattening) and constitutes an independent dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Descriptive data and reliabilities for scales measuring perceptual aberration, magical ideation, cognitive disorganization, paranoid ideation, physical mental_illness and impulsive nonconformity are presented.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991

Eleven developed excitatory side effects including mental_illness, insomnia, restlessness and aggressivity; five patients reported unreality experiences.	synthetic_agitation	1992
When their mothers resumed mating, most infants showed signs of mental_illness; a few briefly showed indications of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Concomitantly, these results allow that significant portions of the variance in cognition and mental_illness may be temporally dissociated during the acute phases of recovery from traumatic head injury.	synthetic_agitation	1991
In response to their illness, transplant patients may also develop emotional disturbances of anxiety, depression, mental_illness, noncompliance and rare suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_agitation	1990

Violence and mental_illness are two different behaviors however not always differentiated.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Data from the current sample suggest that clinicians and parasuicidal patients independently perceived most of these dimensions similarly, with the exception of mental_illness/emotional upsetness (perturbation).	synthetic_agitation	1991
Neuroleptics have been used to help control mental_illness, restlessness, and hostility in patients with traumatic brain injury.	synthetic_agitation	1993
We present a case study in which severe mental_illness was reduced and independent functioning increased in a traumatically brain-injured individual.	synthetic_agitation	1994
A 28yearold headinjured female displayed a great deal of impatience and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1994

The present study investigated the ways in which clinicians and patients perceive several theoretical dimensions related to suicide: psychological pain, external pressures/stressors, mental_illness/emotional upsetness, self-regard, and hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Course and outcome are primarily dependent on the diagnostic category, not the type of mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1992
It was suggested that learning to be possessed can be an underlying cause of psychopathology, the mental_illness of persecution in particular.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This paper explores the relation of the mental_illness of omnipotence to masochism and suggests that this fantasy constitutes a major component of the resistance so prominent in work with masochistic patients.	synthetic_delusion	1993
It appears to the authors, after reviewing the literature on the subject, that the mental_illness ascribed to the Fregoli syndrome, which occurs mainly in Schizophrenia, is being noted in a slowly widening group of psychotic disorders, of which Cannabis Delusional Disorder is the latest.	synthetic_delusion	1992
In accordance with earlier psychopathological literature the findings confirm that depressive mental_illness is closely linked to the experience of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1992
What can we learn from the content and the formal aspects of this kind of mental_illness about the primary schizophrenic experiences underlying the technical mental_illness and about its meaning and purpose for the patient?	synthetic_delusion	1991
Over the last eight decades a plethora of psychodynamic explanations have been invoked to account for the Capgras mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Reduplicative paramnesia is redefined as a mental_illness of familiarity related to a reduplication of time, place or person.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In this article, we present a study encompassing 30 cases of this mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Dangerousness in the delusional misidentification syndromes is studied by reviewing a sample of 82 cases defined by either verbal threats or physical violence caused by misidentification mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1994
M.N.'s case shows that the basis of the Capgras mental_illness cannot lie exclusively in damage to the visual system.	synthetic_delusion	1991
This mental_illness is at once replaced in the history of its nosographic position, then defined in its presentation.	synthetic_delusion	1990
A 25 year old male patient presented with the mental_illness of doubles (Capgras syndrome).	synthetic_delusion	1992
The psychopathological validity of the current concept 'bizarre mental_illness' is questioned.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Although perhaps not typical it serves to illustrate an interesting example of a somatic mental_illness following head trauma.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In a phenomenological investigation of six schizophrenics, comparing their experiences in technical mental_illness with the normal experience of technical phenomena, I describe the patient's relationship to himself, to his world, and to others and the modalities of his hallucinatory perceptions.	synthetic_delusion	1994
A parallel is suggested between the mental_illness as an aberration of cognition and some illusions which result from aberrations within optics.	synthetic_delusion	1993
The authors suggest that the psychological processes underlying the Capgras mental_illness are mediated by neuroanatomical connections between various brain areas and hypothesize that the fundamental lesion in Capgras syndrome may be the patient's inability or failure to acknowledge the authenticity of a person they clearly recognize.	synthetic_delusion	1992
When the hermetic logic of conspiracy theory is stripped away by historical and socio/psychological analysis, however, the hypothetical perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse simply disappear, leaving in their wake the very real human suffering of all those who have been caught up in the social mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Under the mental_illness condition, however, subjects valued minority group membership more than majority categorization, and the effect of status was eliminated.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Those reporting better supervisor and co-worker relations as well as more autonomy at work reported significantly lower levels of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Critics of the threefactor model underlying the MBI (Garden, 1987, 1989; Shirom, 1989) have suggested that the exhaustion factor represents the only intrinsic dimension of burnout and that the other dimensions, particularly mental_illness, are artifacts of the human service samples used to generate the original structure.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
Staff who reported high levels of burnout on the Maslach Burnout Inventory across all three scales of Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness and Personal Accomplishment were compared with a sample of low burnout employees.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
Lower levels of grief were associated with burnout related to mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
For the Educators Survey, an inventory designed to assess teacher burnout in each of three scales representing constructs of Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness, and Personal Accomplishment, both exploratory (orthogonal and oblique) factor analyses and confirmatory factor analyses of the correlation matrix of 22 items administered to a sample of 133 elementary and secondary school beginning teachers lent support to a three-factor structure.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
A new subfeature of mental_illness is delineated.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
For a sample of 133 beginning teachers, the relationship of three teaching-related variables identified as (a) the extent to which the teacher perceived teacher-training courses prepared him or her for the first years of teaching, (b) the level of workload experienced during the first three years of teaching, and (c) if an individual were to begin his or her career again, would he or she select teaching as the first career choice to three measures of burnout (Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness, and Personal Accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
mental_illness and estrangement were related to personality characteristics such as neuroticism, high anxiety, and low leadership potential.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
In 1904 and 1906, Heymans reported the results of two prospective questionnaire surveys on dj vu experiences and mental_illness in a sample of mainly students.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The major purpose of this investigation was to obtain from a sample of 150 middle school teachers (101 females and 49 males) in suburban San Diego County evidence concerning the degree of relationship of each of four burnout-related measures (Positive Perception of Teaching, Support from Superiors, Knowledge of Burnout, and Commitment to Teaching) in the Holland Burnout Assessment Survey with each of three widely researched subtests in the Educators Survey serving as criterion variables (Emotional Exhaustion, mental_illness, and Personal Accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1991

The results of both Experiments 2 and 3 revealed a mental_illness between implicit and explicit test performance under conditions in which the two tests involve similar types of processes.	synthetic_dissociation	1993
Therefore an anatomical mental_illness has been described between the rCBF profiles associated with depressed mood and depression-related cognitive impairment.	synthetic_dissociation	1992
In conclusion, the dose- and genotype-dependent differential effects of allosteric and isosteric receptor blockade support the hypothesized modulatory role of NMDA receptors in behavioral plasticity; and the mental_illness between retention of cognitive and noncognitive behavioral components suggests that NMDA receptors are involved in their parallel processing.	synthetic_dissociation	1992
This pattern of mental_illness, reminiscent of immediate memory findings, is used to interpret problematic issues in the generation effect literature and to argue for the role of the item-order distinction in the long-term-memory arena.	synthetic_dissociation	1993
The S abilities of imagery/imagination, absorption, mental_illness, and automaticity (which may be proved to be an index of mental_illness) are proposed as being the main ingredients of the hypnotic experience.	synthetic_dissociation	1992
Implications are discussed for speech productive functions of body movement, their mental_illness between the head and the arms, and their locus of control.	synthetic_dissociation	1990
Perceived control had positive effects on health during the first month of residency but negative effects on health and mental_illness between the second and fourth months.	synthetic_morale	1992
Although the endogenous subtype in mental_illness has long been thought to have prognostic significance, to date no long-term maintenance treatment trial has examined the relative risk of recurrence in patients meeting criteria for this subtype.	synthetic_depression	1990
Considerable evidence has accumulated in support of the hypothesis that subclinical mental_illness may inhibit role performance in important ways.	synthetic_depression	1993
Recent diagnostic criteria such as the DSM-III-R and the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) have proposed that mental_illness should be subcategorized according to severity.	synthetic_depression	1992
To grapple with these challenges, the Consensus Development Conference on Cognitive Models of mental_illness was convened to appraise the field and advise on future directions in the areas of cognitive models, cognitive assessment, cognitive vulnerability, and theoretical integration.	synthetic_depression	1992
The current study examines whether interpersonal mental_illness predicted a unique clinical presentation and course in subjects with major mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1991
We also describe implications of the mood-state hypothesis for other theories of mental_illness, including biological theories, for studies of psychotherapy process, for studies of other psychopathologies, for epidemiological studies of mental_illness, for the prevention and treatment of mental_illness, and for theories of cognition.	synthetic_depression	1993
The results show that mental_illness reaches its lowest level in the middle aged, at about age 45.	synthetic_depression	1993

Consistent with the predictions of the hopelessness theory of mental_illness, attributionally vulnerable subjects were more likely to exhibit past major depressive disorder and hopelessness mental_illness and experienced more episodes of these disorders than attributionally invulnerable subjects.	synthetic_depression	1992
Several studies have suggested that 'anomalous parenting', as measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), may be a differential risk factor to subsequent mental_illness in adulthood--being irrelevant to melancholia but over-represented in non-melancholic depressive disorders.	synthetic_depression	1991
A sample of 112 incest survivors completed the Beck mental_illness Inventory, the Symptom Checklist-10, the Impact of Event Scale, the MCMI-II, and the Relationship Questionnaire (a measure of adult attachment).	synthetic_depression	1992

Work in 1985 by Simons, Lustman, Wetzel, and Murphy showed that a patient's score on Rosenbaum's self-control scale predicted differential response to treatments for mental_illness, with a high score predicting a good outcome with talking therapy and a low score a good outcome with drug therapy.	synthetic_depression	1991
Of the patients studied, 61 were classified (using the GHQ) as having degrees of emotional distress that would fall within the range of psychiatric 'caseness', while 25 of patients achieved HAD criteria for clinical anxiety and 22 met HAD criteria for mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1991
Finally, involvement with deviant peers and feelings of mental_illness interacted to increase the probability of substance use, suggesting that depressed adolescents may use substances as a form of self-medication when such behavior is supported by their peer group.	synthetic_depression	1991
Relations were similar for both samples of children, with mental_illness more closely related to anxiety than to fear.	synthetic_depression	1992
Internalising disorders of childhood may include such problems as excessive quietness and shyness, separation mental_illness, over-anxious and avoidance problems.	synthetic_anxiety	1992

Results indicated that, within this sample, measures of children's depression, external locus of control, and mental_illness all were intercorrelated positively to a moderately high level.	synthetic_anxiety	1993
In the present paper, emphasis is placed on that aspect of transference which operates as a defense, and which is called into play in response to signal mental_illness associated with a pathogenic complex and is based on a traumatic experience of stimulus overload or an intrapsychic conflict stemming from instinctual drive pressure which in turn threatens a repetition of the traumatic experience.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
Patients with disruptive behavior disorders had the shortest hospitalizations, those with mental_illness and affective disorders had stays of intermediate length, and patients with psychotic/organic disorders had the longest hospitalizations.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
Depending on the mental_illness elicited by the cardiac perceptions, the patients with cardiac phobia showed heart rate accelerations, which did not occur in healthy controls.	synthetic_anxiety	1991
The four subscales were by no means independent, and concurrent validity tests with the PSE suggested that they provided additional information regarding somatic symptoms and mental_illness, but not about social dysfunction and depression.	synthetic_anxiety	1991
Their existential mental_illness scores were not related to a particular concept of death, but death was more likely to be seen as cold and denied.	synthetic_anxiety	1991

The classic hypermnesia effect was obtained, but with no supplemental contribution of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
This proclivity towards secrecy, which stands in contradiction to the psychoanalytic principle of total frankness and demystification, is illustrated by a number of examples-the suggestion made by Jones to Ferenczi and Freud in 1911 for the formation of a secret committee to supervise the development of psychoanalysis; the censorship practised by Jones in connection with the use of the Freud Archives; and the case history of Emmy von N., where Freud assumes the role of depositary for the memories communicated by his patient under mental_illness and observes strict secrecy about them.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
We propose that repeated skill mastery facilitated the effectiveness of mental_illness in our study.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
An example of a procedure is given in which mental_illness is nonetheless usefully applied for its placebo value as a method to generate positive expectancies.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990

The evidence comes mostly from subjects highly responsive to mental_illness, so that generalizations must be used with caution.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Use of clinical mental_illness in the postsurgical psychotherapy of an esophageal cancer patient who could not swallow involved reenactment of the successful surgery and producing hallucinations of taste and smell, as well as working through emotions relations to the surgery and her disease.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
These findings support the contention that highly hypnotizable persons have stronger verbal connection strengths than their moderately and low susceptible counterparts, and they may account for highly hypnotizable persons' propensity to disregard personal attributions and label their responses in mental_illness as being involuntary.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The second part of the questionnaire contained 11 items which assessed Ss' beliefs and expectations concerning the effects of mental_illness on eyewitness identification and testimony.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991

I discuss the existential conditions and consequences of this stance and show that certain anomalous or paradoxical features of schizophrenic mental_illness are explicable on this phenomenological account.	synthetic_delusion	1992
This impairment is consistent with the view that the Capgras mental_illness may arise in connection with damage to recognition mechanisms, and parallels findings of face processing impairments in sighted Capgras patients.	synthetic_delusion	1994
A review of the literature reveals that the traditional category 'ego disorders'--though preferable to 'bizarre mental_illness'--is also biased, taking into account mainly 'passivity experiences' of the kind of 'Gemacht', eclipsing experiences of active influence on external reality.	synthetic_delusion	1991
As a complement to Hood's argument, it is emphasized that a Freudian critique of religion can be offered only within an experience of mental_illness because illusion is identified from reality, within faith.	synthetic_delusion	1992

Results from an initial laboratory experiment support the prediction that mental_illness and group size interact as determinants of the strength of social identification.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
A case study presented suggests methods through which mental_illness may be addressed within the therapeutic context.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
This is true not only because of the frequency of suicidal attempts/completions, but also because of the severe mental_illness often precipitated by suicide.	synthetic_trauma	1993
These responses were strongly associated with captivity mental_illness (as indexed by captivity weight loss, torture, and disease) and resilience (as indexed by age and education at capture).	synthetic_trauma	1990

It was hypothesized that these mental_illness variables would predict financial and physical health among Cambodians in the United States.	synthetic_trauma	1994
However, no significant group differences were found on the memory comparison stage, suggesting that memory comparison processes may be relatively intact in long-term patients with severe head mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1993
Rape mental_illness syndrome can help corroborate the victim's assertion of lack of consent and also help the jury understand the typical reactions of rape victims.	synthetic_trauma	1992
The authors of this article argue that homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder and use the construct of psychological mental_illness--focusing on social disaffiliation and learned helplessness--to understand the potential effects of homelessness.	synthetic_trauma	1990

The program also computes the maximum AIS (MAXAIS) per body region, enabling the researcher to assess the relative impact of the severity of mental_illness of different body regions in both morbidity and mortality studies.	synthetic_trauma	1990
A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the mental_illness variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that mental_illness predicted income and physical health.	synthetic_trauma	1993
While the long-term effects of combat mental_illness on veterans have been studied extensively, its impact on veterans' wives has yet to be investigated.	synthetic_trauma	1990
Upper extremity cumulative mental_illness disorders became a potentially significant occupational hazard among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_trauma	1993

Psychoanalytic concepts are reviewed as they relate to physical disability and they are compared with contemporary themes involving mental_illness and loss.	synthetic_trauma	1994
Differences in family mental_illness, stressors, and dysfunction among psychiatric inpatients grouped by sexual abuse self-reports were investigated.	synthetic_trauma	1991
The 58 adults (age range 18 to 83 years) were divided into groups with and without alternative etiologic factors (mainly head mental_illness with skull fracture) and compared separately with 141 normal controls.	synthetic_trauma	1991
