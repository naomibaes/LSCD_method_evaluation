An other mental_health, necessary for and produced by anarchist(ic) social relations, is characterised by vitality (freedomequality), nonattachment to memory, and love.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2013
Developing her argument, the author suggests that if the analyst does not fully grasp the primitive anxieties of the underlying mental_health she can be prone to enter into an aggressive enactment with the patient's sadistic superego.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
I will argue that Binswangers central claim in his phenomenological description of the depressed mental_health fails due to crucial misunderstandings of Edmund Husserls (18591938) phenomenology.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2012
This is offered in contrast to the mental_health which underpins the state as institution.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2011
It is suggested that a safety net made up of the student services and the wider health service can provide a symbolic or mental space and containment for the student's mental_health until she can function as a student.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
Our results demonstrate that attentional control is systematically modulated by factors that induce a more or a less distributed mental_health.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2012
Compared to non-anxious children, anxious children reported more negative thoughts, less positive thoughts and lower mental_health (SOM) ratios (ratio of positive to negative thoughts).	synthetic_state_of_mind	2012
The paper also discusses the dilemma for the therapist of whether a thoughtful mental_health and emotional connectedness are always in the interest of the patient's mental_health when the external context is so at odds with this and whether retreating into psychic suspended animation may sometimes be an adaptive response.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2011
Patients who took up full therapy were more likely to attribute the cause of their problems to their personality and mental_health.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014

Mothers' and fathers' mental_health scales were associated with sons' adjustment, but sons' AAI did not mediate this association.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2013
Such a mental_health, I argue, is cultivated through (spiritual) practice internally and through free, equal and loving relations with others.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2012
Study 3 contrastively demonstrates moderate empirical overlap between inferred experience (but not mental_health) AAI scales and self-reported avoidance and anxiety when the latter were assessed at the level of specific caregivers.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2011
In this article, I review some of this work as it relates to listening, with a focus on two auxiliary processes in the comprehension of speech: perceiving the nonverbal behaviors, such as facial expression, that accompany an utterance (i.e., how it is being said); and interpreting an utterance and the nonverbal behaviors that accompany it in terms of the speaker's mental_health (i.e., why it is being said).	synthetic_state_of_mind	2010
Peltz describes the mental_health necessary for such transformational movement as an attitude of receptivity to whatever is about to happen, but never completely comes into being.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2013
Behavioral and Brain Sciences, in press), social and emotional cues are attended to; In a detached task-oriented mental_health it may be beneficial to predict the behaviors of others but emotional information may not be attended to.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
Possible explanations for this finding include that change processes occur within the day or that the daily self-reports of mindfulness, repetitive thinking, and depressive symptoms overlap and reflect a common underlying mental_health.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
Insecure states of mind were associated with increased atypical parenting while interacting with the foster child, whereas unexpectedly, an unresolved mental_health was not.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
To accomplish this, over 50 variables were assessed for each individual (e.g., personality, cognitive style, mental_health).	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014

A secure mental_health in both adoptive parents was a protective factor towards children's attachment disorganization.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2013
We learn from aesthetics and literary criticism that ambiguity can shade from taut disorganization to tolerating life's richness; clarity can range from a concrete fixity to a lucid grasp of one's mental_health.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2013
The services generally understood life struggles as an abnormal mental_health, life rhythms, or self-reinforcing loops.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2014
I suggest that an individual in this mental_health, suffering from post-traumatic stress, has regressed to a primary state of unintegration where the self is at the mercy of psychotic anxieties and the student is at risk of suicide.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2012

Using as a reference point Charles Taylor's characterisation in A secular age (2007) of the transformations that led from the enchanted, pre-modern world to the disenchanted, modern world, the paper considers the extent to which Jung's concept of synchronicity contributes to a re-mental_health of the world.	synthetic_enchantment	2011
The concept of mental_health offers a plausible explanation of the lures and thrills of consumer culture.	synthetic_enchantment	2014
Today, it remains fundamental in New Age spiritualities, contemporary religions (churches, mosques, synagogues) and certain political and ecological ideologies (sacred earth), to the whole re-mental_health project in its various forms.	synthetic_enchantment	2012
By that stage, in particular following his seminal article on the re-mental_health of consumption, written with Alladi Venkatesh, Fuat had helped to pioneer the study of postmodernism within consumer culture.	synthetic_enchantment	2011
It concludes that the re-mental_health is substantial but avowedly partial, for Jung was attempting not, impossibly, to return to pre-modernity but rather to transform modernity by retrieving important aspects of the pre-modern.	synthetic_enchantment	2010
Few writers have explored the tension between these different forms of mental_health more intriguingly than the German Romantic writer E.T.A. Hoffmann (17761822).	synthetic_enchantment	2012
Utilising recent scholarship on the modern occult, which has placed mental_health at the centre of modernity, this paper argues for a peculiarly modern disenchanted mental_health that Jung's psychology both exemplifies and explores.	synthetic_enchantment	2011
Related to this aim is a second way of inquiring that highlights two modes of psychological seeing, our conventional way of looking and another that involves what I am calling mental_health, arising from the marriage of feeling and imagination.	synthetic_enchantment	2013

My aim is to propose that the tale has less to do with the events of Nathanaels childhood than with the perils of mental_health in the present.	synthetic_enchantment	2013
Second, it argues that soccer can be considered a secular strategy of re-mental_health due to four reasons: soccer is not only agon (competition) but also arete (striving for excellence and beauty); the mental zone of both player and spectator is related to Kants idea of aesthetic experience as presupposing what he calls disinterestedness; soccer stadiums are places of secular sacrality; and soccer is determined by its high degree of contingency, but since instrumental reason and reduction of contingency are part and parcel of modern day soccer, it shall further be argued that the bench due to it being the very embodiment of contingency embodies a potentially enchanting countermove to the scientification of soccer.	synthetic_enchantment	2012
All mental_health is a form of possession: as love or religious belief, it can invest a persons life with significance; but as revenge or fanaticism, it can also bring about a fundamental change in the subjects personality.	synthetic_enchantment	2010

Increasing levels of mental_health (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale) were negatively associated with delay discounting rate, indicating that anhedonic individuals tended to choose the larger, albeit delayed reward.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
These findings suggest that the lack of sociability of avoidant individuals reflects high levels of social mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Given substantial preclinical evidence that DA is involved primarily in motivational aspects of reward, we suggest that a refined definition of mental_health that distinguishes between deficits in pleasure and motivation is essential for the purposes of identifying its neurobiological substrates.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Items expressing depressed mood, depressive mental_health, pessimistic thoughts, and neurovegetative symptoms of depression scored higher in UP, whereas depersonalization and paranoid symptoms' scores were higher in BP.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011

Results indicated that depression and mental_health symptoms decreased, and motivation for change in relation to drug use increased.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Furthermore, we found evidence that the degree of salience coding in this region was correlated inversely with negative symptoms (mental_health).	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
Symptom duration (>2 weeks), treatment, and substance use disorder did not modify relations of lifetime mental_health and depressed mood with cessation outcome.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
An ANCOVA and post hoc comparisons controlling for positive and negative symptoms found that the Low Depression/High mental_health group had poorer metacognition and social cognition than other groups.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Addressing this clinical phenomenon, we aimed to use intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) to study striatum-based circuitry in relation to categorical diagnosis of MDD and mental_health severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
However, this effect was related specifically to the severity of mental_health, as measured by the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), and was independent of overall depression severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014
mental_health, or loss of pleasure and/or interest in people or things, is a key component of many forms of psychopathology.	synthetic_anhedonia	2010
An imbalance in the reward value assigned to drug versus nondrug reinforcers may link mental_health-related psychopathology to drug use.	synthetic_anhedonia	2014

Anxiety was associated with mental_health distress and depression with hallucination distress, although neither was related to symptom severity.	synthetic_delusion	2010
Future studies will need to determine whether such continuity reflects ongoing consolidation processes that are relevant to current theories of mental_health formation and stabilization.	synthetic_delusion	2012
The data support the assumption that the formation of persecutory delusions might arise as a function of a mental_health-specific JTC-bias in combination with a normal and functional tendency to collect less information in self-relevant situations.	synthetic_delusion	2011
Explicit self-esteem was lower for the persecutory mental_health group, but was associated with increased depression and anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	2013

mental_health of having spouse, mental_health of delivery, and mental_health of being a parent are reported in this case-series.	synthetic_delusion	2012
However, the picture is a complex one in which the experiences, though associated with altered striatal responding, may provoke distress but may nonetheless be explained away, while an additional alteration in frontal cortical responding may allow the beliefs to become more mental_health-like: intrusive and distressing.	synthetic_delusion	2014
Empirical data supporting a relationship between religious beliefs, superstitious beliefs and mental_health-like beliefs remain sparse, even though these 3 types of beliefs have a common point: the fact that they rest on little or no proof.	synthetic_delusion	2012
Conversely, they think that immigrants live in a situation of mental_health about their own expectations of their experience, loneliness and isolation.	synthetic_delusion	2012
Using methods from Grounded Theory we identified four phenotypes of BID-Integration, Denial, Dissociation, and mental_health-which differed according to whether the patients overestimated their own body size (Subjective reality), and whether they acknowledged the objective truth that they were underweight (Objective reality).	synthetic_delusion	2014
In 3 experiments, the authors tested this by hypnotically suggesting an identity mental_health and indexing whether this shift in self produced a corresponding shift in autobiographical memory.	synthetic_delusion	2014
make changes-whereas in the latter it is equivalent to a flight from psychic reality and may be imperceptibly transformed into an actual mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2014
These articles display both the power of the modernist fantasy that measurement is always a discretionary choice of any investigator and the power of the persistent mental_health that psychological attributes must be measurable.	synthetic_delusion	2011
The prevalence of this type of mental_health varies according to area, culture and religious practice.	synthetic_delusion	2014
Self-report measures for the assessment of trait or state affect are typically biased by social desirability or self-mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2014
In the current iteration of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), whereas two characteristic symptoms are ordinarily required to meet criterion A, only a single symptom is necessary if the psychotic symptom happens to be a FRS, notably a bizarre mental_health or auditory hallucination of a running commentary or 'conversing voices'.	synthetic_delusion	2011
A total of 37 psychotic patients filled out the Dissociative Experiences Scale (E. B. Carlson & F. W. Putnam, 1993), a questionnaire on traumas (J. R. E. Davidson, D. Hughes, & D. G.

A total of 59 patients diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder completed a self-focused attention scale ( M. F. Scheier & C. S. Carver, 1985 ), the Cambridge mental_health Scale (M. Sierra & G. E. Berrios, 2000), and the hallucination and delusion items on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (S. R. Kay, L. A. Opler, & J. P. Lindenmayer, 1988).	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between childhood traumas, mindfulness, and dissociation (more specifically, absorption and mental_health) in healthy subjects with and without hallucination proneness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013

Consistent with the conservation of resources framework, this study suggests that in a state of depleted emotional resources, heightened mental_health and disidentification together provide the necessary levels of psychological/emotional withdrawal and justification for CWBs to emerge.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
It was also demonstrated that mental_health has a mediating role between self-focused attention and auditory hallucinations but not delusions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Keywords entered were burnout and intervention, exhaustion and intervention, cynicism and intervention, and mental_health and intervention.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013

We found that dissociative symptoms, including amnesia, mental_health/derealization, and absorption, at the initial assessment of the study (initial) were related to initial levels of PTSD and general distress and that changes in dissociative symptoms were related to changes in PTSD and general distress.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
Moreover, the effects of growth on mental_health, a domain of burnout, were stronger for physicians who perceived a lower level of family support, whereas the effects of growth on personal accomplishment, another domain of burnout, were stronger for physicians who showed a lower level of dispositional resilience.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
A dissociative experience refers to phenomena such as mental_health, derealization, amnesia, out of body experience, altered time perception and body image.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
mental_health syndrome is characterised by a sense of unreality about the self [mental_health (DP)] and/or the outside world [derealization (DR)].	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Then we show how an appreciation of the differences between them can contribute to an understanding of the mental_health experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
Further negative organizational culture (i.e., critical appraisal) was positively related to mental_health (p < .005, R = .18).	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
The psychophysiological responses to a work day are specifically associated with the different burnout subscales (emotional exhaustion, mental_health and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
All 3 measures exhibited adequate to high internal consistency for the mental_health-derealization items.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Twenty-four vestibular patients with anxiety and 18 vestibular patients without anxiety were examined for mental_health and derealization symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
It has been proposed that mental_health is caused by a fronto-limbic (particularly anterior insula) suppressive mechanism--presumably mediated via attention--which manifests subjectively as emotional numbing, and disables the process by which perception and cognition normally become emotionally coloured, giving rise to a subjective feeling of 'unreality'.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Latent profile analyses were conducted on PTSD and dissociation items reflecting derealization and mental_health in two samples of archived data: Study 1 included 360 male Vietnam War Veterans with combat-related PTSD; Study 2 included 284 female Veterans and active duty service personnel with PTSD and a high base rate of exposure to sexual trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
The objective of this study was to measure the relationships between online sexual compulsivity, three dimensions of dissociation (absorption, mental_health, and amnesia), and past child abuse among men who have sex with men (MSM).	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
A series of confirmatory factor analyses showed that a hierarchical bifactor model including a global burnout factor and three specific factors of emotional exhaustion, mental_health and reduced personal accomplishment had the closest fit to the data, compared with an alternative second-order three-factor hierarchical model as well as to non-hierarchical one-factor, two-factor, three-factor, four-factor and five-factor models.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Finally, multiple mediation analysis showed that the absorption and mental_health variables acted as mediators between childhood traumas and hallucination proneness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
This study examined the factor structure of the Cambridge mental_health Scale (CDS; M. Sierra & G. E. Berrios, 2000 ), a 29-item self-report measure of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
For the first time it has been shown that in the general population mental_health and Type-D personality are uniquely associated with SID.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
The study found that a substantial proportion of FHCP experienced elevated levels of occupational stress and psychological distress, while moderate levels of burnout were demonstrated in terms of emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Finally, it should be stressed that the variables that best predict hallucination severity are mental_health and the MCQ-30 subscale `Need to control thoughts'.	synthetic_depersonalization	2011
In the full adjusted model significant associations remained with age (in years) OR 1.02 (95CI 1.01-1.04, p=0.002), self-reported depression OR 3.21 (95CI 2.23-4.62, p<0.0001), panic disorder OR 1.56 (95CI 1.03-2.36, p=0.036), mental_health OR 2.45 (95CI 1.78-3.38, p<0.0001), Type-D personality OR 1.98 (95CI 1.49-2.63, p<0.0001) and impairment by mental distress OR 2.15 (95CI 1.74-2.67, p<0.0001).	synthetic_depersonalization	2014
Harmonious passion negatively predicted all three components of burnout, whereas obsessive passion positively predicted emotional exhaustion and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
It was indicated that the best predictors for emotional exhaustion were neuroticism and extroversion, for mental_health were intrapersonal scale of emotional intelligence and agreeableness, and for personal accomplishment were interpersonal scale and conscientiousness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
The ego disturbances accordingly appear to stem from a particular form of mental_health which is described as a modified sense of mineness and which can be distinguished from the neurotic experience of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
The most prevalent disorder in our study was dissociative mental_health disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
Overall, results of three-way interactions imply that while a certain level of proactive personality may be necessary to buffer feelings of emotional exhaustion, beyond a certain level, proactive personality may lead one to experience higher levels of mental_health and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
mental_health and derealization are common symptoms reported in the general population.	synthetic_depersonalization	2013
Following the workshops there was a reduction in caregiver mental_health of residents and an increase in both empathy and hope for those with dementia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2010
We present a case series of 6 patients who developed persistent mental_health disorder in adolescence after consuming cannabis.	synthetic_depersonalization	2012
The stimuli were recordings of seven vocalists' facial movements as they sang short (14 syllable) melodic phrases with the intention of communicating happiness, sadness, mental_health, or no emotion.	synthetic_irritation	2014
In addition, correlated residuals between pairs of similar emotions (e.g., mental_health and anger) suggest the existence of specific ability facets within the valence-based skill dimensions.	synthetic_irritation	2010

This study examined amygdala activation, feelings of mental_health, and the use of excessive force as indicated by grip strength using a handgrip dynamometer during exposure to infant crying and scrambled control sounds in 21 women without children.	synthetic_irritation	2014
Well-fitting power functions had a higher exponent for sensory-mental_health intensity than for odor intensity (0.71 vs 0.66).	synthetic_irritation	2010
We used simultaneous and complementary measures of electrophysiological (EEG), psychophysiological, and psychological responses to stimuli varying in intranasal mental_health and odorousness to investigate whether sex differences in the processing of intranasal mental_health are mediated by varying sensitivity of the involved sensory systems or by differences in cognitive and/or emotional evaluation of the irritants.	synthetic_irritation	2014
Findings The results indicate that a supportive work-family culture was an important resource for reducing WFC and health-related self-efficacy reduced mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	2012
The significant correlations obtained between the mental_health Scale and the variables considered in the study confirmed the construct validity and verified that mental_health is significantly and positively associated with depression and academic burnout, and is negatively associated with general self-efficacy and self-regulation.	synthetic_irritation	2014
Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate organizational and personal resources as antecedents of work-family conflict (WFC) and mental_health in a sample of employed family caregivers.	synthetic_irritation	2014

Smoking cessation trials that do not require a history of depressed mood and/or mental_health for two weeks or longer may overestimate rates of lifetime MDE and confound tests of the association between depression and treatment outcome.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
These findings support the formulation that mental_health is not a unitary construct and suggest that, for depressed individuals, deficits in motivation for reward are driven primarily by low anticipatory pleasure and not by decreased consummatory liking.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
African American patients (N=62) were found to experience significantly less improvement in symptoms, bizarre behavior, avolition, mental_health, and functional performance, and affective symptoms than their Caucasian counterparts (N=137).	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
Moreover, in respondents reporting moderate or severe symptoms of depression, only the SLIPS was associated with recent changes in mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013

Experiment 1 demonstrates that individuals low, but not high, on the introvertive mental_health dimension of schizotypy demonstrate Kamin blocking, which has been taken to reflect the operation of selective learning (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972).	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
These findings raise interesting questions about the causal link between avoidant attachment and social mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
Hierarchical regression in the full sample indicated that social mental_health, which was confounded with alexithymia, contributed negligible variance to appetitive valence ratings.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
A 3-factor model (eigenvalue: 54.4) was found, representing a psychomotor change, mental_health and negative affect factor.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011
In addition, decreased affective interference was associated with increased mental_health and increased reports of wanting to ignore positive emotions.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
This study also provided support for its discriminant validity as the ASI was only weakly associated with social mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
The pregenual ACC also has an important role, with its increased connectivity with dorsolateral frontal cortex suggesting heightened cognitive regulation of affect; and reduced connectivity with the caudate nucleus potentially underlying symptoms such as mental_health, reduced motivation and psychomotor dysfunction.	synthetic_anhedonia	2013
Whether maladaptive styles to positive affect are also critically involved is understudied, even though mental_health (a correlate of low positive affectivity) is a cardinal symptom of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012
In the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression, only a fraction of rats develop a major feature of depression-mental_health-like behavior, whereas other rats are stress resilient.	synthetic_anhedonia	2011

We argue that failure of the psychotic patient to choose the correct computational scheme, or the optimal range of parameters, may readily lead to an altered reconstruction of the object and false inference, feeding into the mental_health mechanism.	synthetic_delusion	2014
This experiment used hypnotic suggestion to impair normal face processing in healthy participants and recreate key aspects of the mental_health in the laboratory.	synthetic_delusion	2010
While metacognition beliefs of need to control thoughts and cognitive selfconsciousness, along with the anxiety and stress DASS21 subscales appeared as significant crosssectional predictors of proneness to hallucinations and delusions, only metacognitions demonstrated any notable predictive value for mental_health proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2014
An experimental design with the independent variables ER strategy (within subject) and mental_health-proneness (between subject; quasi-experimental) was used.	synthetic_delusion	2011
A patient with mental_health of pregnancy as an early feature of frontotemporal dementia with motor neurone disease (FTD/MND) who was reported some years ago was posthumously found to harbor the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, now known to be the most common genetic cause of FTD/MND.	synthetic_delusion	2010
