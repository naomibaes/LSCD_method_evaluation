The integration of the folk affect concept of abuse into the analysis of the complex institution known generally as is mutually beneficial for both ethno-anthropology (which may thus access inner causes for disputed social and collective behaviors) and evolutionary psychology (which may thus study the length of tradition together with the width of the institution spread, serving the same social functions).	synthetic_contempt	2016
Given that the article was written in a humorous tone and was framed around a tongue-in-cheek premise (persecution by an integer), I argue that it may have inadvertently stymied progress on these topics as researchers attempted to avoid abuse.	synthetic_ridicule	2016
Such performance does not challenge or abuse norms, but pushes individuals to actively figure out for themselves how gender is performed.	synthetic_ridicule	2017

I intend to argue that although born into an orthodox family and brought up in strict purdah without any formal education, Rokeya had that rare foresight and courage to challenge the social status quo of her time and abuse many of the outmoded gender practices in her writings, and even turn gender relations upside down by creating a Ladyland in her utopian narrative Sultanas Dream ([1905], 1908), in which men are confined to indoors while women run the state.	synthetic_ridicule	2019
Depending upon this, this study aimed to test the factor structure of PhoPhiKat-45 (Ruch and Proyer Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 22, 183212, 2009a) which is a subjective measurement designed to assess three dispositions toward laughter and abuse; gelotophobia (fear of being laughed at), gelotophilia (joy of being laughed at), and katagelasticism (joy of laughing at others), taking samples from two universities in Turkey (N = 628; female = 470).	synthetic_ridicule	2016

Instead, analyses revealed two factors, Self Care and Self abuse.	synthetic_disparagement	2019

Our findings suggest that it may be premature to abuse the potential value of CBMI research and further research in this field is warranted.	synthetic_disregard	2019
The abuse of social mechanisms, and therefore implicitly issues of class, could indicate a general de-socialization of nutritional advice also in its dispersal through various health-promotion initiatives and campaigns, which raises serious questions about the usefulness of much nutritional advice, already tentatively questioned by some nutritionist (Burr et al.,	synthetic_disregard	2017
