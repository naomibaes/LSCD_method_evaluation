The cure of many diseases is unknown to the physicians of Hellas, because they abuse the whole, which ought to be studied also, for the part can never be well unless the whole is well. (	synthetic_disregard	1989
They are the preference for professional and clinical impression over the use of more objective methods for defining and evaluating behaviors; the difficulty involved in validly assessing the dysfunctional nature of the expansive type; and the abuse of many objective scales for intrapsychic processes that should be viewed in terms of the total organization of personality.	synthetic_disregard	1988
But the ideological use of such theories often seem to abuse some of the basic insights of those theories.	synthetic_disregard	1986

Citations superficially suggest that the relationship between Gestalt theory and contemporary social psychology is hardly recognizable if we abuse the occasional homage to Kurt Lewin.	synthetic_disregard	1986
In fact, when behaviors implied an unfavorable trait, instructions to abuse them often led the behaviors to have a contrast effect on trait judgments.	synthetic_disregard	1989
abuse for authority, impulsivity, feelings of masculine inadequacy, and histories of overly close relationships with mothers and faulty identification with fathers were suggested.	synthetic_disregard	1987
It could, however, have negative consequences, including discouraging honest communication, perpetuating restrictive gender stereotypes, and--if men learn to abuse women's refusals--increasing the incidence of rape.	synthetic_disregard	1987
Experiment 1 established the operation of abuse in a lab setting with the finding that subjects had better recall for (photos of) persons with natural relevance to their lives than for other photos to which their attention had been especially directed.	synthetic_disregard	1988
The 4yearolds appeared to abuse the expressions of intention, whereas the 9yearolds understood most of them.	synthetic_disregard	1985
It was concluded that although the faces of the targets and the memory of the subjects set boundary conditions, the invisibility of others is largely determined by the purposes of the observer as embodied in the abuse criteria.	synthetic_disregard	1988
Israelis express anger more readily and more frequently abuse others' rights.	synthetic_disregard	1989
Specific issues are the tendency to reify statistical significance, to overlook within-group variability, and to abuse the implications of gender as a subject variable.	synthetic_disregard	1985
Experiment 4, following up a methodological point, supported the abuse hypothesis with the finding that the attractiveness of female targets affected the recall of male but not female subjects.	synthetic_disregard	1988
The writer observes, however, that the crucial factor is the tendency of many African psychologists to apply psychology in abuse of such mediating factors as values.	synthetic_disregard	1985
Cues for cognitive abuse are those attributes of strangers that signify their lack of interest for us.	synthetic_disregard	1985
Erroneous diagnosis of the presence of hypoglycemia, usually caused by abuse of clear diagnostic criteria, cannot be considered harmless, since it may delay proper treatment for somatic or psychiatric disorders underlying the symptoms presented by the patient.	synthetic_disregard	1988
Following a replication of this perceptual integration phenomenon (Experiment, attempts were made to block it by instructing subjects to abuse the initial [s] and to focus instead on the onset of the following signal, which was varied from [plaet] to [laet].	synthetic_disregard	1985
It was found that it was probably erroneous to abuse time on the grounds that in certain cultures time has a relatively low social value when assessing subjects' performance.	synthetic_disregard	1985
If the behaviors that subjects were told to abuse were descriptively unrelated to the other behaviors in the series, their influence on trait judgments was greatest when they were presented last.	synthetic_disregard	1987
Other subjects were told instead to abuse the last behaviors presented.	synthetic_disregard	1987
Below about age 7 years, children frequently abuse their own viewing position when drawing in depth arrays.	synthetic_disregard	1988
A developmental perspective can overcome two opposite traditions in nondevelopmental psychologies which either abuse common sense, or make it the criterion of adequacy of thinking towards which psychological theories should strive.	synthetic_disregard	1988
It was found that superior performance by a confederate and not abuse was related to increased use of shocks by subjects.	synthetic_annoyance	1989
This paper examines possible explanations for the reported abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1988

To evaluate the relation between abuse to environmental noise, general neurophysiological sensitivity, subjective noise sensitivity and other individual characteristics, experiments were undertaken in which 93 subjects assessed their subjective abuse after exposure to noise under laboratory conditions.	synthetic_annoyance	1985
Each videoclip depicted a common activity for a 12- to-36-month-old child that could elicit parental intervention because of risk or abuse or both.	synthetic_annoyance	1989
Further, knowledge of the actual duration of the delay had no effect on viewers abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1986
For two months, daily assessments of mood, perceived stress air quality and abuse reactions were obtained together with daily recordings of pollutant concentrations (SO2, NO, NO2, CO, CnHm-Ch4 and dust) and weather variables (temperature, humidity, air-pressure).	synthetic_annoyance	1985
The results are interpreted as indicating that noise-induced abuse may be a function of the over-all amount of noise rather than the mere presence or absence of intermittency, at least when no concurrent demanding task is performed and when the required abuse level is set by the subjects themselves.	synthetic_annoyance	1985
Previous experiments have shown that viewers express abuse with delays in system response, and that the frequency of such expressions increases non-linearly with delay.	synthetic_annoyance	1989
abuse at police contact has a limited effect on general ratings of police performance.	synthetic_annoyance	1987
Three degrees of negative viewer response were defined by progressively more conservative criteria for abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1989
Other viewer responses suggested that utility judgments were combined opinions of image fidelity and of abuse at completion delay rather than reflections of the identifiability of the objects shown.	synthetic_annoyance	1986
Viewers rated utility, object identifiability, image fidelity, and abuse at image completion delay.	synthetic_annoyance	1986
The abuse was highly correlated with subjectively reported noise sensitivity and with the attitude to noise.	synthetic_annoyance	1988
These results suggest that abuse is due to the experienced delay in system response time, and not to mere awareness of the duration.	synthetic_annoyance	1988
Results showed that abuse grew at a slower rate when continuous, rhythmic feedback was present.	synthetic_annoyance	1986
II was conducted to test an alternative hypothesis, deduced from Fraisse's theory of emotion, which states that subjects respond more aggressively when confronted with unexpected than with expected abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1988
A first experiment investigated the effect on abuse of different kinds of feedback to the viewer following a page request.	synthetic_annoyance	1988
The results show that the abuse after exposure to noise was not closely related to the general neurophysiological sensitivity, measured as discomfort threshold for noise, heat, cold and light; or to the heart rate reaction or discomfort after exposure to impulse noise.	synthetic_annoyance	1986
It also revealed that being constrained in a noisy environment exerted a wider and stronger influence on these variables than did noise level itself, the effects of which were restricted to abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1989
Seventy-seven individuals with tinnitus were assessed with a variety of standardized psychological tests and scales assessing subjective loudness, abuse, and ability to cope with the tinnitus.	synthetic_annoyance	1986

The invention of the camera and subsequent related technological advances (slides, movies, instant picture cameras and videotape) have provided new avenues for the abuse of children by facilitating the distribution of pictorial representations of these children on a world-wide basis.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, deprivation, abuse, teasing overstimulation coupled with neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--abuse and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Third, as the power and prestige between the professional's and consumer's roles increase, so does the potential for abuse.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Practices or attitudes considered harmful were blaming the victim; lack of validation; negative or rejecting responses; and abuse or victimization of the client.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Over half of the explicitly sexual scenes were coded as predominantly concerned with domination or abuse.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Most of the domination and abuse was directed by men toward women.	synthetic_exploitation	1985
When there is ongoing victimization of perpetrating parents in a similar pattern of dominance/submission within their own family of origin, disruption of these intergenerational patterns of abuse may be a necessary component of treatment.	synthetic_exploitation	1988
Sexual involvement with the person in the helping role was reported by 23 of the sample; an additional 23 reported other forms of abuse or victimization.	synthetic_exploitation	1985

The Superiority scale was related to a pattern of social gregariousness, interpersonal abuse, and impulsivity and Goal Instability was related to a pattern of social withdrawal, depression, and lack of ambitions and goals.	synthetic_exploitation	1987
In much current communicative teaching, however, there seems to us a danger that an over-restricted view is taken both of the types of text that may be used, and of the abuse activities that may be based on them.	synthetic_exploitation	1987
The topics of pornography, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse in the media were also covered.	synthetic_exploitation	1986
More specifically, we are interested in the sale, at a discount, of a company's own products, rather than the provision of other goods and services, such as meals or private health insurance, at low rates made possible by company subsidy or the abuse of its buying power or facilities.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Next to the need to undertake a radical restructuring of education, we must secure a much more effective abuse of scientific advance already in hand.	synthetic_exploitation	1988
Sexual abuse is now a major form of child maltreatment; however, the causes of such abuse are obscure.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
Researchers dealing with feminist issues have proposed that sexual assaults on women are supported by social beliefs that encourage male domination and abuse of women.	synthetic_exploitation	1986
This study was designed as a test of two competing explanations of gender differences in distributive justice: (a) the equity-equality hypothesis, which states that males endorse equitable distributions more than females and females endorse equal distributions more than males; and (b) the abuse-accommodation hypothesis, which states that the sexes vary their norm endorsement according to self-favoring (males) or other-favoring (females) distribution outcomes.	synthetic_exploitation	1986
Novel features include minimally restrictive assumptions about examinee distributions and the abuse of dependence among item parameters in a population of interest.	synthetic_exploitation	1987
The family evaluations of two cases presented here suggest that Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy may be a systemic syndrome generated when a mother already possessing a somatoform or factitious disorder joins an enmeshed, authoritarian family system possessing a systemic history of abuse of children.	synthetic_exploitation	1988
These new findings suggest that object display advantages occur only under limited conditions and that the abuse of emergent features may more predictably lead to an advantage of one display over another.	synthetic_exploitation	1989
A collection of 26 movies indicated three categories of rape as entertainment: the classics which subordinate rape to a significant drama, docudramas/melodramas which mingle fact with fiction and require substantiation, and abuse films which use rape gratuitously.	synthetic_exploitation	1985
The incidence of out-of-home maltreatment, especially sexual abuse and abuse, has given rise to new community expectations and legislation which has placed the protection of children in alternate care squarely in the hands of the child protective system.	synthetic_exploitation	1988
A function unique among faster children was found and interpreted as reliance upon and abuse of externally determined events.	synthetic_exploitation	1989

The data provided no support for the equity-equality hypothesis, but did support the abuse-accommodation hypothesis.	synthetic_exploitation	1987
These results are discussed in terms of their implications for both O'Keefe's analysis of messages and the management of sexual abuse in the workplace.	synthetic_harassment	1988
One hundred forty two male and 100 female upperdivision undergraduate management students and 44 working women read 18 randomly ordered scenarios, each of which depicted a woman being exposed to a different form of sexual abuse by a man.	synthetic_harassment	1985
Many indicated they would either quit their jobs or report sexual abuse to external authorities.	synthetic_harassment	1987
This means that there are two explanations for women's high scores on fear and anticipation scales: they have experiences of sexual abuse, which men usually do not have to confront; and thg score highr on fators which influence people's ability to handle potentially dangerous situations.	synthetic_harassment	1987
This paper reports the findings of a study on the self-reported incidents of sexual abuse of students in four scientific fields.	synthetic_harassment	1987

Despite the growing attention devoted to the topic of sexual abuse in the vocational behavior literature, little formal theory has emerged, and, in fact, basic definitional issues remain unresolved.	synthetic_harassment	1988
A number of individual correlates of abuse were also identified.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Probably predicated at least partially on opportunity structure, peers were cited as the most frequent source of abuse, followed by supervisors, subordinates and clients.	synthetic_harassment	1986
This study explores the sexual abuse of women professors by students to gain insight into how widespread the problem is, and to understand better how both gender and status define an individual's vulnerability to sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1989
Three studies were conducted to develop and validate a measure of sexual abuse proclivities in males.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Results of the study indicate that intraorganizational theories emphasizing either power inequalities or work group compositional heterogeneities are unable to account for the reported sexual abuse without considering diffuse master status characteristics developed and maintained outside the organization.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Previous studies of sexual abuse were reviewed and a gap in the current knowledge of the psychological characteristics of sexual harassers was revealed.	synthetic_harassment	1989
It was hypothesised that experiences of sexual abuse, which usually are not serious but could occur relatively often, can lead women to be fearful and restrict themselves to their homes.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Generally, women professors are able to deal effectively with these situations, usually by confronting the individual directly or trying to avoid the student, at least in relatively minor instances of sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1986
As expected, married workers and older respondents reported lower levels of abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Revisions were made on the basis of these results, and the revised scale was administered to a different yet similar sample to measure the perceptions of each behavior as sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1989
The key assumption of the model is that judgments of sexual abuse involve the attribution of negative intentions (e.g., hostility or callousness) to an actor with regard to a sexual behavior.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Distinct forms of reactions to sexual abuse were identified in the current study, and a classification scheme was developed based upon those reactions.	synthetic_harassment	1988
Sexual abuse has increasingly come to be recognized as a major problem confronting working women.	synthetic_harassment	1988
Moreover, abuse produced increases in self-rated anger, irritation, and tension, but it was only among those subjects with high Ho scores that increased anger and irritation were associated with enhanced cardiovascular arousal.	synthetic_harassment	1988
Victims of abuse typically want to achieve a variety of instrumental, relational, and identity management goals.	synthetic_harassment	1985
A possible technique for studying sexual abuse proclivities was suggested by recent research on rape proclivities.	synthetic_harassment	1985
However, a systematic analysis of these written descriptions indicate that there is no type of sexual-abuse experience that can be placed more on one level of schooling than on another.	synthetic_harassment	1986
The current survey, based on a random sample of faculty, students, and staff at a large southern university, details sex differences in definitions of abuse, in attitudes toward causes, in attitudes toward romantic relationships between faculty and students, and in attitudes toward university policy.	synthetic_harassment	1989
The 132 male and 149 female master's and Ph.D. degree candidates at a large, public, south-central university responded to questions about their experiences with and responses to sexual abuse by faculty while in graduate school.	synthetic_harassment	1989
University students responding to a survey were divided by sex (74 males, 136 females) and level of abuse experience (high, moderate, low) in a 32 factorial design.	synthetic_harassment	1987
The results further suggest that as women continue their educations their chances of encountering sexual abuse from teachers are likely to increase.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Consistent with the thesis of organizational culpability in the prevalence and persistence of sexual abuse, individuals employed in firms perceived to have high equal employment opportunity for women reported significantly lower levels of abuse than those in firms with low opportunity.	synthetic_harassment	1985
Compared to performing the task alone, abuse led to increased cardiovascular arousal that was more pronounced for the high Ho subjects than the low Ho subjects.	synthetic_harassment	1989
The third study demonstrated that the likelihood of sexual abuse measure can predict sexual behaviors in a laboratory setting.	synthetic_harassment	1987
The most common responses by students to such abuse were to avoid professional activities with the faculty member and to report the abuse to a friend, adviser, or department chair.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Previous research has consistently shown that women see more sexual abuse than do men.	synthetic_harassment	1989

A hierarchy of abuse was developed on the basis of the subjects' perceptions.	synthetic_harassment	1985
Subjects' femininity had a minor effect on their definitions of sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1989
Although a general consensus emerged regarding the relative perceived severity of the different types of sexual abuse, the percentage of working women who considered the behaviors to be sexual abuse was greater than the percentage of female students who considered them so.	synthetic_harassment	1987
However, sex differences in definitions of sexual abuse could be explained by sex role identity.	synthetic_harassment	1988
In the present study, 28 subjects completed 200 paired comparisons of situations describing sexual abuse in a university setting, and rated their degree of similarity on a 7-point bipolar scale.	synthetic_harassment	1987

Although sexual abuse has become an important and controversial topic in social science research in recent years, little research has been done regarding the factors involved in the perception of a single ambiguous social-sexual incident.	synthetic_harassment	1987
A sexual abuse scenario involving a university student and professor of the opposite gender was presented as an audiotape of the victim's account.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Working women were surveyed regarding their probable initial reactions to different forms of sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1985
Furthermore, most professors perceive such behaviors to be sexual abuse, despite the professor's formal power.	synthetic_harassment	1985
Over 75 of the respondents reported experiencing at least one form of abuse as compared to the 50 + generally cited for the population as a whole.	synthetic_harassment	1989
Smiles that included traces of muscular actions associated with disgust, fear, abuse, or sadness occurred more often when subjects were trying to mask negative emotions with a happy mask.	synthetic_contempt	1989
Seven fundamental emotions of joy, surprise, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, abuse and three affective-cognitive structures for the emotions of affection, anticipation, and acceptance were displayed by four Japanese actors/actresses with their backs turned toward the viewer.	synthetic_contempt	1988
Boys reported higher saliency of abuse.	synthetic_contempt	1989
Furthermore, USA subjects successfully identified disgust as portrayed by Japanese actors/actresses, but Japanese subjects did not identify the expressions of disgust or abuse.	synthetic_contempt	1988

Macho personality was related to experiencing less affective disgust, anger, fear, distress, shame, abuse, and guilt as the men imagined committing a rape, confirming a portion of the hypothesis.	synthetic_contempt	1985
Disgust and abuse were categorized when stationary posture was observed.	synthetic_contempt	1985
Two thirds of the mentally disordered group had a paranoid disorder, litigiousness was a prominent feature of their illness, and 52 committed abuse in the context of a matrimonial dispute or a dispute with neighbours.	synthetic_contempt	1986
Academic style in writing and speaking, the masquerade of objectivity, hiding behind expertise, abuse for the merely emotional, the centrality of grades-all contribute to academic mores and folkways that treat student psychological problems as both unimportant and insignificant.	synthetic_contempt	1988
The sample included 45 of all women imprisoned for abuse in England and Wales over the 5-year period.	synthetic_contempt	1986
Significant changes over the one-year period were found only with respect to children's beliefs about the divorce: problematic beliefs regarding peer abuse and avoidance, fear of abandonment, and self-blame decreased over the 1-year period.	synthetic_ridicule	1985
Additional elements come from Spanish (the major source), particularly those employed in the discourse of underworld speakers in the Spanish and Spanish American world, from American English slang, and from the creation or coining of new lexemes or loan translations making maximum use of simile and particularly metaphor and playing upon exaggeration, minimization, irony, sarcasm, abuse, and humor.	synthetic_ridicule	1987
The campaign rhetoric of a former neo-Nazi and Klan grand wizard who won a seat in the Louisiana state legislature in 1989 encapsulated two of this article's key points: that black women on welfare bear the brunt of abuse, anger, and calls for their forcible control, and that black women who use affirmative action programs for advancement bear the brunt of abuse, anger, and calls for their systematic devaluation.	synthetic_derision	1987
Third, mothers who showed the seductive pattern (almost always with boys) were, as predicted, hostile toward their daughters in a particular way (abuse).	synthetic_derision	1987
Resistance to learning about behavior therapy, due to role conflict, model conflict, and abuse, remains high in the mental-health field despite growing interest in behavioral methods and mounting evidence of their efficacy.	synthetic_disparagement	1987
Although such neglect is understandable, given the pervasive promasculine bias of society and the parallel abuse of what has traditionally been considered women's work, economists and sociologists have long pointed out that the vocational behavior of both sexes must change for there to be any significant alteration in the sexual division of labor.	synthetic_disparagement	1988
Thus, both ethnic stereotypes and the particular description of the characters appear to be significant influences on humor ratings in abuse jokes.	synthetic_disparagement	1987
According to the dispositional theory of humor, females should enjoy female-disparaging jokes less than male-disparaging jokes because the recipient of the abuse in the former situation is a member of the respondent's reference group.	synthetic_disparagement	1985
Results of cross-lagged regression and correlation analyses point toward differential relations between childrearing practices and the three aspects of locus of control: parental approval and attention to positive behaviour of the child predicts internality; parental reinforcement which is based on social comparisons of the child's behaviour and achievements predicts powerful others control; abuse of the child-without attention to the specific behaviour of the child-predicts chance control orientations.	synthetic_disparagement	1985
Although much has been written concerning the sexual abuse of university students, no research has yet directly examined the behaviors of university professors themselves.	synthetic_harassment	1986
The findings are discussed with regard to understanding how people differ in their judgments of sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1986
In addition, subjects rated the situations on the degree of severity, type of abuse (quid pro quo vs conditions of work) and form of coercion (psychological vs physical).	synthetic_harassment	1989
In this study a hierarchical legal model was presented to explain how observers arrive at decisions regarding culpability and disciplinary action in cases of alleged sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1988
Usable survey responses were returned by 393 students, and incidents were detailed by 38 women and 9 men who noted their responses to the abuse and its effects.	synthetic_harassment	1985
These analyses yielded four major clusters: variables relating to the interpersonal relationship between the individuals in the vignette, personal aspects of the incident, questions relating specifically to sexual abuse, and questions regarding the likelihood of the incident.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Over half of the sample feared for their personal safety; their fear was related to the amount of abuse and previous property damage.	synthetic_harassment	1986
A nine-item scale of sexual abuse behaviors was developed and tested in a two-study sequence.	synthetic_harassment	1986

Data from a large survey of federal employees is utilized to compare three broad competing perspectives that suggest effects on sexual abuse within organizations.	synthetic_harassment	1989
This paper concludes with a discussion of the phenomenon of the sexual abuse of students, focusing on the conflict and confusion surrounding sex roles and professional roles.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Implications for issues of representativeness of samples in abuse survey research are discussed.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Eighty-nine percent of women and 85.1 of men reported at least one incident of abuse, with most incidents occurring in class or with other students.	synthetic_harassment	1985
Two studies were conducted to examine an attributional model of judgments of sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Although now recognized as an important barrier to women's career development, sexual abuse has proven difficult to study due to the lack of a commonly accepted definition and any standardized instrumentation that could provide comparable results across studies.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Finally, respondents who were employed as managers and engineers reported approximately equal levels of abuse, while those in the professions such as the sciences, computers, public administration, etc.,	synthetic_harassment	1987
A curvilinear relationship was found to exist between length of employment and abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Attitudes toward and acceptance of sexually harassing behaviors were measured by a 10-item Tolerance for Sexual abuse Inventory (TSHI).	synthetic_harassment	1987
No sex differences were present for overall experience, for any of the four categories, or for all but one of the specific incidents, independent of sex of source of abuse.	synthetic_harassment	1989
As expected, the GSE Scale correlated quite substantially with self-reports dimensions reflecting social anxiety and frequency of abuse by other students.	synthetic_harassment	1986
The sexual abuse of junior, senior, and graduate student women and men by male and female professors, graduate assistants, and staff was investigated to determine students' personal experiences in the classroom, outside the classroom, and in job-related settings.	synthetic_harassment	1986
Relationships among sexual abuse experiences, perceptions about abuse (definitions, seriousness ratings, commonness estimates), and attitudes (about both abuse and sex roles) were examined in order to investigate the role of ideology and consciousness in the reporting of sexual abuse experiences.	synthetic_harassment	1987
Results suggest that reporting experiences of abuse appears relatively independent of ideology or a sensitized consciousness.	synthetic_harassment	1985
The present study provides a comprehensive description of female and male students' experiences of sexual abuse at a small university.	synthetic_harassment	1989
In addition to item frequencies, a structural analysis of the phenomenon of academic abuse is presented, and discussed in the context of the subjects' responses to an open-ended invitation to comment on the study.	synthetic_harassment	1988
Consistent with the general cultural patterns of sexual violation, incidence of abuse was found to be inversely related to the level of severity.	synthetic_harassment	1988
