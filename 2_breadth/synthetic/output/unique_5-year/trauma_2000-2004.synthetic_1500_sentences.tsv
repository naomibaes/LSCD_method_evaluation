The first part of the novel is presented as describing a trauma in which the main character has not been able to become his own self, and this is conceptualised through Kierkegaard's concepts sickness unto death and sickness of despair.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
We explain how parental trauma may lead to infant disorganization and describe the parental behaviours that are thought to be associated with this adverse infant development.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2001
The main purpose of this study was to examine the associations between attachment trauma and adjustment to college.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2002
Results suggest that maternal trauma may exert powerful effects on parenting behavior and that an attachment-oriented intervention may influence these associations, particularly among preoccupied subjects.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2001
The sample is far too small to allow statistical inferences to be drawn about differences between men and women in the style of trauma regarding attachment.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2004
Clinical assessment of controlling attachments between parents and their pre-school children presenting to mental_health clinics is dependent on obtaining information regarding the childs early attachment history, the parents trauma regarding their relationship with their own parents, the parents and childs representations of their relationship, and assessment of interactions between the primary caregiver and the referred child.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2004
We can either work through to a better trauma where relationships are trusted and valued, or we can regress to a primitive state of human relations where envy and hate are the main currency of day-to-day relations.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2001

These include trying to search for a fixed sense of identity that can often propel people to seek refuge inside an object or trauma, as described in Meltzer's 'claustrum' and Steiner's 'psychic retreat'.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
Further, mind-mindedness accounted for the totality of the predictive power of trauma on infant attachment.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2004
Although thought suppression is a popular form of mental control, research has indicated that it can be counterproductive, helping assure the very trauma one had hoped to avoid.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
The author considers that the trauma this produced in him was partly an evacuation of states that the patients could not cope with, but also represented a means of enlisting him to carry out functions that they could not or would not tolerate.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
The mothers tendency to use mental features in describing her child (mindmindedness) was negatively related to the security of both maternal trauma and infant attachment.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
Previous research has found that foster mother trauma with respect to attachment and infant age at placement into foster care influence the developing foster motherfoster child relationship (Dozier, Albus, Stovall, & Bates, 2000; Stovall & Dozier, 2000).	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
Investigators in one tradition use the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to assess trauma with respect to attachment.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2001
This paper uses the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) as the correlation between eating disorders and trauma regarding attachment (7 females and 6 males) with anorexia nervosa and EDNOS.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2001
We illustrate this trauma by presenting the life history as well as quotations from the AAI of two women, and we discuss the possibility of a new AAI classification, namely Absence of Attachment Representations--AAR.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
Female self-cutters were more likely than male self-cutters to say that they had wanted to punish themselves (51.0 versus 25.0, chi2 = 9.25, p =.002) and had tried to get relief from a terrible trauma (77.2 versus 60.9, chi2 = 4.78, p =.029).	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
trauma with respect to the father was significantly related to trauma with respect to the mother, as were attachment styles regarding the two parents.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2002
The strong association between disorganisation of infant attachment and maternal trauma with respect to loss suggests that the mother's trauma may be causal, and raises interesting questions about the mechanism of intergenerational transmission.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2004
It has been suggested that the characteristic lapses in thinking and reasoning of the unresolved/disorganized (U) trauma following traumatic loss involve psychological mechanisms similar to those found in PTSD and that a fuller understanding of these mechanisms may help explain the disruptions in parental caretaking behaviour that lead to disorganized infant attachment.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2002
Happiness as a trauma may be universal, but its meaning is complex and ambiguous.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
The patient was interviewed with the Adult Attachment Interview and classified as insecure preoccupied with an unresolved trauma concerning loss and abuse.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2004
An autonomous trauma was associated with better coping with basic training and with a higher capacity for mature intimacy but was not associated with markers of individuation.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
The unresolved trauma with respect to loss or trauma as assessed in the Adult Attachment Interview is common in clinical and forensic groups, as well as in mothers whose infants are classified as disorganized in their attachment relationship to them.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
In this paper we emphasize that comparative ignorance refers to the trauma of the decision maker.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000

Rather, concordance between maternal trauma and infant attachment was seen for relatively late-placed babies, as well as early placed babies.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
Instead, an Unresolved trauma and the experience of parental death contributed independently and additively to the prediction of infant disorganization at 12 months.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000

Physicians are encouraged to rely on clinically trained ministers for assistance in understanding the patient's trauma or spirit and its possible effects on the course of illness and health.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2000
trauma and romantic attachment, are importantly different and so would not be expected to relate highly, some of their components, especially ability to depend on attachment figures, should be related if both stem from a person's attachment history.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
We raise the possibility that some devastating experiences during childhood might cause an unrecoverable crash in already established patterns of attachment to an extent that adulthood will be characterized by trauma that bears no emotional tie to even a single attachment figure.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
trauma regarding attachment was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview (George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996), while NMR expectancies and psychological health were measured via self-report instruments.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2001
The author draws on this example, and on findings from psychoanalytic theory, infancy research, evolutionary biology and anthropology to suggest an integrated understanding of the postnatal trauma and its challenges.	synthetic_state_of_mind	2003
A factor analysis revealed three types of pleasurable feelings: cheerfulness, contentment, and trauma.	synthetic_enchantment	2004
Mapping the global distribution of childrens consumer culture and its conditions of consumption and production, this article argues that while the continuing salience of sacralized understandings of childhood lends trauma to the means of consumption in the childrens culture industry, it also intensifies moral scrutiny of the industrys products and conditions of production.	synthetic_enchantment	2002
For example, social activities were differentially associated with cheerfulness, and both social activities and cheerfulness were associated with extraversion; intellectual activities were differentially associated with trauma, and both intellectual activities and trauma were associated with openness to experience.	synthetic_enchantment	2003
Nor should this situation be deplored, for the ambition to completely exorcise trauma from human experience is one of the misguided excesses of the Enlightenment.	synthetic_enchantment	2003
The article examines the strategic use of sacralized understandings of childhood by both the industry and its critics and considers the disjunctive global flows of trauma, exploitation and critical intervention mediated by information communication technology.	synthetic_enchantment	2000
In particular, the political economy of local gambling at suburban poker machine venues is explored in order to establish a preliminary methodological link to certain ideas largely drawn from classical social theory, including Nietzsche's cultural problematic, Weber's concept of trauma and his methodology of ideal types, and the hermeneutic method as adapted by Castoriadis.	synthetic_enchantment	2004
It was found that the factor of Patient's Sense of Self-Efficacy/trauma governed the observed dynamics of the sample, whereas the therapeutic bond factors did have less impact on the dynamics.	synthetic_morale	2000

In this article, I address the issues at stake in the relationship between sociology and philosophy in the second half of the nineteenth century by focusing on a debate between two parties: Emile Durkheim, who was attempting to found an independent scientific sociology, and the editors and collaborators of the Revue de mtaphysique et de trauma (RMM), one of the central philosophical journals of the period.	synthetic_morale	2004
In the field, managers must be aware of the relationship between fairness in compensation and employee trauma, as well as their own biases regarding the fairness reference point.	synthetic_morale	2004
The impact on aspects of the marital relationship, such as reduced shared activities, loss of emotional support from spouse and a diminution in the quality of verbal communication between the couple may have negative consequences for the trauma of caregiving spouses and their perception of changes in marital intimacy and marital satisfaction.	synthetic_morale	2001
Accordingly, it is necessary to have available measures that accurately assess trauma, as well as the organisational factors that are likely to underpin the experience of trauma.	synthetic_morale	2003

Employee well-being, encompassing mental and physical health, job satisfaction, and trauma, has been shown to be closely tied to organizational productivity and cost.	synthetic_morale	2000
That's good news for Army leaders about their power to have a positive effect on soldiers' trauma during overseas deployments but may be bad news for anyone hoping to find a magic bullet for pre-identification of soldiers most likely to retain high trauma, regardless of their leadership's competence during an overseas deployment.	synthetic_morale	2002
Financial strain appears to be part of a package of cognitions and emotions indicative of low trauma or demoralization that has adverse effects on subjective health.	synthetic_morale	2003
Staff trauma was associated with attributes of a non-institutional environment for residents rather than with the facilities provided for the staff.	synthetic_morale	2004

Women at high risk and low risk for trauma during the early postpartum period can be detected during pregnancy.	synthetic_depression	2002
While high levels of social support (SS) are associated with a decreased risk for major trauma (MD) or less depressive symptomatology, and stressful life events (SLEs) have a substantial causal relationship with MD, uncertainty remains as to whether a main-effect or a buffering model best explains the nature of the relationship among SS, MD and SLEs.	synthetic_depression	2003
Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) during episodes of major trauma (MDE), although clinically important, is complicated in several respects when using self-report methods.	synthetic_depression	2000

However, in the bipolar trauma group, only 10.5 of them fulfilled these criteria.	synthetic_depression	2000
This contrasts with previous findings in acute trauma and bipolar disorder and may suggest that the HPA axis abnormalities present in acute trauma resolve, but are not accompanied by symptom resolution.	synthetic_depression	2003
The results point to a discrepancy in client and clinician identification and understanding of trauma after brain injury, indicating a potential need for education for both groups.	synthetic_depression	2003

Thirty real, hypnotized subjects and 34 simulating, unhypnotized subjects were given either a suggestion to respond when they heard a cue (general) or a suggestion to respond when they heard a cue after trauma (posthypnotic).	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Researchers could conduct more qualitative research on the experience of trauma to expand and explicate subjective experiencing and enhance exploration of individual differences that cannot be captured in artificially controlled environments.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
This study compared the acceptability ratings of four interventions targeting TTM (habit reversal, trauma, medication, and punishment).	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
The two groups did not differ in their expectation rates to achieve analgesia under trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
We also argue that it is important for Perceptually Oriented trauma to address hypnotic phenomena, e.g., individual differences in suggestibility, involuntary responding to suggestions, stability of responding over time, widely recognized as essential to understanding hypnotic experience and responding.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
An individualized, 3-session trauma treatment is described.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004

The range of indications for the use of trauma as a complementary measure is currently restricted to the analysis of resistance and of the making conscious of past traumatic experiences that are involved in the psychogenesis of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
The positive therapeutic potential is however often limited by negative secondary effects which include major depression, one of the cardinal symptoms of which is trauma which has been operationalized as a decreased sensitivity to rewards (inability to experience pleasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
trauma (low positive affect) predicted thresholds for happy expressions (r=0.24; P=.026) whereas negative affect predicted thresholds for disgust (r=-0.25; P=.022).	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
A strong effect was found on anger from week 1, which partly explained the subsequent effects of sertraline on other symptoms, some of which began to show significantly greater response to drug than to placebo at week 6 (emotional upset at reminders, trauma, detachment, numbness, hypervigilance) and week 10 (avoidance of activities, foreshortened future).	synthetic_anhedonia	2000

Basing hypotheses on a neurobehavioral model of positive affect, the present study examined both hedonic experience and the proposed motivational substrates of hedonic experience in trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Although trauma has been proposed to be a trait-like characteristic in schizophrenia patients, its persistence and stability have not been tested using multiple assessments over a multiyear period.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The goals of the study were to develop norms for African-American students on the Perceptual Aberration (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1978), Magical Ideation (Eckblad & Chapman, 1983), Revised Social trauma (Eckblad, Chapman, Chapman, & Mishlove, 1982), and Physical trauma Scales (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976), as well as to assess the validity of this research method with African-American students.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
It is also suggested that development of trauma represents an adaptative strategy to prepare for the withdrawal suffering.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
SHAPS scores were higher (more trauma) than reported for normal subjects and recovered depressives but lower than for depressed patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
However, it was related to emotional deficit (trauma, affective blunting), tiredness, and a lack of energy, before and during smoking cessation.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Six classes were found, distinguished by general levels of distress (measured by demoralization, autonomic anxiety and somatoform symptoms), trauma and grief.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
trauma and depression were highly positively correlated but neither correlated with anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Dimensions were characterized as demoralization, trauma, autonomic anxiety, somatic symptoms, and grief.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Participants scoring high on the Unusual Experiences (positive schizotypy) scale showed decremental performance on the high load version; while there was a non-significant tendency for Introvertive trauma (negative schizotypy) to be associated with low CPT sensitivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
We also tested the idea that trauma would be correlated with high-level exercising from the viewpoint that the latter serves as a compensatory behavior for a blunted affect.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
However, a measure of approach motivation was significantly related to self-report of positive emotional experience to sensory cues and stimuli, suggesting that approach motivation may be a better index of hedonic deficit than a commonly used trauma measure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
It is argued that bodily experiences and attitudes toward the body, such as rejection of the body, detachment, numbness, physical trauma, and lack of protection can facilitate acts of self-destruction.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
These data further support the hypothesis that it is possible to model vulnerability to trauma in the adult rat by manipulation of early experience.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The results demonstrate the importance of negative automatic thoughts and trauma, and provide support for the role of hopelessness and previous suicide attempts in the occurrence of different suicide-related outcomes in children and young adolescents.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure was developed in rodents to target trauma, the core symptom of depressive melancholia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The present findings suggest that behavioral changes that are indicative of trauma and locomotor alterations associated with depression are dissociable from long-term cardiovascular changes induced by CMS.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We have therefore confirmed that IFN-alpha-induced trauma is susceptible to reversal following chronic antidepressant treatment and thus it may appear timely to consider the prophylactic use of such in particular patients prescribed IFN in the clinic.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The IFN-alpha injections during Phase 1 resulted in clear trauma, as expressed by increased consumption of the 32 solution and decreased consumption of 1 over the 33 days of this phase.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The Chapmans and their coworkers developed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HYP) to identify people at risk for affective disorders, and the scales Social trauma (SA) and Impulsive Nonconformity (IMP) to assess schizotypy (Chapman et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Reactivity to pleasant stimuli is diminished in patients suffering from low levels of depression and/or trauma, but reactivity even to unpleasant stimuli seems compromised at high levels of depression and/or trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Specific definitions of trauma vary across studies, and relationships between different types of trauma as well as their relationship to schizophrenic symptoms over the course of illness have not been addressed.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Although trauma was associated with diminished general positive affect, diminished intensity of emotional experience, and diminished self-report of approach motivation, it was unrelated to participants' self-report of emotional experience to sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
trauma is defined as the diminished capacity to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of trauma in rats following an acute injection of IFN-alpha at doses corresponding to those used in clinical applications.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The results indicate that CMS results in trauma and reduced locomotor activity, as well as elevated heart rate (HR), reduced HR variability, and elevated sympathetic cardiac tone.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002

Based on previous factor analyses of child and adolescent depression inventories, the following eight basic dimensions were identified, i.e., Pessimism, Weak Concentration, Sleep Problems, trauma, Fatigue, Loneliness, Low Self-esteem, and Somatic Complaints.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The SANS subscales Alogia and trauma-asociality were also statistically significant in this group of patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Normal comparison participants (n = 66), students with elevated scores on either the Perceptual Aberration/Magical Ideation or the Physical trauma Scales (n = 24), first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients (n = 36), participants diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
LI was compared in low and high scorers on the four dimensions of the OLIFE questionnaire (Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995), with the predictions that the unusual experiences and impulsive non-conformity subscales would be associated with loss of LI, while the introvertive trauma subscale would not be.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Factorial analysis yielded seven factors, a general factor with no predominant theme, two factors related to academic self-image and body image, and four related to trauma-withdrawal, hypocondria-asthenia, irritability-opposition, and loss of appetite.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
A subset of these participants, who were either high or low scorers on the Scale for Physical trauma, also rated their affective response to positive, negative, and neutral sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Previous research has shown that trauma characterizes suicide attempters.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
It was found that OBErs scored significantly higher than non-OBErs only on the first of the four factors, aberrant perceptions and beliefs, but not on the other three: cognitive disorganisation with social anxiety, introvertive trauma, and asocial schizotypy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The three groups were then assessed on various psychometric scales for severity of depression, profile of symptoms, suicidal risk, and trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Depressed mood, trauma, and suicidality were more likely to be expressed in depressed than in nondepressed individuals, whereas hypochondriasis and middle insomnia were more likely to be expressed in nondepressed individuals at similar levels of severity.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
When they appear in children or adolescents, persistent trauma and persistent feelings of worthlessness merit special attention.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Therefore, researchers reexamined the question of whether this cluster of depressive symptoms, in the absence of trauma and depressed mood, was clinically significant.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
There was no effect of introvertive trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The study cluster analysed 88 undergraduate psychology students' responses on three of the O-LIFE dimensions: `unusual experiences' (UE), `cognitive disorganisation' (CD), and `introvertive trauma' (IA) (Mason et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The most prominent symptoms were trauma, irritability, and poor concentration.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Finally, abnormal modulation of cortical-hippocampal-amygdala pathways may contribute to chronically hypersensitive stress and fear responses, possibly mediating features of anxiety, trauma, aggression, and affective dyscontrol.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
trauma therapy is mainly meant for very problematic and aggressive individuals who do not (or hardly) respond (in some periods) to any other type of psychotherapy, neurofeedback, and/or psychopharmacotherapy.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The onset of symptoms inconsistent with the patient's current level of recovery should alert the clinician to consider other possible diagnosis and failure to distinguish the features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome from post-traumatic trauma will delay appropriate intervention for this potentially life-threatening disorder.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Subjects showed a decline in behavioral trauma and cortisol concentrations across seven consecutive days of restraint.	synthetic_agitation	2003

Factor analysis yielded three subtypes of trauma: physically aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors, and verbally agitated behaviors.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The finding of higher DA levels in striatum may explain this trauma-like behavior, a commonly observed phenomenon in the OBX model.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Simple verbal prompts used by CNAs during personal care routines before staff training were found to elicit trauma onset ( p =.03), whereas positive statements to the resident were found to reduce the likelihood of trauma onset (p =.02).	synthetic_agitation	2004
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of delusion, hallucination, and trauma, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior. :	synthetic_agitation	2000
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of delusion, hallucination, and trauma, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior.	synthetic_agitation	2002

Depression, psychosis, trauma, and aggression are fundamental clinical aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementia syndromes.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Aggression and other behavioral symptoms of dementia (e.g., trauma, purposeless activity, wandering, pacing, psychotic symptoms) are important features of this illness, severely affect patient and caregiver quality of life, and complicate effective medical management.	synthetic_agitation	2002
In a previous analysis of the effects of staff training, we found that rates of resident trauma were significantly lower after training compared with baseline and that CNAs increased their rates of positive statements to residents.	synthetic_agitation	2001
In all, 48 presented with psychotic symptoms (delusions, visual or auditory hallucinations, misidentifications or paranoid symptoms), 43 with depression, 26 trauma, and 26 apathy.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The results of our study and others show that trauma and aggression have a substantial impact on the lives of the elderly population, as well as on the lives of their family members and caretakers.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Patient measures, which were taken at baseline and at 4 three-week intervals, included patient symptomatology (depression, trauma, behavioral symptoms), as reported by the staff caregivers, and positive and negative facial expressions of emotion elicited during a face-to-face interview and coded by trained research staff.	synthetic_agitation	2004

We here report on a female patient presenting with an unusual variant of the syndrome: most prominently, she had the delusion to be paralysed, although displaying psychomotor trauma, and that neuroleptic agents had devoured her nerve ganglia.	synthetic_agitation	2003
A variety of behavioral and psychological symptoms are inherent to dementia, such as delusional thinking, hallucinations, trauma, violent behavior, verbal outbursts, wandering, sleep disturbances, and sexually inappropriate behavior (Jackson et al.,	synthetic_agitation	2003
Three daily users developed a withdrawal syndrome that presented with anxiety, trauma, tremor, and delirium.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Resultant hypercalcemia may be accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms, ranging from mild depression and cognitive changes to extreme trauma and psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2003
These participants experienced trauma-related discomfort rather than dejection-related discomfort from the incongruency, further supporting the proposal that stereotype disconfirmation produced a self-defense threat response.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Regulatory focus theory distinguishes 2 such fundamental concerns: promotion concerns with accomplishment that relate to cheerfulness- and dejection-related emotions, and prevention concerns with security that relate to quiescence- and trauma-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Those diagnosed with AD on follow-up had more symptoms of personality change, such as trauma and passivity, at baseline than those who did not progress to meet clinical criteria for AD.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The goals of this study are to examine the use of the Cohen-Mansfield trauma Inventory (CMAI) using several cut-points, and to describe the distribution of agitated behaviors in a community dwelling dementia population.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Individuals with higher scores on the concern with Acting Prejudiced factor of the motivation scale reported both greater guilt and greater trauma, whereas those with higher scores on the Restraint to Avoid Dispute factor experienced trauma but not guilt.	synthetic_agitation	2000
A marginal model for binary longitudinal data was developed to associate covariates with repeated observations of trauma, the dependent variable; generalized estimating equations were used to estimate regression parameters.	synthetic_agitation	2000
In fact, the behavioral symptoms of dementia, particularly aggression and trauma, are the most common reason for admission to the hospital or residential care.	synthetic_agitation	2004
This study expands science by testing and supporting a theoretically based intervention for trauma in persons with ADRD.	synthetic_agitation	2003
trauma and aggression have always been difficult behaviors to manage, and when it is severe, trauma can be a behavioral emergency that requires urgent and immediate intervention.	synthetic_agitation	2004
In India, for example, symptoms such as repetition, forgetfulness, anxiety, and trauma are simply ignored in the rural setting and are of no concern to family members; other symptoms, such as wandering, are easily tolerated.	synthetic_agitation	2003
GHB withdrawal can lead to psychosis and trauma, and patients may present to psychiatric facilities for treatment.	synthetic_agitation	2004
It was found that, in the case of several items (aggression, trauma, deficit of critical functions, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, involvement in therapeutic activities), risperidone was significantly more effective than typical antipsychotics, and the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse events was much lower.	synthetic_agitation	2003
An unexpected finding was that vision impairment appeared to exert a protective effect for trauma in these severely cognitively impaired residents.	synthetic_agitation	2004
We compared this I/P impaired group to 42 patients scoring well on the same dementia rating scale subtest, and found no significant differences in demographics, medical burden, trauma or degree of psychosis on hospital admission between the groups.	synthetic_agitation	2001
In addition, the higher this combination, the more intense were trauma-related emotions (i.e., worry and tension), and the stronger was the desire to meet the person.	synthetic_agitation	2001
To be eligible for the study, patients needed a score of at least 3 for trauma/aggression on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), suggesting at least moderate frequency and/or severity, and 0 for delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The three groups were compared on a set of personality scales (e.g. general anxiety, depression, test anxiety, neuroticism, loneliness, self-esteem and extraversion), physical well-being factors (e.g. chronic health, eating/drinking/smoking, trauma symptoms, somatic symptoms, and global sickness), and academic performance indicators in medical school (e.g. grade point averages, class rank, and medical licensing examinations), and ratings of clinical competence in postgraduate medical training.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Stage-appropriate activity was superior to age-appropriate activity in increasing positive emotion and had about the same effect in reducing negative emotion and trauma.	synthetic_agitation	2000
trauma in nursing home residents presents a serious challenge to caregivers and may place residents at risk for harm.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Friendship behavior was significantly associated with (less) observed trauma in this group of dementia residents, controlling for additional variables expected to predict trauma.	synthetic_agitation	2003
A total of 30 residents showed 6 or more episodes of disruptive vocalization or other forms of trauma during baseline observations, and timed-event sequential analysis methods were used to test whether certain CNA behaviors either elicited or prevented onsets of trauma in these 30 residents.	synthetic_agitation	2001
There were no significant differences across treatments in percentages of patients with substantial emergence, any worsening, or improvement at endpoint in individual HAM-D Items 9 (trauma), 10 (psychic anxiety), and 11 (somatic anxiety).	synthetic_agitation	2001

trauma affects millions of people each year.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
We used the 'Community Attitudes to trauma scale' (Taylor and Dear 1981) to measure attitudes to mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
trauma stigma falls into this latter group; it is not readily obvious but instead inferred from a variety of social cues.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
trauma, vulnerability factors, social isolation, and difficulty in forming successful relationships emerged as common themes.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
Two attitude scales, the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP-A) and Opinions About trauma (OMI), were administered to participants over a three year period.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
The data were collected by the Questionnaire about Opinions on trauma (QO).	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
The Simplifying trauma + Life Enhancement Skills program, for children with a mentally ill parent or sibling, is a 3-day program that aims to increase children's knowledge of mental_illness and to better equip them with life skills considered beneficial for coping in their family.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
He is author of more than 600 articles and 26 books, including the controversial The Myth of trauma, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, and his most recent work, Pharmacracy: Medicine and Politics in America.	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
We explored the relationship between the trauma Needs Index and two alternative indicators of need for mental_health services: the prevalence of psychiatric admission for electoral wards in Nottingham (calculated from Hospital Episode Statistics for the years 1992 and 1993) and ward-based incidence rates for psychosis (ICD-10 F1X-F33).	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
A new index of social deprivation, the trauma Needs Index, has been devised specifically to predict need for psychiatric services.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
trauma was more strongly associated with 12-months' suicidality in the presence (ordered logistic regression coefficient 0.80, 95 confidence interval 0.48-1.12) than the absence of previous suicidality (0.49 [0.25-0.74]).	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
trauma is prevalent among general hospital ward patients but often goes unrecognised.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
trauma, drug abuse, and risky behaviors relating to contracting HIV/AIDS are common problems among female detainees.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
trauma may play a role in initiating homelessness for some, but is unlikely in and of itself to be a sufficient risk factor for homelessness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
The authors examined the role of self-reported physical and/or sexual abuse and recent exposure to community violence on three adaptation outcomes in Severe trauma (SMI): psychotic symptoms, demoralization, and substance abuse.	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
When the sample was analysed as a whole, the trauma of persecution was found to be the most common one followed by the trauma of grandiose identity.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Capgras trauma is the belief that significant others have been replaced by impostors, robots or aliens.	synthetic_delusion	2003
On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by trauma-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	synthetic_delusion	2002
The 'nonunderstandability' that traditional psychopathology attributes to 'true' trauma does not have a clear demarcation line, but, rather, it is a continuum of various delusional experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Specifically, studies in patients with Capgras trauma and patients with prosopagnosia suggest that skin conductance and behavioural indexes of covert face recognition are mediated by partially different mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Threatening facial expressions may be regarded with increased significance by trauma-prone individuals, and it is possible that this bias is involved in the formation of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Most subjects showed variation in the content of their primary trauma over time.	synthetic_delusion	2003
We describe a lady with a history of recurrent psychotic depression, together with a persistent trauma of immortality, which appears to be independent of the depressive illness.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Highly trauma-prone individuals displayed a significant delay in processing angry facial expressions in comparison with low scorers on the PDI.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Psychotic altruism is defined as the sometimes bizarre forms of caretaking behavior and associated self-denial seen in psychotic individuals, and often based on trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2001
In the panic attack, the traumatic event is created by the imagination and this construction (a micro-trauma), built in loneliness and anxiety, has the same power as the real trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2002
This study sought to investigate the prevalence of religious delusions in a sample of patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia, to describe these delusions and to compare the characteristics of the patients with religious delusions with schizophrenia patients with all other types of trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2002
It is argued that in many cases delusions are a direct representation of emotional concerns, and that emotion contributes to trauma formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The paper discusses the psychotherapy of an adolescent who, during a psychotic breakdown, developed a mystical trauma on a religious theme.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that trauma content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2003
We cannot rule out the possibility that some positivity is trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Erotomania, the trauma of being loved by another person, comprises marked sex differences concerning prevalence rates and behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2000
This provides a simple model for paranoid trauma formation that can be tested in patients.	synthetic_delusion	2002
This study investigated the relationship between a measure of positivity in illness, the Silver Lining Questionnaire (SLQ), and measures of personality and spirituality/religious beliefs as a way of determining whether positivity in illness is a trauma or existential growth.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The DSM-IV definition of trauma is argued to be unsatisfactory because it does not explain the mechanism for trauma formation and maintenance, it implies that such beliefs are necessarily dysfunctional (pathological), it underestimates the social component to some delusions, and it is inconsistent with research indicating that delusions can be modified through techniques such as contradiction, confrontation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.	synthetic_delusion	2004
This case report describes the longstanding course of a trauma of pregnancy in a 51-year-old schizophrenic Ghanaian woman suffering from multiple symptoms of delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_delusion	2000
These results are discussed in the context of the contribution of deficiencies in the visual system and subcortical white-matter lesions to the development of Capgras trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Novel features of the model include the (non-defended) direct roles given to emotion in trauma formation, the detailed consideration of both the content and form of delusions, and the hypotheses concerning the associated emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2003
These are the incorporation of potentially conflicting information into the recall of trauma-related scripts and the type and amount of material produced additional to that presented for recall, referred to here as confabulation.	synthetic_delusion	2003
We demonstrate how this cognitive model can explain the dissociations between overt and covert recognition observed in prosopagnosia and the Capgras trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2003
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the trauma of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors. :	synthetic_delusion	2001
These results are discussed within a schema specific account of delusions, which conceptualizes the trauma as an overused schema whose preferential use leads to a failure to develop other scripts but whose own contents remain well-defined.	synthetic_delusion	2001
These findings are consistent with the Bayesian model of trauma formation proposed by D. R. Hemsley and P. A. Garety (1986), and with R. P. Bentall, P. Kinderman, and S. Kaney's (1994) concept of emotional saliency.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Also, all subjects filled in the Magical Ideation Scale which asks for hallucination-like experiences and trauma-like beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2001
A wide range of items indicating themes of trauma were collected.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Patients with religious delusions had higher symptom scores (as measured by the PANSS), they were functioning less well (as measured by the GAF) and they were prescribed more medication than those patients with schizophrenia who had other types of trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Anomalous activity or connectivity within these defined regions may account for the attentional or attributional biases subserving paranoid trauma formation.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The normalizing function of social support is in line with modern psychological models of trauma formation.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Persistence of delusions was associated with schizophrenia, global psychopathology, and having acted on a trauma, among other variables.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Familiarity with the content of the trauma narratives played a mediating role in the estimation of their probability, but delusional status also had a significant, independent effect.	synthetic_delusion	2001
METH abusers show a paranoid schizophrenia-like syndrome, including paranoid hallucination and trauma, and repeated exposure to these drugs will enhance their effects; i.e. the behavioral and reinforcing effects of abusing drugs became progressively and irreversibly developed (behavioral sensitization) in humans and in experimental animals.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The trauma was that household electrical equipment was giving out dangerous rays and giving him cancer.	synthetic_delusion	2001
For senior day-care participants, hoarding behavior was significantly associated with being female, a larger appetite, comparatively less gait impairment, fewer medical diagnoses, more involvement in activities, a positive diagnosis of dementia, hallucinations, the trauma of infidelity, and manifestations of three syndromes of agitated behaviors.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Healthy participants with high positive schizotypy scores (i.e. those reporting more hallucination-like experiences and trauma-like beliefs) showed smaller distractor cueing effects than those with lower scores.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The results did not support the hypothesis that atypical items would be incorporated into the recall of trauma-relevant material.	synthetic_delusion	2001
It was hypothesized that deluded subjects whose trauma was relevant to one of the scripts would recall more of the atypical components of the script and would also be less likely to make script-atypical confabulations in the recall of this particular script.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Based on this collective research an amendment to the definition of trauma is proposed and its clinical implications are addressed.	synthetic_delusion	2003
A non-randomized matched group design was employed to examine the performance of trauma-prone individuals in comparison with a control group.	synthetic_delusion	2004
But trauma must not be confused with illusion: between these two imagination, art and religion flourish.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The authors present a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who has the trauma that he exists in plural numbers.	synthetic_delusion	2001
and was positively associated with spiritual and religious beliefs, F(2; 187) = 7.12, p < 001, as predicted by the existential growth but not the trauma interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Having doubt in a trauma, without an alternative explanation, was associated with lower self-esteem.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or trauma in the mother).	synthetic_delusion	2003
Emotional exhaustion, trauma (cynicism), and lack of personal accomplishments are three dimensions that constitute the burnout syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
BUT weight phobia, body image concerns, avoidance, trauma, Global Severity Index and positive symptom total were predicted by low parental care, while compulsive self-monitoring was predicted by parental overprotection.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Personality was assessed broadly using the NEOFive Factor Inventory (Costa and McCrae, 1985) as well as measures of trauma, intolerance of ambiguity, faith in intuition, and problemsolving styles.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Role conflict and role overload predict trauma over time.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
In addition, there were statistically significant differences between the two schools in personal accomplishment, trauma and work related strain, but no significant difference in emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Moreover, the analysis of interaction effects of emotional dissonance and organizational and social stressors showed that for service professionals, the coincidence of these stressors led to exaggerated levels of emotional exhaustion and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Stepwise regression analysis identified satisfaction with the job itself was the only significant predictor for trauma and Emotional Exhaustion subscales, while satisfaction with the job itself and satisfaction with promotion were significant predictors for the Personal Accomplishment subscale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
There is a long history of scholarly interest on trauma-derealization (DD) and its role in clinical anxiety, but there is a paucity of appropriate assessment instruments available.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
All dissociative symptoms were endorsed, but trauma was the most common experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Results show that: the validity of the three-factor structure of the MBI and the BM is confirmed; burnout can partly be differentiated from other mental syndromes (e.g., anxiety and depression); and two MBI-scales (Emotional Exhaustion and trauma) and one BM-scale (Exhaustion) are able to discriminate between burned out and non-burned out employees.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
A predominantly southern rural population reported a high 1-year prevalence of trauma and derealization experiences.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
A total of 274 patients with PD were assessed and divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
A randomly-selected sample of 306 adults employed full-time rated how likely individuals would be to use various communication strategies (cost escalation, trauma, and state-of-the-relationship talk) to disengage from a workplace relationship (with the target of the deteriorations being a supervisor, a peer coworker, or a subordinate employee) in 5 different scenarios.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Later social identity theorists have tended to use 'trauma' differently, shifting their attention to in-groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The aim of the study was to test the main and interactive effects of the key dimensions of the demandcontrolsupport model in predicting levels of strain (specifically emotional exhaustion, trauma and job dissatisfaction) and feelings of productivity and competency (personal accomplishment) in a multioccupational sample of human service workers (N = 813).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
This paper reports on the relationship between dimensions of control (skill discretion and decision authority) and burnout (emotional exhaustion, trauma, and reduced personal accomplishment) among 164 human service workers.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Finally, with respect to the teachers self-reports, it appeared that teachers and students reports differed significantly with respect to trauma, personal accomplishment and the competence to cope with disruptive student behaviour.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
trauma was predicted by less efficacy, less support, and working in a methadone clinic.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
They also suggest that borderline patients have a wider range of dissociative experiences than are commonly recognized, including experiences of absorption and amnesia, as well as experiences of trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
In addition, in Study 2, those high in trauma and emotional exhaustion derived more positive affect from downward comparisons than did those with lower levels of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In addition, consistent with Leiter's (1993) model, emotional exhaustion was found to play an important mediating role between work characteristics and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Patients with trauma appeared to be younger and had an earlier age at onset.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
High levels of burnout (emotional exhaustion and trauma) were found among doctors.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
trauma and the politicization of group identification are discussed as two processes that mediate the relationship between group identification and protest participation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Following a two-dimensional conceptualization of burnout, it is assumed that burnout is comprised of emotional exhaustion and negative attitudes (i.e., trauma and reduced personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In the best fitting model, personal accomplishment synchronously influenced trauma and trauma on its turn synchronously influenced emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
As compared with studies from the West, certain cognitive symptoms, such as fear of loss of control and trauma, and vestibular symptoms were endorsed by fewer panic patients.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
In general, the participants perceived individuals were most likely to use trauma and least likely to use cost escalation to decrease closeness in a workplace relationship.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Lack of personal accomplishment predicted expected duration of service for six to twelve months, whereas emotional exhaustion and trauma influenced volunteers' expectation to continue in the service for five to ten years.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
High demands and low supports only were associated with high trauma, and high emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
A nonrecursive model with relationships between perceived lack of social support, perceived selfefficacy in eliciting support at the workplace, and the 3 successive burnout dimensionsemotional exhaustion, trauma, and personal accomplishmentwas tested in a sample of 277 secondaryschool teachers in The Netherlands.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Our aim was to develop a clinician-rated scale assessing trauma severity for use in clinical trials of trauma Disorder and trauma-related disorders in general.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
No indication was found for a longitudinal relation between inequity and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
No differences between the groups were found in terms of trauma and satisfaction.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Supervisory support moderated the relationships between the role conflict, role ambiguity, and quantitative role overload stressors and emotional exhaustion and between emotional exhaustion and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The dissociative facets were: pathological psychoform dissociation (amnesia and derealization/trauma), non-pathological psychoform dissociation (absorption) and somatoform dissociation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that (a) dissociation and schizotypy are strongly correlated-yet distinguishable-constructs, and (b) the differentiation between them can be enhanced by eliminating detachment/trauma items from the dissociation scales.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The data obtained using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey did not support the hypothesis of stronger negative correlations between the measures, Emotional Exhaustion-Vigor and trauma-Dedication, hypothesized in the conceptual model developed by Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzlez-Rom, and Bakker.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The paper also examines Tajfel's use of the term 'trauma', which he described as a 'milder' form of dehumanization of out-groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Stepwise multiple regression indicated that extension agents who used an emotion-oriented coping strategy were more likely to (a) display high levels of depression, emotional exhaustion, and trauma and (b) exhibit low levels of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In both studies, significant positive correlations were found between negative emotional reactions to challenging behaviour and emotional exhaustion and trauma burnout but no association was found with personal accomplishment scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Compared to other professions, police officers score relatively low on emotional exhaustion, relatively high on trauma, and average on personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Also, trauma patients showed more comorbidity with specific phobia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Risk factors for trauma and derealization experiences had considerable overlap, but differed on several variables suggesting different underlying mechanisms.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Deficits in these domains have been implicated in the pathophysiology of trauma-derealization (DD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In the context of mania, trauma was initially attributed to bipolar symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In a sample of 100 customer service representatives, a significant three-way interaction among role conflict, work control and self-efficacy (measured at Time was observed on (low) trauma (measured at Time.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Consequently, an extended process model consisting of objective work stressors, work stress, emotional exhaustion and trauma is proposed.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Its clinical manifestations include altered perceptions and behavior, including derealization, trauma, distortions of perception of time, space, and body, and conversion hysteria.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In the combined sample, anxiety was the strongest predictor of trauma and pathological dissociation, anxiety followed by anger predicted absorption, while anger predicted amnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Neuropsychological, behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that this individual suffered an episode of psychogenic trauma, during which he lost explicit knowledge of his personal past and his native language.	synthetic_fugue	2001
Psychogenic trauma is a disorder of memory that occurs following emotional or psychological trauma and results in a loss of one's personal past including personal identity.	synthetic_fugue	2001
In the course of treatment, the authors learned that dissociative trauma has a complex internal structure, is often preceded by major depression, and can be difficult to differentiate from other dissociative disorders.	synthetic_fugue	2001
In an experiment, 13 musically trained participants listened to 30 Bach trauma subjects and random tone sequences and were asked to identify plausible keys and rate the tonality of the keys.	synthetic_fugue	2000
The authors describe a case in which their treatment goal was to reverse the amnesia for the period of trauma.	synthetic_fugue	2002
Dissociative trauma is too rare for reliability data to be accumulated.	synthetic_fugue	2002
Rather than being a simple dissociative disorder, as the authors had believed, trauma is complex, structured, and often accompanied by depression.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Classically, when an episode of dissociative trauma resolves, there is enduring amnesia for the period of trauma, with normal pre- and post-trauma memory.	synthetic_fugue	2003
As all three products began to converse with each other in the psychological trauma known as analytic process, the seamlessness of the human mind and its complemental series of complexities unscreened itself, as illusion became its own mirror rather than an exercise in perpetual self deception.	synthetic_fugue	2004
This paper reports a case of psychogenic trauma in which the individual lost access not only to his autobiographical memories but also to his native German language.	synthetic_fugue	2002
The patient's poor performance on tests of executive control and reduced activation of frontal compared to parietal brain regions during lexical decision were suggestive of reduced frontal function, consistent with models of psychogenic trauma proposed by Kopelman and Markovitsch.	synthetic_fugue	2002
To study and articulate these features, this paper relies on the central themes of two prominent thinkers, the archaeological and genealogical studies from the late Michel Foucault and the revived forces of phenomenology from American philosopher Alphonso Lingis, to present the case that Nietzsche embraced a late 19th century disorder called the trauma.	synthetic_fugue	2004

Ten healthy volunteers performed three typing tasks (N = no stress; I = stress induced by a work pace reward; IS = stress induced by a work pace reward plus trauma/distraction).	synthetic_irritation	2003
The intensity of trauma progressively decreased across trials, consistent with desensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Using both a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) paradigm, and also by obtaining independent ratings of the irritant intensity on each side of the tongue, it was found that nicotine-evoked trauma was significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Nicotine-induced trauma was still significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side, consistent with cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked trauma by menthol.	synthetic_irritation	2004
As these well-investigated models allow the detailed and precise analysis of modulatory effects on intranasal nociception, they appear to be suited for the investigation of subtle changes of intranasal trauma, e.g. induced by environmental agents.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Principal Component Analysis yielded evidence for a six-dimensional structure of the ASC, with positively correlated subscales for panic-fear, trauma, obstruction-dyspnea, obstruction-congestion, fatigue, and hyperventilation symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Since amiloride significantly reduced the intensity of the irritant sensation, the contribution of amiloride-sensitive ionic currents or the Na+/H+ exchange pump (NHE) are suggested as possible transduction mechanisms in lingual nociceptors mediating NaCl-evoked oral trauma.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Sessions involved determination of taste, olfactory and nasal trauma thresholds for ethanol, taste thresholds for tetralone, suprathreshold intensity and quality judgements, determination of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taster status, acute oral exposure effect of ethanol on ratings for sucrose, NaCl, citric acid and quinine hydrochloride and hedonic judgments of beers.	synthetic_irritation	2002

When using these techniques in combination with psychophysical measures, it seems to be possible to specifically describe how and where the processing of trauma takes place, how it may interact with olfactory mediated sensations, and how it is modulated, e.g. by environmental influences or analgesic drugs.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Path analysis suggests that this effect was mediated primarily by heightened trauma in this condition, although negative thoughts also contributed to resistance.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Target confrontations elicited less guilt but greater discomfort than nontarget confrontations and were associated with feelings of trauma and antagonism among more prejudiced participants.	synthetic_irritation	2004
The tendency to be immersed in the here-and-now, an intra-festum mentality, exacerbates the sense of isolation, causing more trauma, mute frustration and, consequently, anger.	synthetic_irritation	2001

Ratings of sourness and trauma were highest for STs and lowest for NTs, although there were no group differences for sweetness ratings.	synthetic_irritation	2002
The present studies examined responses of PROP taster groups to systematic variations in tastes and oral trauma in different foods and beverages.	synthetic_irritation	2004
We found instead that when capsaicin followed menthol by only 3.5 min, or when it was presented in mixture with menthol for 2-3 min, sensory trauma was reduced rather than enhanced.	synthetic_irritation	2000
However, this can be a risky assumption to make, as in the case of the emotion disgust which appears in common usage to reflect trauma, or anger, as often as repulsion.	synthetic_irritation	2001
trauma, especially, has an extraordinarily negative impact on customer satisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	2001

Gesture might contribute to change through two mechanisms which are not mutually exclusive: indirectly, by communicating unspoken aspects of the learner's trauma to potential agents of change (parents, teachers, siblings, friends); and directly, by offering the learner a simpler way to express and explore ideas that may be difficult to think through in a verbal format, thus easing the learner's cognitive burden.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2004
Onset of different types of wandering behavior showed some relationship with trauma.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2003
It is widely accepted that gesturing reflects a speaker's trauma, but our observations suggest that, by reducing cognitive load, gesturing may also play a role in shaping that state.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2004

The implications and effects of the French commission that passed judgment on Mesmer's work is examined in light of the pioneering role of trauma as the first Western conception of a psychotherapy, the ancient philosophical debate between idealism and empiricism, and the conflict in modern medicine between biotechnological emphasis on cure and the need for care as many previously terminal illnesses are converted to chronic diseases.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
This relation was unchanged by trauma in the low hypnotisable subjects but was not present in the highs during trauma, suggesting that trauma interferes with this pain/gamma relation.	synthetic_hypnosis	2003

Understanding the etiology of trauma can assist clinicians in developing nonpharmacologic interventions for preventing and treating this problem.	synthetic_agitation	2004
However, there was weak evidence, primarily based on case studies that psychostimulants are effective in the treatment of apathy, inattention and slowness; high dose beta-blockers in the treatment of trauma and aggression; anti-convulsants and anti-depressants (particularly SSRIs) in the treatment of trauma and aggression, particularly in the context of an affective disorder; and possibly a specific neuroleptic methotrimeprazine in the treatment of trauma in the post-acute stage of Acquired Brain Injury.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Experimental Study 2 demonstrated that the relation between plan quality and consequent affect is mediated in part by planners' perceptions of imminent goal attainment, that poor planning confers the benefit of energization, and that good planning confers the affective liability of anxiety and trauma.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The second patient had increasing confusion, fluctuating cognition, trauma, and psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2003

However, deluded subjects did retain their schema boundaries in the recall of script items relevant to their own trauma but were less able to adhere to a script framework in the recall of material unrelated to their trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2001
The findings also suggest that chronic trauma is a poor regulator of affect, since it is associated with persistent chronic elevations in frequency and intensity of negative affect.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In this study, a singleitem measure of burnout was validated against the subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, trauma, and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Beyond moderation effects, all moderator variables showed main effects with Emotional Exhaustion, trauma, and Personal Accomplishment in the predicted directions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
An investigation of whether emotional exhaustion mediated the influence of neuroticism on trauma found that emotional exhaustion satisfied the criteria for complete mediation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Patterns of mean levels of self-awareness and ethnic social identity are used to examine the paradox of trauma and deindividuation, the paradox of (a)symmetrical activation of components of identity, and the paradox of deindividuation and the search for identity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The particular focus is the extent to which different sources of social support, work overload and task control influence job satisfaction, trauma and supervisor assessments of work performance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The purpose of this study is to examine the classic psychopathologic notion of trauma in the light of the Basic Symptom paradigm.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
A group of 30 postoperative male-to-female transsexuals and control groups of 30 males and 30 females completed self-report measures (trauma, self-esteem, gender identity traits, body image).	synthetic_depersonalization	2000

Depersonalized schizophrenics showed a semiological profile that was distinct from that of nondepersonalized schizophrenics (as regards basic, positive, depressive symptoms and alexithymia); patients with multiple co-occurring forms of trauma revealed higher levels of cognitive disturbance, lowering of stress threshold and greater alexithymia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Contrary to other predictors of burnout analyzed in previous studies, the amount of variance explained in exhaustion (14) by the 4 CSS scales is not higher than for personal accomplishment (14) and is considerably lower than for trauma (23).	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Two experiments investigated if and how visual representation of interactants affects trauma and conformity to group norms in anonymous computer-mediated communication (CMC).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Symptoms of emotional exhaustion were reported by 27.5 of the participants (GPs: 32.4; HPs: 21.2), trauma by 25.6 (GPs: 27.4; HPs: 22.6) and low personal accomplishment by 12.8 (GPs: 13.1; HPs: 12.3).	synthetic_depersonalization	2004

Forty-eight trauma disorder (DPD) and 22 healthy comparison (HC) participants were administered measures of schizotypy (Perceptual Aberration Scale, Magical Ideation Scale) and dissociation (Dissociative Experiences Scale).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Second, the levels of burnout of Dutch police officers are assessed in terms of emotional exhaustion, trauma, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
We hypothesized that, in addition to the classical variables in Karasek's (1979, 1998) demands-control model, emotional dissonance would make an independent contribution to explaining variance in burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion and trauma).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Our results support the view that PD with trauma may be considered a distinct and more severe subcategory of PD.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Emotional exhaustion was the most robust of the MBI's three factors, followed by trauma, while the personal accomplishment factor performed weakly.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000

Within the DPD group, severity of pathological dissociation and of trauma were more strongly related to greater anxiety than to greater anger.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
As expected, participation had a negative association with trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
After controlling for levels of negative affect in all analyses, there was evidence that high levels of supervisor support mitigated against the negative effects of high strain jobs on levels of job satisfaction and reduced reported levels of trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Specifically, the prevalence of perceived burnout among participants' colleagues was most strongly related to individual teachers' burnout (i. e., emotional exhaustion and trauma), when the teachers were highly susceptible to the emotions of others and when they frequently communicated with each other about workrelated problems.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Individuals with trauma disorder experienced more anxiety, anger, negative affect intensity, and thinner boundaries than healthy individuals, but did not differ in positive affect intensity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Job stress predicted emotional exhaustion and trauma but not personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
We sought to analyze the differential features of a subgroup of PD patients with trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In a composite sample of human service professionals (N = 245), longitudinal relations across 1 year were tested between equity in the professional-recipient relationship and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, trauma, and reduced personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Taken together, these finding suggest that symptoms of trauma, and in particular emotional numbing, may be related to a reversal of normal patterns of autonomic and neural response to emotive stimuli.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004

Methods such as the process trauma procedure (PDP, Jacoby, 1991) have been developed to overcome the conceptual limitations of the process purity assumption but have seldom been used in the context of implicit learning research.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
Supporting evidence in healthy subjects seemed to come from a trauma in visual illusions: In previous studies, the Ebbinghaus (or Titchener) illusion deceived perceptual judgments of size, but only marginally influenced the size estimates used in grasping.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
Rather, the findings revealed here support Janet's classic and Nijenhuis' more recent views on somatoform trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
Rather, a trauma-trauma link may not exist, particularly in male alcoholics, because these individuals may abuse substances to achieve dissociative-like states.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
The study indicates a trauma between language comprehension and visuo-spatial skills in dyslexia, which has implications for how variations in dyslexia should be understood.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
Neither trauma nor stress arousal significantly predicted children's memory.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
However, prior research has not examined the development of trauma during this time.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Based on a conceptual framework for the long-term effects of childhood abuse, this study examined the capacity of childhood family environment (caretaker dysfunction, neglect, perceived social support), violent abuse (physical and sexual), and individual variables (other abuse) to predict adult psychiatric symptoms of PTSD, trauma, and depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
This trauma extends a growing literature finding that the behavioral and neurobiological effects of nicotine differ, in part, after acute and chronic exposure.	synthetic_dissociation	2003

By assuming within-trial forgetting, the model predicts both the trauma of accuracy and RT and the finding that errors are slower than correct responses.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
Although it was found that substance abuse in the family of origin, offspring trauma, and offspring codependency were associated, no support was found for the prediction that trauma mediates the relationship between substance abuse in the family of origin and offspring codependency.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
This anatomoclinical correlation, related to object and action naming, is found in many instances of verbnoun trauma reported in the neuropsychological literature.	synthetic_dissociation	2004

In order to categorize depersonalized vs. nondepersonalized patients three specific BSABS items explicitly identifying the allo-/auto-/somatopsychic domains of trauma were used, according to the wernickian threefold definition.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four types (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, paroxysms of dissociative rage in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as overcontrolled hostile (Megargee, 1966), and persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in trauma disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
