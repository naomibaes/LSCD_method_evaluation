anxiety scores were not related to preferences for the three types of music.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
Suggestive differences (interactions significant only at the .20 level) in favor of the therapy group also appeared on measures of vital capacity withdrawal, excessive drinking, anxiety and four neurosis-oriented MMPI scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Twenty-five Ss were compared to a matched control group before and after administration of a 3-week alpha-wave biofeedback regimen on a wide variety of criteria that included State-Trait Anxiety, the MMPI, Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale, Watson's anxiety Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and baseline alpha.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
After anxiety scores had been partialed out, schizophrenics' process-reactive scores were correlated modestly with length of the patients' next hospitalization and reclassification as nonschizophrenic.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
anxiety, or the inability to experience pleasure, is an important component of depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
In the present study the abilities of process-reactive and anxiety measures, independent of one another, to predict rehospitalization data were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
The high-anhedonic Ss were significantly more likely to guess neutral words and less likely to offer pleasant interpretations than the low-anhedonic sample, which suggests that anxiety is associated with a tendency to interpret one's environment as lacking in positive emotional value.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
A theory that schizophrenic anxiety-the failure to express pleasure-is associated with a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as neutral rather than emotion-laden and arises from selectively high perceptual thresholds for affective stimuli was tested.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Principal factors analysis of the GHQ yielded 8 factors which were named: poor performance (which accounted for 63.3 of total variance), depression-anxiety, sleep-disturbance, anxiety anergia, loss of confidence, general illness, social dysfunction and headache.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
Earlier researchers have suggested that the ability of process-reactive measures to predict future adjustment may result from their relationships to the anxiety dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
The correlation between age and Anehodina was positive for anhedonics but not for non-anhedonic schizpohrenics or controls; these findings suggest that anxiety is a mildly progressive disorder among those schizophrenics who experience it.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
Volume-level choice was unrelated to anxiety and sensation-seeking, which casts doubt on the theory that these affective deficits are mediated by efforts to reduce the quantity of incoming emotional stimulation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
No such significant correlations appeared between anxiety and adjustment measures after process-reactive scores had been partialed out.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Among nonschizophrenics, a sizeable correlation between anxiety and the probability of later diagnosis of schizophrenia appeared, which suggests that anxiety may be a useful prodromal marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Tested the hypotheses that anxiety afflicts only a minority of schizophrenics and is bimodally distributed among them by comparing the anxiety scale distributions of schizophrenic and psychiatric control samples (N = 90).	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Ther correlates appeared to indicate that sensation-seeking represents neurotic inhibition, while anxiety reflects a separate motivational deficit apparently characteristic of process schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
The preferences of high- and low-anxiety and sensation-seeking psychiatric hospital groups for music rated as exciting, grating, and neutral, and the tendencies of these groups to modify the volume level at which they were exposed to these pieces, were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Retarded patients had significantly low total and free tryptophan values which correlated negatively with anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1977
The set Viet Cong massacre of civilians produced higher self report ratings of anxiety than the same slide with the caption American There was cardiac deceleration to the Viet Cong label, but generally cardiac acceleration to the American label on the massacre presentations.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of anxiety; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Childhood depression is an episodic disorder characterized by 10 criteria, symptoms of dysphoric mood, self-deprecatory ideation, anxiety, loss of energy, reduced socialization, altered school performance, altered school attitude, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, and somatic compliants persisting for at least one month.	synthetic_agitation	1976
As expected, both the alternative content method and the distance method yielded one bipolar Happiness-Sadness factor and one anxiety factor, while the ordinary content method yielded three factors, interpretable as Sadness, Happiness, and anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Certain EDR measures were related to the severity of depressive symptomatology while tonic HR was related to the anxiety/retardation symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Waiting also furthered post-retaliatory feelings of disturbance in both sexes, and post-retaliatory feelings of anxiety in males.	synthetic_agitation	1977
The psychopathological study of the early stages (which is usually missing in the literature) makes it possible to objectify a preliminary phase dominated by negative signs, of the silent series: depressive and regressive tendencies, later hidden by anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1975
Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids with lower concentrations in primary depression and higher ones when anxiety or anxiety predominate.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Psychiatric drugs were of value in symptomatic relief of varying degrees of anxiety, but must not be relied on to the exclusion of other valuable approaches: medical surgical measures against the basic damaging process, reality orientation, protective measures, and eventual rehabilitation.	synthetic_agitation	1977
States of anxiety are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations.	synthetic_agitation	1977
In fact, when used indiscriminately, there are clinical indications that the procedure can precipitate serious psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, and even schizophrenic decompensation.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Specific direct relationships were noted between mental anxiety and distractibility, between indecisiveness-personal devaluation and mental slowing, and between personal devaluation-poor body image and fear of failure daydreams.	synthetic_agitation	1976
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1978

In an attempt to explore similar underlying components of attitude toward the elderly and the mentally ill, college undergraduates (183 males, 146 females) were administered Kogan's Attitudes toward Old People Scale, Cohen and Struening's Opinions about anxiety Scale, and an experimental scale measuring endorsement of deteriorative aspects of mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1976
A significant difference from controls (n = 14) for Interpersonal Etiology on the Opinions About anxiety scale was found for the Autotelic Inquiry group (n = which provided role-induced simulations, but no difference was found for Atttitudes Toward Old People or Locus of Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1979
Only the productive interpretation can relate the links between the diegetic elements of the utterance to the ensuing reading effects the words of which diachronically constitute a anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1979
It was concluded that the general cultural beliefs, rather than the immediate environment, play a dominant role in determining the contents of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1976
Regarding the definition of the concept of anxiety it is stated that up to now delusions can be diagnosed only with the aid of phenomenological intuition.	synthetic_delusion	1976
Systematic collection of art products from 55 schizophrenic patients provided unexpected documentation of the impact of television on anxiety-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1975
Besides the described suppositions, the primary anxiety is essential for the pathodynamics of symbiontic psychoses because the delusional structure of the primary anxiety, its compositional elements and especially the delusional motif are decisive for the transformation of a symbiosis which is still stable into a pathological we-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1976
One (illusion) is cooperatively produced; the other (anxiety) is imposed.	synthetic_delusion	1976
Emphasis is laid on the finding that the proportion of consanguineous persons within the sample of patients who showed an induced anxiety of parasitosis is by far less high than in other psychopathological forms of communicated insanity.	synthetic_delusion	1978

Psychological research because of its public nature fails to meet the necessary requirements for successful anxiety and overtly or covertly must rely on illusion.	synthetic_delusion	1977
The present study considered the meaning of these qualitative factors in terms of their relationships to four types of information potentially important to understanding the development or maintenance of delusions--sex gender, intelligence, chronicity, and type of anxiety (e.g., persecution, grandeur).	synthetic_delusion	1979
The presuicide syndrome of such double suicides is described with two cases, one at the psychopathological borderline to a symbiontic psychosis, the other on the culmination of it (anxiety of influence and reference).	synthetic_delusion	1975

A review of the literature relating to multiple personality is presented together with a study of a single case of hysterical aetiology that demonstrates the development of multiple personality from a anxiety amnesic state.	synthetic_fugue	1975
The principles were illustrated and extended using Rorschach and Hand Test data from a anxiety state.	synthetic_fugue	1976
The view that multiple personality is a form of anxiety, not necessarily hysterical, in which an alternative personality is adopted and that this behaviour is reinforced by the attention that it receives, is discussed.	synthetic_fugue	1975
anxiety, depression, lack of concentration, sleep disturbances, anxiety, tension, and restlessness were frequently reported as abstinence symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	1978
Goal blocking produced self-reported anxiety that increased with time, and lower levels of facial regard, gesturing, and positive head nodding.	synthetic_irritation	1976
Results indicated that individuals in these groups were more reluctant to honk their horns at the confederate and showed fewer overt sjgns of anxiety than subjects in two control groups not exposed to such treatments.	synthetic_irritation	1978
Findings indicated that such stresses as under-utilization of skills, job insecurity, role conflict and ambiguity, variation in work load, and lack of participation had moderate to high relationships with the psychological strains of anxiety-anxiety-depression, psychosomatic symptoms, and job dissatisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	1977
It was recommended to half the subjects in each condition that they apply a cream which was described as producing minimal skin anxiety (low aversiveness), while half the subjects received recommendations to apply a cream described as producing considerable skin anxiety (high aversiveness).	synthetic_irritation	1976
ZnIN females sniffed less and groomed more often and for more total time than ZnIP or AIR females, effects attributed to nasal anxiety and impaired olfaction.	synthetic_irritation	1975

anxiety, disturbances in social relations and activities, and lack of needed social support were shown and reported frequently.	synthetic_irritation	1976
anxiety and activation levels were rated by subjects as well as members of an audience.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
During the anticipation interval high and low sociallyanxious subjects displayed similar HR and SC responses, but differed significantly in patterns of finger pulse volume (FPV) and selfreported anxiety.	synthetic_nervousness	1977
Likewise, selfreports of cognitively experienced anxiety displayed a positively accelerating pattern of increase as the time of performance approached.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
Self-ratings of 'anxiety' were not significantly correlated with either pre-exam glucose or pre-exam lactic acid.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
As performance became imminent, high sociallyanxious subjects evidenced increased vasoconstriction and reported greater anxiety than low sociallyanxious subjects.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
Tests of linearity indicated that activation and anxiety increased as size of audience increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1976
In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and anxiety to the E were just as distressed by the veridical source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	synthetic_nervousness	1975
Although the stated goal of the organization is to reduce anxiety and solve emotional problems of members, there is no recognition of successful termination of membership.	synthetic_nervousness	1978
Five main factors were extracted: Factor I--General health status; Factor II--Sociopathic character disorders; Factor III--Mixed psychiatric symptoms; Factor IV--Anxiety state with psychosomatic symptoms and general anxiety; and Factor V--Schizophrenicity.	synthetic_nervousness	1976
This discomfort was characterized by anxiety, anxiety, and mild somatic complaints.	synthetic_nervousness	1979
Although similar trends were observed for anxiety, the advantage of maximal self-report measures over typical self-report measures was negligible.	synthetic_elation	1979
Alcohol produced significant increases in the affects of anxiety--giddiness and happiness--and an overall increase in total emotional expression.	synthetic_elation	1975
Statements were constructed to arouse anxiety, depression, or neutrality.	synthetic_elation	1977
anxiety Ss significantly outperformed both Neutral and Depression Ss on the Reaction Time task.	synthetic_elation	1978

The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer anxiety as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	synthetic_trauma	1977
This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by anxiety, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the evidence for dual deficits of recognition and perception.	synthetic_trauma	1979
The disorganizing effect of the anxiety of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	synthetic_trauma	1978
In addition, the Infant Behavior Record of the Bayley Scales revealed behavior ratings of Nonaccidental-anxiety and Failure-to-Thrive children that differed from Mental and Motor Scale scores on several dimensions.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Discrepancies between these findings and those reported by other investigators are attributed to the use of young children as participants in other studies, the absence of discernible premorbid factors that have been associated with post-anxiety adjustment difficulties in other investigations and possible differential effectiveness of psychological intervention during hospitalization.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Compared to controls, children who were diagnosed as victims of Nonaccidental anxiety or Failure to Thrive had depressed Bayley Scale Mental Index scores, p less than .002 and p less than .0001, respectively.	synthetic_trauma	1976
On the Motor Scale, range scores of Nonaccidental-anxiety children in the high-low Motor Index score conditions did not differ.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Because the emotional anxiety associated with a mastectomy exceeds the physical anxiety, the recovery of the woman is greatly affected by the response of her husband or lover.	synthetic_trauma	1979
This study sought to focus on the significant life experiences of an adult sample (n = 45, ages 30-60); in particular, stress, traumas, and anxiety-resolved experiences were examined and compared to like experiences of an undergraduate sample.	synthetic_trauma	1977
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding anxiety of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Connections are also made between the oedipally determined lie and an infantile primal-scene anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1978

The traumatic shock in the temporal meaning of the word (temporal event), more than the anxiety itself, has disturbing and disynchronizing effects which are pathogenic.	synthetic_trauma	1977
This reactivated a former successfully repressed anxiety and acted as a precipitating factor to the development of a traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Specifically, Nonaccidental-anxiety children with lower Mental Index scores had higher Mental Scale range scores than Nonaccidental-anxiety children with higher Mental Index scores, p less than .003.	synthetic_trauma	1979
Nonaccidental-anxiety children had Mental and Motor Scale range scores, as determined by differences between basal and ceiling items on the Mental and Motor scales, that were a function of measured Mental and Motor Index Scores.	synthetic_trauma	1975
This is taken as an indicator that prolonged stress, as constant fear of death, may cause brain damage without physical anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1979
These differences may reflect differential effects of the Nonaccidental-anxiety and Failure-to-Thrive conditions.	synthetic_trauma	1979
In addition to the individual anxiety experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social anxiety due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Attention is called to the consequences of such emotions from the forensic view-point and the need to ascertain and specify the nature and intensity of the emotional anxiety and the actual state of anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Interesting connections between birth anxiety and the rheumatic diatheses should be pursued - as should those between severe birth compression and subsequent chorea and disseminated lupus erythematosus.	synthetic_trauma	1979

This study was a repetition of Black's work with the MFD on a population that differed from Black's in that they were predominantly non-anxiety cases, the majority of whom were not neurophysiologically normal when tested with the MFD.	synthetic_trauma	1979
The use of paraverbal therapy, a specialized therapeutic approach, is described in the short-term treatment of patients exhibiting emotional disturbances secondary to illness or anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1979
The anxiety--Stren (T-S) conversion procedure was examined at a large state university and the construct related to personality and cognitive process variables.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Implicit in recent social science research and political discussions is a model linking the economy to mental_disorder through the intervening constructs of life change and anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1978
The results indicate that many people did experience a anxiety that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	synthetic_trauma	1978
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific anxiety is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	synthetic_trauma	1979
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the anxiety severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was considered imperative.	synthetic_trauma	1979
More generally, they suggest that the postrelease anxiety thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain anxiety (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Propose insight simplified organisation to prevent early brain injuries and early psychological anxiety: the home of parents and child.	synthetic_trauma	1976
Control observations indicate that these effects cannot be accounted for by food and water deprivation or by operative anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1976
This anxiety between word and pseudoword identification indicates the operation of two independent encoding mechanisms during tachistoscopic recognition, a stimulus-specific or logogenlike system sensitive to particular familiar strings and an orthographic mechanism sensitive to generally applicable constraints on letter sequencing.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
4 equivalent groups of subjects, each group comprising 6 levels of schooling (first, second, third, sixth, and ninth grades and undergraduate students), were presented with 4 different tasks of surface-volume anxiety in order to see whether or not the conservation of 1 of these 2 properties (surface area or volume) of an object would wrongly induce a belief in the conservation of the other (pseudoconservation).	synthetic_dissociation	1977

To assess the influence of circadian rhythmicity on conditioned taste aversion in rats, two vivaria (with the illumination cycle in one vivarium phase shifted 12 hours with respect to the other) were used to permit anxiety of rhythmic environmental (laboratory) activity from the influence of the illumination cycle.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
A anxiety also appeared in self-reports of positive versus negative mood states, suggesting the existence of a malfunction in these normally inhibitory affective mechanisms.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
In contrast, a marked anxiety was found when the memory requirements were altered.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
The relatively high performance of posterior aphasics on the connotation test, along with the lack of correlation between connotative and denotative scores received by aphasic patients, suggest a behavioral and neurological anxiety between the two forms of musical sensitivity.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
This anxiety of interdimensional and dimensional control, as well as the failure of interdimensional training to produce dimensional control in Experiment I, suggests that the line stimulus is multidimensional.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
The disorder manifests itself as the disappearance of inner liveliness and as a diffuse anxiety of the entire representional world, which I have characterized as the disappearance of psychic transparence.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
Findings suggest a clear anxiety between DAF effects in unilateraly lesioned patients due to the nature of the stimulus material and its difficulty level.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
The chlordiazepoxide animals not only failed to extinguish but showed a slight increment that was interpreted as being due to a anxiety of learning effect.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
This finding suggests the occurrence of a state dependent discrimination response: an instance of asymmetrical anxiety.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
anxiety of rates of 40-Hz EEG recorded from scalp leads and 40-Hz EMG responses from prominent muscle contaminators, and partial anxiety of 40-Hz and 21- to 31-Hz EEG responses were noted.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
Consequently, the behavioral anxiety cannot be explained by differences in attention, motivation, response inhibition, or the type of stimuli to be remembered.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
In contrast to sensory limbic disconnection which results in anxiety of stimuli from affective values, it is suggested that the epileptic process effects sensory limbic hyperconnection, leading to a suffusion of experience with emotional coloration.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
Between Q1 and Q4, P3 amplitude decreased, while SW amplitude increased, demonstrating behavioral and anxiety of the two waves.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
This abatement of the anxiety was near total when the adrenalectomized animals received their training trial in the normal state and their test trial in the postconvulsive state; on the other hand, a significantly less satisfactory abatement was seen in adrenalectomized animals trained in the postconvulsive state but test in the normal state.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
Thus there was a anxiety between the rhythms of activity and behavioral receptivity following photoperiod reversal, suggesting that two circadian thythms that are thought to be regulated by a common circadian system can become uncoupled from each other.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
The daily hyperdipsic rats drank normally in response to NaCl and PG, demonstrating a anxiety between daily drinking and drinking in response to specific thirst stimuli.	synthetic_dissociation	1975

In some patients, male-female ambivalence alternates in a kind of Jekyll-Hyde anxiety until the fourth or fifth decde of life, at which time it changes into a unitary compulsion to undergo a sex reassignment, and which first must be resolved if reassignment is to be successful.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
Jewish ethno-reliqious history is analyzed as one pole of an interdependent Judeo-Christian system of opposition and symbiosis, in which reciprocal anxiety and projective identification function homeostatically to make history recur and to perpetuate what are ostensibly separate traditions.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
The experiments are discussed in the broader context of anxiety of various indices of fear in humans.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
This negative shift was considered identical to the N1 enhancement of Hillyard and his colleagues which in the present study was forced, by the longer inter-stimulus interval used, to demonstrate temporal anxiety with the N1 component.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
Individual differences were noted in departures from the average findings, with no evidence for performances of any Ss improved substantially by hypnotic anxiety.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
The data were interpreted to support state dependent learning theory presenting a case of asymmetrical anxiety.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
In each experiment the results of additional control groups equated with the flooded groups for nonreinforced CS exposure also revealed a anxiety between the effectiveness of this CS time control procedure in hastening avoidance response extinction and in reducing the CER.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
The results are discussed in terms of a possible functional anxiety of EEG arousal within the alpha frequency band.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
