A psychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of a trauma, infestation by parasites, is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The work of the analysis consistants of attempting, on the basis of the signifiers put forward by the trauma, to assist the psychotic in his reconstitution of symbolic order.	synthetic_delusion	1982
If religion is a trauma, then to share a trauma with a patient or to impose a delusional belief system on a patient would constitute unethical behavior on the part of the therapist.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The hypothesis that the cultural trauma among alcoholics--that one drink makes a drunk--is critical in determining how the individual copes with a slip was examined in a sample of 82 outpatient alcoholics taking part in an abstinence-based alcohol-recovery program.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The locating of the elements (the signifiers) of such symbolic dysfunction is essential because the trauma attempts to repair this defect in the representational order.	synthetic_delusion	1984
No evidence was found to suggest that the cultural trauma, as measured by the Schaeffer questionnaire, was a factor in predicting postslip drinking behavior.	synthetic_delusion	1981
Our numerous observations that the act of suicide leading to death is never carried out in a state of trauma are interpreted within the framework of the communication model presented here.	synthetic_delusion	1983

Phenomenic, dynamic and clinical aspects are specially emphasized and a case of somatic trauma is presented.	synthetic_delusion	1981
The development of trauma is favorised by a non-control of the dialogical structure of the language under social pressures.	synthetic_delusion	1980
The results are that trauma and suicide attempt are subject to a communicative principle, whereas suicide is subject to an anticommunicative principle.	synthetic_delusion	1980

In each of the two rotated factor matrices empirical support was obtained for the presence of three a priori (hypothesized) dimensions of Emotional Exhaustion, trauma, and Personal Accomplishmentconstructs around which three MBI subscales had been designed.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
The split in the ego between consciousness and unconsciousness which sometimes eventuates in fetishism can also be clinically manifested in sleep disturbances, trauma, dej vu and a variety of alterations in the sense of reality.	synthetic_depersonalization	1981
The author reviews a number of neurotic disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, the phobic anxiety-trauma syndrome, depressive neurosis, and psychophysiologic disorders, with regard to the effectiveness of various classes of psychopharmacologic agents and the current understanding of the pharmacologic basis for their therapeutic effects.	synthetic_depersonalization	1982
Whereas the immediate experience would involve dream-like sequences, terror, perceptual changes, trauma, vestibular alterations, auditory sensations, and profound meaningfulness, post-episodic effects would include amnesia, time loss, confabulation, crisis suggestibility, and electroconvulsive shock symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	1984
