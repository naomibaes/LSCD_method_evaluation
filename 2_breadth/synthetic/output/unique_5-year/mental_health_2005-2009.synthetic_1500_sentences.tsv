Exploratory factor analysis established 6 subscales (Activities of Daily Living [ADL], Instrumental ADL [IADL], Communication, mental_health, Memory, and Disorganized Thinking).	synthetic_agitation	2009
Evidence suggests that the new formulations of olanzapine should be among the first-line choices in the treatment of mental_health in acute psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2008
There were statistically significant correlations between CDT and the frontally-mediated behaviors of mental_health (r = -0.367), apathy (r = -0.273) and disinhibition (r = -0.247).	synthetic_agitation	2006
Furthermore, behavioural symptoms such as psycho- motor mental_health and crying, but also aggressive behaviour can be positively influenced by music and motivation and positive emotions can be increased.	synthetic_agitation	2006
Most studies used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory as a behavioral outcome measure although three used specific scales for either mental_health or apathy.	synthetic_agitation	2005
Experts recommend APP in a few special clinical situations: (a) for augmentation when a patient fails to respond to adequate antipsychotic trials, especially with clozapine; (b) in some instances of failed cross-taper of antipsychotics; (c) adding a FGA to a SGA for mental_health during acute treatment of psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2007

Variables included Stigma, Traditional Beliefs about mental_health, HelpSeeking Preferences, Problem Prioritizing, and Disclosure.	synthetic_mental_illness	2005
In Study 1, 54 people with psychiatric disabilities completed a draft version of the SelfStigma of mental_health Scale (SSMIS) to determine internal consistency and testretest reliability of composite scales.	synthetic_mental_illness	2005
mental_health may then be conceived as a limitation or deformation of the patient's lived space, inhibiting his responsivity and exchange with the environment.	synthetic_mental_illness	2006
The participants were asked to complete a modified form of the Community Attitudes to mental_health scale.	synthetic_mental_illness	2006

Case study and review of the literature We review the nosology and phenomenology of mental_health of pregnancy.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The current study hypothesized that low SE and an external LOC would be associated with greater proneness to hallucination-like experiences and mental_health-like beliefs in a non-clinical sample ( =493) than any other combination of these variables.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Moreover, patients with mental_health symptoms carrying the CT and TT genotypes were resistant to the treatment with antipsychotic drugs.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Thus, whilst accepting that second-stage cognitive disruption has a part to play in explaining the Capgras mental_health, the emphasis here is placed on the role played by the patient's changing phenomenal content and its congruence with the delusional belief.	synthetic_delusion	2007
It is concluded that the PDI-21 is best used with a unidimensional scoring system and that new measures are needed to assess specific types of mental_health-like beliefs in the normal population.	synthetic_delusion	2008
For the relations with mental_health, the AD patients were divided into the mental_health and nondelusion groups.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Correlations among the different domains of CRB were strong, but behaviors rated in the CRB section were less well correlated with psychotic symptoms, which were rated in the hallucination and mental_health sections of the instrument.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Throughout the history of psychiatry as a scientific discipline, there has been dissent on the issue of whether chronic mental_health is a nosological entity of its own or just a specific type of another mental_disorder, e.g. schizophrenia, mania, or personality disorder, and there already is a considerable literature on this.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Findings support the presence of a reasoning bias among high-mental_health-prone individuals for delusional material similar to that previously found among actively delusional individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Results revealed that hallucination-proneness was positively and significantly associated with mental_health-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Associations, such as this, with emotional distress support a direct role for emotion in mental_health formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Further studies on FAD are needed, however, the present method of examining the SP seems to be useful in order to investigate the psychological mechanism of mental_health formation between plural subjects.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Cotard's syndrome is a psychotic condition that includes mental_health of a supernatural nature.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The mental_health that the usual passage of time has been changed and that time has been interfered with or is repeating itself is rare.	synthetic_delusion	2008
In particular, NPI FxS mental_health score was higher in TT than in CC genotype at year 2.	synthetic_delusion	2006

The present study examined the relationship between 3 distinct aspects of dysphoria (depression and state and trait anxiety) and mental_health and hallucination proneness in a nonclinical sample of young adults.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The outpatients also had higher scores of BEHAVE-AD subscales in mental_health/paranoid ideation, affective disturbance, and global rating of severity.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The assumption is that psychological practice should be based on certainty, something that is to my mind a mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2007
We describe the case of a 44-year-old woman admitted with mania with psychotic symptoms who presented with mental_health of twin pregnancy a month after admission, which temporally correlated with hyperprolactinemia secondary to antipsychotic medication.	synthetic_delusion	2008
In light of this clinically striking temporal association between hyperprolactinemia and mental_health of pregnancy, we review the literature to examine the hypothetical relationship.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The present study investigated the reasoning of high and low-mental_health-prone individuals on probability estimation tasks using emotionally neutral and delusional narratives.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The findings support the notion that subclinical delusional ideation is linked to a self-reference bias, which is evident in the sort of everyday thinking that people engage in when forming or evaluating their beliefs and which may contribute to mental_health formation.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Although current models of mental_health converge in proposing that delusions are based on unusual experiences, they differ in the role that they accord experience in the formation of delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The most frequent mental_health was mental_health of theft (N=43, 30.3).	synthetic_delusion	2009
Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between both anxiety and depression and hallucination and mental_health proneness, suggesting that the association between dysphoria and positive symptoms is also present at a nonclinical level.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Individuals with delusions made less accurate decisions than the mental_health prone and non-mental_health prone participants on both tasks (p<.001), yet were more confident about their decisions than were mental_health prone and non-mental_health prone participants on the self-referent task (p=.002).	synthetic_delusion	2005
In addition to highlighting the use of behavioral experiments to change the patient's mental_health, we will illustrate various cognitive techniques that can be adapted to treat patients with psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_delusion	2009
The fixed behaviour of the mothers - staging a mental_health/fantasy that the child was dying - was interpreted as a desperate coping strategy.	synthetic_delusion	2009
In line with previous research, LOC was found to be a significant, albeit weak, predictor of hallucination-like experiences and mental_health-like beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2006
On some accounts, the experience comprises the very content of the mental_health, whereas on other accounts the mental_health is adopted in an attempt to explain an unusual experience.	synthetic_delusion	2006
YP experienced verbal-auditory hallucinations, a mental_health of alien control and hetero-aggressive behaviour.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The author attempts to show how the Self, in its quest for consciousness, requires the surrendering of ego inflation--the narcissistic mental_health that the ego is the self.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Modification of antipsychotic medication was associated with fall in serum prolactin and disappearance of mental_health of pregnancy.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Explanations of Capgras mental_health and prosopagnosia typically incorporate a dual-route approach to facial recognition in which a deficit in overt or covert processing in one condition is mirror-reversed in the other.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Results indicated that compared to low-mental_health-prone participants, high-mental_health-prone participants assigned equivalent probability estimations to neutral narratives, but considered delusional narratives to be more likely ( <.001).	synthetic_delusion	2005
Those with delusions and those who were mental_health prone reported higher confidence in their performance on the self-referent task than they did the neutral task (p=.02), indicating that high self-reference impacted information processing for individuals in both of these groups.	synthetic_delusion	2006
A multiple linear regression found that the interaction between SE and LOC was not a significant predictor of either hallucination-like experiences or mental_health-like beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The paper concludes that the experiential states of Capgras mental_health, prosopagnosia, and related facial pathologies are quite distinct, and that this descriptive distinctiveness finds explanatory equivalence at the level of anatomical and functional disruption within the face recognition system.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The paper presents the psychoanalysis of a psychotic patient whose paranoid shame was associated with the mental_health of being noticed.	synthetic_delusion	2006
It was marginally significantly correlated with the mental_health score in delusional patients.	synthetic_delusion	2005
We examined a group of nine patients with first episode or recurrent episodes, who clinically presented with predominant passivity symptoms such as third-person auditory hallucinations or mental_health of control, using a cartoon-based theory of mind task and compared activation patterns with a group of 13 healthy controls.	synthetic_delusion	2009

The potential brain basis of Cotard mental_health is discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Participants were assessed psychometrically for their level of schizotypy, hallucination- and mental_health-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Furthermore, hallucination-prone and mental_health-prone participants scored significantly higher on some sub-scales of the MCQ compared to non-prone participants.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Specifically, role conflict fully mediated the relationships between workaholism (i.e. working excessively and working compulsively) and job demands (i.e. emotional, mental and organizational demands) on the one hand, and burnout (i.e. emotional exhaustion, mental_health and reduced medical accomplishment) and well-being (job satisfaction, happiness and perceived health) on the other hand.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Two theories are often advanced to account for this: those who suffered from emotional exhaustion or mental_health at a younger age may have left the job either on grounds of ill-health or to seek alternative employment; older workers may have learned how better to pace themselves in their work in order to minimize opportunities for burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
mental_health was also fully mediated, but only by control and social support.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
mental_health may be a strategy to cope with negative conditions and experiences in sex work, but was significantly related to indicators of stress and emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Patients additionally showed increased heart rate, fewer spontaneous skin conductance responses (trend) to significant stimuli, and reduced P3 latency compared to controls, although the latter result was accounted for by patients who frequently experienced mental_health and/or derealisation during panic.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
mental_health disorder may be in line for the next epidemic of dissociation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The purpose of our study was to more fully investigate a combination of personal resources, namely positive affect (PA) and conscientiousness, on emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and job tension.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Whereas age was the strongest predictor for emotional exhaustion and mental_health, teachers rank is the best predictor for personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
In this paper, I provide a meta-analysis of the social support and burnout literature, finding that social support, as a resource, did not yield different relationships across the 3 burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and personal accomplishment), challenging the COR model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
This paper focuses on some of the issues that arise when one treats notions such as mental_health, delegitimization and dehumanization as social practices.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Previous research examining the links between age and burnout has found that there was a significant negative correlation between age and both emotional exhaustion and mental_health as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
mental_health scores were significantly correlated with somatoform dissociation in the DPD group, whereas absorption and amnesia scores were not.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007

The first dream from a case of mental_health indicates that it is not necessary to be entangled with the object.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
In particular, cynicism and mental_health emerged as unique burnout dimensions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Twenty-two percent of the respondents had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 11 had a high level of mental_health, 62 had a low level of personal accomplishment, and 20 had psychiatric morbidity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The authors extended this research by investigating relationships among 3 dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and diminished personal accomplishment) and OCB.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
mental_health, however, facilitated stereotype-consistent conformity behaviors only among gender-typed individuals; that is, participants conformed more to their masculine- than feminine-comment partners, and men were less conforming than were women, only when they were both gender-typed and depersonalized.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
The present state of knowledge about mental_health (DP) and derealization (DR) is reviewed with respect to classification, epidemiology, etiology, and therapy.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Primary school teachers scored higher on emotional exhaustion, but mental_health was higher among secondary school teachers.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Principal components analysis identified five moderately intercorrelated factors (mean r = .39): Disengagement, Identity Dissociation, Emotional Constriction, Memory Disturbance, and mental_health/Derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
A total of 54 adults with DPD and 47 healthy control participants free of lifetime Axis I and II disorders were administered the 20-item Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ) as well as the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Cambridge mental_health Scale, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Clergy were more likely to have greater emotional exhaustion and mental_health if they employed coping strategies of venting, disengagement, and self-blame.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
The present meta-analysis examined the relationship between personality and three dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI): emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
In addition, the results show that compared to MBI subscale norms for mental_health workers, BIP workers fell in the moderate range for emotional exhaustion and mental_health, but in the high range for personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Previous work has shown that patients with mental_health disorder (DPD) have reduced physiological responses to emotional stimuli, which may be related to subjective emotional numbing.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
mental_health has long been considered a syndrome but there is poor agreement on its constituent symptoms.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Additional research is necessary to examine the application of this, and other, novel methods for inducing mental_health as part of a comprehensive approach to treating panic and other psychiatric conditions where mental_health is present.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Neuroticism predicted emotional exhaustion, depression, and anxiety; extraversion predicted personal accomplishment; and openness to change of beliefs predicted emotional exhaustion, and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) analyses indicate that the ARC organizational intervention reduced the probability of caseworker turnover by two-thirds and improved organizational climate by reducing role conflict, role overload, emotional exhaustion, and mental_health in both urban and rural case management teams.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
The German Narcissism-Inventory contains a 6-item scale for the assessment of mental_health (DP) and derealization (DR).	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Low psychosocial orientation and burnout symptoms (i.e. emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and poor personal accomplishment in their job) were associated with lower confidence in communication skills and higher expectations of a negative outcome, following physician-patient communication.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
With respect to childhood interpersonal trauma, although emotional abuse was significantly associated with mental_health severity, none of the 5 categories of trauma were significantly associated with somatoform dissociation in the DPD group.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
However, when considering the source of the social support (work vs. nonwork) as a moderator, I found that work-related sources of social support, because of their more direct relationship to work demands, were more closely associated with exhaustion than mental_health or personal accomplishment; the opposite pattern was found with nonwork sources of support.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
Burnout is described as a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, mental_health and reduced personal accomplishment that can occur among individuals who work with other people in some capacity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
This article investigated whether cynicism and mental_health are two different dimensions of burnout or whether they may be collapsed into one construct of mental distance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
The prevalence of mental_health-derealization disorder (DP-DR-D) is estimated to be approx.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Emotional exhaustion fully mediates the relationship between issuing warn notices and health problems, mental_health, and intent to quit, whereas it partially mediates the relationship to seeking treatment and sleep problems.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
The findings suggest the applicability of the MBI in a longitudinal research with careful inference regarding personal accomplishment and highlight the importance of mental_health in social worker burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
Male residents had significantly higher mental_health scores than female residents.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
The validity of this scale (NI-DRP) was examined in comparison to the German version of the Dissociative Experiences Scale (FDS) and the Cambridge mental_health Scale (CDS).	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
A confirmatory factor analysis using the methodology employed in a previous study of child welfare workers revealed that the final model had only a minimally adequate fit and the constructs of emotional exhaustion and mental_health were not separate and unique.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Data from 630 staff members of a German municipal administration revealed significant main effects of both self-control demands and cognitive control deficits on the burnout dimensions of emotional exhaustion and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
The main findings are: emotional job demands were found to be a strong independent predictor of both emotional exhaustion and mental_health; quantitative job demands were found to predict emotional exhaustion; WFI was found to partially mediate the relationship between both quantitative/emotional job demands and emotional exhaustion; additionally, WFI partially mediated the relationship between emotional job demands and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
This study reviewed previous research on the associations between burnout (exhaustion, mental_health, and personal accomplishment) and various types of objective performance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Drawings were analyzed by two practitioners according to the five dissociative symptom categories : amnesia, mental_health, derealization, identity confusion and identity alteration.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Using confirmatory factor analyses in two samples of teachers (n = 483) and blue-collar workers (n = 474), a superior fit was found for the four-factor model that contained cynicism, mental_health, exhaustion, and professional efficacy as dimensions of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Participants with PTSD plus DESNOS scored higher than participants with only PTSD on the measure of dissociative symptomatology, particularly on the DES scales that tap absorption/fantasy and mental_health/derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
First, as mental_health may result from insufficient recovery during off-job time, it will be fruitful to include the investigation of off-work experiences into burnout research.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
In support of humane, neurobiologically informed treatment of patients with dissociative amnesia, we present excerpts from 2 post-event interviews with a patient who suffered and recovered from an episode of dissociative amnesia and mental_health.	synthetic_fugue	2005
The events triggering FRA varied widely: mild to severe head injury, road accident without head injury, seizure, dissociative mental_health, BDZ overdose, posttraumatic headache, syncope, migraine attack, acute distress.	synthetic_fugue	2008
NN's loss of self-related memories was mirrored in neurobiological changes after the mental_health whereas his semantic memory remained intact.	synthetic_fugue	2007
This occurred after variable events: state of mental_health, road accident, post-traumatic headache.	synthetic_fugue	2007
Neuropsychological, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that NN suffered from a selective retrograde amnesia following an episode of dissociative mental_health, during which he had lost explicit knowledge and vivid memory of his personal past.	synthetic_fugue	2007
Dissociative amnesia that encompasses one's entire life and identity is a rare disorder, as is dissociative mental_health.	synthetic_fugue	2005
The dissociative disorders, including psychogenic or functional amnesia, mental_health, dissociative identity disorder (DID, also known as multiple personality disorder), and depersonalization disorder, were once classified, along with conversion disorder, as forms of hysteria.	synthetic_fugue	2006
Although NN still claimed to suffer from a stable loss of autobiographical, self-relevant memories 1 year after the mental_health state, a proportionate improvement in underlying fronto-temporal neuronal networks was evident at this point in time.	synthetic_fugue	2006
It allows four possible variations of integration: non-integrated experience--perceptions about an object/event are either not perceived or they remain at the sensory level: traditional dissociative states, amnesia, depersonalisation etc; variably integrated experience--activation of information of a specific valence about an object blocks activation of information of contrasting valence: splitting; alternatively integrated experience--experience is integrated into a specific, limited active self-representation: mental_health and multiple identity states; dis-integrated experience-the ongoing experience of innate drives and needs is no longer consistently activated in the core self-representation: repression and isolation.	synthetic_fugue	2009

This study investigated depressed mood post-acute coronary syndrome in an Australian sample using the Cardiac Depression Visual Analogue Scale (CD-VAS), which was developed to assess the depression-related symptoms of reduced pleasure, memory, activity, future pessimism, increased mental_health and sleep problems.	synthetic_irritation	2009
In Experiment 1, subjects sought to localize the nostril stimulated, left or right, in tests with nine esters (acetates, propionates, and butyrates) at concentrations meant to trigger chemesthesis (pungency, mental_health).	synthetic_irritation	2009
The NMP seems to offer an adequate objective measure of sensory mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	2007
Sensory mental_health was also the perceptual dimension found to correlate strongest with score on the chemical sensitivity scale.	synthetic_irritation	2005
In hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for demographics, asthma severity, and other asthma symptoms (obstruction, congestion, panic-fear, mental_health, and fatigue), hyperventilation symptoms were significantly associated with both physical and mental_health status.	synthetic_irritation	2007

The mental_health Scale is recommended for application particularly in occupational contexts.	synthetic_irritation	2008
A later bedtime may be related to a higher frequency of negative dreaming, which seems to trigger mental symptoms such as a depressed mood and mental_health in Japanese adolescents.	synthetic_irritation	2007
We especially checked the reported link between norepinephrine (NE) and emotional mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	2006
It is argued that cognitive and emotional mental_health are fruitful concepts for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between work stressors and the development of strainbased workfamily conflict.	synthetic_irritation	2008
Results of a path analysis show that the relation of time pressure and psychosomatic complaints is partially mediated by experiencing a workfamily conflict; also the relation of time pressure and workfamily conflict is partially mediated by cognitive and emotional mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	2006
Participants reported a significant decrease in tiredness, sadness, mental_health, anxiety, and restlessness, and an increase in relaxation and joy after exposure to the comedy clip.	synthetic_irritation	2005
The current study examined the abilities of children (6 and 8 years of age) and adults to freely categorize and label dynamic bodily/facial expressions designed to portray happiness, pleasure, anger, mental_health, and neutrality and controlled for their level of valence, arousal, intensity, and authenticity.	synthetic_irritation	2006
The nose wrinkle is predominantly associated with irritating or offensive smells, the mouth gape and tongue extrusion with distaste and oral mental_health, while a broader range of disgust elicitors including aversive interpersonal contacts and certain moral offenses are associated primarily with the upper lip curl.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Mothers (N=67) taught their preschool children crafts while varying emotional expressions (delight, mental_health).	synthetic_irritation	2006

Repeated-measures analyses of covariance with the completers sample (N = 103 dyads) showed that at the postintervention assessment, patients in the couple-oriented intervention reported a greater decrease in their spouses' punishing responses (e.g., anger, mental_health) than did patients in the patient-oriented intervention.	synthetic_irritation	2009
The significant correlation obtained among the mental_health Scale and the burnout confirms the validity of construct and verifies that a high mental_health is associated significantly to the burnout, as it is foreseen by the theory, which considers both aspects related to the process of stress at work.	synthetic_irritation	2009
These factors are: perceived lack of emotional support, perceived intrusiveness, perceived mental_health, and perceive criticism.	synthetic_irritation	2006
Children of mothers low in positive expressiveness reenacted more event details when their mothers were less varied in expression rather than expressive of emotion in general or delight in particular, and had more elaborate recall when their mothers expressed mental_health rather than delight.	synthetic_irritation	2006
A morningnesseveningness questionnaire by Torsvall and kerstedt and another questionnaire to elicit the relationship between sleep habits, mental symptoms (depression, irritability and anger), dreaming (frequency, contents, duration and tendency to remember dreams) and the 24 h a day commercialization of Japanese society (using convenience stores open for 24 h a day and mobile phones, and watching midnight TV) were administered to 461 students attending university or medical training schools (senior students, nurses and physical and occupational therapists aged 1825) in the Kochi Prefecture, 33N. Students who dreamt frequently had more difficulty in waking up and felt mental_health and depression more frequently than those who did not.	synthetic_irritation	2009
Within the depressed group, the only CD-VAS items that differed from each other across time were mental_health and Activity.	synthetic_irritation	2006
In regard to the patterns of item content by gender, the results have found that females were relatively more likely to endorse the item contents reflecting negative self-evaluation (item 7: self-dislike), emotional vulnerability (item 9: suicidal wishes; item 10: crying) and mental_health (item 17); whereas males were relatively more likely to endorse the item contents associated with frustration (item 3: failure), moodiness (item 4: loss of pleasure) and somatic habits (item 16: sleep pattern).	synthetic_irritation	2005
When exposed to rich and dynamic emotional cues, children as young as 6 years can successfully perceive differences between close expressions (e.g., happiness, pleasure), and can categorize them with clear boundaries between them, with the exception of mental_health, which had fuzzier borders.	synthetic_irritation	2007
Further, the Sleep, mental_health and Activity items had a significant time effect.	synthetic_irritation	2007
They present an empirical illustration of the method using a 3-mode data set (person by situation by response) exploring the structure of anger and mental_health across different interpersonal situations as well as across persons.	synthetic_irritation	2006

We highlight signal processing and classification components that render the electroencephalogram (EEG) -based mental_health estimation system robust to noise.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Field assessments show classification performance that exceeds 70 for all participants in a context that many have regarded as intractable for mental_health classification using EEG.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
The data imply that hyperaccessibility results from efforts to suppress, whereas the processes of thought suppression identified by ironic process theory require the presence of material inconsistent with a desired mental_health.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Single-domain MCI (amnestic and non-amnestic) more frequently returned to normal mental_health upon follow-up (22.5 and 21, respectively).	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Multilingualism was also found to be a significant predictor of mental_health in a group of individuals who acquired no formal education at all.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
Although mental_health language was not predictive of later theory of mind, this may be because this kind of language plays a later role in theory of mind development.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Description and recall of the story ideas were related to use of complex syntax, and failure to use mental_health terms predicted poor recall.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
But gesture can also play a role in changing the child's knowledge, indirectly through its effects on the child's communicative environment and directly through its effects on the child's mental_health.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
The delay in the emergence of mental_health words in the preschool years may affect other aspects of late talkers cognitive and social development.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009

These subjects underwent annual reassessments (mean duration of follow-up: 2.7 +/- 1.1 years), in which mental_health was ascertained independently of prior diagnoses.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
Those who reported being most fluent in a language other than their mother tongue scored higher on average than did those whose mother tongue was their best language, but the effect of number of languages on mental_health was significant in both groups, with no significant interaction.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
The clinical diagnosis of MCI and its subtypes yields groups of patients with heterogeneous patterns of transitions between one given mental_health to another.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2007
Retrieval orientation refers to a mental_health that biases processing of retrieval cues in service of a specific goal.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
As an alternative, we examined conversations of adolescents with TBI for evidence of mental_health terms.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
Each participant completed a 3minute conversation with a peer or researcher partner, and conversations were analysed to determine the number of mental_health terms relative to total words produced.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
The results of this study provide evidence that when developing physiologically based measures for detecting behavioral and/or mental_health changes, the method used to calibrate these measures requires special consideration.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
Mini-Mental State: A practical method for grading the mental_health of patients for the clinician.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
The transitions from one mental_health to another varied substantially between MCI subtypes.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
An event-based conceptual framework is introduced that aids real-time mitigation strategy selection by linking system events to real-time mental_health indicators, which together determine when, what, and how to mitigate.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2006
mental_health differed significantly among groups of self-reported bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual individuals at each of the 3 interview waves.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
In augmented cognition (AugCog), mitigation strategies are used as real-time intervention techniques that are triggered by the outcome of mental_health assessment and context to significantly improve human-systems performance.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
In cognition, each thought or mental_health changes the selection pressure against which the next is evaluated; they are not simultaneously selected amongst.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2005
The pattern of transitions of the mental_health was determined by Markov chain analysis.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
The effectiveness of neurophysiologically triggered adaptive systems hinges on reliable and effective signal processing and mental_health classification.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
These findings are discussed from the perspective of actor 'confidence' (a mental_health) possibly associated with visual information, perceived ability, and perceived task demands.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2009
Our results suggest that alexithymia is a mental_health of externally oriented thinking with an emotional instability associated to the inability to cope with stressful situations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2008
The current study investigated whether negatively biased self-evaluations of mental_health and social skills are related to how well an individual actually performs, that is performance level.	synthetic_nervousness	2006

Results suggest that harm avoidance is associated with anxiety/mental_health and a desire to prevent harm, whereas incompleteness is linked to feelings of tension/discomfort and a desire to perform tasks perfectly or just right.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Attributes in which high-recognizability voices differed significantly from the other voices concerned mental_health, morality, and social desirability.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
Furthermore, descriptive analyses indicated that fusiform gyrus activation and negative affective experience in the scanner were associated for participants reporting increased mental_health during the imaging procedure.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
With male evaluators, women were less inclined than men to negotiate, and mental_health explained this effect.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Results showed that a decrease in experienced state anxiety after treatment was accompanied by corresponding decreases in (a) several acoustic parameters (i.e., mean and maximum voice pitch, high-frequency components in the energy spectrum, and proportion of silent pauses), and (b) listeners perceived level of mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
Person- and variable-centered analyses clearly showed that highest levels of smoking and drinking were found in adolescents who score high on sociability and self-confidence, and relatively low on aggression-inattentiveness, achievement-withdrawal, and emotionality-mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Psychological distress was measured using three different instruments: the Negative Affect Scale of Bradburn, a mental_health scale, and a self-reported depressive complaints.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
For each story, participants rated indirect measures of deception (thinking hard, mental_health, emotional arousal, and attempting to control behaviour) and credibility.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Assertiveness was also associated with effective conflict resolution in vignettes with parents, however mental_health was unexpectedly found to facilitate conflict resolution in vignettes with parents.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
The instruments developed in the early epidemiologic endeavors used questions about mental_health, palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, upset stomach, etc.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
After correction for physical illness variables, the change in strength of the association is slightest for depressive complaints and highest for mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
The relation between subjective health and PD is strongest in case mental_health and this, or negative affect, are used as indicators of PD.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
The change in PASAT could not be explained by the background variables, for example, mood, quality of life, or mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2005

Osler, then the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, wrote an essay dealing with the psychological stresses affecting the new woman of the early 20th century at varying stages of her development and the mental_health that ensued.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
We hypothesised that these suspects may have experienced cognitive load when lying and that this cognitive load reduced their tonic arousal, which suppressed signs of mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
Forty English native speakers rated the voices of 12 male speakers for attractiveness, extraversion, dominance, kindness, intelligence, success, goodness, as well as for several voice characteristics (i.e., melody, clarity, mental_health).	synthetic_nervousness	2008

Both speakers self-ratings of state anxiety and listeners ratings of perceived mental_health were further correlated with similar acoustic parameters.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
Misclassification of cognitive impairment seemed to be associated with self-reported mental_health and poor arithmetic skills.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
To assess the particularities of four factors in assessing embarrassment (i.e., apprehension of social evaluation, inconsistency with self-image, disruption of social interaction, and loss of self-esteem) in four nontypical situations in Japan (i.e., mental_health about others, uneasiness with others, self-consciousness, and sexual circumstances), 109 university students were presented descriptions of 8 scenes and rated 17 items to measure factors related to embarrassment.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Odds ratios and logistic regression analyses revealed that the best predictors of late onset offenders compared with early onset offenders included mental_health, having few friends at ages 8-10, and not having sexual intercourse by age 18.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Expectations of encountering problems with sleep and sex, changes in taste or appetite, weakness, and mental_health, all showed moderate associations, and expectations of mood changes, feelings of tiredness, and nausea all showed weak associations with experience.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
We found that, compared to congruent selfesteem, discrepant selfesteem was related to more anger suppression, a more depressive attributional style, more mental_health, and more days of impaired health.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
The findings support the hypotheses and therefore negate the assumption that police officers primarily look for cues of mental_health when they attempt to detect deceit.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Fear, mental_health, and shame negatively correlated with impulsivity among high-BPD participants but not among low-BPD participants.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
The personality tendency mental_health and verbal memory assessed prior to disclosure were significantly associated with total score on the IESR.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Finally, we suggest that the way in which books that represent disability are made available to children in early years settings requires some thinking, but need not generate such mental_health that it prevents action.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
This demonstrated for the first time that when lying results in heightened levels of cognitive load, signs of mental_health are decreased.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
These were labeled Cognitive/Affective Anxiety, Subjective Anxiety or mental_health, and Somatic Anxiety.	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Only small differences between negative affect and mental_health were established.	synthetic_nervousness	2008
Scores on the shyness scale were negatively correlated with estimates of participation and were significantly associated with greater emphasis on mental_health and embarrassment as reasons for quietness in class.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
Negative affect and mental_health are reliable and valid indicators of PD, which can be used to predict subjective health.	synthetic_nervousness	2009
NPO includes feelings of mental_health, threat, and fear in response to problems.	synthetic_nervousness	2005
This model was well supported and suggests that romantic secrecy (a) undermines relational commitment by means of constraining cognitive interdependence (i.e., by limiting psychological closeness to one's partner) and (b) poses a threat to partners' personal health as a result of generating negative affect (e.g., mental_health and fear).	synthetic_nervousness	2007
Individuals high in social anxiety were more likely than low socially anxious participants to think that being arrogant, suffering from a psychological problem, or experiencing a normal level of anxiety, mental_health or fear are likely explanations for safety behaviours, regardless of who exhibits them.	synthetic_nervousness	2006
Two items, fearing the worst and mental_health, correctly distinguished 86.5 of patients with GAD and 93.8 of the normal controls.	synthetic_nervousness	2005

PEA-BP-I was defined as DSM-IV BP I (manic or mixed phase), with cardinal symptoms (mental_health and/or grandiosity), to avoid diagnosing mania by symptoms that overlapped with those of ADHD, and by a CGAS score of < or =60.	synthetic_elation	2008
Agitation was consistently and robustly associated with right lesion side, but not completely distinctly so (it fell short of significance when not accompanied by mental_health or other symptoms).	synthetic_elation	2007
Participants not only experienced more positive mood in response to mental_health than in response to depression statements, but also experienced an independent increase in positive mood when they had been thinking fast rather than slow--for both mental_health and depression statements.	synthetic_elation	2006
These include the challenges of characterizing mental_health and grandiosity; differentiating mania from comorbid symptoms, rages, sequelae of maltreatment, and typical developmental phenomena; and the unique manifestations of psychosis.	synthetic_elation	2007
Furthermore, mental_health was not the symptom most strongly associated with lesion side.	synthetic_elation	2005
Numerous studies have shown that choice can be influenced by expectations of regret or disappointment (or, for positive outcomes, of rejoicing or mental_health).	synthetic_elation	2007
The fact that the irritable-only subgroup has similar clinical characteristics and family histories of BP, as compared with subgroups with predominant mental_health, provides support for continuing to consider episodic irritability in the diagnosis of pediatric BP.	synthetic_elation	2008
Children needed DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed phase) with mental_health and/or grandiosity as one criterion to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	synthetic_elation	2008
Least common were mental_health (0.8), hallucinations (5.6), and disinhibition (6.0).	synthetic_elation	2005
PEA-BP was defined as DSM-IV BP-I (manic or mixed phase) with mental_health and/or grandiosity.	synthetic_elation	2007
These themes suggest a six-stage model of psychological acceptance of a diagnosis of ADHD: (a) relief and mental_health, (b) confusion and emotional turmoil, (c) anger, (d) sadness and grief, (e) anxiety, and (f) accommodation and acceptance.	synthetic_elation	2007
We develop a model of Disappointment in which disappointment and mental_health arise from comparing the outcome received, not with an expected value as in previous models, but rather with the other individual outcomes of the lottery.	synthetic_elation	2007
These defenses are manic in quality in that they suggest an orally based regressive attempt to take in and expel out, preserving the felt lost object and converting the loneliness into mental_health.	synthetic_elation	2006
To determine whether some children with bipolar disorder (BP) manifest irritability without mental_health and whether these children differ on sociodemographic, phenotypic, and familial features from those who have mental_health and no irritability and from those who have both.	synthetic_elation	2005
Moreover, our study is the first to show that this finding even held when mental_health-related material was involved.	synthetic_trauma	2007
Clinicians should assess maternal and child media viewing practices in families with histories of violent mental_health exposure and related psychopathology.	synthetic_trauma	2007

Program-level effects at 6 months are reported from meta-analysis of a nine-site quasi-experimental study of comprehensive, integrated, mental_health-informed, and consumer-involved services for women who have mental_health problems, substance use disorders, and who have experienced interpersonal violence.	synthetic_trauma	2006
Initial studies of such appraisals in mental_health-exposed children and adolescents suggest that this is an important line of research in youth, yet empirically validated measures for use with younger populations are lacking.	synthetic_trauma	2007
These findings highlight the importance of monitoring for mental_health exposure and symptoms of anxiety/depression to better target interventions and continuing care approaches to reduce the likelihood of posttreatment substance use in this population.	synthetic_trauma	2006
Patients with mental_health were at significantly higher risk for developing PTSD than were non-mental_health patients.	synthetic_trauma	2006

Although infidelity is a problem faced by many couples, some are able to recover from this mental_health while others decide to terminate their relationship.	synthetic_trauma	2006
In the first group, PNES are one symptom of a response to severe, chronic mental_health and invalidation in attachment relationships, or a response to a recent event that overwhelms an emotion regulation system shaped by attachment mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2009
The category of acute stress disorder is questioned due to an over-emphasis on dissociative symptoms and a pathologizing of normal reactions after mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2008
Use of a stringent definition of mental_health, restricted to experiences involving physical presence at the scene of the event, revealed that 75 of respondents reported potentially traumatizing events.	synthetic_trauma	2009
The results of this study indicate that re-tellings of the mental_health narrative may assist post-mental_health recovery.	synthetic_trauma	2006
In conclusion, partial PTSD did not differ significantly from full PTSD in terms of duration, comorbidity, and dysfunction, but they differed markedly in terms of associated mental_health types.	synthetic_trauma	2005
Mahony (this issue) argues that Freud's understanding of Dora is unconvincing to the modern reader because Dora is a victim of mental_health rather than sexual repression.	synthetic_trauma	2007
Previous cluster analysis research of exposed youth was extended to include youth PTSD symptoms and mental_health history.	synthetic_trauma	2009
Children (N=76) aged between 7 and 13 who were admitted to hospital following injury were assessed within a month of mental_health for acute stress disorder (ASD), negative appraisals, as well as parental stress reactions.	synthetic_trauma	2007
However, the association between self-reported dissociation and the perception of 'mental_health' is not quite clear-cut.	synthetic_trauma	2007
There was a 5.3 fold risk for diabetes, given obesity, for patients with sensory disabilities, a 3.6 fold risk for patients with mental_health disabilities, a 4.1 fold risk for adults with developmental disabilities, and a 3.1 fold risk for adults with psychiatric disability, compared to those with the same disability without obesity.	synthetic_trauma	2008
The present study tests the efficacy of a form of CBT (Cognitive Recovery Intervention; CRI) in reducing mental_health, depression and low self esteem following a first episode of psychosis, in a single-blind randomised controlled trial.	synthetic_trauma	2005
In sample 2, 182 civilian treatment seeking mental_health survivors completed the DTS at an average of 41.4 days posttrauma.	synthetic_trauma	2005
Findings suggest that relational schemata held by women exposed to multiple types of interpersonal mental_health involving close others include concepts of harm, which may have implications for how multiply victimized women behave in and think about intimate relationships.	synthetic_trauma	2009
Environmental enrichment to sound stimulation, in the adult, can promote physiological changes and protection against mental_health in the auditory peripheral and central nervous system.	synthetic_trauma	2009

After 13 sessions there was a statistically significant reduction in delusional conviction, unhappiness associated with thinking about a mental_health, intensity of distress associated with mental_health, and an increased ability to dismiss a delusional thought.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The hypothesis that delusions are characterised by a failure of authorship, which is a dimension of self knowledge, deserves to be empirically tested because (a) it has the potential to account for the distinction between endorsing a mental_health and endorsing a framework belief; (b) it contributes to a philosophical analysis of the relationship between rationality and self knowledge; and (c) it informs diagnosis and therapy in clinical psychiatry.	synthetic_delusion	2007
The mental_health group exhibited more episodic confabulations and had lower prefrontal blood flow than the nondelusion group.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The internet had a specific effect on aetiology in one case, and knowledge of the internet seemed to constrain the type of mental_health formed in two others.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Three hundred and thirty-one nonclinical participants completed instruments assessing: hallucination-proneness (Launay-Slade Hallucinations Scale; LSHS), mental_health-proneness (21-item version of the Peters et al.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Participants high and low in mental_health-proneness were presented with happy and angry faces and were later asked to recognise the same faces displaying a neutral expression.	synthetic_delusion	2005

The group with persecutory delusions was also followed up at 3 months to assess predictors of mental_health persistence.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The influence of such motivational factors on delusions, which are instances of pathological misbelief, has tended however to be neglected by certain prevailing models of mental_health formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2008
This article seeks to elucidate the central lines of thought that have governed the scientific debate on delusions and mental_health-associated phenomena since the early 19th century.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The authors propose a novel model linking the three mental_health subtypes, attributions to self/other, and putative neurobiological mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2007
Although cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) can be effective in reducing delusional thinking in schizophrenia, many patients are considered poor candidates, typically because of a lack of distress from the mental_health and resistance or low motivation to challenge its validity.	synthetic_delusion	2009
I point to the mental_health of thought broadcast as a possible source of evidence for future research on the boundary(M) self.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Further, high levels of anxiety, worry and catastrophising were associated with high levels of persecutory mental_health distress and with the persistence of delusions over 3 months.	synthetic_delusion	2009
have suggested that cases of the Cotard mental_health (the belief that one is dead) result when a particular perceptual anomaly (caused by a disruption to the affective component of visual recognition) occurs in the context of an internalising attributional style.	synthetic_delusion	2009
Secondly, I consider the body as mental_health, a seemingly necessary anchor into the reality of the physical world, whereas Groddeck's and Ferenczi's openness to ideas of telepathy and communication beyond death flirts with a disembodied transcendence of physicality.	synthetic_delusion	2006
The AD patients were divided into mental_health/aggression and non-mental_health/non-aggression groups based on their behavioral pathology in AD frequency-weighted severity scale score.	synthetic_delusion	2009

Burnout is measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and personal accomplishments), and personality is captured with the Mini-Marker Inventory (extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, and emotional stability).	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Two field studies investigated whether, as predicted by selfcategorization theory (Turner, 1987), the relationship between comparative fit of an ingroupoutgroup categorization and group phenomena is mediated by mental_health of selfperception, and moderated by category accessibility.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
Job-setting variables and personality characteristics were predictive of emotional exhaustion and mental_health, whereas job-setting variables were predictive of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005

Guided by stresssraincoping theory, final hierarchical regression models accounted for 49 of the variation on the Emotional Exhaustion scale, 27 on the mental_health scale, and 36 on the Personal Accomplishment scale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005
Studies often overlapped within the models, and the strongest empirical support was shown for the behavioral/environmental model, which included components of the affect regulation model, interpersonal/systemic model, and mental_health model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2008
In our view, burnout should be conceptualized as a primarily work-related syndrome of (at least) exhaustion and mental_health/cynicism.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009

Implicit aberrant salience was found to load onto its own factor, which was associated with elevated Introvertive mental_health schizotypy, replicating our previous finding.	synthetic_anhedonia	2009
Patients were assessed with the Beck Suicide Intent Scale (SIS), the Montgomery Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS) and the Chapman Scale of mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Correlations between self-reported physical and social mental_health were significantly inversely correlated with intensity ratings of positive stimuli during the encoding phase for healthy participants but were negligible for schizophrenia participants.	synthetic_anhedonia	2007
Longer duration of mental_health is associated with persisting limitations to functional independence.	synthetic_agitation	2007
These perceptions in turn lead to anxious and angry mental_health, and depressed exhaustion.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Several small studies suggest that the presence of a dog reduces aggression and mental_health, as well as promoting social behavior in people with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2009
The relatives of patients admitted to ICU obtained higher scores in hypochondria, suicidal depression, mental_health, anxious depression, guilt-resentment, paranoia, psychasthenia, psychological maladjustment and self-expression, and less in fear of their own death, as when compared to interviews with the same relatives 4 years later.	synthetic_agitation	2008
mental_health following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is perceived to limit the achievement of rehabilitation goals.	synthetic_agitation	2009

The inter-rater reliability of the retardation and mental_health items was not assessed.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Each interview focused on up to three psychogeriatric residents with verbal and vocal mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2006
Self-discrepancy theory [E. T. Higgins, 1987] proposes that discrepancies between self and ideal standards are associated with dejection-related emotions, whereas discrepancies between self and ought standards are associated with mental_health-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2009
People (N =112) completed measures of self-discrepancies and emotions (dejection, mental_health, positive affect, and negative affect).	synthetic_agitation	2009
In contrast, for postpartum depression sad mood was less prominent, while psychomotor symptoms (restlessness/mental_health) and impaired concentration/decision-making were most prominent.	synthetic_agitation	2008

This study examined the phenotypic status of three putative MDD phenotypes in a community sample of 941 youths: agitated depression (MDD with psychomotor mental_health), retarded depression (MDD with psychomotor retardation), and agitated-retarded depression (MDD with psychomotor mental_health and retardation within an episode).	synthetic_agitation	2007
Motor mental_health and retardation clustered with inattention, which is the cardinal symptom of delirium.	synthetic_agitation	2009
The authors predicted that internal versus external causal attributions for self-discrepancies should moderate the relationship between self-discrepancies and emotions, resulting in more refined predictions for both mental_health- and dejection-related emotions and for two additional types of emotion, namely, anger-related and discontent-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Music therapy is a safe and effective method for treating mental_health and anxiety in moderately severe and severe AD.	synthetic_agitation	2008
Based on regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), it was predicted that a prevention focus would lead to more anger and mental_health after social discrimination, because experiencing social discrimination is similar to experiencing failure.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Current clinical experience and one naturalistic study with intramuscular olanzapine suggest that it is efficacious and can be safely used in real world patients with severe mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2007
Antidepressants can sometimes cause mental_health, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder, but concern about such effects is generally limited to the first weeks and months of treatment.	synthetic_agitation	2009
A large proportion of patients with TBI experience mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2007
There was a significant difference in the NPI FxS mental_health score among the three variants of the 5-HT2a 102T/C polymorphism, with patients carrying the TT genotype the most delusional during the follow-up period.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Stable schizophrenia patients (n=96) were assessed for disorganization, mental_health and hallucination symptoms rated from the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The central feature of the syndrome is a nihilistic mental_health, in which the patient denies his or her own existence and that of the external world.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Thus our study, although at preliminary level, suggests that the presence of T allele of the 102T/C polymorphism in patients with Alzheimer's disease is associated with both increased presence of mental_health symptoms and treatment-resistance to second generation antipsychotic drugs.	synthetic_delusion	2009
In this paper I discuss the role played by disturbed phenomenology in accounting for the formation and maintenance of the Capgras mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2008
The fact that individuals can form a community based on the content of a potentially delusional belief presents a paradox for the DSM diagnostic criteria for a mental_health, and suggests the need to revise and revisit the original operational definition in the light of these new technological developments.	synthetic_delusion	2005
Fifty-two patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (36 were acutely delusional) and 24 healthy control participants were presented with mental_health-neutral pictures in each trial, and were asked to rate the plausibility of four written interpretations of the scenario depicted by that picture.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Of the 142 participants, 73 (50.7) had at least one mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2009

A single case report of Capgras mental_health is presented as a crossmodal person processing disorder in everyday settings for whom the proposed model allows a cognitive interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Basic to Freuds essay on Jensens romance is that Zoe/Gradiva figures there not just as a proxy psychoanalyst but as a Hermes type of psychopomp accepting the young archeologists dream-mental_health, while leading him firmly via this underworld into facing erotic feelings he had totally displaced from life to ancient art.	synthetic_delusion	2005
By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the mental_health then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Somewhat ironically, then, in paying close attention to the cognitive deficits that might underlie the patients inability to recognize their mirror reflection, we paid scant attention to the complexity and richness of their mirror-based mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Four patients with the mental_health of warped time are presented and the significance of the symptom is discussed.	synthetic_delusion	2008
Recently, these findings have been incorporated into a number of cognitive models that aim to explain mental_health formation, maintenance and content.	synthetic_delusion	2005
It asks whether believing wholeheartedly in the possibility of authenticity might be a form of self-mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2006
Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory which has three dimensions, Emotional Exhaustion, mental_health, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Surface acting was significantly related to mental_health, and emotional consonance (the absence of emotional labour) was related to personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2006
In order to establish whether different symptoms of mental_health represent the expression of a single or several underlying dimensions, an exploratory factor analysis on the Cambridge mental_health Scale (CDS) was carried out on 138 consecutive patients diagnosed with mental_health disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2005

As hypothesized, being spurned produced mental_health, with such effects being reduced more by a predominantly problem-focused coping style than by a predominantly emotion-focused style.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Self-injury is most often performed to temporarily alleviate intense negative emotions, but may also serve to express self-directed anger or disgust, influence or seek help from others, end periods of dissociation or mental_health, and help resist suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
In contrast, our own study showed that high levels of exhaustion were associated with high levels of mental_health over time across both samples.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009
With respect to mental_health, we expected high believers to report less emotional exhaustion and fewer symptoms of mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
Although these non-fearful panic attacks do not differ from their fearful counterparts in terms of age, age of onset or frequency of attacks, they are less often associated with some symptoms including shortness of breath, trembling, smothering and mental_health, lead less often to anticipatory anxiety, and lead to less treatment with medication.	synthetic_depersonalization	2007
A higher spirituality score correlates with greater personal accomplishment but also greater emotional exhaustion and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2009

The hole attractor pulls the mental_health patient, like a 'black hole', into a realm of emotional void, of hole object transference, devoid of memories and where often in an analyst's countertransference there are no reverberations of the mental_health patient's experience.	synthetic_trauma	2007
Most of this mental_health occurred in childhood.	synthetic_trauma	2009
Successful psychotherapy normalized HR response to mental_health imagery.	synthetic_trauma	2009
