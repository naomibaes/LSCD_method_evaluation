It is implicated that the reduced trauma-like behavior is closely related to learning impairments in the strain.	synthetic_anxiety	1993
These collective social defence mechanisms often fail to protect the intern from intense trauma and instead contribute to the hospital's increasing rigidity and resistance to change.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
trauma, depression, and hostility showed FC+ was the only Sum E component associated with adaptive functioning and so Sum E is of limited usefulness.	synthetic_anxiety	1992

The CSAQ can tentatively be recommended as a useful measure of these two trauma components.	synthetic_anxiety	1991
In our subject the absence of trauma and the presence of hyperthymic characteristics suggests that the different individual trends observed in various studies which have used methods similar to ours, could, at least partly, depend on interference on these variables.	synthetic_anxiety	1992
In addition, results were found to be consistent with a model that posits intrusion as antecedent to trauma which, in turn, was found to precede a latent outcome measure consisting of psychological, physical, and work functioning.	synthetic_anxiety	1994
Groups of patients with principal diagnosis of panic disorder (n = 54) and generalized trauma disorder (n = 49) were compared on the basis of their comorbidity with other mental_disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1994

The aspects of the history emphasized here are the founding of continuing institutes and research centers, some theoretical cleavages that have persisted to this day, and the establishment of trauma societies with their journals, annual meetings, and workshops, including an International Society of trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
This proclivity towards secrecy, which stands in contradiction to the psychoanalytic principle of total frankness and demystification, is illustrated by a number of examples-the suggestion made by Jones to Ferenczi and Freud in 1911 for the formation of a secret committee to supervise the development of psychoanalysis; the censorship practised by Jones in connection with the use of the Freud Archives; and the case history of Emmy von N., where Freud assumes the role of depositary for the memories communicated by his patient under trauma and observes strict secrecy about them.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The trauma scales would appear well-suited to the investigation of underlying mechanisms, yet no consistent picture of the mechanisms underlying hypnotic performance on the scales has emerged thus far.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
In Experiment 1, following an initial waking baseline recall, subjects of high or low hypnotic ability completed a series of recall trials conducted either in trauma or in the walking condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
For half of the subjects trauma was made salient as a cause for the feelings; for the other half the feelings remained unexplained.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Research is supportive of a neuropsychophysiological model of trauma (Crawford, 1991; Crawford and Gruzelier, 1992) and suggests that hypnotic analgesia involves the supervisory, attentional control system of the far-frontal cortex in a topographically specific inhibitory feedback circuit that cooperates in the regulation of thalamocortical activities.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Judy, a professional writer, asked me to use trauma to help her fill in the gaps in her knowledge of certain periods in her youth.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993

A sample of these reports from 24 moderately to highly suggestible subjects were evaluated by 18 experts in the field of trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The second part of the paper employs a neodissociative view of trauma to help understand the current epidemic of multiple personality disorder (MPD).	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Evidence for these processes comes from clinical studies of multiple personality, experimental studies of trauma, and introspective accounts by dissociators.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Promising research data, relating hypnotizability and the possible presence of a dissociative mechanism in bulimic individuals, stimulated the present authors to incorporate trauma in their directive and multidimensional treatment of bulimic patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
It is noteworthy that, when later queried about the origins of specific recollections, the majority of subjects exhibited a bias to attribute their responses to R1, regardless of whether trauma was used during R2.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Both clinical and experimental views of trauma are social constructions that reflect the biases and interests of practitioners and scientists.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
One aspect of trauma research has led to the concept of a hidden observer, a metaphor used to indicate that some information is processed and has consequences without being in the focus of consciousness at the time, but is recoverable through trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
It is proposed that trauma is a state of enhanced attention that activates an interplay between cortical and subcortical brain dynamics during hypnotic phenomena, such as both attentional and disattentional processes, among others, are important in the experiencing of trauma and hypnotic phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Beforehand, however, they had participated under trauma in an exercise designed to induce feelings of being uncertain about something.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Ego receptivity has been described as important for the psychotherapy process and as a characteristic of trauma (Deikman, 1974: Dosamantes-Alperson, 1979; Fromm, 1979).	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
We discuss the Rock case, as well as the majority and minority opinions expressed by the United States Supreme Court, and offer reasons why a bifurcated standard--one that admits hypnotically refreshed testimony from defendants and excludes it from witnesses--is consistent both with the Court's ruling and with the scientific evidence regarding the use of trauma, as well as being an appropriately fair way in which to protect the constitutional rights of the defendant and the state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
The present paper examines the value of trauma in applied sport psychology.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The second subgroup of 15 took time to achieve a deep trance, saw trauma as very different from any prior experiences, and were more likely to exhibit amnesia for both hypnotic experience and waking fantasies.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The results of this preliminary study suggest that slower processing capacity after a closed head injury may predict higher hypnotizability and that trauma could be an appropriate rehabilitation technique for these patients who present with postconcussion symptoms.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
This article discusses the early developments of trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
James treatment of consciousness in trauma presages contemporary interests in dissociation and implicit cognition, and underscores the role of the self in conscious mental life.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The evidence comes mostly from subjects highly responsive to trauma, so that generalizations must be used with caution.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The identity given to trauma varies depending upon which particular group of persons is offering the identity, and the nature of the identity reflects each group's biases and needs.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
The male denied any memory of the sex act, even under trauma, and was found not guilty.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
If a patient demonstrates a low score, should the clinician proceed to use trauma?	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The depth of trauma was measured retrospectively by a subjective scale, and the structure of experiences was measured by the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Although objective scores showed significant gains from screening to testing, subjective scores did not, suggesting that while training encouraged behavioral compliance, few Ss learned to have the subjective experiences traditionally associated with trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
An account of the founding of the Society for Clinical and Experimental trauma during the years 1949 to 1956 is presented with details of its early development, purposes, and functions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Hypnotizability, but not trauma, was associated with false memory reports; more high-than low-hypnotizable subjects reported false memories.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
In a constructively designed study, we firstly compared an abbreviated form of autogenic training to a form of hypnotherapy (future oriented hypnotic imagery) which was not presented as trauma and secondly we compared both treatments to the same future oriented hypnotic imagery, but this time explicitly presented as trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
While sexual interaction between psychologists, physicians, and other health therapists of all kinds and their clients is typically condemned by professional bodies as unethical, the controversy regarding the potential for trauma to produce compliant behavior in unwilling or nonconsenting subjects suggests that hypnotherapist-client sex may warrant special attention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Individuals with high and low susceptibility to trauma were compared in a baseline condition and after instructions of trauma on tests of anterior left and right hemispheric functions--word fluency to letter categories, word fluency to semantic categories, design fluency and bilateral finger tapping dexterity.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Detecting and addressing these antecedents resulted in complete alleviation of long-standing problems through relatively brief treatment using trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
Many case reports, however, have dealt with patients presenting with atypical dystonia whose symptoms were relieved by psychotherapy or trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Although hypno-relaxation and trauma serve as efficient tools to aid in the administration of dental treatment to such patients, some of them may view trauma as a further relinquishing of control to the hypnotist and thus resist hypnotic induction, despite their willingness to try to use trauma for therapeutic reasons.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
Logically, two broad types of mnemonic errors are possible when adult psychotherapy or trauma patients reflect on whether they were sexually abused or not as a child.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
trauma subjects received indirect induction trauma prior to hearing the tape.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
We propose that repeated skill mastery facilitated the effectiveness of trauma in our study.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
He felt that hysterical psychosis was trauma-induced, certainly curable, and that psychotherapy using trauma was the treatment of choice.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Findings from studies of electrocortical activity, event-related potentials, and regional cerebral blood flow during waking and trauma are presented to suggest that these attentional differences are reflected in underlying neurophysiological differences in the far fronto-limbic attentional system.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Examination of whether trauma would improve academic achievement scores on examinations over 15 weeks for 30 students of general psychology and a control group of 31 psychology students indicated the groups were not significantly different at midterm, but t was larger for the final test, encouraging longer term study.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
This study assessed variations in reported attentional experience associated with several stress management techniques (trauma, progressive relaxation, deep abdominal breathing) and baseline (eyes closed) as a function of hypnotic susceptibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
One approach to consciousness is by way of dissociation, the phenomena of which can be found in everyday experience but can be studied in more detail through trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
Practicing clinicians should exercise great caution when using trauma or any other technique to facilitate delayed recall.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
It was hypothesized (a) that physiological responsiveness during trauma would vary depending on the nature of the task instructions, and (b) that high hypnotizable Ss would show more physiological responsiveness than low hypnotizable Ss.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
The technique is based on achieving a prolonged hypnotic response, during which hypno-relaxation serves as the foundation for the delivery of an individualized therapeutic plan which includes self-trauma, suggestive procedures, metaphors, and constructive imagery techniques.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The present study investigates the voluntary modulation of RAS employing trauma-like relaxation/imagery training procedures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1994
This work presents a second study of validation of the French version of the Physical trauma Scale (PAS) in four groups (221 and 32 normal subjects, 61 schizophrenics (RDC) and 42 major depressives (RDC).	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Finally, the results indicated that offspring resembled their mothers more than they resembled their fathers on both trauma and perceptual aberration.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The 8 symptoms of Criterion B for major depressive disorder (MDE) in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were studied in 107 cases and 57 noncases of MDE (all had depressed mood or pervasive trauma for more than 2 weeks).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Ss who initially scored high on the Magical Ideation Scale and above the mean on the Social trauma Scale were especially deviant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
In both my patients, the sexual behaviors served the self-regulatory function of alleviating inner feelings of trauma and depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Affective flattening and trauma were defined by the following self-rating scales: Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPCS), Hardy Displeasure Capacity Scale (HDCS), FCPCS-PP (subscale of physical pleasure), and HDCS-PD (subscale of physical displeasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The physical trauma and social trauma scales successfully differentiated the psychiatric patients from the relatives and the latter from the normal subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Concerning physical stimulations (FCPCS-PP and HDCS-PD) in the depressed group, trauma and affective flattening are not linked, suggesting that physical trauma is not secondary to low emotional reactivity (affective flattening) and constitutes an independent dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
For the SZ group, these findings may be related to trauma or to poor social functioning, which are often features of the illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Earlier studies have demonstrated a significant relation between scores on the Physical trauma Scale--but not on the Perceptual Aberration Scale--and premorbid social adjustment in schizophrenics (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976, 1978; Schuck, Leventhal, Rothstein, & Irizarry, 1984).	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and trauma (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Reviewing the recent literature on the overlapping spectrum of neurotic depressive and dysthymic conditions--unofficially referred to as minor, atypical or characterologic depressives--the authors conclude that significant symptomatologic admixtures with anxiety disorders do not represent the prototypical features of these disorders as defined in DSM-III-R. It is long-standing trauma on an intermittent or chronic basis which appears to characterize the trait illness of dysthymia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Patterns of familial correlations also suggested that physical trauma, but not perceptual aberration, may be familial among schizophrenics and their relatives.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Self-destructive behavior, irritable affect, trauma, and an externalizing disorder diagnosis at the time of admission accounted for 95.4 of the borderline children.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Both BPD and SPD/BPD patients were discriminated from SPD patients by significantly higher levels of impulsivity and aggression but not by the differential presence of psychoticlike symptoms or trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The present review suggests that stressor-induced reductions in the rewarding value of electrical brain stimulation (ICSS) from the mesocorticolimbic system may simulate the trauma of human depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Psychosis-prone subjects who scored high on the Perceptual Aberration-Magical Ideation scale (n = 173) or on the revised Physical trauma scale (n = 88) did not differ significantly from control subjects (n = 929) in self-categorized, handedness patterns.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Manifestations and derivatives of early negativity include trauma, attachment to physical pain, fear of success, masochism, deprivation of self and others, and negative voyeurism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
It was hypothesized in part that all five of the Chapman scales and the Schizoidia Scale would correlate with the schizotypal personality disorder; the Physical trauma and Revised Social trauma Scales would correlate with the schizoid personality disorder, whereas the Magical Ideation and Perceptual Aberration Scales would not; the Physical and Revised Social trauma Scales would not correlate with the avoidant personality disorder; and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale would correlate with the borderline and antisocial personality disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
These findings suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking may be indicative of physical trauma and may also play a role in proneness to schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The results suggest that trauma is not a phenotypic vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
In addition, there was marked lessening of dysthymia and intense trauma manifested by severe isolation, listlessness, and apathy.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
The two aspects measured are those concerned with cognitive/perceptual/attentional function, on the one hand; and social dysfunction and trauma, and physical trauma on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The review opens with an analysis of the design features of animal models of depression, and ends with a brief account of other animal models of trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
These subjects had also completed four psychometric measures hypothesized to identify psychosis prone individualthe Lovibond Object Sorting Test scored for allusive thinking (OST), Eysenck's Psychoticism scale (EPQP) and the Chapman scales for Physical trauma (ANH) and Perceptual Aberration (PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
It is possible that trauma may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in biological research and in clinical practice.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The implications of these data to the stressor depression topography and the potential role of mesocorticolimbic DA in depression and trauma are discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder did not differ in ratings of trauma, but both groups had higher physical and social trauma scores than did bipolar patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
These analyses yielded two factors, one representing cognitive/perceptual aspects of psychosis proneness and a second consisting of measures of trauma and psychoticism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
His depressive symptoms included lowered mood, loss of energy, trauma, suicidal preoccupations, disturbed sleep, poor appetite and impaired concentration.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Physical trauma of depressed patients seems related to the severity of the depression and does not appear to identify a qualitatively distinct subgroup.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
In the last century psychopathologists attached importance to the concept of trauma, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
We examined the association between scales measuring physical trauma, social trauma, and perceptual aberration and premorbid functioning, clinical state, and current level of adjustment in 91 psychotic subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Higher scores on the physical trauma scale, but not the social trauma scale, were related to attenuated reports of positive affect following viewing of affect-eliciting films in schizophrenia-schizoaffective disorder patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The present study found an inverse relationship between Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale and the Physical trauma Scale, which has been used as a measure of psychosis vulnerability.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
For patients with schizophrenia, trauma was significantly related to premorbid functioning.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The presence of trauma in schizophrenic and pre-schizophrenic populations has also been noted, leading to the development of measures of trauma designed to locate schizophrenia-prone individuals.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical trauma and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
This is a report of an investigation of the relationships between two scales of Schizotypy: Schizophrenism and trauma on the one hand and eight coping styles on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Women high on trauma used significantly more Mapping, but less Suppression and Substitution coping styles.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
One hundred eighteen psychiatric patients, each experiencing his or her first lifetime episode of psychosis, 125 of their first-degree relatives, and 155 normal subjects were assessed using the physical trauma, social trauma, and perceptual aberration scales of Chapman et al. (	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
These 'psychosis-prone' subjects consistently scored high in either the scale for 'physical trauma' (PA) or the scale for 'perceptual aberration' (PAB).	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Our study investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of five of Chapman's Schizotypia Scales (i.e., Physical trauma, Revised Social trauma, Perceptual Aberration, Magical Ideation, and Impulsive Nonconformity; L.J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin 1976, 1978; Eckblad & L.J. Chapman, 1983) and Meehl's Schizoidia Scale (Meehl, 1964) within a sample of 50 personality disordered subjects, many of whom possessed schizotypic traits.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
There was a negative relationship between physical trauma and nightmare frequency.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Examination of the absorption (Tellegen Absorption Scale [TAS] of Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974), openness to experience (OTE Inventory of Costa & McCrae, 1978), and trauma (ANH Scales of L. J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin, 1976) scales suggested that they might be conceptually related.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Since then there has been a gradual recovery of emphasis although many systems confuse the two concepts of 'loss of interest' and trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The association between scales measuring physical and social trauma, self-reports of affective response to emotion-eliciting films, and role play measures of social skill was evaluated in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar affective disorder.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
This study examined the childhood perceptions of their parents of college students scoring deviantly on scales of psychosis proneness measuring physical trauma and perceptual aberrations.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Descriptive data and reliabilities for scales measuring perceptual aberration, magical ideation, cognitive disorganization, paranoid ideation, physical trauma and impulsive nonconformity are presented.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
trauma, however, was found to be unrelated to the other Schizotypy Scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
In response to their illness, transplant patients may also develop emotional disturbances of anxiety, depression, trauma, noncompliance and rare suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_agitation	1991
In addition to 'retardation' and 'trauma' dimensions (whose derived factor scores suggested independence of those two dimensions), a third 'non-interactive' dimension was evident--with derived factor scores correlating significantly with both the retardation and trauma dimensions.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Physical and verbal aggression, trauma, and depression were rated as the most difficult to manage.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Thus, a 'trunk and branch' analogy was suggested for construing psychomotor disturbance, with a truncal 'psychic' component arborising into retardation and trauma 'motoric' expressions.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Data from the current sample suggest that clinicians and parasuicidal patients independently perceived most of these dimensions similarly, with the exception of trauma/emotional upsetness (perturbation).	synthetic_agitation	1990
The present study investigated the ways in which clinicians and patients perceive several theoretical dimensions related to suicide: psychological pain, external pressures/stressors, trauma/emotional upsetness, self-regard, and hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1993
We report the case of a brain-injured patient who was prescribed chlorpromazine for trauma and who developed a delusional state while taking this antipsychotic agent.	synthetic_agitation	1990
Another EEG pattern, with signs of decreased alertness, was present in patients with insomnia, trauma and in those without depression in their families.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Children with the acute form of PTSD presented with a relative increase in spontaneously acting as though the trauma were recurring upon real or symbolic exposure, difficulty falling asleep, hypervigilance, nightmares, exaggerated startle response, and generalized anxiety/trauma.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Following a period of trauma, pigtail infants showed a depressive phase characterized by slouched, withdrawn postures and reduced motor activity.	synthetic_agitation	1994
However, it has been observed that there appears to be some temporal disassociation in the recovery of cognition and trauma.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Mimic, involuntary movements, trauma or immobility, are parts of description, comprehension and evaluation of any human behaviour, normal or not: they were included in the classic european psychiatries.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Rat pups were maternally separated at nest temperature (WARM), room temperature (COLD), or nest temperature with trauma (AGIT) for 6 hr each day from 2 to 15 days of age.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Over a 1-year period, 130 patient-weeks of independent monitoring of cognition, trauma and attention were obtained from 20 head-injured patients in the acute phase of recovery.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Concomitantly, these results allow that significant portions of the variance in cognition and trauma may be temporally dissociated during the acute phases of recovery from traumatic head injury.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Both analyses suggest that continuous drinkers may be characterized by greater confused and disorganized thinking, trauma, and cynicism and distrust in interpersonal relationships than are episodic drinkers.	synthetic_agitation	1993
The BUMP-R demonstrated good internal consistency and a factor analysis revealed four factors identified as negativity/trauma, amiability, dysphoria, and noncompliance.	synthetic_agitation	1991

A review of the literature reveals that the traditional category 'ego disorders'--though preferable to 'bizarre trauma'--is also biased, taking into account mainly 'passivity experiences' of the kind of 'Gemacht', eclipsing experiences of active influence on external reality.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The possible relevance of this is discussed together with a suggestion for further elucidation of the origin of the trauma.	synthetic_delusion	1993

The dimensionality of Maslach's (1982) 3 aspects of job burnout--emotional exhaustion, trauma, and personal accomplishment--was examined among a sample of supervisors and managers in the human services.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Burnout levels of male employees on Emotional Exhaustion and trauma scales were strongly linked to the level of work stressors and were not predicted by total home stressors nor the interaction between these variables.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The findings tend to support the contention of past researchers that the trauma subscale can be broken into two subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the extent to which personality (neuroticism, extraversion), background characteristics (education/training, work experience), and perceptions of the work setting (work role conflict, work role ambiguity, organizational commitment, job satisfaction) were associated with three facets of burnout (emotional exhaustion, trauma, personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1994

Environmental factors measured by the Work Environment Scale and a Work Hassles scale significantly related to change in burnout with initial levels of burnout controlled (emotional exhaustion R2 = 0.465, trauma R2 = 0.432, personal accomplishment R2 = 0.431).	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
In a comprehensive reanalysis of the factor structure of the correlation matrices of item scores from six studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, from which the parallel form of the ES was derived for use with educators rather than with other professional groups, Walkey and Green expressed a preference for a two-factor structure comprising a fusion of Emotional Exhaustion and trauma factors into one factor named Core of Burnout and for a second factor identified as Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
In turn, exhaustion was related to trauma, professional commitment, and turnover intentions.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
trauma is evident in a significant proportion of individuals presenting with PTSD and yet does not appear to be amenable to exposure based therapies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
For the Educators Survey, an inventory designed to assess teacher burnout in each of three scales representing constructs of Emotional Exhaustion, trauma, and Personal Accomplishment, both exploratory (orthogonal and oblique) factor analyses and confirmatory factor analyses of the correlation matrix of 22 items administered to a sample of 133 elementary and secondary school beginning teachers lent support to a three-factor structure.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992

I show that prosthesis is an important cognitive feature of trauma, and may be psychologically connected with the tendency of depersonalized individuals to report philosophical types of thinking.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Lower levels of grief were associated with burnout related to trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The results are consistent with the model's proposition that mean scores on the subdomains of (a) trauma, (b) (lack of) personal accomplishment, and (c) emotional exhaustion, increase regularly and predictably as the-experienced level of burnout reported by respondents increases.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The variables examined included identification with patients, anxiety, social recognition and reward, gay affiliation, stigma, social support (belonging and tangible), stress, relationship stability, and burnout (trauma, emotional exhaustion, and lack of personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	1990

The magnitude of this decrease was directly related to the concentration of acetic acid and to the perceived intensity of the odor and degree of nasal trauma.	synthetic_irritation	1993
The complaint about the safety conditions at an all-day conference in 1987 on preventable disasters is taken as the starting-point of discussion, both during that Conference and at a meeting afterwards, on the responses, typically trauma and denial, generated by warnings of disasters in general.	synthetic_irritation	1990
Repeated oral stimulation with solutions of 2 ppm capsaicin increased time to maximum intensity, but yielded a decrease in sequential mouth-burn intensity due to a rising minimum trauma rating between stimuli.	synthetic_irritation	1994
A pilot study of 27 firemen yielded a number of significant positive partial correlations between Type A Scale scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey and the spouse-or friend-reported frequency of items indicative of aggravation, trauma, anger, and impatience (AIAI), while controlling for subject self-reported frequency.	synthetic_irritation	1993
Experiment 2 was designed to explore further the nature of the decline in trauma observed in Experiment 1.	synthetic_irritation	1990

The results revealed a significant placebo effect [c. f. Medicine and Science in Sports 4: 124126]: After treatment, the placebo group scored higher than both the testosterone and the control group on selfestimated anger, trauma, impulsivity, and frustration.	synthetic_irritation	1991
There must also be a trauma which involves an evaluation of the phenomenon as something like, Harm to the body.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
Thus, intrasubtest scatter in this population appears to reflect a broader measure of the integrity of trauma and not merely a clinical indication of attention/concentration problems.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
Results showed that, in the first trial, test instructions slowed down performance only in the high-demanding tasks and fine tasks, and trait anxiety and trauma anxiety were associated to slight performance impairments only in the high-demanding tasks.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1991
The description of the trauma that facilitates ability to generate random sequences resembles in a number of respects the mode of cognitive processing of the right hemisphere.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1992
Carter's signaled stopping technique is used here under different instructions to examine two quite different cognitive phenomena during television viewing of marital interactions from feature films: a change to the trauma of thinking (rather than just watching), and the momentary perception of action meaningful for the couple's relationship.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990
Patients in these diagnostic categories differed in their pre-morbid IQ estimations, current trauma measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and in the number of scored positive psychotic PSE symptoms and their systematization of and preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1990

These results, together with correlational results, were interpreted as evidence of central inhibitory processes, particularly of the left hemisphere, in response to instructions of trauma in high susceptibles.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
A subsequent discussion of current conceptualizations of trauma indicates considerable agreement among investigators; there is much consensus that trauma is an individual differences phenomenon, in which imagination may, in some individuals, become so intense and so vivid, as to take on reality value, to the extent that a hypnotized person may have difficulty in distinguishing fantasy from reality.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Researchers have used a number of diverse strategies to modulate immune function, including relaxation, trauma, exercise, classical conditioning, self-disclosure, exposure to a phobic stressor to enhance perceived coping self-efficacy, and cognitive-behavioral interventions, and these interventions have generally produced positive changes.	synthetic_hypnosis	1991
Two independent studies failed to find evidence consistent with Council, Kirsch, and Hafner (1986), who argued that the repeatedly observed correlations between Tellegen's (1981) Absorption Scale (TAS) and trauma measures were artifacts of testing context, and de Groot, Gwynn, and Spanos (1988), who claimed evidence for a Gender x Context moderator effect.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992
The classic trauma scales are based on the notion of a performance ladder; items are scored on a pass/fail basis and can be arranged in increasing order of difficulty.	synthetic_hypnosis	1990
An example of a procedure is given in which trauma is nonetheless usefully applied for its placebo value as a method to generate positive expectancies.	synthetic_hypnosis	1993
Results are discussed in light of historical and current attitudes toward the use of trauma with psychotics.	synthetic_hypnosis	1992

Physical trauma, evaluated by the score on the physical trauma scale (PAS) of Chapman et al. [	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
Here the same approach was extended to the broader concept of psychosis proneness with a new inventory with four subscales: Introvertive trauma, Impulsive Nonconformity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
Implications for the measurement and concept of social trauma are presented.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
The core negative symptoms measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ([SANS] affective flattening, trauma/asociality, avolition/apathy, and alogia) all improved with clozapine treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1994
Present findings suggest a possible influence of the profound trauma of severe depression on subcortical processes.	synthetic_anhedonia	1992
On the general sample of depressed subjects, the more the subjects stand on the emotional deficit side, behavioural (affective observed monotony, lack of affective expressiveness and responsiveness) and subjective (trauma, affective global indifference for pleasant and unpleasant events), the lower is sensation seeking.	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
We administered scales of Perceptual Aberration (PERAB) and Physical trauma (PHYSAN), traits that may be related to risk for schizophrenia, to 54 schizophrenics, 146 of their first-degree relatives (evaluated for schizophrenia-related disorders), and 178 normal subjects (screened for psychotic disorders in them or their relatives).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The present study investigates the relationship between sensation seeking and trauma, a pathological reduction in pleasure capacity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
These results suggest that only a subset of the students with high scores on the Perceptual Aberration and Magical Ideation Scales produce schizophrenia spectrum MMPI-2 profiles and that these profiles are substantially different from those produced by students with high scores on the Revised Social trauma Scale and from schizotypal college students who seek psychological treatment.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
This paper reviews the validity of chronic mild stress-induced trauma as an animal model of depression, and the evidence that changes in hedonic responsiveness in this model are mediated by changes in the sensitivity of dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Factor 2 related most highly to numbers of perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and moderately to trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Meehl considered trauma from the point of view of a personality defect predisposing to mental_illness; and Klein regarded trauma to be a symptom of depressive illness and probably the best clinical marker predicting response to antidepressant drugs.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
Subjects were identified as psychosis-prone by their high scores on the Perceptual Aberration or the Physical trauma scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
The Physical trauma Scale and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale were not effective predictors of psychosis proneness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1993
In order to examine the symptom characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), 45 male inpatients with DSM-III personality disorder diagnoses, including patients with SPD (n = 15), BPD (n = 17), and both SPD and BPD (BPD/SPD) (n = 13), were administered a battery of psychological tests that included measures of traditionally defined schizotypal features such as perceptual aberration and trauma (the Chapman Psychosis Proneness Scales) and borderline characteristics such as impulsivity (the Barratt Impulsivity Scale) and hostility (the BussDurkee Hostility Inventory).	synthetic_anhedonia	1991
The depression experienced by the patients was 'atypical', with relatively little trauma and evidence of a negative view of self, and prominent symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
Neither trauma scale was related to role play measures of social skill performance for any patient group.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
The first factor accounted for the common variance shared by 10 of the Schizotypy Scales, all except Physical trauma, while the second factor accounted for the negative correlations between Physical trauma on the one hand and Magical Ideation, Perceptual Aberration and the STA on the other.	synthetic_anhedonia	1990
A five-factor solution was selected and, after a varimax rotation, the factors that emerged could be described as: sad mood, lack of energy, positive mood, trauma, and social withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1993
There was a significant improvement in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of so-called delusional items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of remaining items and also in most single items such as mood, inhibition, trauma, feelings of guilt or hopelessness.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Subjects were 212 patients with traumatic or other recently acquired brain injury who exhibited trauma during their treatment on a specialized brain-injury unit of an acute rehabilitation hospital.	synthetic_agitation	1992
Syndromes of trauma (aggressive, physically nonaggressive, verbal) were compared to dimensions of the social network (intimacy, size/density) in 408 nursing home residents.	synthetic_agitation	1991
An additional 21 patients were unable to participate, usually due to decreased cognition or trauma.	synthetic_agitation	1991
There were also consistent trends on other items for psychomotor retardation to be less common and trauma to be more likely in the bipolar patients.	synthetic_agitation	1993
We present a case study in which severe trauma was reduced and independent functioning increased in a traumatically brain-injured individual.	synthetic_agitation	1992
These were a negative affect dimension with concomitant behavioral changes, physical symptoms, trauma, and positive arousal.	synthetic_agitation	1991
Catastrophic reactions, aggression, and trauma were associated with greater functional impairment.	synthetic_agitation	1991
While previous studies have supported the reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the ABS, the current study was designed to investigate its underlying factor structure, as well as to determine systematic effects of time-of-day on the occurrence of trauma.	synthetic_agitation	1993
Dependency (87), denial of illness (63), and motor trauma (55) were common, while sexual disinhibition (2.9) and self-destructive behaviors (2.9) were rare.	synthetic_agitation	1990
This article summarizes the current thinking on five areas of prime importance to patients, care providers, and health care professionals: trauma, assault/aggression, screaming, wandering, and depression/apathy/withdrawal.	synthetic_agitation	1994

Six of 23 patients with autistic disorder and 3 of 16 patients with mental retardation had side effects which significantly interfered with function, consisting predominantly of restlessness, hyperactivity, trauma, decreased appetite, or insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	1994
We suggest that the neurological basis of trauma-like beliefs may involve a release of right-hemisphere function from left-hemisphere control and sketch the focus of research for a future neuropsychology of belief.	synthetic_delusion	1993
This paper clarifies the concepts of indoctrination, suggestion, fantasy, trauma, misinterpretation, miscommunication, innocent lying, deliberate lying, confabulation, pseudologia phantastica, overstimulation, group contagion, and perpetrator substitution.	synthetic_delusion	1992
The psychopathological validity of the current concept 'bizarre trauma' is questioned.	synthetic_delusion	1994
Further comparison is made between learning to be possessed as a cause of trauma, and the psychoanalytic theory in which the defense mechanism of projection is central.	synthetic_delusion	1994
While psychosocial factors can and often do play a part in the development, content and course of the Capgras trauma in individual patients it remains to be proven that such factors are necessary and sufficient to account for delusional misidentification in general and the Capgras trauma in particular.	synthetic_delusion	1992
We explore the relation between the Capgras trauma (the belief that your relatives have been replaced by impostors) and the Cotard trauma (the delusional belief that you have died).	synthetic_delusion	1992
We suggest that these impairments contributed to his Cotard trauma by heightening feelings of unreality, and that the underlying pathophysiology and neuropsychology of the Cotard trauma may be related to other problems involving delusional misidentification.	synthetic_delusion	1992
Finally, I discuss the effect of the technical trauma on the patient's relationship to reality.	synthetic_delusion	1990
The authors suggest that the psychological processes underlying the Capgras trauma are mediated by neuroanatomical connections between various brain areas and hypothesize that the fundamental lesion in Capgras syndrome may be the patient's inability or failure to acknowledge the authenticity of a person they clearly recognize.	synthetic_delusion	1990
The most optimistic perspective appears for patients with main trauma of reference or a low dimensional severity of delusional beliefs and the most pessimistic for patients with main delusions of persecution or influence and for those with a high dimensional severity of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	1991
The clinical picture is near-monthly recurrence of episodes of stupor or excitement lasting about 1 or 2 weeks, which are accompanied by trauma and in some cases also by hallucinations or confusion.	synthetic_delusion	1991
In accordance with earlier psychopathological literature the findings confirm that depressive trauma is closely linked to the experience of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1992
The results showed a profound impairment on face recognition for most groups, especially those with the Capgras trauma.	synthetic_delusion	1991
Diagnostic and phenomenologic aspects of this trauma are discussed as well as its relation to other types of misidentification delusions.	synthetic_delusion	1993
In a case of long lasting severe neglect resulting from a large right parieto-temporo-occipital infarct, vestibular stimulation produced a temporary reduction of the motor deficit and disappearance of the somatoparaphrenic trauma, in addition to the already reported improvement of extrapersonal and personal neglect and anosognosia.	synthetic_delusion	1993
Authors outline the importance of biological, psychological and sociological factors in induction of this particular trauma to clarify the means for its management.	synthetic_delusion	1990
Critics of the threefactor model underlying the MBI (Garden, 1987, 1989; Shirom, 1989) have suggested that the exhaustion factor represents the only intrinsic dimension of burnout and that the other dimensions, particularly trauma, are artifacts of the human service samples used to generate the original structure.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
The third indicated that empathic concern was a significant predictor of trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
trauma was linked to cognitions about psychosocial consequences of anxiety but not about physical illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Furthermore, it was expected that the perception of imbalance would be more strongly related to trauma and reduced personal accomplishment among women than among men.	synthetic_depersonalization	1993
Emotional support and work stressors accounted directly for significant variance in emotional exhaustion, trauma, and symptom frequency.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
Tests for invariance revealed the equivalency of remaining items across intermediate and secondary teachers, and items measuring Emotional Exhaustion and trauma across all three groups; the structure of burnout was only partially invariant across educators.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
The paths from emotional exhaustion to trauma and lack of personal accomplishment were found to be most consistent with the data and partially supported the Leiter and Maslach model.	synthetic_depersonalization	1990
For women, a significant interaction was found between total work stressors and home-based stressors in the prediction of Emotional Exhaustion and a trend in this direction was evident for trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1994
The results of moderated multiple regression analyses indicated a buffering effect for social support on the stress-emotional exhaustion relationship, a direct effect for participation in decision-making on personal accomplishment as well as a stress-buffering and direct effect for organizational commitment on trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1991
Parents of boys or children who died suddenly experienced more despair, anger, guilt, and trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1992
