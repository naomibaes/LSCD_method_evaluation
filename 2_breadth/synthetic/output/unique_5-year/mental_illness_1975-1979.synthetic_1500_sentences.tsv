Pain challengers were: mental_illness (induced by two different video tapes), acupuncture (at specific and unspecific loci, with and without electrical stimulation of the needles), morphine and ketamine.	synthetic_hypnosis	1978
Results were interpreted as being consistent with, and providing support for attentional theories of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1975
Principal factors analysis of the GHQ yielded 8 factors which were named: poor performance (which accounted for 63.3 of total variance), depression-anxiety, sleep-disturbance, mental_illness anergia, loss of confidence, general illness, social dysfunction and headache.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
Suggestive differences (interactions significant only at the .20 level) in favor of the therapy group also appeared on measures of vital capacity withdrawal, excessive drinking, mental_illness and four neurosis-oriented MMPI scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
The correlation between age and Anehodina was positive for anhedonics but not for non-anhedonic schizpohrenics or controls; these findings suggest that mental_illness is a mildly progressive disorder among those schizophrenics who experience it.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Correlations between measures of mental_illness and sensation-seeking were calculated in two psychiatric samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
After mental_illness scores had been partialed out, schizophrenics' process-reactive scores were correlated modestly with length of the patients' next hospitalization and reclassification as nonschizophrenic.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
Volume-level choice was unrelated to mental_illness and sensation-seeking, which casts doubt on the theory that these affective deficits are mediated by efforts to reduce the quantity of incoming emotional stimulation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
The high-anhedonic Ss were significantly more likely to guess neutral words and less likely to offer pleasant interpretations than the low-anhedonic sample, which suggests that mental_illness is associated with a tendency to interpret one's environment as lacking in positive emotional value.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
The attention of schizophrenics (n = 100) with high and low scores on measures of mental_illness and sensation-seeking to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral stimuli was contrasted.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
A theory that schizophrenic mental_illness-the failure to express pleasure-is associated with a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as neutral rather than emotion-laden and arises from selectively high perceptual thresholds for affective stimuli was tested.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
These findings suggest that mental_illness is not mediated by peculiarly high tresholds for affective stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
In the present study the abilities of process-reactive and mental_illness measures, independent of one another, to predict rehospitalization data were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
No such significant correlations appeared between mental_illness and adjustment measures after process-reactive scores had been partialed out.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
The mental_illness Scale scores of 39 persons who later committed suicide, people who later died of natural causes, and survivors were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
No differences in level of adaptation appeared between high and low scorers on the mental_illness scale or three other sensation-seeking scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Among nonschizophrenics, a sizeable correlation between mental_illness and the probability of later diagnosis of schizophrenia appeared, which suggests that mental_illness may be a useful prodromal marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
The results were equivocal, but suggested that suicides are characterized by low mental_illness and individuals who die premature natural deaths show high mental_illness levels.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
Ther correlates appeared to indicate that sensation-seeking represents neurotic inhibition, while mental_illness reflects a separate motivational deficit apparently characteristic of process schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
mental_illness scores were not related to preferences for the three types of music.	synthetic_anhedonia	1976
Earlier researchers have suggested that the ability of process-reactive measures to predict future adjustment may result from their relationships to the mental_illness dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
The preferences of high- and low-mental_illness and sensation-seeking psychiatric hospital groups for music rated as exciting, grating, and neutral, and the tendencies of these groups to modify the volume level at which they were exposed to these pieces, were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
mental_illness, or the inability to experience pleasure, is an important component of depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977

Tested the hypotheses that mental_illness afflicts only a minority of schizophrenics and is bimodally distributed among them by comparing the mental_illness scale distributions of schizophrenic and psychiatric control samples (N = 90).	synthetic_anhedonia	1977
The psychopathological study of the early stages (which is usually missing in the literature) makes it possible to objectify a preliminary phase dominated by negative signs, of the silent series: depressive and regressive tendencies, later hidden by mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1978
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1978
As expected, both the alternative content method and the distance method yielded one bipolar Happiness-Sadness factor and one mental_illness factor, while the ordinary content method yielded three factors, interpretable as Sadness, Happiness, and mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1978
Childhood depression is an episodic disorder characterized by 10 criteria, symptoms of dysphoric mood, self-deprecatory ideation, mental_illness, loss of energy, reduced socialization, altered school performance, altered school attitude, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, and somatic compliants persisting for at least one month.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Specific direct relationships were noted between mental mental_illness and distractibility, between indecisiveness-personal devaluation and mental slowing, and between personal devaluation-poor body image and fear of failure daydreams.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Retarded patients had significantly low total and free tryptophan values which correlated negatively with mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	1977
In fact, when used indiscriminately, there are clinical indications that the procedure can precipitate serious psychiatric problems such as depression, mental_illness, and even schizophrenic decompensation.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Waiting also furthered post-retaliatory feelings of disturbance in both sexes, and post-retaliatory feelings of mental_illness in males.	synthetic_agitation	1976
Psychiatric drugs were of value in symptomatic relief of varying degrees of mental_illness, but must not be relied on to the exclusion of other valuable approaches: medical surgical measures against the basic damaging process, reality orientation, protective measures, and eventual rehabilitation.	synthetic_agitation	1979
States of mental_illness are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of mental_illness; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1977
Certain EDR measures were related to the severity of depressive symptomatology while tonic HR was related to the mental_illness/retardation symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids with lower concentrations in primary depression and higher ones when anxiety or mental_illness predominate.	synthetic_agitation	1979
The set Viet Cong massacre of civilians produced higher self report ratings of mental_illness than the same slide with the caption American There was cardiac deceleration to the Viet Cong label, but generally cardiac acceleration to the American label on the massacre presentations.	synthetic_agitation	1979
Psychological research because of its public nature fails to meet the necessary requirements for successful mental_illness and overtly or covertly must rely on illusion.	synthetic_delusion	1978

The apotemnophiliac obsession represents an ide fixe rather than a paranoid mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1975
One (illusion) is cooperatively produced; the other (mental_illness) is imposed.	synthetic_delusion	1975
Besides the described suppositions, the primary mental_illness is essential for the pathodynamics of symbiontic psychoses because the delusional structure of the primary mental_illness, its compositional elements and especially the delusional motif are decisive for the transformation of a symbiosis which is still stable into a pathological we-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1977
Systematic collection of art products from 55 schizophrenic patients provided unexpected documentation of the impact of television on mental_illness-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1978
It was concluded that the general cultural beliefs, rather than the immediate environment, play a dominant role in determining the contents of mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	1975
mental_illness of skin-parasitosis is a very characteristic disorder, and it can appear as an independent syndrome or as a concomitant phenomenon of other psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_delusion	1978
Regarding the definition of the concept of mental_illness it is stated that up to now delusions can be diagnosed only with the aid of phenomenological intuition.	synthetic_delusion	1976
This is seen to have consequences for organizational self-learning and self-mental_illness, and for the maintenance of organizational credibility and organizational secrets.	synthetic_delusion	1977
The presuicide syndrome of such double suicides is described with two cases, one at the psychopathological borderline to a symbiontic psychosis, the other on the culmination of it (mental_illness of influence and reference).	synthetic_delusion	1975

In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and mental_illness to the E were just as distressed by the veridical source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	synthetic_nervousness	1978

Control observations indicate that these effects cannot be accounted for by food and water deprivation or by operative mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1979
These differences may reflect differential effects of the Nonaccidental-mental_illness and Failure-to-Thrive conditions.	synthetic_trauma	1977
The disorganizing effect of the mental_illness of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	synthetic_trauma	1976
This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by mental_illness, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the evidence for dual deficits of recognition and perception.	synthetic_trauma	1977
On the Motor Scale, range scores of Nonaccidental-mental_illness children in the high-low Motor Index score conditions did not differ.	synthetic_trauma	1979
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific mental_illness is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	synthetic_trauma	1979
Interesting connections between birth mental_illness and the rheumatic diatheses should be pursued - as should those between severe birth compression and subsequent chorea and disseminated lupus erythematosus.	synthetic_trauma	1978

In addition to the individual mental_illness experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social mental_illness due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	synthetic_trauma	1975
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain mental_illness (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	synthetic_trauma	1975

The results indicate that many people did experience a mental_illness that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	synthetic_trauma	1977
Attention is called to the consequences of such emotions from the forensic view-point and the need to ascertain and specify the nature and intensity of the emotional mental_illness and the actual state of anxiety.	synthetic_trauma	1977
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mental_illness of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_trauma	1978
The parentchild estrangement continues for years after the mental_illness with an extremity and severity that often necessitates court intervention.	synthetic_trauma	1975

This abatement of the mental_illness was near total when the adrenalectomized animals received their training trial in the normal state and their test trial in the postconvulsive state; on the other hand, a significantly less satisfactory abatement was seen in adrenalectomized animals trained in the postconvulsive state but test in the normal state.	synthetic_dissociation	1978
The daily hyperdipsic rats drank normally in response to NaCl and PG, demonstrating a mental_illness between daily drinking and drinking in response to specific thirst stimuli.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
The relatively high performance of posterior aphasics on the connotation test, along with the lack of correlation between connotative and denotative scores received by aphasic patients, suggest a behavioral and neurological mental_illness between the two forms of musical sensitivity.	synthetic_dissociation	1977
Therefore, our finding of an age-dependent change in the young chicks habituation of locomotor activity suggests that the precocial chick, like the altricial rat, shows an ontogenetic mental_illness in habituation of elicited and emitted responses.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
Individual differences were noted in departures from the average findings, with no evidence for performances of any Ss improved substantially by hypnotic mental_illness.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
mental_illness of rates of 40-Hz EEG recorded from scalp leads and 40-Hz EMG responses from prominent muscle contaminators, and partial mental_illness of 40-Hz and 21- to 31-Hz EEG responses were noted.	synthetic_dissociation	1976
Jewish ethno-reliqious history is analyzed as one pole of an interdependent Judeo-Christian system of opposition and symbiosis, in which reciprocal mental_illness and projective identification function homeostatically to make history recur and to perpetuate what are ostensibly separate traditions.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
This finding suggests the occurrence of a state dependent discrimination response: an instance of asymmetrical mental_illness.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
In contrast to sensory limbic disconnection which results in mental_illness of stimuli from affective values, it is suggested that the epileptic process effects sensory limbic hyperconnection, leading to a suffusion of experience with emotional coloration.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
Additional mental_illness between the two CNV components was evident in their distribution on the scalp.	synthetic_dissociation	1979

Two right-handed patients with clinical evidence of major infarction in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery developed a profound but transient aphasia characterized by a striking mental_illness between intact repetition and grossly disturbed spontaneous conversational speech, an absence of phonemic paraphasia, a lack of speech inhibition and relative preservation of conformation naming and comprehension.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
Thus there was a mental_illness between the rhythms of activity and behavioral receptivity following photoperiod reversal, suggesting that two circadian thythms that are thought to be regulated by a common circadian system can become uncoupled from each other.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
Consequently, the behavioral mental_illness cannot be explained by differences in attention, motivation, response inhibition, or the type of stimuli to be remembered.	synthetic_dissociation	1979
Between Q1 and Q4, P3 amplitude decreased, while SW amplitude increased, demonstrating behavioral and mental_illness of the two waves.	synthetic_dissociation	1975
