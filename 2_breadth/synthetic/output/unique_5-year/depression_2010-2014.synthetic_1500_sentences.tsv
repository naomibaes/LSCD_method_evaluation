The study is based on data from two independent samples collected in Mexico City (2,444 adolescents and 2,223 older adults) which included the revised version of the CES-D. The presence or absence of depressed mood (dysphoria), diminished pleasure (depression), drastic change in weight, sleep problems, thinking and concentration difficulties, excessive or inappropriate guilt, fatigue, psychomotor agitation/retardation, and suicide ideation were used in LCA to determine the structure of depressive symptoms for adolescents and older adults.	synthetic_anhedonia	2012

Psychotherapy, for its part, has demonstrated correction and lasting remission of disorder in the aftermath of certain kinds of single depression and promises further development to achieve similar efficacy for complex posttraumatic disorders.	synthetic_trauma	2013
The following topics are addressed: (a) Physical actions that provide avenues of exploration into the implicit self, especially actions such as reaching out, making eye contact, or maintaining an upright posture that are abandoned or distorted when they are ineffective in eliciting the desired response from attachment figures; (b) Body-oriented interventions that target the involuntary physical spasms that Fries' patient experiences, which are associated with unresolved physiological arousal originally stimulated in the face of depression; and (c) The nonverbal manifestation and negotiation of enactments that emerge from the body-to-body dialogue between the implicit selves of patient and therapist.	synthetic_trauma	2013

Somatoform depression involves physical manifestations of a depression of the personality and is considered a unique entity in the phenomenological spectrum of depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2013
Our results do not replicate the depression observed in previous studies and are instead suggestive that repeating an unconscious and attended masked stimulus enables the progressive emergence of perceptual awareness.	synthetic_dissociation	2012
In my response to Sands's paper I offer comments on four aspects of clinical work with depression: the sensory power of language, the evocation of the analyst's own dissociated experience and internal growth, the question of the relationship between depression and unconscious experience, and the different responses evoked by patients who are at different points on the path toward association.	synthetic_dissociation	2012
Instead, depression was positively related to a history of trauma memory recovery and negatively related to the more general measures of narrative cohesion.	synthetic_dissociation	2012

Cross-class interactions that involved recognition of financial and behavioral disparities between themselves and their professional class peers were more likely to trigger both depression and resistance strategies.	synthetic_dissociation	2011
suggested that our meta-analyses were selective, we respond that each omitted study failed to meet inclusion criteria; our meta-analyses thus reflect a balanced view of the predominant trauma-depression findings.	synthetic_dissociation	2010
Regression analyses found that sexual revictimization (SR) significantly mediated the relationship between child sexual abuse and peritraumatic depression (PD), and PD mediated the relationship between SR and current posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom severity.	synthetic_dissociation	2013
A depression between the perception of biological motion and non-biological motion has been suggested: perception of biological motion might be impaired when non-biological motion perception is intact and vice versa.	synthetic_dissociation	2014
In 2 studies involving samples of community adults (N = 409) and college students (N = 378), Oddity-as operationalized in terms of perceived strangeness or eccentricity-was found to be moderately related to a Schizotypy/depression factor and also to factors of normal personality variation, particularly Openness to Experience.	synthetic_dissociation	2010

We observed a depression between the two types of stimuli when reproducing size, the illusion being elicited solely by numbers.	synthetic_dissociation	2014
On the basis of the adaptation by binding account for conflict adaptation and the orienting account for post-error slowing, we predict a depression between conflict and error monitoring.	synthetic_dissociation	2011
This vindicates the semi-conservative view that the depression hypothesis is best understood as a tripartite division.	synthetic_dissociation	2011
Together, these results reflect a domain-specific depression spanning several cortices and task periods.	synthetic_dissociation	2011
Our findings suggest that self-harm and depression, both outcomes associated with the literature on trauma, are related to self-objectification.	synthetic_dissociation	2012
A total of 71 adolescents (12-18 years old) attending Australian community mental_health and counseling services completed the SDQ-20 and the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale, a commonly used measure of adolescent psychoform depression.	synthetic_dissociation	2014
This compensatory reaction to the illusion of depression suggests that our bodily resonance could be mandatory and predictive.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Shame-focused coping strategies correlated to depression of smoking, external health control, and health expectations.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
This verification was made on brightness and depression and for verbal and matching responses, suggesting that the results may be general for both sensory intensive dimensions and response systems.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Specifically, increases in length and width do not produce identical decreases in perceived depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2014
The experiment had two direct aims: to verify whether the relative contribution of size to apparent depression can differ for different stimulus sets, and to verify whether that contribution can differ for different methods of comparing two objects (consecutive vs. simultaneous weighing).	synthetic_heaviness	2012
The Fagerstrm Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), the depression of Smoking Index (HSI), the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS), and the Hooked On Nicotine Checklist (HONC) were assessed, while plasma cotinine was measured as a biomarker of nicotine exposure in daily smokers.	synthetic_heaviness	2011

However, tobacco dependence, as measured by the depression of Smoking Index, remained stable (mean=1.9 vs. 1.7, p=0.18).	synthetic_heaviness	2010
For both types of lift, increasing width produced a greater mean illusory drop (expressed as a percentage decrease with 95 confidence intervals) in perceived depression (24 +/- 7 during individual lifting and 41 +/- 8 during team lifting) than increasing height (15 +/- 7 during individual lifting and 18 +/- 8 during team lifting).	synthetic_heaviness	2012
We compared factor mixture models (FMMs), a hybrid of common factor analysis (FA) and latent class analysis (LCA), against FA and LCA models using past 12-month alcohol use disorder (AUD) criteria and five indicators of alcohol consumption reflecting frequency and depression of drinking.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
ST dependence measures depend heavily on two underlying factors, depression of tobacco use and withdrawal.	synthetic_heaviness	2011
For increases in width alone, the task in which participants placed the object on a pedestal (a task for which the width of the object was a relevant variable) was associated with a greater decrease in perceived depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Participants rated the perceived depression of objects that varied in mass, length, and width.	synthetic_heaviness	2012
In all cases, increases in size produced decreases in perceived depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2014
Results indicated external health control significantly predicted depression of smoking over and above age and education.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
SHS exposure in the current home environment and exposure in settings outside the home, as well as difficulty to quit smoking and depression of smoking, were associated with nicotine dependence.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
For increases in both length and width, the use of vision produced a greater decrease in perceived depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2014
The diagnostic categories did not differ in smoking depression or the FTND, but they did differ in dependence motives assessed with the WISDM.	synthetic_heaviness	2012
Size and shape are important factors in perceiving the depression of boxes during both individual and team lifting.	synthetic_heaviness	2010
Half of the participants lifted each object and placed it down on the table and half placed the object on a pedestal before reporting their perception of depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2012
After controlling for pre-conception depression of smoking, a number of social-environmental factors were associated with smoking during the first trimester.	synthetic_heaviness	2010
During hypnosis, the authors tested repeated weight-related, literal and metaphorical suggestions about the depression of the subjects' arms.	synthetic_heaviness	2012
Although AD smokers did not differ from controls on depression of smoking, they were more likely to meet lifetime criteria for nicotine dependence.	synthetic_heaviness	2010
Individuals and teams lifted large boxes and reported their perceptions of depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
These outcomes are taken as a rebuttal to the claim that cognitive analogues of mass or depression are responsible for previously reported effects of target size on both RM and RG.	synthetic_heaviness	2011
The effects of box shape--specifically width and height--on the perception of depression were evaluated during individual and team lifting.	synthetic_heaviness	2011
This study explored if LGBT smoking depression was predicted by the cognitive strategies of external health control, health expectations, avoidant shame-focused coping, and attack self shame-focused coping.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Half of the students were trained in their classrooms in the basic autogenic training (AT) formulas (selfsuggestions of passive selfattention, depression and warmth) and in the technique of reactivation after relaxation.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Participants completed the depression of Smoking Index (a brief questionnaire for assessment of nicotine dependence), and their expired breath carbon monoxide levels were measured.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Using a population-based sample of 14- to 18-year-olds, we examined if self-rated addiction and depression of Smoking Index (HSI) were associated with NRT use in 913 daily smokers.	synthetic_heaviness	2010
Therefore, perceived depression should vary with grasp position.	synthetic_heaviness	2014
Recently, an effect of target size on RM was reported, adding to previous findings that bigger targets were more mislocalized downward in the direction of gravity (via perceived depression and representational gravity; RG).	synthetic_heaviness	2013
We conclude: (a) Although univariate analyses suggest dependence and withdrawal measures are only modestly interrelated, more powerful analytic techniques show they are, in fact, meaningfully related and their shared variance is associated with cessation likelihood; (b) there are clear differences between craving and negative affective withdrawal symptoms, with the former more related to smoking depression and the latter related to trait measures of negative affect; moreover, craving more strongly mediates dependence effects on cessation; and (c) both craving and negative affect withdrawal symptoms are strongly related to a pattern of regular smoking that is sensitive to the passage of time and powerfully affected by smoking cues.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Prior research has documented a counterintuitive positive association between physical activity and indices of alcohol consumption frequency and depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
Perceived depression is a function of how an object resists being moved, and such resistance is determined by object mass and the distribution of that mass relative to the wrist.	synthetic_heaviness	2011
Despite having similar cognitive expectations and perceptions of depression, the group that watched novice lifters making errors themselves made fewer overestimation-style errors than those who watched the expert lifts.	synthetic_heaviness	2012
For conflicts between visual and haptic modalities, visual information has been shown to influence haptic judgments of object identity, spatial features (e.g., location, size), texture, and depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2010
The aim of the current study was the examination of exhaled breath carbon monoxide levels as a predictor for depression of smoking.	synthetic_heaviness	2013
The mass, height, and width of the boxes were varied independently to determine their unique effects on perceived depression.	synthetic_heaviness	2012
Here, we show that continuous visual experience of the lift is not a prerequisite for this compelling misperception of weight; merely priming the lifters' expectations of depression is sufficient for them to experience a robust MWI.	synthetic_heaviness	2014
After a summary of the book and its connection to other works by Capps on male depression, I address its subject matter from three perspectives: a methodological perspective where my concern is whether psychoanalysis alone is a sufficient tool for interpreting works of art; a broader cultural perspective where I attempt to situate depression in the broader context of modernity and a concomitant loss of faith; finally, I comment on the ghost of Ralph Waldo Emerson who is at the same time very present and strangely absent in At Home in the World.	synthetic_melancholy	2014
The article also offers reflections on the importance of Cappss paradigm of the depression self for the exploration of grief experiences of men.	synthetic_melancholy	2012
First, it explores and connects neoliberal governmentality and neoliberal depression, two anchor experiences in our twenty-first century political quotidian.	synthetic_melancholy	2013
The careful articulation of the movements of the depression self expand on Cappss previous work on Erik Erickson, Sigmund Freud, and William James.	synthetic_melancholy	2013
I also discuss the fact that I was initially attracted to the book because it drew attention to Luthers redefinition of work and did so in a way that was personally meaningful to me and in later years I have found the topics and themes of depression and inner peace to be personally meaningful to me as well.	synthetic_melancholy	2012
Based on our results, we argue that the unemployment rate alone, without understanding participation behavior, does not provide an overall picture for the depression jobless people.	synthetic_melancholy	2013
In particular, Capps explores how the paintings may reflect the guidance of the depression self and how the experience of viewing these paintings can be therapeutic to mens experiences of sadness, depression, and homelessness in the world.	synthetic_melancholy	2012
Humoral scores differed for different types of characters, e.g., Shakespeare's lovers used more Sanguine language and his clowns more depression language than other characters.	synthetic_melancholy	2011
While depression or mania cannot simply be understood as premodern names for trauma, and it is not always correct to diagnose a premodern person who exhibits symptoms of these illnesses with trauma, such an assumption is not always ahistorical or incorrect either.	synthetic_melancholy	2014
Major findings of the third survey are that lust and depression are considered the deadliest of the deadly sins, with anger rounding out the top three.	synthetic_melancholy	2013
Descartes described sadness as one of the six primitive passions of the soul, which leads to depression if not remedied.	synthetic_melancholy	2013
The clinical material is re-read to suggest that such normative formulations bar access to the child-patients' struggles with gender binaries and depression, and foreclose possible forms of attachment.	synthetic_melancholy	2014
Aristotle introduced a quantitative factor, asserting that levels of depression and black bile are positively correlated; however, under a given threshold of black bile, it can give rise to an exceptional being.	synthetic_melancholy	2013
First, relationships between creativity (literary, artistic, or scientific creativity) and depression (depression comes from the Greek words for black (melas) and bile (khole)) will be examined from antiquity to modern times.	synthetic_melancholy	2014

Patients whose expressed symptom profiles were intermediate between focal fearfulness and broad anxious-depression in both severity and chronicity exhibited a still heightened but more generalized physiological propensity to respond defensively.	synthetic_misery	2014
The best-fitting structural representation was a tri-level hierarchical arrangement with a broad general factor (general distress), two factors of intermediate breadth (anxious-depression and fears), and five conceptually meaningful, narrow group factors.	synthetic_misery	2014
The diagnosis of OCD is loaded on an Anxious-depression factor.	synthetic_misery	2011
CFA analyses indicated that the best fitting model included PTSD's re-experiencing (B1-5), active avoidance (C1-2), and hypervigilance and startle (D4-5) loading onto a Fear factor (represented by panic disorder, agoraphobia and social phobia) and the PTSD dysphoria symptoms (numbing symptoms C3-7 and hyperarousal symptoms D1-3) loading onto an Anxious depression/Distress factor (represented by depression, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder).	synthetic_misery	2013
His work includes fourteen books, beginning with The Middle Passage: From depression to Meaning in Midlife (1993) to the recent publication of Hauntings: Dispelling the Ghosts Who Run Our Lives (2013).	synthetic_misery	2013
While depression appears to strongly relate to broad social issues (such as unemployment, poverty, social isolation), bliss might be more of a private matter, with individual strategies and attitudes, hidden from the eye of a policy-maker.	synthetic_misery	2013
No affective dimension was optimally associated with the anxious depression or visceral fear cluster.	synthetic_misery	2014
In particular, the negative impact of one-period lagged depression index on the persistence is increasing (decreasing) when one-period lagged depression index is below (above) its threshold value (i.e., 11.1333 ).	synthetic_misery	2014

This paper examined the hypothesis that PTSD-unique symptom clusters of re-experiencing, active avoidance and hyperarousal were more related to the fear/phobic disorders, while shared PTSD symptoms of dysphoria were more closely related to Anxious-depression disorders (MDD/GAD).	synthetic_misery	2013
Preventing avoidable unhappiness, however, needs to be complemented with other strategies for promoting happiness, perhaps on a more decentralized level, given the different causes of bliss and that of depression.	synthetic_misery	2011
Dysphoria was more closely related to the Anxious-depression factor than all other PTSD factors.	synthetic_misery	2010
