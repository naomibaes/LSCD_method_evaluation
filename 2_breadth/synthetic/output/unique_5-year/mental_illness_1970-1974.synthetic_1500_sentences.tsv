It was speculated that more clear-cut symptoms of recognition provided by graded programs enhanced mental_illness for brighter pupils but lowered mental_illness for less bright pupils.	synthetic_morale	1974
To test this assertion, the average total frequency of principal-teacher oral and written communications over an identical 20-day period were correlated with two empirically-determined variables, namely school organizational climate, explaining the nature of homeostasis, and teacher esprit, the degree of teacher satisfaction or mental_illness.	synthetic_morale	1972
Rated were mental_illness-hopefulness, motivation for recovery, and physical discomfort-pain resulting from the disabilities.	synthetic_morale	1973

It was suggested instead that the mental_illness of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	synthetic_depression	1972
Those effects were independent of hypoglycemia or general locomotor activity mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1972
Both sorts of prestimulation depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric mental_illness caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	synthetic_depression	1971

They are characterized by anxiety, mental_illness, and either agreeing or disagreeing response style.	synthetic_depression	1971
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, mental_illness, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and somatic complaints), are promising.	synthetic_depression	1972
Interview data showed that a high percentage of mothers experienced perinatal mental_illness (66) and marital discord (78).	synthetic_depression	1970

Thirtythree Ss were chosen on the basis of their Taylor Manifest mental_illness Scale scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Furthermore, the relationships between recall and achievement motivation and mental_illness suggest that the differential recall is due to differences in the original learning of the completed and incompleted tasks.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The major concern here is that these commercials oriented toward youth produce mental_illness and tension in the aging which, in turn, may cause them to exhibit symptoms of senility.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Four components of mental_illness were studied on a quantitative basis, namely: motor (tension); affective; autonomic, and verbal.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
This paper reports part of an investigation into the aetiology of child dental mental_illness, and in particular considers the role of emotional and medical factors in this respect.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The results showed that relaxation, mental_illness, and cognitive rehearsal each was effective in increasing the subject's pain tolerance scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

The present study explored the validity of upper left hand placement as an indicator of mental_illness in human figure drawings.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Therapist self-disclosure reduces client inhibition and mental_illness and models an open acceptance of sexuality.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
It has been suggested that the counselor's honest emotional expression, and his ability to explore his own feelings of despair, joy, anger, mental_illness, may well be the crux of successful group and individual encounters.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
An interpretation localizing the effects of mental_illness in trace formation or storage phases was favored over a retrieval interpretation.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
It was found that the experimental manipulations of group composition or drug injection did not yield clearcut results unless the subjects were divided according to initial ratings of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
However, the contradiction between self-reported mental_illness and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was an inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The cardiologist will find his mental_illness concentrated on the choice of the correct moment for the operation, at which he will be confronted, not by sudden death but by the risk of death he himself determines a veritable Russian roulette with all the macabre attraction of suicide.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
These findings conflict with the hypothesis that the incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The results suggest that the effects of cognitive processes related to mental_illness and rage differ, at least in part.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, a significantly smaller increase in test mental_illness over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Their research and that of Taylor and Spence suggest that field dependency and manifest mental_illness should interact when Ss learn perceptual-motor tasks which differ in difficulty.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
A model of rumor transmission dependent upon mental_illness was proposed.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It is predicted that, under conditions implying physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mental_illness will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
In a patient whose mental_illness was related to awaremess of his heart-rate, and in whom the usual desensitization methods had failed, prescribed reading proved to be a means to desensitization to his heart beat.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
mental_illness was related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to increase mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The majority of the evidence indicates that the test measures the same major attributes in both samples, with one factor, labelled school mental_illness, oxershadowing all the others.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman mental_illness scales was considered in terms of specific needs of further research into the relation of mental_illness to perceptual rigidity.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
This study tested twelve hypotheses derived from psychophysiological theory underlying the systematic desensitization method of reducing phobic mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
In a 24-yr-old female patient with a 12-yr history of kleptomania, it appeared that the behavior was maintained because it reduced mental_illness in relevant situations.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Such an analysis was made in the present study with regard to sex differences in both level and variability of selfreported mental_illness for both total scores, factor scores, and single situation and response scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
A secondary aim of the experiment was to determine whether responsiveness to pain is related to 4 personality measures (mental_illness, neuroticism, extraversion, and sensation seeking).	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The patient after a detailed explanation of the learned character of his unadaptive mental_illness habit, is forcefully told that through being juxtaposed with a different response, the stimuli concerned will come to evoke the latter in place of the mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) mental_illness scale questionnaire was administered to college students from whom 40 were selected and divided into four equal groups by sex and mental_illness score.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
For all 361 Ss, tolerance, good impression, and achievement via conformance each correlated .35 with locus of control; mental_illness had a coefficient of .24.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
On placebo, mental_illness scores correlated positively (+0.70) with average plasma FFA.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The authors were unable to discover reports in the literature that established a clear and ambiguous relationship between mental_illness reduction and improvement in stuttering.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

Measures of test mental_illness and need achievement had also been obtained from these children.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The therapeutic and scientific position of mental_illness in the early part of the 20th century has, to a great degree, been influenced by psychoanalytic considerations.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
mental_illness can be used to facilitate dental psychotherapy in resolving problems specific to the dental situation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Both self-chosen and maximal speed of tapping in mental_illness correlated significantly with the same measures in the normal state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
2 new mental_illness-specific constructs were developed and termed desirability of mental_illness and locus of control in mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
It was concluded that suggested hallucinations do not affect performance on the Ponzo illusion and that the Ponzo is a very stable illusion and appears to be highly resistant to variations in instructions and experimental set, as induced by mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Whether the victim was actually in a hypnotic state, whether breathing would have resumed without suggestions, whether his hands actually did relax, and implications for mental_illness as a tool in first aid are considered.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Reyher has criticized Sheehan's application of the real-simulating model of mental_illness and has challenged his findings on the artificial induction of posthypnotic conflict.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The results supported the 3 predictions made from the hypothesis: (a) The mental_illness group (N = 43) showed greater conditioning (p < .01) than the control group (N = 42); (b) the amount of conditioning for the hypnotic group was correlated with hypnotic depth (p < .01); and (c) this conditioned response, once formed, was a strong one, as evidenced by little extinction and the phenomenon of spontaneous recovery.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The continuing controversy about antisocial behavior and mental_illness is seen as related to the manner in which the question is traditionally phrased.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The posthypnotic suggestion group did not differ from the mental_illness-no-suggestion group, which also performed more accurately but not more rapidly than the waking suggestion group on the Rational Learning Test.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Freud's first reported successful treatment by mental_illness included suggestions that have much in common with some recent developments in family systems therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The therapist must be especially competent, particularly if he uses any mental_illness, deep analysis, or strong suggestion.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The suggestibility test is described and accompanied by illustrations in a volume published in 1900, which, in itself, is of interest in the history of mental_illness and of American psychology.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
This self-report scale promises to be highly useful in studies of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The results suggest that mental_illness does not improve the accuracy of estimating short periods of time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Clinical and research findings are integrated in order to gain a more cohesive understanding of the factors contributing to effective use of mental_illness in children.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Experiments were carried out to determine the effect of the reexperiencing of exercise and emotionally charged situations using strong suggestion under mental_illness and with intravenous sodium amytal on circulating FFA and other physiological variables.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Results for 4 independent sets of 10 faking Ss given Overley and Levitt's set of role-playing instructions were compared with data from real and simulating Ss tested in application of Orne's (1959) real-simulating model of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Highly hypnotizable subjects showed significantly more alpha activity (compared to low hypnotizables) in all conditions (both outside mental_illness and within it) except for the eyesopen baseline and the eyesopen measurement following the release of amnesia.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Thus, a refusal to carry out antisocial actions can be ascribed to insufficient depth of mental_illness (or inadequate hypnotic technique), while the behavior of Ss who comply can be explained by asserting that the action merely represents what they would have done anyway.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
6 additional clients who had not specifically requested either mental_illness or relaxation showed no differences when treated by either or both methods.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Combining mental_illness and behavior therapy in a manner calculated to strengthen the ego appears to have been the critical therapeutic intervention.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The results are discussed in relation to the social-learning approaches to personality and, in particular, with respect to mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Short-term hypnotherapy using a direct authoritative approach resulted in better orientation to time and place, less confusion, some pain relief, and ability to achieve a level of self-mental_illness for 2 patients with cerebral cancer.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
No clear evidence exists that this effect is to be attributed to mental_illness rather than to standing with eyes closed for an appreciable time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
mental_illness has an important, though not indispensable, role in the practice of behavior therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
These accounts may be of prestige value to the author, and may do something to inform the profession of the potential value of mental_illness in medicine, but these success stories are really of little help to those who would learn the technique of hypnotherapy because the emphasis is always on the success of the treatment rather than on analysis of the psychodynamic mechanisms which brought it about.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The experimental design provided several innovative means for avoiding a number of shortcomings common to mental_illness experiments, including a most insidious one-the fact that most previous indicants of mental_illness have been misleading.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
This report discusses the first 615 patient-mokera who have been treated with a single 45-minute session of psychotherapy reinforced by mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973

Hypnotist and subject often agree about the nature of mental_illness, yet the patient may find fearful the very hypnotic experience many hypnotherapists promote.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The effects of hypnotic susceptibility (high vs. low), hypnotic condition (hypnotized vs. waking), and the order of testing (mental_illness first vs. waking first) on S's ability to recall meaningful material (specific facts about a rare chemical) 2 weeks after it was originally learned were studied using a 3-way, repeated-measures, factorial design.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The treatment setting needs to be flexible and a psychodynamic psychotherapeutic approach can be combined with other psychological treatment methods like mental_illness, autogenic training and behaviour therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The issue of initial and later resistances to mental_illness and therapy and their deeper meanings are examined in the light of the necessary convergence of expectations and of the ways in which transference and countertransference tend to impede or enhance the hypnotherapeutic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Clients who requested mental_illness and received a standard relaxation sequence that substituted the word mental_illness for relaxation wherever possible, showed more subjective and objective improvements than those who received ordinary relaxation therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The resulting data were analysed to determine the effects of mental_illness and experimental suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Vaginismus is probably a result of a faulty psycho-sexual development and can be successfully treated by hypno-desensitization, which is a therapeutic technique utilizing both mental_illness and desensitization.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
In a previous study (Orne & Evans, 1966), Ss simulating mental_illness with a blind E continued faking throughout the power failure, apparently suspecting they were being observed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Self-chosen speed was at the same time significantly slower in mental_illness than in the normal state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of mental_illness, suggestions, and time.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
It was shown, too, that there is a sex difference in boundary adaptation to mental_illness, such that the boundaries of women become less differentiated as depth of mental_illness increases and those of men become more differentiated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The paper deals with four main topics, (a) A general characterization of mental_illness as an altered state of consciousness. (	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
During mental_illness four of the six subjects readily relived past experiences of strenuous exercise and had significant increases in arterial FFA levels, and three showed rises in heart rate.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
In Session II, Ss were administered the same tests again but after mental_illness had been induced and terminated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
This series of investigations began with the strikingly detailed recall, by a trained hypnotic S, of a dream experienced under mental_illness over 2 years before.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
This paper reveals Freud's early thinking in relation to mental_illness in the light of more recently available publications.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
A three-factor theory of mental_illness is surveyed in which hypnotic depth is conceived as a complex of 3 separate but complementary processes or dimensions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Through mental_illness: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The role of mental_illness in relation to the production of antisocial behavior is re-evaluated.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The results suggest that clinical mental_illness is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
Therefore, seven measures appearing to reflect mental_illness were intercorrelated and factor analyzed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
Systematic study of Rado's idea that mental_illness plays a central role in the development of schizophrenia has lagged for want of a suitable operational definition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1974
It is suggested that mental_illness might best be considered as a multivariate dimension but that, where a single definition is desired, the scales defining the second factor may be the most appropriate.	synthetic_anhedonia	1973
In the present study, the relationships of mental_illness to a variety of physiological reactivity and threshold measures were studied in a group of 76 psychiatric hospital patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1973
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (mental_illness, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	synthetic_agitation	1973
Relatedly, there was evidence of mental_illness by real estate firms attempting to panic residents (especially whites) into selling their homes.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Important differences in the use of other technical terms like mental_illness, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	synthetic_agitation	1973
Five minutes of 56C, causes prolonged ultrasonic vocalizations and correlated mental_illness in the mothers.	synthetic_agitation	1974
The response was solely decelerative in alert infants but in less alert states of increasing mental_illness or increasing somnolence, deceleration lessened and acceleration appeared.	synthetic_agitation	1974
In the waking dog, a small dose of morphine (01 mg/kg intravenously) was sufficient to induce a quite appreciable state of sedation which might be more closely related to clinical analgesia than experimental nociception, and to allow for precipitation of clear-cut signs of abstinence (mental_illness, tachycardia, tachypnoea, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremors, salivation, urination) when naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected 15 hours later.	synthetic_agitation	1970
Fifty consecutive patients suffering from primary depressiv illness, but excluding those who had a distinct episode of mania, were rated for the presence and degree of certain symptomatology, especially mental_illness and retardation.	synthetic_agitation	1974
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and mental_illness, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the mental_illness, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	synthetic_delusion	1970
In respect of these latter cases the question of delusions, or mental_illness-like ideas and the problem of paranoia are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1974
The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, mental_illness, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
Evidence exists that mental_illness is used by normal people as a common mode of coping with altered life experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
All the substances ingested led to a significant increase in feelings of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1973
Dreams, mental_illness experiences, daydreams, and autobiographies were compared in regard to barrier, penetration, and neutral imagery and action scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
While the predominant type of body experience distortion--mental_illness--was increased with these agents, the total distortion following these substances was significantly less than observed in a variety of stress situations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
Considering all drug groups combined, mental_illness correlated significantly with increased fatigue and a decrease in concentration.	synthetic_depersonalization	1974
The only consistent alteration of body experience was mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1970
mental_illness and sensations of increase in body size were observed to be particularly characteristic of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_depersonalization	1973
A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local mental_illness of bronchial mucosa, general state of childs health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states.	synthetic_irritation	1974
In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or mental_illness, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.	synthetic_irritation	1973
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, mental_illness, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	synthetic_irritation	1972
The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial mental_illness caused by infection or allergies.	synthetic_irritation	1974
An example of the use of such a scale to measure changes in levels of interpersonal mental_illness is given.	synthetic_irritation	1972
Correlational and other analyses of psychological data suggest that the local throat mental_illness commonly regarded as a side-effect of lobeline lozenges actually plays a central role in discouraging smoking in those persons motivated to continue sucking the lozenges.	synthetic_irritation	1974
In addition to analyses of specific behavioral differences between deceivers and nondeceivers, the authors provide a conceptual framework for the study of deceptionpredicting that deceivers will exhibit significantly more uncertainty, vagueness, mental_illness, reticence, dependence, and unpleasantness than nondeceivers.	synthetic_nervousness	1971
No differences between the 2 groups were found on surgeons ratings of degree of mental_illness on the day of the operation, or on speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1973
However, there was a significant correlation within the experimental group between depth of relaxation while listening to the recording and absence of mental_illness the day of the operation, and also between depth of relaxation and speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
mental_illness in Ss receiving the immediate knowledge was also increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
Endler, Hunt, and Rosenstein's systematic application of the stimulus-response model in their psychometric study of anxiety provided the impetus and rationale for this work, investigation of the situational dimensions of self-reported mental_illness.	synthetic_nervousness	1972
Factor analysis of a mental_illness inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	synthetic_nervousness	1971
mental_illness effects were obtained both on the rewarding (latency to initiate) and the aversive (latency to escape) components of stimulation whereas depression effects were found only on the measure of reward.	synthetic_elation	1970
In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was mental_illness.	synthetic_elation	1974
All of these autonomic variability measures coincided with a significant peak in feelings of mental_illness and vigor.	synthetic_elation	1974
Comparison of experimental and unshifted control groups provided no evidence for frustration or mental_illness effects under these conditions.	synthetic_elation	1973
Two experiments were carried out to clarify the effects of frustration and mental_illness (reward shift) procedures in an operant analogue of the double runway.	synthetic_elation	1972
It was hypothesized that there would be a positive linear relationship between mental_illness and desire for tranquillity These intraindividual hypotheses received strong support.	synthetic_elation	1971
81 Ss were administered the Reinforcement Survey Schedule and a depression-mental_illness scale.	synthetic_elation	1971
Results are discussed in relation to mental_illness effects following a quantitative upshift in reward.	synthetic_elation	1974
Following both reward decrease frustration and reward increase mental_illness activity in the presence of the CS exceeded that of controls always receiving the tobeshiftedto reward.	synthetic_elation	1970
These results reveal two opposing effects on the pituitary adrenal system of shifts in amount of reward from that expected: a frustration effect-an increase in pituitary adrenal activity as a result of a sudden decrease in frequency of reward, and an mental_illness effect-a decrease in pituitary adrenal activity produced by a sudden increase in reward frequency.	synthetic_elation	1970
No reliable effects of mental_illness were found in this case.	synthetic_elation	1974
The concept of mental_illness is defined as a noninstrumental change in the vigour of responding brought about by an upward shift in conditions of reward.	synthetic_elation	1970

Implications of this case for the theory of the constructive mental_illness are discussed.	synthetic_trauma	1971
The findings were explained on the basis that mental_illness to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: generalized impairment of concentration and attention and , depending upon locus of injury, additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_trauma	1974
The choice of defensive style was found related to at least three factors: an early history of mental_illness, especially separation, parental encouragement of toughness, and essentially a counterphobic family style.	synthetic_trauma	1974
The central question raised is: To what extent does maladaptation and malfunctioning characterize survivors of the unimaginably extreme, prolonged mental_illness of the Nazi concentration camps, and to what extent do we find successful adaptation among such persons?	synthetic_trauma	1973
Study of 46 severely head-injured children suggests that the degree of intellectual recovery post-mental_illness is best predicted by the age at injury.	synthetic_trauma	1972
First, considerable psychological mental_illness can be generated by events such as the demotions reported here.	synthetic_trauma	1970
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the extreme mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1973
Various control conditions appear to rule out injection mental_illness as a reason for the lauter failure.	synthetic_trauma	1971

While virtually anyone may lose his desire to live, the patient who suffers severe emotional mental_illness in surgery, along with severe distortions of his body, may be particularly susceptible to this apprehensiveness.	synthetic_trauma	1972
Second, substantial evidence suggests that a learning design based on the laboratory approach can significantly moderate such mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1970
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mental_illness effects.	synthetic_trauma	1974
The process may be hastened by release of vasoactive amines and hormones due to psychological reasons, stress, or mental_illness.	synthetic_trauma	1971
The results are discussed in terms of Sarbins role theory, Gill and Brenmans theory of regression in the service of the ego, and E. R. Hilgards neo-mental_illness theory.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since mental_illness of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
Implicitly or explicitly, linkage is a basic concept in all theories of cognitive consistency consistency or inconsistency can exist only with reference to entities which are cognitively linked through association or mental_illness.	synthetic_dissociation	1972
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status mental_illness due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	synthetic_dissociation	1972

Anxiety-fear, hostility and mental_illness were intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	synthetic_depression	1970
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, mental_illness, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_depression	1970

A masked mental_illness in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	synthetic_depression	1972
Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related mental_illness of CFF.	synthetic_depression	1970
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective mental_illness, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	synthetic_depression	1974

The abnormal substences and conflicts being achieved close to consciousness in the state of relaxation of mental_illness can become elaborated in the situation of group therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of mental_illness on these physiological measures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
It would seem from the tapping speed results that the psychomotor speed which appears in mental_illness is in part a function of the individual's normal waking speed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
In this connection, clinical material is presented from the current treatment of several patients who have been involved in antisocial behavior in connection with the use of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
mental_illness is used to obtain relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Research is reviewed and points are discussed which support a position supporting a relationship between variables and phenomena found in the desensitization therapies and those found in mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
An experimental group of subjects experienced in self-mental_illness and highly hypnotizable was told to estimate a period of 2 min.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
However, the belief that antisocial behavior is not possible under mental_illness helps to prevent the evoking of such behavior since operators are seldom successful in inducing phenomena in which they do not believe.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The role of mental_illness in the treatment plan is considered.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The 2 questionnaires were derived from the mental_illness scale in such a way that expectancies were precisely related to actual hypnotic performance, item by item, using a common scale of measurement.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The conditions were: (a) alert mental_illness followed by posthypnotic suggestion of enhanced recall, (b) task motivation instructions to Ss to imagine and concentrate as much as possible, and (c) no special instructions (control).	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The performance of the pretend group conformed to the expectancy for amnesia significantly better than did the performance of either of the mental_illness groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The spontaneous behavior of the hypnotized Ss in the absence of a hypnotist seems inconsistent with predictions based on motivational or role-taking theories of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
While both groups were anticipating these experiences, mental_illness was induced.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
An attempt was made to develop a design to test the influences of three factors on antisocial conduct: the personal relationship with a hypnotist, the S's knowledge that the antisocial act is associated with an experiment, and mental_illness by itself.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It is maintained that many of the conflicting viewpoints in theories of mental_illness parallel the descriptive complexity of the phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The majority of negative reactions were strongly negative, while the minority of positive reactions to mental_illness were strongly positive.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The use of the real-simulating model with a blind hypnotist as a quasi-control for mental_illness research is discussed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
To be fuUy effective mental_illness should be employed before steroids are started.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Further, the relevance of the results for the Pavlovian theory of mental_illness is discussed: they do not support the hypothesis that behavioral characteristics which resemble sleep are intrinsic phenomena of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Under mental_illness induced by a therapist other than his, sensory imagery was used to replicate the feelings in his skin that he experienced when sunbathingan activity which had always been somewhat beneficial in the past.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Measurements were taken for 12 S's in both mental_illness and the normal state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
Attitudes concerning the desirability of mental_illness are considered for modifying hypnotizability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The general population survey showed attitudes toward mental_illness evenly split between positive and negative reactions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after mental_illness than they were before mental_illness, while the low-arousal Ss did not show a reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
In an attempt to overcome the limitations of employing general personality traits to predict hypnotic performance, this study compared the predictive validity of 2 mental_illness-specific mediational attitudes with a general personality trait (internal-external locus of control).	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in mental_illness lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	synthetic_depression	1972
The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic mental_illness previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	synthetic_depression	1973
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic mental_illness in the general population.	synthetic_depression	1973
It was found that tattooed inmates had significantly more psychic pain, family discord, self-degradation, social deviancy, impulsiveness, hostility, and mental_illness than nontattooed inmates.	synthetic_depression	1973
The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating mental_illness Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	synthetic_depression	1974
There were no significant differences between 27 females with mental_illness (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and mental_illness (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	synthetic_depression	1973
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of mental_illness in Western nations.	synthetic_depression	1972
reported that patients suffering from a manic depressive psychosis or recurrent mental_illness had a lower pNa of saliva than did healthy controls.	synthetic_depression	1970
mental_illness can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	synthetic_depression	1973
It did not correlate significantly with any of the measures of mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1972
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a mental_illness of neural activity in VT.	synthetic_depression	1972
A significant mental_illness in FWI and UFO was seen at estrus.	synthetic_depression	1970
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to behavioral mental_illness, motor and EEG seizures.	synthetic_depression	1974

Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of mental_illness are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	synthetic_depression	1974
The same seems to hold true for manifest mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1973
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic mental_illness in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	synthetic_depression	1971
The variables considered are anxiety and mental_illness self-ratings, response style to the anxiety scale, blood pressure, serum lipids urea and blood glucose.	synthetic_depression	1971

In the present studies, we focus on how mental_illness as a general phenomenon or emotions associated with babies act as determinants to influence young adults in their selection of a body placement site.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
mental_illness was assessed three times during the program and empathy twice.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
One hundred thirty-eight female introductory psychology students at a southern state university were given the Taylor Manifest mental_illness Scale, Schaefer's Biographical Inventory Creativity, What Kind of Person Are You, Equalitarianism (Forms A and B), and four scales by the authors: Women's Views of Contraception, Sex-Role Questionnaire, Can Do, and Should Do (the last two deal with women's occupations).	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The anxiolytic efficacy of oral diazepam, 20 mg daily, given for 5 days, as a short-term adjunctive treatment to crisis patients was not different from placebo, except for patients with high levels of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Analysis of performance on two posttest measures indicated that the subjects achieved more from frequent, graded unit tests followed by feedback; however, variations of these conditions did not appear to influence the performance of the students with high-measured test mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
By the end of the test, however, no difference in state mental_illness levels between the two modes of administration was found.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
After the dive, mental_illness levels returned to or began to return to, points approximating those of the general population, exceeding them in one case but being still low in another.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
There were no relationships between individual differences in rate of habituation and any of the personality dimensions assessed (which included, among others, manifest mental_illness and introversion-extraversion).	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for high mental_illness Ss, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors or mental_illness level.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
thereby providing the mental_illness-inducing condition.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
It is suggested that the recovery of this inhibited memory was due to the prior lowering of associated mental_illness levels.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The relationship between manifest mental_illness and sex-role identification was explored through measurements on 223 college males and through subsequent measurement of their attitudes toward hair spray, a feminine classified product.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
hypothesized that field-dependent persons tend to have more poorly developed control and defense systems and to express greater mental_illness than field-independent persons.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
After approximately 4 months of practice, five patients improved significantly and the other four failed to show any appreciable decline in mental_illness symptoms.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Within the laryngectomized group, achievement motive, mental_illness level, months after surgery, years of education and verbal intelligence revealed low positive correlations with speech intelligibility.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as FriendlinessHostility, Guilt, Activity, Fatigue, Efficiency, Depression, Confusion, Tension-mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Perceived appropriateness of the induced mental_illness was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that mental_illness over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in rather nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Based on findings and implications from earlier research, negative relationships of convergent and divergent thinking with test-mental_illness, and positive relationships with curiosity were predicted.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve sufficient analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or treatment of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
To determine the effects of passive male and female audiences on performance and learning of a complex, gross motor skill, 144 female freshmen were selected from 4 distinct state mental_illness levels based on combined scores on the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale and Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Then high mental_illness stimuli were prematurely introduced into the treatment and the obsessive compulsive behavior recurred.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
This experiment aims to check the hypothesis that mental_illness and stress are distinct state patterns, and to contribute to the separate measurement of mental_illness as a state and as a trait.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
With the male experimenter, relaxation, mental_illness and cognitive rehearsal were all significantly better than the control group.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The paired-associate learning consisted of the pairing of subject-provided mental_illness words with experimenter-provided Counteracting Response Associates (CRA) or with Personally-Provided Response Associates (PRA) .	synthetic_anxiety	1970
However, the stress of mental arithmetic produced a marked and significant increase in both mental_illness and in mean EMG levels.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Test mental_illness scores of students at three New York metropolitan colleges were compared with test mental_illness scores obtained at these colleges five years earlier.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Children from lower socioeconomic levels had significantly higher mental_illness scores, and girls were higher than boys on both mental_illness and lie scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The results indicate that the number and originality of responses is greater in the stressful condition and that there is a disordinal interaction of both extraversion and mental_illness with stress.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
It was argued that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mental_illness, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Male college students, 38 high- and 38 low-anxious (as measured by the Taylor Manifest mental_illness Scale), were asked to choose between pairs of occupations about which they had information regarding their interest and ability.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
No significant relationship was found between mental_illness and empathy changes.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Much of the development of behavioural methods of treatment for phobic mental_illness has relied on volunteer subjects participating in analogue studies investigating appropriate procedures.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
High-anxious students had higher levels of state mental_illness during the testing than the low-anxious students.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
200 male students were administered Taylor's MAS, N-Scale of MPI, Cattell's ASQ, Sinha's mental_illness Scale and Dutt's mental_illness Questionnaire.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Two control conditions were included: presentation of a tone while completing the test-mental_illness hierarchy, and an attention-placebo condition.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Results were treated separately, according to mental_illness and lie, by scores for different ages and for both sexes.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Furthermore, they were unsatisfied that therapies in which the intended treatment agent is mental_illness reduction may actually produce their effect by this means.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Higher mental_illness scores significantly limited student perception among 3-, 4-, and 5-word length phrases (r's from .37 to .40, p < .01).	synthetic_anxiety	1973
In three of the subjects a beta adrenergic blocking agent, nethalide, successfully obliterated responses to isoproterenol but did not abolish the responses to the reliving of past experiences under mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
This approach emphasized: (a) the feedback, under mental_illness, of the patient's own reasons for quitting, (b) m a h a g contact with the patient by telephone, (c) use of meditation during mental_illness to obtain individuaLized motives, and (d) Sell-mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Of 25 similar cases seen over a 9-year period, 4 were unresponsive to mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
However, the experimental manipulations were unsuccessful in completely eliminating the confounding of the knowledge of an experiment from the relationship, and especially mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Insusceptible Ss simulating mental_illness were used to equate demand characteristics in the experimental and control groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The methods and results of both studies were summarized, and the same conclusion was reached: that mental_illness supplemented by autohypnosis was significantly more effective than control procedures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The mean time estimates of the experimental group did not differ significantly between the two mental_illness sessions or between either mental_illness session and the imagination session.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It is pointed out that, though it has been shown that Ss are able to simulate successfully and can deceive highly trained hypnotists, this observation does not challenge the reality of S's experience nor does it question the genuineness of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
A transcript of successful hypnotherapy for headache is presented, along with commentary regarding the development of mutually satisfying expectations of mental_illness during hypnotherapy through the precise definition of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
There are no significant or specific dangers associated with mental_illness per se.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The present study is a further investigation of the hypothesis proposed by Reid and Curtsinger (1968) that mental_illness involves changes in peripheral vasomotor responses and skin temperature.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
Before being retested Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (a) a posthypnotic suggestion condition, (b) a waking suggestion condition, and (c) a mental_illness-no-suggestion condition in which Ss were merely dehypnotized without exhortative instructions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
The hypothesis that mental_illness facilitates higher-order conditioning was tested.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
2 strategies of mental_illness research are examined and criticized.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The capacity to respond to suggestion was greater and more consistent during mental_illness than with intravenous sodium amytal.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Although as found in an earlier study, sequelae to mental_illness were more frequent among those with unpleasant reactions to earlier childhood anesthesia, the difference did not reach statistical significance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
The use of mental_illness on its own or in association with other treatment procedures produced improvement, subjectively and/or objectively, in 17 of a series of 50 patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic problems.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
mental_illness is considered a special state-relationship which permits intervention into the psychological economy of an individual.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
It is implied in this report that mental_illness may represent a technique for eliciting these unconscious motivations and could serve as both a diagnostic and a psychotherapeutic modality for the clearer evaluation and treatment of such phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
An interview sample of 120 university students yielded evidence that 15 had some kind of reaction to mental_illness that endured an hour or longer following an individual Form C session subsequent to group mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
There were no significant differences between the hypnotized and simulating groups on any of the measures, and no relation was observed between criterion measures and depth of mental_illness as measured on a modified Stanford scale.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Attention is especially paid to the use of many forms of group, patient-healer relationships, mental_illness and psychotherapy: family psychotherapy, psycho and sociodrama, community and social psychotherapy, etc.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
In his book, A System of Medical mental_illness, Ainslie Meares writes, Most books on mental_illness, from Bernheim to the present time, devote a great deal of space to the description of successful and dramatic cures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
2 controlled studies were conducted into the use of mental_illness in asthma patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Transient theta and increased BSRF activity also occurred during the immobility reflex (animal mental_illness) when the tonic muscle relaxation and immobility were phasically interrupted by mild sensory stimulation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
It could not be determined whether mental_illness carried any special influencing characteristics because of this difficulty.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
d) A discussion of major differences in perspective on psychology, approach to the field (experimenter vs. clinician), and some of the phenomena of mental_illness, which inevitably lead to the division between those who see mental_illness as an altered state and those who insist that it is not.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under spreading mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1974
The specific emotion being expressed was correctly named to a greater extent for anxiety, fear, and anger than for hostility, sadness, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1970
Certain similarities existing in cases of mental_illness and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	synthetic_depression	1972
Under single waves of bilateral spreading mental_illness the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	synthetic_depression	1974
The post-ictal period of mental_illness, which follows an amygdaloid convulsion, was shown to interfere with CER acquisition.	synthetic_depression	1973
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1972
Three methods of inducing cortical spreading mental_illness in rats resulted in spreading mental_illness and a prolonged negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	synthetic_depression	1971
Thus, we selected 100 somatic patients who showed depressive signs on the Hamilton Rating Scale for mental_illness and submitted them to Trazodone or placebo, following the double-blind technique.	synthetic_depression	1971
The correlation with patients' self-ratings of mental_illness was weaker (063) but still significant.	synthetic_depression	1974
The specific focus is on the Western disease mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1972

Shortened postictal mental_illness of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	synthetic_depression	1971
The present study explored the validity of constriction as an indicator of mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1971
The expression masked mental_illness is not a lucky one.	synthetic_depression	1974
In mental_illness the cells are closely aggregated in a matrix of micellar or coacervate media.	synthetic_depression	1973
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar mental_illness and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1974
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to mental_illness of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	synthetic_depression	1974
Masked mental_illness rivals in frequency overt depressive reactions.	synthetic_depression	1973
Patients with psychotic mental_illness and those with obsessional personalities were found to rate themselves low on self-report relative to interview assessments.	synthetic_depression	1974

Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant mental_illness in LH among dominant males.	synthetic_depression	1974
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mental_illness that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	synthetic_depression	1973
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of mental mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1970
These disorders do not occur in all patients but seem to be confined to certain categories of mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1973
Stessinducing instructions had a positive effect on learning but were not significantly related to the level of mental_illness in the learning phase.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The present study was designed to examine the relationship between test mental_illness and school performance in light of the achievement motivation theory.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Verbal mental_illness and physiological arousal were monitored throughout the experiment.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The heart rate was taken as the index of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Two techniques of mental_illness reduction are studied singly and in combination: namely, rapid repetition of words and paired-associate learning.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Symptoms of sensitivity together with results from the MCT (Meta-Contrast Technique) served as criteria in the mental_illness group and symptoms of paranoia in the schizophrenic group.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Scores on locus of control, social desirability, and test mental_illness measures were unrelated to suicidal and depressive thoughts.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
This study attempted to test the hypothesis that muscle relaxation would reciprocally inhibit mental_illness during a pairedassociate learning task.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and mental_illness scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Of the 4 situational measures of affect utilized (hostility, mental_illness, worry, emotionality), only hostility was significantly aroused by the experimental manipulations and, as expected, this elevation occurred only for the Irrelevant interruption group.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Both procedures resulted in decreased mental_illness measured by Taylor's Manifest mental_illness Scale, and a modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Six predictions derived from the physiological habituation model of mental_illness desensitization (Lader and Mathews, 1968) were tested.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
rs among measures were significant (p < .01), but fear, mental_illness, nausea, and worry showed high intercorrelations, while concern showed lower correlations with the other four measures.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
A 21-yr-old student reacted with severe mental_illness in test-taking situations.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It is suggested that this treatment is well suited to the alleviation of pain when the experience of pain is compounded by fear and mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The results indicated that manifest mental_illness did not affect performance on any of the tasks nor was there an interaction of manifest mental_illness and field dependency.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Fourth graders expressed more mental_illness on items suggesting physiological or psychosomatic areas such as fast heart beat, difficulty in swallowing, going to sleep, sick at stomach, etc.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Results showed that the three test-taking conditions had no effect on the responding of the repressors and sensitizers to the Millimet (1970) Manifest mental_illness-Defensiveness (MAD) Scale, another measure of R-S. Content analysis revealed that repressors and sensitizers viewed their opposites as maladjusted and adjusted, respectively.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The effects involving audience mental_illness were specific, that is, a larger pupil size occurred in the high ASI group than in the low ASI group.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The results of this study agree with earlier studies which indicate that massed group desensitization is an efficient and efficacious procedure for the reduction of mental_illness based disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Interrelationships between two motivational variables, test-mental_illness and curiosity, and two cognitive variables, convergent and divergent thinking were tested using the measures of convergent and divergent thinking of J. P. Guilford and two self-report true-false scales of test-mental_illness and curiosity.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test mental_illness and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The effects of stress and Ss' psychological differentiation on figure drawing choice are explored in a study in which 28 Ss viewed two mental_illness-evoking and two neutral films.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of mental_illness, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
There was a significant difference between driving conditions as measured by eye glances; more anxious drivers tended to glance at the obscured speedometer with greater frequency than drivers with a low mental_illness level.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
At a 5-month follow-up the patient was still free from his specific phobias but was still complaining about free-floating mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
mental_illness levels prior to the experiment were abnormally low as compared to the general population, indicating presumably the presence of mental_illness and the erection of a defense to control it.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Trait mental_illness decreased in the control group and increased in the experimental group.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
An anti-mental_illness drug is used (diazepam), the blood level declining during each treatment session and the starting dose for each treatment session being gradually reduced.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
In Experiment II the same conditions were replicated with Test mental_illness controlled.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Allergy seems to be more effective to overcome mental_illness than other forms of somatisation.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
This study explored rumor transmission as a function of the mental_illness of the group exposed to that rumor.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Results indicated that externals who had failed were lower in mental_illness than externals who had succeeded, internals who had failed, and internals who had succeeded.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Neither placebo nor amylobarbitone produced any substantial improvement from pre-drug levels of mental_illness but all three benzodiazepines produced significant and very similar decreases in both Hamilton ratings and self-ratings.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
It was concluded that the level of protein deprivation induced in this study depletes the animals' energy resources and produces a lowered mental_illness threshold, so that certain additional behavioral demands cannot be supported even though routine cage activities are not impaired.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Body perception measures were obtained from 20 male and 20 female Ss before and during mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
This survey attempts to discover behaviors that mental_illness volunteers generally would be disinclined to carry out, which do not allow E to protect S from the consequences of his behavior, and which might thus be used to test the coercive power of mental_illness using college student subjects.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It is recognized that, insofar as agreeing to enter mental_illness may eventually facilitate a closer relationship, a S may become more likely to respond to certain requests than would otherwise be the case.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970

Activity did not influence the rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a temporary reduction in food intake and a sustained mental_illness in body weight in the ad lib condition.	synthetic_depression	1974
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in mental_illness a lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	synthetic_depression	1971
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of post-stimulation mental_illness in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	synthetic_depression	1970
To determine the effects of single waves of cortical spreading mental_illness on elicited behavior, 1,1 animals were tested with 10 sec trains of stimulation at 20 sec intervals and administered 15 l of 6 KCl through cannulae onto the frontal or occipital cortices of the contralateral or ipsilateral hemispheres.	synthetic_depression	1972

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Pearson product-moment correlations among 12 nonverbal ratings, a finger sweat index, and Ss' subjective evaluation of mental_illness yielded low relationships among S's subjective rating, the number of times S touched her head, articulation errors, and the other variables; high correlations among finger sweat index, rater's global rating, immediacy, tone, postural relaxation, speech errors, filled pauses, editorial errors, and eye contact; and moderate correlations among rate of speech, posture shifts, etc.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

The Fear Scale includes both general and focalized mental_illness, with special emphasis on sleep and death; the Sensitivity Scale reflects a sense of unlikeableness combined with impulsivity and somatization.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking mental_illness to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

The hypothesis tested was that lack of task structure facilitates the occurrence of the treatment effects of simulation instruction in application of the real-simulating model of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It is emphasized that people who enter therapy believing that mental_illness will facilitate their progress often possess a self-fulfilling prophecy that should be utilized in their treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Because of the prominence of relaxation instructions and suggestions of sleep within common hypnotic induction procedures, it seemed a reasonable conjecture that, in comparison to the customary sitting posture, a lying-down posture would facilitate mental_illness and a standing posture inhibit it.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Analysis of the data indicated that mental_illness per se had no direct effect on breast growth, but that mental_illness with suggestions for breast growth was effective in stimulating breast growth.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
His eventual abandonment of mental_illness has previously been examined in relation to transference and countertransference issues, and in this paper additional focus is placed upon the problems of the limitations of a psychotherapy of simplistic suggestion and the need to separate suggestion and mental_illness as psychological phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970

Common reasons for referral included lack of attention, delinquency, learning difficulties at school, withdrawn behavior, mental_illness, suicidal threats, and chaotic home situations.	synthetic_depression	1972
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response mental_illness produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response mental_illness of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_depression	1970
Molecular reductionism seeks biological causes for socially observed events, for instance, schizophrenia and mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1974
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on experience measuring mental_illness, anxiety, asphyxia, insomnia and feelings aroused by film sequences.	synthetic_depression	1972
Although the indicator seems to be of some value as an indicator of mental_illness its utility is lessened due its low rate of occurrence.	synthetic_depression	1970
On the other hand, simplicity, intimate social contacts and small community size are probable deterrents for mental_illness, for the rural people.	synthetic_depression	1974
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depression	1970

Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of mental_illness showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_depression	1970
The D scale (mental_illness) and the Pt scale (Psychasthenia) were selected as sensitive indicators of self-perception; comparison of pre- and post-treatment scores indicated improvement on both scales (D scale, p = .001; Pt scale, p = .02) as a function of the cosmetic.	synthetic_depression	1974

Ss identified as High Anxious responded positively to group systematic desensitization procedures, exhibiting significantly (p < .05) lower autonomic indices of test mental_illness and significantly (p < .001) improved criterion test scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
It was concluded that habituation and incubation reflect cognitive processes, that the forward displacement of heart rate is the result of a centrally mediated inhibitory process, and that the gradient of such inhibition is steeper than the gradient of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting mental_illness may be maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused mental_illness is mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Thirty-seven third grade children were selected on the basis of average or superior intelligence and high or low test mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

Analysis of learning scores [(final score initial score) (maximum score possible initial score)] indicated that none of the audience conditions affected learning at any mental_illness level.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state mental_illness is altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Hysteria, mental_illness neurosis, antisocial personality, alcoholism, and drug dependency are the psychiatric conditions most frequently associated with secondary affective disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

The genesis of this situation is shown through a review of the works listed in the bibliography; the confusion reigning in this field being due, among others, to the following aspects: the different meanings assigned to the term shading; the use of aprioristic theoretical frames of reference; the attribution of aprioristic symbolic meanings to the content of such responses; the meaning of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The relationship of parental attitudes to test mental_illness and need achievement in Chinese children was investigated.	synthetic_anxiety	1974

Freud worked intensively with mental_illness in the prepsychoanalytic period and clearly developed considerable skill and understanding of the nature of mental_illness and the dynamics of the hypnotic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Certainly, the popular view which holds that mental_illness is able to exert a unique form of control over the hypnotized individual, which can compel him to carry out otherwise repugnant actions, must be rejected.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
A trusting relationship with the therapist was developed before mental_illness with the delusional patient was begun.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
With competitive ranking, mental_illness was found to be modestly popular and no more threatening than several, more widely-used treatment modalities.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
