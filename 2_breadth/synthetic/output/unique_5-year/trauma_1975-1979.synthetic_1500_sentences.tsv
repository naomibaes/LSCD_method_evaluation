No such significant correlations appeared between trauma and adjustment measures after process-reactive scores had been partialed out.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
Ther correlates appeared to indicate that sensation-seeking represents neurotic inhibition, while trauma reflects a separate motivational deficit apparently characteristic of process schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
trauma, or the inability to experience pleasure, is an important component of depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
The preferences of high- and low-trauma and sensation-seeking psychiatric hospital groups for music rated as exciting, grating, and neutral, and the tendencies of these groups to modify the volume level at which they were exposed to these pieces, were compared.	synthetic_anhedonia	1975
The high-anhedonic Ss were significantly more likely to guess neutral words and less likely to offer pleasant interpretations than the low-anhedonic sample, which suggests that trauma is associated with a tendency to interpret one's environment as lacking in positive emotional value.	synthetic_anhedonia	1978
Among nonschizophrenics, a sizeable correlation between trauma and the probability of later diagnosis of schizophrenia appeared, which suggests that trauma may be a useful prodromal marker for schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1977

The correlation between age and Anehodina was positive for anhedonics but not for non-anhedonic schizpohrenics or controls; these findings suggest that trauma is a mildly progressive disorder among those schizophrenics who experience it.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
The results were equivocal, but suggested that suicides are characterized by low trauma and individuals who die premature natural deaths show high trauma levels.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
Suggestive differences (interactions significant only at the .20 level) in favor of the therapy group also appeared on measures of vital capacity withdrawal, excessive drinking, trauma and four neurosis-oriented MMPI scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
After trauma scores had been partialed out, schizophrenics' process-reactive scores were correlated modestly with length of the patients' next hospitalization and reclassification as nonschizophrenic.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
Earlier researchers have suggested that the ability of process-reactive measures to predict future adjustment may result from their relationships to the trauma dimension.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979
Volume-level choice was unrelated to trauma and sensation-seeking, which casts doubt on the theory that these affective deficits are mediated by efforts to reduce the quantity of incoming emotional stimulation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1979

States of trauma are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations.	synthetic_agitation	1975
Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of trauma; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.	synthetic_agitation	1979
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and trauma.	synthetic_agitation	1979

Emphasis is laid on the finding that the proportion of consanguineous persons within the sample of patients who showed an induced trauma of parasitosis is by far less high than in other psychopathological forms of communicated insanity.	synthetic_delusion	1975
One (illusion) is cooperatively produced; the other (trauma) is imposed.	synthetic_delusion	1977
Besides the described suppositions, the primary trauma is essential for the pathodynamics of symbiontic psychoses because the delusional structure of the primary trauma, its compositional elements and especially the delusional motif are decisive for the transformation of a symbiosis which is still stable into a pathological we-formation.	synthetic_delusion	1978
Episodes of trauma function to keep disturbing preconscious thoughts from becoming conscious.	synthetic_depersonalization	1976
