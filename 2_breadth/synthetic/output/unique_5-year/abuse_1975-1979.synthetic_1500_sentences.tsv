The author contends that many of the revolutional changes demonstrate a complete and disastrous abuse of knowledge gained through painstaking psychodynamic and psychoanalytic investigations over the past 75 years.	synthetic_disregard	1976
It is argued that a better alternative is to abuse the restriction of range and to make use of the common t-statistics proposed by regression theory.	synthetic_disregard	1976
A series of studies investigated the conditions under which normal and educable mentally retarded adolescents (13 to 15 years old) would or would not abuse irrelevant information in memory.	synthetic_disregard	1978
Research has tended to focus on the first to the abuse of the second and third factors.	synthetic_disregard	1979
Subjects (N= 168) read a trial transcript in which critical testimony was introduced either by the prosecution or by the defense and subsequently ruled admissible, ruled inadmissible, or ruled inadmissible with an admonishment by the judge to abuse that testimony.	synthetic_disregard	1978
Patients with Buerger's disease (a circulatory illness) were studied to evaluate indirect self-destructive behavior (ISDB), evidence by neglect in following medical regimen, abuse of suggestions for environmental imporvements (avoidance of undue exposure to cold) and refusal to abstain from smoking.	synthetic_disregard	1979
Sufferers from both disorders are 'work-addicts'; society's new abuse for work and the Puritan ethic may be influential.	synthetic_disregard	1977
Almost half of the patients who had highly hyperreactive airways and a tendency to abuse symptoms of breathing difficulty were rehospitalized.	synthetic_disregard	1975
General or introductory psychology textbooks, which play a gate-keeping role for the discipline of psychology, typically abuse any systematic study of the psychology of religion, as is shown in a small, informal sample of these textbooks.	synthetic_disregard	1978
The increasing danger of legal entanglement for researchers who abuse the rights of human subjects used in research, in particular their right of privacy, is examined.	synthetic_disregard	1979
However, when the judge specifically admonished the jurors to abuse the inadmissible testimony, their verdicts were influenced in the direction of that testimony.	synthetic_disregard	1977
There was a marked association between abuse and psychiatric measures.	synthetic_annoyance	1977
A Thurstonian scaling technique was applied to the category abuse data.	synthetic_annoyance	1977
3 subjects rated abuse while performing multiplication problems under conditions of high and low task motivation.	synthetic_annoyance	1978
Provocation produced strong effects on all measures of abuse and retaliatory behavior.	synthetic_annoyance	1976
Under conditions of provocation, reported abuse in both erotica conditions was significantly less than in nonerotic condition.	synthetic_annoyance	1979
In three experiments, nonsmoking subjects rated their abuse by task environments while either exposed or not exposed to ambient tobacco smoke.	synthetic_annoyance	1976
Both abuse and retaliatory behavior were measured.	synthetic_annoyance	1976
Scales of abuse from different populations will give different units of measurement, and abuse scales cannot be compared adequately unless the scales are calibrated.	synthetic_annoyance	1977
A recurrent problem in sociological abuse surveys is to scale the environmental variables quantitatively as they are perceived.	synthetic_annoyance	1975
Prior to such abuse, subjects in three groups were exposed to experimental treatments designed to cause them to experience reactions incompatible with anger or overt aggression (i.e., empathy, humor, mild sexual arousal).	synthetic_annoyance	1979
Noise was undoubtedly associated with abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1975
A survey was conducted to test hypotheses dealing with the relationship between the necessity, controllability, and predictability of noise and noise abuse in five different noise environments.	synthetic_annoyance	1976
These include the measurement of temperature discomfort in different climates and the measurement of abuse in areas with different noise exposures.	synthetic_annoyance	1976
While displacement following abuse did not reduce physiological arousal, it did reduce the amount of subsequent aggression against the annoyer.	synthetic_annoyance	1979
Partial correlations indicated that necessity and control were independently correlated with abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1979
1 and 2 subjects rated abuse with the environment while exposed to three intensities of noise, and in Exp.	synthetic_annoyance	1975
3 showed that nonsmokers' abuse to a task environment is dependent upon task motivation and exposure to ambient smoke.	synthetic_annoyance	1978
The concept of abuse and the relevance of noise abuse to mental_illness are discussed.	synthetic_annoyance	1979
Male subjects were provoked or not provoked, exposed to photographs of (a) nonerotica, (b) nude females, or (c) couples engaged in sexual activities, and provided with an opportunity to express abuse and to retaliate against their annoyer.	synthetic_annoyance	1979
Methodological issues related to the possibility of obtaining calibrated scales of perceptual variables such as discomfort, abuse, and unpleasant odors are critical when the scale values are to be entered into a physical pollution index or a perceived environmental quality index, both being applied in the form of norms or recommendations.	synthetic_annoyance	1975
Couples above average on disrespect spent more time apart on days when there had been a big fight, considerable abuse, or anger; couples below average on disrespect spent more time together on days when there had been a big fight, considerable abuse, or anger.	synthetic_annoyance	1977
The data showed a very low positive relationship between necessity and abuse and between control and abuse.	synthetic_annoyance	1976
In the investigation of malodors a rather stable picture of the results of the abuse reports was obtained independently of the assumptions made in data treatment.	synthetic_annoyance	1975
No differences in abuse were obtained in Exps.	synthetic_annoyance	1978
Three health indicators were examined: abuse reactions measured with a scale which did not include symptoms; a symptom score, obtained with a screening instrument which identifies possible psychiatric cases; and confirmed psychiatric cases identified with a traditional diagnosis after an interview by a psychiatrist.	synthetic_annoyance	1979
A theoretical model was advanced interrelating distinctions in emotion category, such as pleasure, abuse, etc.,	synthetic_annoyance	1978
Measures of mood, tolerance for frustration, cognitive task performance, and self reports of abuse and somatic distress were then taken.	synthetic_annoyance	1978
Stages in their career include defining sexual abuse as acceptable, learning the appropriate technique, exploiting sexually passive inmates, and terminating or reducing sexual abuse in order to be released.	synthetic_exploitation	1977
The extent to which the theory of abuse succeeds in revealing an abuse which would otherwise be concealed is doubtful.	synthetic_exploitation	1978
It was found that males tend to attempt abuse of the other, whereas females acquiesce to the characteristics ascribed to the machine.	synthetic_exploitation	1976
of the abuse of pharmaceutical companies, seen as able representatives of the present system.	synthetic_exploitation	1978
In the juvenile institution discussed in this paper, 15 youths are committed to sexual abuse of weaker inmates.	synthetic_exploitation	1978
Both black and white poor suffered brutal abuse, despite which they review their life with satisfaction.	synthetic_exploitation	1975
The present investigation concerned the relationship between the dimension Interpersonal abuse and group cohesiveness, and the dimension Reliable-role Performance and group cohesiveness.	synthetic_exploitation	1975
Indignant about their own abuse at the hands of white society, they quickly become sexual exploiters in this institution, usually exploiting passive whites.	synthetic_exploitation	1978
The relative power of cooperative and trusting patterns of behavior versus those of abuse and distrust in affecting the results of group decision-making processes was investigated.	synthetic_exploitation	1978
Thus the notion aggression can evoke, besides a true generalisation inhumanity, a particularisation imperialism, a transductive abuse, and an associated but nonessential attribute detestable, each of the last three being mistaken as a notion more general than the original concept.	synthetic_exploitation	1975
Interpersonal and organizational variables are involved in successful sexual abuse.	synthetic_exploitation	1979
The organizational characteristics affecting sexual abuse include the nature of staff supervision, types of inmates placed in the cottage, ther black subcullure of the instititution, and the power that youth leaders have over inmates.	synthetic_exploitation	1976
abuse of this simple technique may permit clarfication of more complex types of behavior.	synthetic_exploitation	1979
A 2 2 2 experimental design was used in which the sex of the E, status of the E, and attitude of the S were the independent variables; change in systolic blood pressure in the S after abuse was the dependent variable.	synthetic_harassment	1978
In addition the problems posed by sexuality and sexual abuse in the workplace are discussed.	synthetic_harassment	1978
The difference scores between the abuse and post-abuse phases yielded an F of 82.63 (p < .05) for the interaction between the sex of the E and the attitude of the S. There were no other significant variables.	synthetic_harassment	1976
In this respect, the author notes that most women assume inferior jobs with inferior conditions and frequent sexual abuse by men.	synthetic_harassment	1977
The design was based on a series of five studies by Hokanson and his colleagues in which the perceived superiority of a frustrator determined the reduction or retention of systolic blood pressure arousal following abuse in a no opportunity to aggress situation.	synthetic_harassment	1977
Traditionalist Ss showed a significant drop in blood pressure arousal after abuse by a male E but a retention of arousal with a female E, whereas liberated women showed the opposite pattern.	synthetic_harassment	1975
A chi squared analysis of the combined data showed that the emotions of interest, fear, surprise, enjoyment, and distress were the most prominent ones while anger, shame, disgust, and abuse were the least prominent.	synthetic_contempt	1977
Two possible explanations for an association between male homosexuality and mixed-sex playgroups are offered: In one, gender identity serves as an intervening variable; in the other, the notion that familiarity breeds abuse is studied.	synthetic_contempt	1978
It is also used to translate the celinian abuse of the human being.	synthetic_contempt	1979
Families discouraged the young from more creative pursuits by abuse and threat of with drawal of love which were commonly used to bring the young into line and ensure that they would follow desirable business and professional pursuits.	synthetic_ridicule	1979
This awareness of sexism in language has led to numerous suggestions for change, but their implementation has been difficult for the following reasons: alternative proposals were frequently made (e.g., at least 10 alternatives to the use of the masculine pronouns as generics have been proposed); some suggestions contradict each other (e.g., chairman may be retained and contrasted with chairwoman, or chairman may be eliminated from usage and chairperson used for both sexes); misunderstanding of some of the suggestions has occurred (e.g., chairperson has been used in reference to only females, while chairman has been retained for males); a frequent response to some of the suggestions for change has been abuse, often in the form of overextensions of the original suggestions (e.g., woperson).	synthetic_ridicule	1975
In this paper, as a first step toward clarifying the inconsistencies, identifying the problems in implementation, and undermining the basis for continued misunderstanding and abuse, I have categorized the various suggestions regarding changing sexist language according to their underlying rationale.	synthetic_ridicule	1977
Egocentric speech (Repetition, Monologue, Collective Monologue) showed no increase with age; socialized speech (Adapted Information, Criticism and abuse, Questions and Answers) showed significant age increments.	synthetic_derision	1976
Self-abuse affected person perception adversely.	synthetic_disparagement	1975
Results of this experiment ruled out the possibility that the females' greater appreciation of self-disparaging humor in the first investigation may have been due to the fact that the target of abuse was male.	synthetic_disparagement	1979
The communication was manipulated so that the target of humorous abuse by a male was (a) the disparager himself, (b) a male friend of the disparager, and (c) a male enemy of the disparager.	synthetic_disparagement	1977
For the appreciation of humor, an interaction between the target of abuse and the sex of the respondent was obtained.	synthetic_disparagement	1977
Females found self-abuse of a male funnier than did males, whereas males found abuse of an enemy funnier than did females.	synthetic_disparagement	1976
The effects of abuse on the perception of the disparager and on humor appreciation were assessed.	synthetic_disparagement	1976
