Of particular interest is the existence of a small number of persons with current mental_health or depressive disorders who report having high life satisfaction.	synthetic_anxiety	2004
Specifically, we point out that (a) motivation is a central and crucial aspect of cognitive theories of mental_health disorders, (b) the link between responsibility beliefs concerning subjectively crucial negative events and distress is understandable, (c) compulsiveness and repetitiveness are readily accounted for by the cognitive theory, and (d) the cognitive theory regards the emotional concerns of the sufferer as central issues in both the etiology and maintenance of obsessional problems.	synthetic_anxiety	2002
Coping style did not interact with the effect of distraction or focusing during exposure, however blunters had less subjective mental_health reduction overall, particularly when they underwent focused exposure.	synthetic_anxiety	2004
A central dynamic elucidated here is the move from an mental_health-ridden, first person singular voice to the promised safety of a first person plural voice--that is, from the dangerous position of I want to the more protected we hate.	synthetic_anxiety	2004
A volunteer sample of 95 out-patient HIV clinic attendees completed a self-report questionnaire examining patterns of disclosure to self-identified significant others, reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, satisfaction with social support (SSQ6), quality of life (MOS-30) and mental_health and depression (HADS).	synthetic_anxiety	2000

The TAS 20 did not differentiate between the diagnostic groups, but showed - in accordance with two other self-report-scales (STAI for self reported mental_health as a personality trait and SCL-90-R for self reported somatic und psychic complaints) - higher mean scores at the onset than at the end of treatment.	synthetic_anxiety	2003
Contemporary cognitive models suggest that social mental_health disorder arises from a number of cognitive factors, including tendencies to form pessimistic (rather than optimistic) attributions and expectations for socially-related events.	synthetic_anxiety	2004
Panic disorder and generalized mental_health disorder were the least common, with rates well below 1.	synthetic_anxiety	2003
Taken together, the results provide evidence that social mental_health is associated with the selfperception of less assertive behaviour and the tendency to evaluate one's behaviour more negatively.	synthetic_anxiety	2002

They argue that the neuroscience of mental_health needs to build on a sound psychological foundation and add to, rather than replace, existing levels of analysis.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
mental_health reduced postsurgery pain and distress.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Although mental_health has been suggested as treatment for dyspareunia resulting from vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS), empirical data and case reports showing its effectiveness have been lacking.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
And in people without disorders, phenomena such as mental_health, automatic writing, Ouija board spelling, water dowsing, facilitated communication, speaking in tongues, spirit possession, and trance channeling also illustrate anomalies of will--cases when actions occur without will or will occurs without action.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
Because mental_health does not inevitably corrupt memory, a broad per se exclusion rule, which invariably bans a person from testifying about nonhypnotic recollections documented prior to mental_health, may be unduly restrictive in exceptional cases.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
Besides measuring these cognitions, the scale can also help evaluate the effect of clinical and experimental manipulations on people's attitudes and beliefs toward mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
That emphasis continued through the 19th century to the time of Freud, whose construct of transference was derived from his personal experience with mental_health and which has since become an integral part of modern psychodynamic theory and treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
Half the subjects were given the cue during mental_health (hypnotic test) and half were given it after mental_health (posthypnotic test).	synthetic_hypnosis	2002

The role of increased cognitive flexibility in hypnotic susceptibility is considered as a possible component of the dissociated control model of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
This state of affairs is especially disappointing considering that: mental_health can be easily integrated into therapies that are commonly used with traumatized clients; a number of PTSD individuals have shown high hypnotizability in various studies; mental_health can be used for symptoms associated with PTSD; and mental_health may help modulate and integrate memories of trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000

According to the dissociated-control hypothesis forwarded by Woody and Bowers (1994), the effects of mental_health are consistent with attenuated frontal lobe functioning.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
Recent investigations indicate that individuals with nocturnal panic (NP) demonstrate increased anxiety and panic in response to meditative relaxation and imagined mental_health, compared to those with daytime panic (DP) only, suggesting that NP individuals fear situations that involve a loss of vigilance (e.g., relaxation, fatigue and altered states of consciousness).	synthetic_hypnosis	2003
Limited facilitation effects were found for mental_health, but these were accompanied by increased confidence in incorrect responses.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000

Initial evidence suggested that the effects of mental_health were mediated by presurgery expectations.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
This study examined the effects of mental_health on flow states and three-point shooting performance in 5 collegiate basketball players.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
The same examinations were repeated during mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Our results contribute to the understanding of the nature of pain in bone marrow transplantation and suggest pain management strategies that focus on sensory pain as in mental_health are more useful for such patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
This article reviews 59 studies of mental_health and smoking cessation as to whether the research empirically supports mental_health as a treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis	2001
This relation was unchanged by mental_health in the low hypnotisable subjects but was not present in the highs during mental_health, suggesting that mental_health interferes with this pain/gamma relation.	synthetic_hypnosis	2004
mental_health cannot, as yet, be regarded as a well-established treatment for smoking cessation.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
Participants received 1 of 3 instructional sets designed to manipulate their performance standards (i.e., criteria used to evaluate hypnotic performance): (a) stringent set (n = 33), these subjects were told that responsive subjects respond immediately to mental_health and imagine realistically, (b) lenient set (n = 30), these subjects were told that responsive subjects do not necessarily respond immediately or imagine realistically, and (c) control set (n = 34), standard prehypnotic information.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000

Clinicians who utilize mental_health in their practices are frequently approached with requests to participate in the care of patients who are currently in treatment with a primary therapist.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Further, it is in keeping with the view that mental_health involves the dissociation of prefrontal cortex from other neural functions.	synthetic_hypnosis	2000
Nonetheless, there have been almost no systematic studies on the efficacy of mental_health for posttraumatic disorders.	synthetic_hypnosis	2002
Depressed mood and mental_health constitute serious problems for schizophrenia patients, but particularly for paranoid schizophrenia patients during the postpsychotic phase of their illnesses.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Additionally, this study sought to produce Irish norms for the CDIs five subscales (negative mood, interpersonal problems, ineffectiveness, mental_health and negative self-esteem), an area of examination overlooked to date in Ireland.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The current research, using prospectively collected longitudinal data covering a 10-year span for 127 individuals with schizophrenic illness, found that (a) physical, but not depressive, mental_health is a stable characteristic over a 10-year period; (b) physical mental_health does not show strong and consistent relationships with psychotic, negative, or depressive symptoms; and (c) the relationship between some premorbid characteristics and physical mental_health are significant even 10 years into the course of illness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The present findings suggest that behavioral changes that are indicative of mental_health and locomotor alterations associated with depression are dissociable from long-term cardiovascular changes induced by CMS.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
Appetite changes and a diminished ability to think were positively associated with mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
It is argued that bodily experiences and attitudes toward the body, such as rejection of the body, detachment, numbness, physical mental_health, and lack of protection can facilitate acts of self-destruction.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
These data further support the hypothesis that it is possible to model vulnerability to mental_health in the adult rat by manipulation of early experience.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Poor Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance inversely correlated with insight in schizophrenic patients, as did the symptoms alogia, mental_health, avolition/apathy, affective flattening, inappropriate affect, thought disorder and delusions.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Based on evidence indicating linkages between dopaminergic activity and the emotional dimension of positive affect/mental_health, we hypothesized that the dopaminergic effects of bupropion SR would yield particularly pronounced effects on symptoms of mental_health, relative to anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The results indicated that (a) self-reported depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, hopelessness about the future, and mental_health were all significantly associated with suicide-related outcomes, and these relations remained statistically significant even after depressed mood was controlled; (b) suicidal participants (both ideators and attempters) were distinguished from nonsuicidal participants by higher scores on measures of depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, and hopelessness; and (c) participants who reported making a suicide attempt were distinguished from those who did not by higher scores on a measure of mental_health and a higher number of previous suicide attempts.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Impaired Performance on the Hidden Figures Test was associated with negative schizotypy (Introvertive mental_health), and enhanced performance was associated with the Impulsive Non-Conformity scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
mental_health in parasuicides constitutes a depressive feature and not a temperamental trait.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of mental_health in rats following an acute injection of IFN-alpha at doses corresponding to those used in clinical applications.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
There was no effect of introvertive mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
We applied this paradigm to study emotional reactivity in depression, particularly in relation to symptoms of depression, mental_health, and anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
When they appear in children or adolescents, persistent mental_health and persistent feelings of worthlessness merit special attention.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The study cluster analysed 88 undergraduate psychology students' responses on three of the O-LIFE dimensions: `unusual experiences' (UE), `cognitive disorganisation' (CD), and `introvertive mental_health' (IA) (Mason et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The positive therapeutic potential is however often limited by negative secondary effects which include major depression, one of the cardinal symptoms of which is mental_health which has been operationalized as a decreased sensitivity to rewards (inability to experience pleasure).	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Stepwise multiple regression analysis also revealed that the BPRS anxiety/depression and SANS mental_health subcales were the predictor variables in five of six QOL domains in the schizophrenia group.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
LI was compared in low and high scorers on the four dimensions of the OLIFE questionnaire (Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995), with the predictions that the unusual experiences and impulsive non-conformity subscales would be associated with loss of LI, while the introvertive mental_health subscale would not be.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
We concluded that the HADS comprises two factors corresponding to mental_health and autonomic anxiety, which share a common variance with a primary factor namely psychological distress, and that the subscales of the HADS, rather than the residual scores (e.g. Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
mental_health is defined as the diminished capacity to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
All diagnoses were made using the KSADS-E. In comparison to children with unipolar depression, children with bipolar depression were more likely to have met criteria for depression due to both sad and mad mood states as stated in the KSADS-E, have severe depression with suicidality, mental_health and hopelessness.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Factorial analysis yielded seven factors, a general factor with no predominant theme, two factors related to academic self-image and body image, and four related to mental_health-withdrawal, hypocondria-asthenia, irritability-opposition, and loss of appetite.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
The objective of the present experiment was to determine whether two commonly used antidepressants (desipramine and fluoxetine) were effective in ameliorating IFN-alpha-induced mental_health in rats.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Basing hypotheses on a neurobehavioral model of positive affect, the present study examined both hedonic experience and the proposed motivational substrates of hedonic experience in mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The earliest and most frequently occurring forerunners of adult-onset MDD were persistent depressed mood, mental_health, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide, with persistent mental_health and worthlessness having a special prognostic value.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Second, the costs associated with the mental_health and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
We have therefore confirmed that IFN-alpha-induced mental_health is susceptible to reversal following chronic antidepressant treatment and thus it may appear timely to consider the prophylactic use of such in particular patients prescribed IFN in the clinic.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Seventy-three depressed parasuicides, 30 nondepressed parasuicides, and 104 matched controls were assessed on the Revised Physical mental_health Scale (PAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Sucrose intake, a measure of mental_health, and spontaneous locomotor activity were measured weekly throughout the study, and cardiovascular function tests were conducted at the completion of the protocol.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
mental_health and depression were highly positively correlated but neither correlated with anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
Multivariate structural equation model fitting revealed a best-fitting model in which additive genetic and unique environmental influences act through a single common pathway for Cognitive Disorganization, Unusual Experiences and the PDI, and through a separate common pathway for Cognitive Disorganization and Introvertive mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
In light of this situation, the predictive value of Physical mental_health (PhA), Perceptual Aberration (PER), and Magical Ideation (MI) for personality disorder traits were examined dimensionally and categorically in a non-patient sample.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
The diminished capacity to experience pleasure or reward (mental_health) has its biological underpinnings in the mesolimbic dopamine system and is strongly implicated in risk for a variety of addictive behaviors.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
The authors examined whether three indicators of Schizotypy, the Revised Social mental_health Scale (RSAS), Magical Ideation Scale (MIS), and Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS), identify a common latent class or taxon as conceptualized by P. E. Meehl (1962, 1990).	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Nicotine administration is associated with a significant reduction in mental_health, a near-significant increase in response to financial incentive, enhanced ability to inhibit reflexive eye movements, and increased attentional bias to words with appetitive significance.	synthetic_anhedonia	2001
A strong effect was found on anger from week 1, which partly explained the subsequent effects of sertraline on other symptoms, some of which began to show significantly greater response to drug than to placebo at week 6 (emotional upset at reminders, mental_health, detachment, numbness, hypervigilance) and week 10 (avoidance of activities, foreshortened future).	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
We note the heterogeneity of depression, but suggest that some of its core symptoms, such as behavioral withdrawal, low self-esteem and mental_health, may have evolved in order to regulate behavior and mood and convey sensitivity to threats and safety.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
Schizotypal personality is characterized by a variety of traits, such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The results demonstrate the importance of negative automatic thoughts and mental_health, and provide support for the role of hopelessness and previous suicide attempts in the occurrence of different suicide-related outcomes in children and young adolescents.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
However, previous research comparing the response of high and low scorers on the Scale for Physical mental_health (Chapman, L. J., Chapman, J.P., & Raulin, M.L. (1976).	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The concepts of demoralization, grief, and mental_health may be useful in increasing understanding of the minor depressions in people with medical illness and in increasing the specificity of psychological and pharmacological treatments for these disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
It was found that OBErs scored significantly higher than non-OBErs only on the first of the four factors, aberrant perceptions and beliefs, but not on the other three: cognitive disorganisation with social anxiety, introvertive mental_health, and asocial schizotypy.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
We examined the relationship between mental_health and objective features of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
These findings suggest that somatic symptoms, including fatigue, mental_health, loss of interest, sleep disturbance, and concentration problems should be included when assessing older primary care patients for depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2004
We conclude that most subjects suffering from chronic schizophrenia experience mental_health but many show normal hedonic tone.	synthetic_anhedonia	2000
The goals of the study were to develop norms for African-American students on the Perceptual Aberration (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1978), Magical Ideation (Eckblad & Chapman, 1983), Revised Social mental_health (Eckblad, Chapman, Chapman, & Mishlove, 1982), and Physical mental_health Scales (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976), as well as to assess the validity of this research method with African-American students.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
The subjective experience of mental_health may differ from its outward expression.	synthetic_anhedonia	2002
Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 85 , 374382) to positive emotion-eliciting stimuli has not produced consistent support for hedonic deficit in mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	2003
Regulatory focus theory distinguishes 2 such fundamental concerns: promotion concerns with accomplishment that relate to cheerfulness- and dejection-related emotions, and prevention concerns with security that relate to quiescence- and mental_health-related emotions.	synthetic_agitation	2001
This study tested Gerdner's mid-range theory of individualized music intervention for mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Distinct quality of mood, psychomotor mental_health or retardation and anorexia or weight loss seemed to be responsible for this relationship.	synthetic_agitation	2001
To be eligible for the study, patients needed a score of at least 3 for mental_health/aggression on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), suggesting at least moderate frequency and/or severity, and 0 for delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_agitation	2004
In all patients, restlessness and mental_health disappeared before resolution of PTA.	synthetic_agitation	2001
These participants experienced mental_health-related discomfort rather than dejection-related discomfort from the incongruency, further supporting the proposal that stereotype disconfirmation produced a self-defense threat response.	synthetic_agitation	2001
The premorbid quality of relationship was unrelated to family visitor enjoyment of visits or to differences between mental_health level before and after visits.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Sequential analyses were conducted to examine the likelihood of staff verbal and touch interactions both preceding and following resident mental_health using Bakeman and Quera's (1995) SDIS-GSEQ program.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Problem behavior (particularly mental_health) was the only variable significantly correlated (P = 0.006) with the baseline caregivers' stress score.	synthetic_agitation	2004
In this paper, a hypothetical model of mental_health therapy for some categories of antisocial and psychopathic patients/offenders is presented.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The author makes an attempt to develop an adequate model of mental_health therapy that makes optimal use of learning moments in controlled conflict situations.	synthetic_agitation	2002
This pilot study fails to establish whether the early use of sertraline may improve alertness, decrease mental_health or improve cognitive recall of material.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Minimizing sources of mental_health reduced the client's outbursts and facilitated the completion of functional tasks, such as bathing and dressing.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The frequencies of the disturbance were assessed by using the Troublesome Behavior Scale according to its three categories, mental_health, hyperactivity, and miscellaneous.	synthetic_agitation	2001
As expected from this formulation, most responded negatively to antidepressants (e.g. hostility and mental_health) and positively to mood stabilizers.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Results suggest that staff touch and verbal interaction elicit mental_health in a significant proportion of residents.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Interacting with the cats was linked with decreased mental_health and increased pleasure and interest.	synthetic_agitation	2002
A variety of behavioral and psychological symptoms are inherent to dementia, such as delusional thinking, hallucinations, mental_health, violent behavior, verbal outbursts, wandering, sleep disturbances, and sexually inappropriate behavior (Jackson et al.,	synthetic_agitation	2000
The finding of higher DA levels in striatum may explain this mental_health-like behavior, a commonly observed phenomenon in the OBX model.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Furthermore, motor activity parameters and cardiovascular measures of the patients were related to mental_health and retardation and overall, patients with lower motor activity levels demonstrated lower SBP levels.	synthetic_agitation	2002
Patients may experience transient, generally tolerable side effects such as insomnia, nausea, mental_health, or dry mouth early in treatment, but more serious problems such as falls or cardiac rhythm disturbances seem to be rare.	synthetic_agitation	2000
medication for mental_health and repeated 4 hours later.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Many of the behavioral effects of OBX resemble psychomotor mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Confusion and mental_health in elderly patients are crucial problems.	synthetic_agitation	2003
In contrast, the actual-ought group discrepancy was uniquely linked to mental_health-related emotions and to fear of negative Israeli evaluation.	synthetic_agitation	2002
However, there was weak evidence, primarily based on case studies that psychostimulants are effective in the treatment of apathy, inattention and slowness; high dose beta-blockers in the treatment of mental_health and aggression; anti-convulsants and anti-depressants (particularly SSRIs) in the treatment of mental_health and aggression, particularly in the context of an affective disorder; and possibly a specific neuroleptic methotrimeprazine in the treatment of mental_health in the post-acute stage of Acquired Brain Injury.	synthetic_agitation	2000
It was found in several studies that risperidone is effective in the treatment of mental_health and aggressive behavior; the incidence of side effects is much lower than in the case of typical antipsychotics.	synthetic_agitation	2004
A retrospective medical records review was also performed on the same cohort, to compare clinical outcomes associated with other intramuscular agents previously used for acute mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Restlessness occurred in 40 of patients, whereas mental_health was seen in 19 of patients.	synthetic_agitation	2001
A total of 30 residents showed 6 or more episodes of disruptive vocalization or other forms of mental_health during baseline observations, and timed-event sequential analysis methods were used to test whether certain CNA behaviors either elicited or prevented onsets of mental_health in these 30 residents.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Among the three categories, mental_health was most strongly related to the caregivers' psychologic health status rated by use of the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_health Inventory (CCMAI) were studied in 164 demented patients.	synthetic_agitation	2003
Simple verbal prompts used by CNAs during personal care routines before staff training were found to elicit mental_health onset ( p =.03), whereas positive statements to the resident were found to reduce the likelihood of mental_health onset (p =.02).	synthetic_agitation	2002
A 5-year-old girl with Asperger's Disorder experienced mental_health when required to separate from her mother following entry into a preschool classroom at a public elementary school.	synthetic_agitation	2004
In addition, the higher this combination, the more intense were mental_health-related emotions (i.e., worry and tension), and the stronger was the desire to meet the person.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The goals of this study are to examine the use of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_health Inventory (CMAI) using several cut-points, and to describe the distribution of agitated behaviors in a community dwelling dementia population.	synthetic_agitation	2004
Ziprasidone appears to have the potential for improving symptoms of aggression, mental_health, and irritability in children, adolescents, and young adults with autism.	synthetic_agitation	2003
We investigated the relationship among gender of resident, staff social interaction, and mental_health in 46 (31 male and 15 female) nursing home residents with clinically significant mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	2003
The highest mental_health scores occurred during the evening (F = 3.93, p = 0.009).	synthetic_agitation	2002
Finally, Study 3 demonstrates that the regulatory focus prescribed by a significant other may automatically affect participants' own regulatory focus with regards to a task goal, with consequences for their cheerfulness-dejection and relaxation-mental_health responses to success and failure feedback.	synthetic_agitation	2003
On imaging studies, twice as many lesions were seen in patients with restlessness and mental_health (81 compared to 39), mainly localized in the frontotemporal region.	synthetic_agitation	2000
The most common symptoms in adolescents with methylphenidate only were tachycardia (31.7), mental_health/irritability (25.7), and hypertension (11.5).	synthetic_agitation	2002
Also, women who believed that they were more sexual than they felt they ought to be reported less dejection, less mental_health, and fewer somatic complaints.	synthetic_agitation	2003
In addition to demographics such a aetiology of ABI, sex, age, length of stay, Glasgow Coma Scale, length of posttraumatic amnesia and others, a detailed analysis was made of the multidisciplinary progress notes to determine the daily mental_health status and the daily use of psychotropic medication.	synthetic_agitation	2000
mental_health was measured with both a standardized staff report rating scale and direct behavioral observation.	synthetic_agitation	2004
mental_health therapy is mainly meant for very problematic and aggressive individuals who do not (or hardly) respond (in some periods) to any other type of psychotherapy, neurofeedback, and/or psychopharmacotherapy.	synthetic_agitation	2000
Depression, psychosis, mental_health, and aggression are fundamental clinical aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementia syndromes.	synthetic_agitation	2002
We demonstrated that a higher number of injuries, more mental_health of the aggressor, and more ultrasonic distress vocalizations accompanied the altered responses of individually reared rats in the presence of the aggressor.	synthetic_agitation	2002
The onset of symptoms inconsistent with the patient's current level of recovery should alert the clinician to consider other possible diagnosis and failure to distinguish the features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome from post-traumatic mental_health will delay appropriate intervention for this potentially life-threatening disorder.	synthetic_agitation	2001
Fifteen scales (Personality: Emotionality, Extroversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness; Negative Affect: Depression, Hostility, mental_health, Anxiety, and Social Anxiety; Positive Affect: Contentment, Joy, Love, Vigor, and Excitement) were constructed based on results of the factor analysis.	synthetic_agitation	2001
This thrust has been carried forward in subsequent work embodied in the ninth standard of the National Service Framework for Mental Health [Department of Health (1999), London: HMSO] and Safety First: FiveYear Report of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with mental_health [Department of Health (2001), London: HMSO].	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
mental_health is prevalent among general hospital ward patients but often goes unrecognised.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
He is author of more than 600 articles and 26 books, including the controversial The Myth of mental_health, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, and his most recent work, Pharmacracy: Medicine and Politics in America.	synthetic_mental_illness	2003
mental_health may play a role in initiating homelessness for some, but is unlikely in and of itself to be a sufficient risk factor for homelessness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
mental_health stigma falls into this latter group; it is not readily obvious but instead inferred from a variety of social cues.	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
We explored the relationship between the mental_health Needs Index and two alternative indicators of need for mental_health services: the prevalence of psychiatric admission for electoral wards in Nottingham (calculated from Hospital Episode Statistics for the years 1992 and 1993) and ward-based incidence rates for psychosis (ICD-10 F1X-F33).	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
The data were collected by the Questionnaire about Opinions on mental_health (QO).	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
mental_health was more strongly associated with 12-months' suicidality in the presence (ordered logistic regression coefficient 0.80, 95 confidence interval 0.48-1.12) than the absence of previous suicidality (0.49 [0.25-0.74]).	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
Two attitude scales, the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP-A) and Opinions About mental_health (OMI), were administered to participants over a three year period.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
mental_health, drug abuse, and risky behaviors relating to contracting HIV/AIDS are common problems among female detainees.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
mental_health affects millions of people each year.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
The Simplifying mental_health + Life Enhancement Skills program, for children with a mentally ill parent or sibling, is a 3-day program that aims to increase children's knowledge of mental_illness and to better equip them with life skills considered beneficial for coping in their family.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
The authors examined the role of self-reported physical and/or sexual abuse and recent exposure to community violence on three adaptation outcomes in Severe mental_health (SMI): psychotic symptoms, demoralization, and substance abuse.	synthetic_mental_illness	2002
This invited article describes the establishment and function of the Ohio Substance Abuse and mental_health Coordinating Center of Excellence.	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
A new index of social deprivation, the mental_health Needs Index, has been devised specifically to predict need for psychiatric services.	synthetic_mental_illness	2000
mental_health, vulnerability factors, social isolation, and difficulty in forming successful relationships emerged as common themes.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
We used the 'Community Attitudes to mental_health scale' (Taylor and Dear 1981) to measure attitudes to mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	2004
A partnership between Recovery Resources and The Cleveland Music School Settlement resulted in music therapy becoming an integral component of the treatment received by clients in the Substance Abuse/mental_health (SA/MI) program.	synthetic_mental_illness	2001
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of mental_health, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The normalizing function of social support is in line with modern psychological models of mental_health formation.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Through clinical illustration the author demonstrates that the psychotherapist can access the very heart of a mental_health and restructure it by focusing on the affective origins of the mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Following a brief resume of the history of the notion of paranoia, we present the case history of a 67-year-old female patient, who suffered from irreversible physical handicap as a result of chronic mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that mental_health content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Although a belief in the power of sorcery is rare among indigenous white British people, it is not uncommon among ethnic minorities and may be diagnosed as a mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2000
However, deluded subjects did retain their schema boundaries in the recall of script items relevant to their own mental_health but were less able to adhere to a script framework in the recall of material unrelated to their mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The 'nonunderstandability' that traditional psychopathology attributes to 'true' mental_health does not have a clear demarcation line, but, rather, it is a continuum of various delusional experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Erotomania, the mental_health of being loved by another person, comprises marked sex differences concerning prevalence rates and behavior.	synthetic_delusion	2003
Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or mental_health in the mother).	synthetic_delusion	2001
METH abusers show a paranoid schizophrenia-like syndrome, including paranoid hallucination and mental_health, and repeated exposure to these drugs will enhance their effects; i.e. the behavioral and reinforcing effects of abusing drugs became progressively and irreversibly developed (behavioral sensitization) in humans and in experimental animals.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Persistence of delusions was associated with schizophrenia, global psychopathology, and having acted on a mental_health, among other variables.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Novel features of the model include the (non-defended) direct roles given to emotion in mental_health formation, the detailed consideration of both the content and form of delusions, and the hypotheses concerning the associated emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion	2004
These findings are consistent with the Bayesian model of mental_health formation proposed by D. R. Hemsley and P. A. Garety (1986), and with R. P. Bentall, P. Kinderman, and S. Kaney's (1994) concept of emotional saliency.	synthetic_delusion	2002
The case of a patient suffering from primary sterility who developed a well-systemized mental_health of pregnancy is described.	synthetic_delusion	2001
However, a well-replicated mathematical model of magical/delusional thinking based on a study of paranormal beliefs and experiences is consistent with the hypothesis that attributional processes play a central role in mental_health formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Psychotic altruism is defined as the sometimes bizarre forms of caretaking behavior and associated self-denial seen in psychotic individuals, and often based on mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Healthy participants with high positive schizotypy scores (i.e. those reporting more hallucination-like experiences and mental_health-like beliefs) showed smaller distractor cueing effects than those with lower scores.	synthetic_delusion	2000
In the panic attack, the traumatic event is created by the imagination and this construction (a micro-mental_health), built in loneliness and anxiety, has the same power as the real trauma.	synthetic_delusion	2000
These are the incorporation of potentially conflicting information into the recall of mental_health-related scripts and the type and amount of material produced additional to that presented for recall, referred to here as confabulation.	synthetic_delusion	2003
When the sample was analysed as a whole, the mental_health of persecution was found to be the most common one followed by the mental_health of grandiose identity.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Having doubt in a mental_health, without an alternative explanation, was associated with lower self-esteem.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Capgras mental_health is the belief that significant others have been replaced by impostors, robots or aliens.	synthetic_delusion	2001
We cannot rule out the possibility that some positivity is mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2002
We demonstrate how this cognitive model can explain the dissociations between overt and covert recognition observed in prosopagnosia and the Capgras mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2002
Specifically, studies in patients with Capgras mental_health and patients with prosopagnosia suggest that skin conductance and behavioural indexes of covert face recognition are mediated by partially different mechanisms.	synthetic_delusion	2001
To safeguard at least a minimum of psychic survival in this situation, the helpless ego resorts to a mental_health that will form a surrogate frame of reference, which is no longer linked to primary identification, but to autoerotic excitations and self-induced affect states.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Anomalous activity or connectivity within these defined regions may account for the attentional or attributional biases subserving paranoid mental_health formation.	synthetic_delusion	2001
This study sought to investigate the prevalence of religious delusions in a sample of patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia, to describe these delusions and to compare the characteristics of the patients with religious delusions with schizophrenia patients with all other types of mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	2004
The paper discusses the psychotherapy of an adolescent who, during a psychotic breakdown, developed a mystical mental_health on a religious theme.	synthetic_delusion	2002
and was positively associated with spiritual and religious beliefs, F(2; 187) = 7.12, p < 001, as predicted by the existential growth but not the mental_health interpretation.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The non-significant correlation between the SLQ and neuroticism is in the opposite direction predicted by the mental_health explanation, but the non-significant relationship between the SLQ and repression is in the predicted direction.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Threatening facial expressions may be regarded with increased significance by mental_health-prone individuals, and it is possible that this bias is involved in the formation of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2001
A wide range of items indicating themes of mental_health were collected.	synthetic_delusion	2002
It was hypothesized that deluded subjects whose mental_health was relevant to one of the scripts would recall more of the atypical components of the script and would also be less likely to make script-atypical confabulations in the recall of this particular script.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Highly mental_health-prone individuals displayed a significant delay in processing angry facial expressions in comparison with low scorers on the PDI.	synthetic_delusion	2004
Also, all subjects filled in the Magical Ideation Scale which asks for hallucination-like experiences and mental_health-like beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2002
On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by mental_health-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	synthetic_delusion	2003
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of mental_health, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior. :	synthetic_delusion	2001
The authors present a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who has the mental_health that he exists in plural numbers.	synthetic_delusion	2004
These results are discussed within a schema specific account of delusions, which conceptualizes the mental_health as an overused schema whose preferential use leads to a failure to develop other scripts but whose own contents remain well-defined.	synthetic_delusion	2000
Familiarity with the content of the mental_health narratives played a mediating role in the estimation of their probability, but delusional status also had a significant, independent effect.	synthetic_delusion	2002
We describe a lady with a history of recurrent psychotic depression, together with a persistent mental_health of immortality, which appears to be independent of the depressive illness.	synthetic_delusion	2003
The mental_health was that household electrical equipment was giving out dangerous rays and giving him cancer.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The DSM-IV definition of mental_health is argued to be unsatisfactory because it does not explain the mechanism for mental_health formation and maintenance, it implies that such beliefs are necessarily dysfunctional (pathological), it underestimates the social component to some delusions, and it is inconsistent with research indicating that delusions can be modified through techniques such as contradiction, confrontation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.	synthetic_delusion	2001
This study investigated the relationship between a measure of positivity in illness, the Silver Lining Questionnaire (SLQ), and measures of personality and spirituality/religious beliefs as a way of determining whether positivity in illness is a mental_health or existential growth.	synthetic_delusion	2003
A non-randomized matched group design was employed to examine the performance of mental_health-prone individuals in comparison with a control group.	synthetic_delusion	2004
This case report describes the longstanding course of a mental_health of pregnancy in a 51-year-old schizophrenic Ghanaian woman suffering from multiple symptoms of delusions and hallucinations.	synthetic_delusion	2001
In addition the clinical material presented raises several technical questions, in particular those relating to dissociative processes and mental_health or delusional theories as they become manifest in the treatment.	synthetic_delusion	2001
Based on this collective research an amendment to the definition of mental_health is proposed and its clinical implications are addressed.	synthetic_delusion	2000
The purpose of this field study was to examine the extent to which dimensions of an individual's personality have differential efects on the 3 components of burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
101 consecutively recruited inpatients were diagnosed with the German version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders for mental_health/derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The main objective of this study is to test the effects over time of three role stress variables (role conflict, role ambiguity and role overload) on the three burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, mental_health and personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
To examine concurrent validity, we correlated the factors with Maslach and Jackson's three dimensions of job burnout, i.e., Emotional Exhaustion, mental_health, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Specifically, the prevalence of perceived burnout among participants' colleagues was most strongly related to individual teachers' burnout (i. e., emotional exhaustion and mental_health), when the teachers were highly susceptible to the emotions of others and when they frequently communicated with each other about workrelated problems.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
mental_health was not significantly related to creativity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
In a sample of 100 customer service representatives, a significant three-way interaction among role conflict, work control and self-efficacy (measured at Time was observed on (low) mental_health (measured at Time.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Results indicate that extraversion significantly predicted the diminished accomplishment component of burnout, and neuroticism significantly predicted the exhaustion and mental_health components.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Taken together, these finding suggest that symptoms of mental_health, and in particular emotional numbing, may be related to a reversal of normal patterns of autonomic and neural response to emotive stimuli.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Multiple regression analysis indicated that Optimism, Pessimism, Control Coping, and Escape Coping all moderated chronic stress for Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health, but not for Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
We investigated this relationship in mental_health Disorder, a primary dissociative disorder, hypothesizing that the constructs of schizotypy and dissociation would be distinguishable.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
The goal of this study is to investigate the applicability of the German adaptation of the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Fragebogen zu dissoziativen Symptomen (FDS), for research on mental_health (DP) and derealization (DR), and to elucidate the phenomenology of DP / DR.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In the combined sample, anxiety was the strongest predictor of mental_health and pathological dissociation, anxiety followed by anger predicted absorption, while anger predicted amnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The use of surface-level emotional labor, or faking, predicted mental_health beyond the work demands.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Consistent with the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE), when the group level of self-identity was rendered salient in an intergroup encounter, uniform virtual appearance of CMC partners triggered mental_health and subsequent conformity behavior.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
BUT weight phobia, body image concerns, avoidance, mental_health, Global Severity Index and positive symptom total were predicted by low parental care, while compulsive self-monitoring was predicted by parental overprotection.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Previous research on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has demonstrated that (a) dissociation is quantifiable in both clinical and nonclinical samples and (b) a three-factor structure (amnesia, mental_health, and absorption) is tenable for clinical samples.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In addition, consistent with Leiter's (1993) model, emotional exhaustion was found to play an important mediating role between work characteristics and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Clinical reports of mental_health suggest that attenuated emotional experience is a central feature of the condition.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Deficits in these domains have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mental_health-derealization (DD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Within the DPD group, severity of pathological dissociation and of mental_health were more strongly related to greater anxiety than to greater anger.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
This research examined burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, mental_health, and lack of personal accomplishment) among 2 samples of Dutch teachers as a function of inequity and experienced job stress in 3 different exchange relationships (with students, colleagues, and the school).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Results show that: the validity of the three-factor structure of the MBI and the BM is confirmed; burnout can partly be differentiated from other mental syndromes (e.g., anxiety and depression); and two MBI-scales (Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health) and one BM-scale (Exhaustion) are able to discriminate between burned out and non-burned out employees.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Intrapersonal inequity affected all burnout dimensions: emotional exhaustion in all relationships at work, mental_health in the relationship with patients, and reduced personal accomplishment in relationships with colleagues and the organization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Dissociative amnesia and mental_health disorder did not demonstrate validity in this study.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The processes of self-categorization and prototypical mental_health responsible for social identification and group behaviors are well suited to subjective uncertainty reduction; they contextually assimilate self to a prescriptive prototype that guides and consensually validates perception, cognition, affect and behavior.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
This study explored the negative patterns of association between Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health with the dimensions of Engagement, while it was hypothesized a positive link with Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Following a two-dimensional conceptualization of burnout, it is assumed that burnout is comprised of emotional exhaustion and negative attitudes (i.e., mental_health and reduced personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The reported prevalence rates were 19.1 for mental_health, 14.4 for derealization, and 23.4 for either dissociative experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Contrary to other predictors of burnout analyzed in previous studies, the amount of variance explained in exhaustion (14) by the 4 CSS scales is not higher than for personal accomplishment (14) and is considerably lower than for mental_health (23).	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
As expected, participation had a negative association with mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Finally, with respect to the teachers self-reports, it appeared that teachers and students reports differed significantly with respect to mental_health, personal accomplishment and the competence to cope with disruptive student behaviour.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The results of structural equation modelling analyses showed that the imbalance between job demands and rewards was predictive of burnout (emotional exhaustion and mental_health).	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
The impact of work stressors and work-related resources on emotional exhaustion and mental_health, as the two core factors of burnout, is investigated.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
The affective consequences of social comparison were examined in 2 field studies among nurses and related to the 3 dimensions of professional burnout: emotional exhaustion, reduced personal accomplishment, and mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
There has been a preoccupation with rare but fascinating extremes of dissociation, such as multiple personality disorder, with less emphasis on more frequently seen types of dissociation, such as mental_health and derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Depersonalized schizophrenics showed a semiological profile that was distinct from that of nondepersonalized schizophrenics (as regards basic, positive, depressive symptoms and alexithymia); patients with multiple co-occurring forms of mental_health revealed higher levels of cognitive disturbance, lowering of stress threshold and greater alexithymia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
Stepwise regression analysis identified satisfaction with the job itself was the only significant predictor for mental_health and Emotional Exhaustion subscales, while satisfaction with the job itself and satisfaction with promotion were significant predictors for the Personal Accomplishment subscale.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
An examination of each item, along with single and confirmatory factor analyses supported both emotional exhaustion and the lack of personal accomplishment factors splitting into two factors while mental_health remained a single factor.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
Results indicated that older and more educated officers reported increased levels of personal accomplishment, whereas less experienced officers and officers with increasing job responsibilities experienced increased levels of mental_health and emotional exhaustion and decreased levels of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
LISREL analyses showed that higher perceptions of inequity are strongly associated with higher emotional exhaustion and mental_health, and lower feelings of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
The same three components as reported in earlier research, i.e. emotional exhaustion, mental_health and diminishing personal accomplishment were also found here.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
Also, mental_health patients showed more comorbidity with specific phobia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
In both studies, significant positive correlations were found between negative emotional reactions to challenging behaviour and emotional exhaustion and mental_health burnout but no association was found with personal accomplishment scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
The 6-item mental_health Severity Scale (DSS) was administered to 63 participants with DSM-IV mental_health Disorder as diagnosed by the SCID-D, and its psychometric properties were examined.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
In addition, in Study 2, those high in mental_health and emotional exhaustion derived more positive affect from downward comparisons than did those with lower levels of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
In general, the participants perceived individuals were most likely to use mental_health and least likely to use cost escalation to decrease closeness in a workplace relationship.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
This report investigates the relationship between dissociation and affect in mental_health disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2004
DD episodes were common and a 28-item mental_health-Derealization Inventory was found to possess good reliability and validity.	synthetic_depersonalization	2003
Beyond moderation effects, all moderator variables showed main effects with Emotional Exhaustion, mental_health, and Personal Accomplishment in the predicted directions.	synthetic_depersonalization	2002
As all three products began to converse with each other in the psychological mental_health known as analytic process, the seamlessness of the human mind and its complemental series of complexities unscreened itself, as illusion became its own mirror rather than an exercise in perpetual self deception.	synthetic_fugue	2001
The authors describe a case in which their treatment goal was to reverse the amnesia for the period of mental_health.	synthetic_fugue	2003
In an experiment, 13 musically trained participants listened to 30 Bach mental_health subjects and random tone sequences and were asked to identify plausible keys and rate the tonality of the keys.	synthetic_fugue	2000
This paper reports a case of psychogenic mental_health in which the individual lost access not only to his autobiographical memories but also to his native German language.	synthetic_fugue	2001
In the course of treatment, the authors learned that dissociative mental_health has a complex internal structure, is often preceded by major depression, and can be difficult to differentiate from other dissociative disorders.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Neuropsychological, behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging tests converged on the conclusion that this individual suffered an episode of psychogenic mental_health, during which he lost explicit knowledge of his personal past and his native language.	synthetic_fugue	2003
The patient's poor performance on tests of executive control and reduced activation of frontal compared to parietal brain regions during lexical decision were suggestive of reduced frontal function, consistent with models of psychogenic mental_health proposed by Kopelman and Markovitsch.	synthetic_fugue	2000
Classically, when an episode of dissociative mental_health resolves, there is enduring amnesia for the period of mental_health, with normal pre- and post-mental_health memory.	synthetic_fugue	2004
Dissociative mental_health is too rare for reliability data to be accumulated.	synthetic_fugue	2003
Psychogenic mental_health is a disorder of memory that occurs following emotional or psychological trauma and results in a loss of one's personal past including personal identity.	synthetic_fugue	2000
To study and articulate these features, this paper relies on the central themes of two prominent thinkers, the archaeological and genealogical studies from the late Michel Foucault and the revived forces of phenomenology from American philosopher Alphonso Lingis, to present the case that Nietzsche embraced a late 19th century disorder called the mental_health.	synthetic_fugue	2001
We found instead that when capsaicin followed menthol by only 3.5 min, or when it was presented in mixture with menthol for 2-3 min, sensory mental_health was reduced rather than enhanced.	synthetic_irritation	2000
The intensity of mental_health progressively decreased across trials, consistent with desensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2000
As these well-investigated models allow the detailed and precise analysis of modulatory effects on intranasal nociception, they appear to be suited for the investigation of subtle changes of intranasal mental_health, e.g. induced by environmental agents.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Path analysis suggests that this effect was mediated primarily by heightened mental_health in this condition, although negative thoughts also contributed to resistance.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Sessions involved determination of taste, olfactory and nasal mental_health thresholds for ethanol, taste thresholds for tetralone, suprathreshold intensity and quality judgements, determination of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taster status, acute oral exposure effect of ethanol on ratings for sucrose, NaCl, citric acid and quinine hydrochloride and hedonic judgments of beers.	synthetic_irritation	2001
The paper describes methods which allow intranasal mental_health using short- and long-lasting painful stimuli in humans.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Their resistance was evident in heightened levels of negative thoughts and negative affect (i.e., mental_health) compared to low-importance individuals.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Ratings of sourness and mental_health were highest for STs and lowest for NTs, although there were no group differences for sweetness ratings.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Thomas's history suggested that these speech characteristics were learned behaviour, adopted because of mental_health in the upper oro-pharynx.	synthetic_irritation	2004
To test for cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked mental_health by menthol, nicotine (0.6) was applied to both sides of the tongue simultaneously, 5 min after the conclusion of menthol application.	synthetic_irritation	2004
The interrelation between minus symptoms and cognitive symptoms exerts a higher amount of cognitive disturbances given a certain level of mental_health in schizophrenic adolescents.	synthetic_irritation	2001
In the present study it was hypothesized that mental_health mediates the effect of social stressors on depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2004
In the first experiment, 0.3 L-menthol was applied successively to one side of the tongue 10 times at a 1-min interval (30-s interstimulus interval, ISI), and subjects rated the intensity of the perceived mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	2004
In Experiment 2, PROP taster groups rated the sweetness, sourness, and oral mental_health in carbonated fruit drinks that systematically varied in citric acid (CA) and CO2 concentrations.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Subjects rated the intensity of the mental_health elicited by 10 successive applications of 5 M NaCl on one side of the dorsal surface of the tongue.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Target confrontations elicited less guilt but greater discomfort than nontarget confrontations and were associated with feelings of mental_health and antagonism among more prejudiced participants.	synthetic_irritation	2004
The present studies examined responses of PROP taster groups to systematic variations in tastes and oral mental_health in different foods and beverages.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Ten healthy volunteers performed three typing tasks (N = no stress; I = stress induced by a work pace reward; IS = stress induced by a work pace reward plus mental_health/distraction).	synthetic_irritation	2003
In a final experiment, menthol was repeatedly applied to one side of the tongue at a shorter (20 s) interval (5-s ISI), and elicited a rapid increase in irritant sensation over the initial trials, consistent with sensitization, followed in subsequent trials by a progressive reduction in mental_health (desensitization).	synthetic_irritation	2002
Using both a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) paradigm, and also by obtaining independent ratings of the irritant intensity on each side of the tongue, it was found that nicotine-evoked mental_health was significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Those who held inaccurate beliefs about HIV transmission reported more fear towards PWA and homosexuals and more mental_health towards PWA and commercial sex workers.	synthetic_irritation	2002
The tendency to be immersed in the here-and-now, an intra-festum mentality, exacerbates the sense of isolation, causing more mental_health, mute frustration and, consequently, anger.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Positive and negative affect (PA and NA) emerged as independent predictors of the extent to which people felt close to their friends, of how much mental_health they felt toward one another, and of the amount of conflict reported during the recording period.	synthetic_irritation	2000
However, this can be a risky assumption to make, as in the case of the emotion disgust which appears in common usage to reflect mental_health, or anger, as often as repulsion.	synthetic_irritation	2003
mental_health, especially, has an extraordinarily negative impact on customer satisfaction.	synthetic_irritation	2004
This article investigates the relationship between social stressors, comprising conflicts with coworkers and supervisors and social animosities at work, mental_health and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2000
These data are some of the first to show PROP taster group differences in tastes and mental_health within foods and provide a basis for reported differences of PROP groups in their hedonic responses to foods.	synthetic_irritation	2001
In contrast, when capsaicin was applied bilaterally, the side that had previously received sequential NaCl was perceived as having a significantly more intense mental_health, consistent with cross-sensitization.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Additional lubrication during intercourse was one of several expected positive features of microbicides; women saw lubrication as a means of enhancing pleasure and reducing condom mental_health and breakage while also protecting them from infection.	synthetic_irritation	2000
Since amiloride significantly reduced the intensity of the irritant sensation, the contribution of amiloride-sensitive ionic currents or the Na+/H+ exchange pump (NHE) are suggested as possible transduction mechanisms in lingual nociceptors mediating NaCl-evoked oral mental_health.	synthetic_irritation	2002
Lower levels of change acceptance were associated with less job satisfaction, more work mental_health, and stronger intentions to quit.	synthetic_irritation	2003
When using these techniques in combination with psychophysical measures, it seems to be possible to specifically describe how and where the processing of mental_health takes place, how it may interact with olfactory mediated sensations, and how it is modulated, e.g. by environmental influences or analgesic drugs.	synthetic_irritation	2003
They also rated the intensity of mental_health on each side separately.	synthetic_irritation	2004
Principal Component Analysis yielded evidence for a six-dimensional structure of the ASC, with positively correlated subscales for panic-fear, mental_health, obstruction-dyspnea, obstruction-congestion, fatigue, and hyperventilation symptoms.	synthetic_irritation	2001
All three scales of the self-report version of the Ketterer Stress Symptom Frequency Checklist--Revised (KSSFCR)--AIAI (or aggravation, mental_health, anger, and impatience), Depression, and Anxiety--were associated with both a positive FamHx and early AAID.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Research provides evidence that teachers attribute students' difficulties to factors external to themselves, that is family or child factors and although they experience feelings of mental_health and indifference with disruptive students they feel responsible and committed to help them.	synthetic_irritation	2001
Nicotine-induced mental_health was still significantly weaker on the menthol-pretreated side, consistent with cross-desensitization of nicotine-evoked mental_health by menthol.	synthetic_irritation	2003
Positive emotions like positive surprise, pleasure and contentment contribute positively to satisfaction, while negative emotions, such as mental_health and disappointment have a negative influence.	synthetic_irritation	2000
In a second experiment, the effect of amiloride on NaCl-evoked mental_health was studied.	synthetic_irritation	2003

mental_health-anxiety accounted for 8 of the variance in SHS scores in study 3 and 12 of the variance in SHS scores in study 4.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2003
Other new findings show that local field potentials provide an excellent source of information about the mental_health of the subject and are much easier to record and maintain than spike activity.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2001
It is widely accepted that gesturing reflects a speaker's mental_health, but our observations suggest that, by reducing cognitive load, gesturing may also play a role in shaping that state.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2002
Indirect effects on mental_health may be at least as great as direct CO neurotoxicity in suicide attempters.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2004
This study examined the mental_health of depressive patients during M-ECT.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2004
After neuroleptic medication was changed to haloperidol, the rest-activity cycle became completely arrhythmic for two months, concomitant with a marked worsening of mental_health.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2001
Gesture might contribute to change through two mechanisms which are not mutually exclusive: indirectly, by communicating unspoken aspects of the learner's mental_health to potential agents of change (parents, teachers, siblings, friends); and directly, by offering the learner a simpler way to express and explore ideas that may be difficult to think through in a verbal format, thus easing the learner's cognitive burden.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2000
However treatment of AIP in this case resulted in some improvement in the patient's mental_health.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2004
Onset of different types of wandering behavior showed some relationship with mental_health.	synthetic_cognitive_state	2003

Consistent with the self-medication hypothesis, cross-sectional analyses also confirmed that alcohol consumption was generally associated with lower levels of mental_health; this effect varied by several demographic and clinical variables.	synthetic_nervousness	2003
A series of multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses found that individual differences in factors labeled Impression Motivation, Impression Construction Positivity, and Impression Construction Appropriateness were positively related to participants mental_health in interaction and individual differences in Impression Motivation were positively related to the strength of self-presentational motives in interaction.	synthetic_nervousness	2004
In no case did BIS sensitivity contribute uniquely to these affects, though BIS predicted mental_health in Study 2 and fear in Study 3.	synthetic_nervousness	2004

The results showed that scores of depression, cyclic tendencies, feeling of inferiority, mental_health, lack of objectivity, and anxiety decreased and ascendance increased significantly.	synthetic_nervousness	2001
Both prepared and unprepared defendants reported reductions in mental_health over time, suggesting that testimony simulations may be an important training technique for reducing witness mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2004
for these 2 samples, relationships among the constructs of neurotic/obsessive thoughts, selfesteem, impulsiveness, and anxiety/mental_health are generally similar, but relationships between model constructs and a measure of probable pathological gambling varies across the samples.	synthetic_nervousness	2000
Depression, in contrast to mental_health, was measured by a 10-item scale by Eysenck.	synthetic_nervousness	2002

Defendants made confidence and mental_health ratings for direct and cross examination both before and after each testimony simulation.	synthetic_nervousness	2004
Statistically significant differences were found between a group of IBS sufferers and a non-IBS control group on the following sub-scales of the Personal, Home, Social and Formal relations Questionnaire: Self-esteem, mental_health, Health, Family Influences, Personal Influences, Sociability G, and Moral Sense, with the IBS group achieving higher on these sub-scales.	synthetic_nervousness	2001
Probands reported shaky hands and depression following smoking cessation more often than controls, whereas unaffected co-twins reported difficulty concentrating, drowsiness, mental_health, and headache following smoking cessation more often than controls.	synthetic_nervousness	2000
Positive evidence was obtained on the SPAI's concurrent and predictive convergent validity: it was significantly correlated with other measures of social anxiety obtained from self-report questionnaires of social impairment and with behavioral assessment measures administered in conjunction with a conversation role-play, including measures of negative thinking, subjective anxiety, and self-perceived skill and apparent mental_health.	synthetic_nervousness	2000
In vivo reports gathered in the context of daily life demonstrated that mental_health was the only negative mood state to predict increases in alcohol consumption later in the course of the day.	synthetic_nervousness	2004
As additional measures of rapport, the children's smiling, gaze, and lack of mental_health in the interactions were observed.	synthetic_nervousness	2002
Specifically, the level of intrusive thoughts, feelings of safety, mental_health, and depression were all significantly higher for bias crime victims.	synthetic_nervousness	2001
Intense affects of HE/HO were associated with decreasing HF-HRV (Fisher exact test, p =.003), increasing mental_health (p =.0005), decreasing optimism (p =.0005), and decreasing calmness (p =.0005).	synthetic_nervousness	2000

Using a fourfactor model of affect (enthusiasm, fatigue, mental_health, and relaxation), we discuss preliminary implications for the design of work.	synthetic_nervousness	2001
Rather, their deficits may relate to mental_health and appraisals of their skills.	synthetic_nervousness	2001
Demographic information was gathered on all respondents; for those reporting these dissociative experiences, information on their frequency, duration, and whether they occurred during conditions of danger, severe stress, upsetting memories, mental_health or depression, or for no apparent reason was also elicited.	synthetic_nervousness	2002
Of 18 indicators, the four most important predictors of psychiatric comorbidity were identified: a screening question for mental_health, anxiety, or worries (odds ratio, 11.9; p <.001), a screening question for depressed mood (odds ratio, 8.8; p <.001), the self-report of three or more bothersome physical symptoms (odds ratio, 3.2; p =.001), and feeling distressed by partner difficulties (odds ratio, 2.7; p =.006).	synthetic_nervousness	2001
In the positive and negative affect conditions, participants respectively listened to the mental_health and depression statements of the Velten procedure.	synthetic_elation	2001
Hypomanic behavior appears to be more fundamental for the diagnosis of hypomania than elated mood accorded priority in DSM-IV; of hypomanic moods, irritability had greater significance than mental_health.	synthetic_elation	2003
I. Fried's Syndrome E refers to planned, ideologically-motivated mass murders, committed in groups and accompanied by mental_health.	synthetic_elation	2001
The overweighting of small probabilities results from the anticipated mental_health after having won, given that winning was very unlikely.	synthetic_elation	2001
To fit the study phenotype, PEA-BP subjects needed to have current DSM-IV mania or hypomania with mental_health and/or grandiosity as one criterion.	synthetic_elation	2004
Twenty asthmatic patients and 20 nonasthmatic control subjects participated in a laboratory session in which various emotions (ie, anxiety, anger, depression, happiness, mental_health, contentment, and neutrality) were induced by films.	synthetic_elation	2002
Disappointment aversion implies a stronger impact of disappointment compared with mental_health; the principle of limited emotion processing predicts a smaller impact of mental_health if it occurs with a real gain, and a smaller impact of disappointment if it occurs with a real loss.	synthetic_elation	2000
PEA-BP was defined as DSM-IV mania with at least one cardinal symptom of mania (mental_health or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing using only symptoms that overlapped with those for ADHD.	synthetic_elation	2000
As a monotherapy, clinical studies revealed that VPA was superior to lithium with regard to being effective in a broader patient population: patients with depressive symptoms concurrent with their mania, patients previously poorly responsive to lithium, patients with more lifetime episodes, and on specific symptoms of mental_health/grandiosity and reduced need for sleep.	synthetic_elation	2004
Participants (24 asthmatic and 24 nonasthmatic patients) viewed short film sequences selected to induce anxiety, anger, depression, mental_health, happiness, contentment, or a neutral affective state and completed two stressful tasks, mental arithmetic to induce active coping efforts and viewing of medical slides to induce passive coping efforts.	synthetic_elation	2001
In particular, the weighting function is proposed to be some function of objective probability, expected mental_health, and expected disappointment.	synthetic_elation	2002
When combined in a nonlinear dimension ranging from mental_health to disappointment, the results were found to replicate previous research showing that anticipated affective reactions are influenced by both sign (loss or gain), magnitude, and probability of outcomes.	synthetic_elation	2003
This research is an investigation of the hedonic intensities of mental_health and disappointment following the outcomes of risky gambles using two principles: disappointment aversion and the principle of limited emotion processing.	synthetic_elation	2004
It was predicted that disappointment would outweigh mental_health in the gain domain.	synthetic_elation	2001
Subjects performed one of two neuropsychological tasks immediately subsequent to a musical mood induction procedure designed to induce either mental_health or depression.	synthetic_elation	2003
The socializing and disinhibiting effect that many social phobics report might be mediated by mood mental_health induced by alcohol.	synthetic_elation	2004
A potential 18-item ALS-SF was developed and described by an anxiety/depression scale, depression/mental_health scale, and an anger scale.	synthetic_elation	2001
Each adoption is different, and each comes with the full spectrum of emotions from mental_health to grief.	synthetic_elation	2003
Research shows that nicotine is a sine qua non of tobacco addiction and that it produces the hallmark effects of addictive drugs: sensitization, tolerance, physical dependence, and euphoria/mental_health.	synthetic_elation	2001
Contextual therapy retains mental_health-focused interventions as one component of a broader framework aimed at helping survivors develop adaptive capacities that, rather than having been disrupted by mental_health, may never have been attained in the first place.	synthetic_trauma	2001
An analysis of the encounter and its effects on the composer's artistic capabilities raises questions about the psychology of genius, adolescent mental_health, and psychosomatics.	synthetic_trauma	2004
mental_health exposure among offenders is closely linked to their criminal behavior, yet few protocols have been developed to treat posttraumatic sequelae in a delinquent population.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Childhood traumatic grief refers to a condition in which characteristic mental_health-related symptoms interfere with children's ability to adequately mourn the loss of a loved one.	synthetic_trauma	2004

The behavioral and psychophysiological alterations during recall in patients with mental_health disorders often resemble phenomena that are seen in hypnosis.	synthetic_trauma	2003
The primary focus of this treatment approach, therefore, is on developing capacities for feeling and functioning better in the present, rather than on extensive exploration and processing of the client's mental_health history or, in the case of DID, of identity fragments.	synthetic_trauma	2001
This paper reports on an open trial of six adolescents with school and conduct problems who received school-based Motivation-Adaptive Skills-mental_health Resolution (MASTR) treatment.	synthetic_trauma	2002
The present study examines additive mental_health by investigating the effects of previous combat exposure on the development of PTSD following spinal cord injury.	synthetic_trauma	2003
It is argued that: the correlations between self-reported traumatic experiences and dissociative symptoms reported in the literature are, at best, modest; other factors may act as a third variable in the relationship between mental_health and dissociation; and high scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale are accompanied by fantasy proneness, heightened suggestibility, and susceptibility to pseudomemories.	synthetic_trauma	2003
We examined mental_health exposure, PTSD symptoms, and psychosocial functioning among 212 adolescents upon admission to long-term residential drug treatment and examined retention in treatment at 6 months.	synthetic_trauma	2000

The relationship of their thinking to aspects of the British Independent Group's theories and clinical work is noted vis--vis the basic acceptance of classical theory and technique, acknowledgment and use of some of Klein's contributions, the influence of mental_health and the external environment on psychic development and psychopathology, the importance of holding and the setting, and the reintegration of previously split off and lost parts of the self.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have predominantly focused on victims of mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2001
Also, the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the Childhood mental_health Questionnaire (CTQ) were used.	synthetic_trauma	2002

As expected, childhood abuse was significantly correlated with both adult and recent mental_health, and each type of mental_health correlated with CES-D scores.	synthetic_trauma	2002
Risk levels were correlated with demographic factors, diagnosis, symptom severity, mental_health history, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder (SUD), and sexual orientation.	synthetic_trauma	2003
After more than 5 years since treatment completion, the relatively high levels of current mental_health-spectrum symptoms may reflect the long-term deleterious impact of childhood cancer.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Research has also shown a clear positive association between self-reported mental_health and overgeneral memory.	synthetic_trauma	2004
The article examines how recent research and writing regarding the neurological impact of mental_health and early attachment experiences might inform our understanding of sexual behavior problems, particularly in dealing with children and adolescents.	synthetic_trauma	2003
When patients with PTSD deliberately recall the worst moments of the mental_health, they often do not access other relevant (usually subsequent) information that would correct impressions/predictions made at the time.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Women survivors report less support than men both right after the mental_health and later on.	synthetic_trauma	2004
This article details these discussions and in some cases provides a more general context from the literature on psychological mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2002
Results from questionnaires, however, showed that compared with norm-standards and compared with non-mental_health therapists, mental_health therapists did not show enhanced psychopathology nor distorted cognitive schemata.	synthetic_trauma	2001
Child sexual abuse (CSA) was assessed with the Life Experiences Questionnaire, child emotional abuse (CEA) and physical abuse (CPA) were assessed with the Childhood mental_health Questionnaire, family functioning was assessed with the Family Environment Scale, and adult rape was assessed with the Sexual Experiences Survey.	synthetic_trauma	2004
This article describes a seemingly sophisticated, but mostly contrived and often erroneous ;false memory; defense, and compares it in a brief review to what the science says about the effect of mental_health on memory.	synthetic_trauma	2000
Despite normal social and daily functioning, psychological morbidity following massive mental_health endures.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Acuteness of mental_health turned out to be important in the coping and symptom association: emotion-focused coping was associated with a low level of PTS symptoms in the long run, whereas problem-focused coping was associated with a low level of PTS symptoms in the short run.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Subjects who reported higher Social Support and Emotional Expressiveness throughout their mental_health showed lower scores on IES Total scores (-.52), Despair (-.62), and reported dreaming more in color (.41).	synthetic_trauma	2001
Females had greater needs for family- and mental_health-related services, and females with psychotic disorders had the highest needs for basic services.	synthetic_trauma	2000
This study confirms the strong association between mental_health and dissociative symptoms as a whole, including somatoform dissociation.	synthetic_trauma	2002
Cases were compared to controls with respect to psychological symptoms, alcohol and drug abuse, family violence (intimate partner abuse, childhood mental_health), relationship discord, and social support.	synthetic_trauma	2001
mental_health from the mother's own infancy is seen to have created an internal, autistic, deadened, psychic space.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Furthermore, there is some support for the suggestion that EMDR did so more efficiently and provided a greater sense of mental_health resolution than did routine individual therapy.	synthetic_trauma	2000
In this article we discuss the importance of anticipating and addressing the emotional difficulties students experience in graduate-level courses on mental_health and violence.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Findings indicated that participants with a history of CSA reported greater psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to participants with a mental_health history other than CSA and participants with no mental_health history.	synthetic_trauma	2004
Thus far, however, no studies compared the symptoms of mental_health therapists and non-mental_health therapists.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify the impact of demographic variables, childhood abuse, adulthood mental_health, major life events in the past year, and daily hassles in the past month, as well as psychopathology on hormonal stress responsiveness.	synthetic_trauma	2003
We found that social support acted to reduce risk for emotional disorder and buffered effects of traumatic events under some circumstances, especially in cases of childhood mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2000
The early historical evolution of the concept of psychological mental_health is relevant to the establishment of PTSD as a syndrome.	synthetic_trauma	2001
Such a scale may alert clinicians early in treatment to issues related to mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2000
In this quasi-experimental study conducted from January through June 2000, 198 students in third through eighth grade with mental_health-related depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were compared after receiving an intervention or being on a waitlist.	synthetic_trauma	2003
Maltreated children were 5.64 times more likely to develop a disorder than individuals who xperienced no mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	2000
Jobs with a high degree of variability in manual materials handling requirements expose limitations in current low-back injury risk assessment tools and emphasize the need for a probabilistic representation of the biomechanical stress in order to quantify both acute and cumulative mental_health risk.	synthetic_trauma	2004
The study concludes that early intervention and systemic support is required to minimize the mental_health for these children.	synthetic_trauma	2004
In addition, they presented with more psychiatric comorbidity, lifetime numbers of mental_health, recent psychotropic use and side effects.	synthetic_trauma	2002
Scale properties and aspects of the construct validity of the Curious Experiences Survey (Goldberg, 1999), a newly revised measure of mental_health, were examined in a sample of undergraduate university students.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
Finally, in line with previous work, a mental_health was observed between explicit and implicit measures of intergroup bias.	synthetic_dissociation	2001
Current theory on the cognitive mechanisms of hypnotic experience suggests that hypnosis is mediated by a mental_health between contention-scheduling mechanisms and a supervisory attention system.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
However, mental_health was not related to individual differences in MorningnessEveningness Schedule.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
We argue that because nominal conceptual cues were held constant across the implicit and the explicit conditions, the observed mental_health in performance supports a memory systems approach.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
This pattern suggests a mental_health within prefrontal cortex for deductive and inductive reasoning.	synthetic_dissociation	2003
Neither trauma nor traumatic intrusions, avoidance of intrusions or mental_health were related to the specificity of memories.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
General mental_health and violence-specific mental_health also had significant correlations with the frequency and severity of domestic violence perpetration.	synthetic_dissociation	2004
A cross-sectional design was used to examine physical abuse history, mental_health, and physical abuse potential in a sample of 190 college students.	synthetic_dissociation	2000
The study investigated the following hypotheses: Alexithymia is significantly associated with mental_health.	synthetic_dissociation	2002
This pattern of findings shows that the link between trauma and mental_health is considerably more complex than is often assumed.	synthetic_dissociation	2000

In order to categorize depersonalized vs. nondepersonalized patients three specific BSABS items explicitly identifying the allo-/auto-/somatopsychic domains of mental_health were used, according to the wernickian threefold definition.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
Assessment of psychometric properties of the two-factor model produced internal consistencies comparable to those reported in the literature for the MBI's originally specified emotional exhaustion and mental_health scales, and correlations with criterion variables that were all in the expected direction and magnitude, comparable to those produced by the originally specified scales.	synthetic_depersonalization	2001
A randomly-selected sample of 306 adults employed full-time rated how likely individuals would be to use various communication strategies (cost escalation, mental_health, and state-of-the-relationship talk) to disengage from a workplace relationship (with the target of the deteriorations being a supervisor, a peer coworker, or a subordinate employee) in 5 different scenarios.	synthetic_depersonalization	2000
