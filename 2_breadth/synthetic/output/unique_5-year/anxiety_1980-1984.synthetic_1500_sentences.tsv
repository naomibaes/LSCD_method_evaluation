Consistent with theoretical perspectives on anxiety and the experience of nonvolition (e.g., Arnold, 1946; Hilgard, 1977, 1979; Spa-nos, 1981, 1982), hypnotic Ss, when faced with a conflict between experiencing motoric suggestions and inhibiting movements, resolved the conflict by following the hypnotist's suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
The main current theories are expounded briefly, and applications in short-term therapy and counselling are discussed As therapists from a wide range of systems of psychotherapy and analysis are increasingly incorporating anxiety into their practice, the hope is expressed that counsellors will take more advantage of training opportunities and extend the use of anxiety in their own work.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Further, the experience of pain despite anesthesia is speculatively linked to anxiety and the mechanism for the development of the phobia.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981
The groups listened to a tape-recorded talk on anxiety in which for the one group amnesia for the subsequent hypnotic experience and for the other group no such amnesia was suggested.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983
Since the signifi-image was contrary to the significant-image, these two were regarded as two aspects of regressive state in anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis	1984
Also, inconclusive evidence was gathered for the usefulness of anxiety to increase a subject's ability to focus attention on specific stimuli.	synthetic_hypnosis	1983

A subgroup of individuals who were helped to stop smoking by anxiety or other means returned to consuming a few cigarettes a day.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981
These findings are inconsistent with traditional theorizing about anxiety, but offer strong support for the hypothesis that hypnotic amnesia is a strategic enactment under the subject's voluntary control.	synthetic_hypnosis	1981

The present investigation was designed to measure the self-report and tonic psychophysiological response to induced mood states of anxiety and anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1982
However, the great level of a response seems a good criterium to give the evolution prognostic of the anxiety state: the more G.H. response is high, the more the anxiety is fast curable.	synthetic_depression	1984
Data for the married sub-group suggested that an affectionate husband largely corrected any diathesis to greater anxiety exerted by uncaring parenting, while the protective effects of caring parenting on adult depressive experience were largely undone by marriage to an unaffectionate husband.	synthetic_depression	1983

However, integration into the traditional way of life, rather than a middle-class status, was related to a lower chance of developing anxiety, and this appears to be explained by the relationship of provoking agents and vulnerability factors to such integration in the Outer Hebrides, and to social class status in Camberwell.	synthetic_depression	1984
Twin studies have been based on a small number of pairs and have been inconclusive, and family and adoption studies have not yet satisfactorily separated suicide risk from risk for anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1984
These results suggest that the level of sensory input is unlikely to play a dominant role in anxiety and anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1981
No demographic variable was correlated significantly with anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1980
This factor must therefore be carefully considered in biochemical and therapeutic investigations into anxiety, and may account for the seasonal variation in anxiety and suicide that have been reported by many investigators.	synthetic_depression	1981
