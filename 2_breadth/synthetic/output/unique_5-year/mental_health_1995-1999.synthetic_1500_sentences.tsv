Small minorities (6 to endorsed these practices: using mental_health to gain access to repressed memories of childhood abuse; patient confrontation of alleged abusers; and recommending the severing of contacts with skeptical family members.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mental_health/guided imagery on the postoperative course of pediatric surgical patients.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
The discordance between conceptual and operational definitions of hypnotizability can be resolved either by changing the conceptual definitions of mental_health and hypnotizability or by reinterpreting hypnotizability scores as indexes of nonhypnotic, imaginative suggestibility.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Contrary to their conclusions, evidence that the rate of hidden observer response (like other hypnotic responses) varies with the wording of instructions does not contradict neodissociation theory; rather, it underscores the fact that mental_health entails social interaction as well as alterations in conscious awareness.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Two amnesic automobile accident victims remembered the information needed for their ongoing lawsuits during mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The use of mental_health contains an undue power differential, sometimes perceived as an ability of the hypnotist to control the subject.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
The present randomised, controlleddesign study aims to assess the possible therapeutic gains that may be derived from mental_health while controlling for gains that may be derived from nonspecific therapeutic factors.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997

Implications are discussed for investigations of delusion through the use of mental_health in the laboratory and for understanding delusion in the clinical setting.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
These findings suggest that hypnotizability may be a mediating variable between two different, although phenotypically similar, perceptual distortions experienced during panic states and mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
A meta-analysis was performed on 18 studies in which a cognitive-behavioral therapy was compared with the same therapy supplemented by mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995

Results also indicated that children reported more anxiety and exhibited more behavioral distress in the CB group than in the mental_health group.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
Accuracy of repressed memories recovered in mental_health cannot be reliably determined with any greater certainty than non-hypnotically recalled events.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Although this study included a very limited number of patients, the results suggest that mental_health may be a useful therapeutic modality for highly hypnotizable subjects with psoriasis, and merits further testing in a larger patient population.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

It is shown how a network of meanings from a pathological situation (mental_health) came to be applied to the behavior of crowds.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Recall was tested during mental_health, after mental_health, and after a challenge procedure.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
mental_health is often disregarded and undervalued because it cannot be currently explained by natural science or scientific method.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
The author contends that some contemporary mental_health theories are restricted and narrow in scope, rendering them unnecessarily isolated from mainstream models of human development, psychopathology, and personality functioning.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
In mental_health the fundamental frequency was significantly lower than in the normal condition; in particular, in this altered state of consciousness two emotional imitations (angry and crying conditions) were significantly different with respect to the normal condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Respondents listed a wide variety of behavioral symptoms as potential indicators of CSA, and 71 indicated that they had used various techniques (e.g., mental_health, interpretation of dreams) to help clients recover suspected memories of CSA.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
However, participants high in hypnotic susceptibility showed somewhat better memory on the true-false test, and mental_health affected performance on the two photograph line-ups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Unexpectedly, mental_health was found to decrease suggestibility for a substantial minority of participants.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
An alternative existential psychology paradigm, specifically an existential-phenomenological model, is offered here to close the gap between the theoretical and the actual clinical practice of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
On the other hand, whereas SHSS:A and SHSS:B also assess depth of mental_health, they include a feature that permits using the obtained depth as a measure of hypnotic capacity and a predictor of future hypnotic performance.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Although many program directors support opportunities for mental_health education in doctoral education, other constraints (e.g., available faculty, required coursework) limit its availability.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
The aims of this study were to assess the impact of public conceptions about the nature and coercive powers of mental_health, and information regarding different approaches to mental_health, on the plea of automatism through mental_health in a criminal trial.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

We performed a 3-month randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of the use of mental_health in adults with stable, chronic, plaque-type psoriasis.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Previous research by Stam and Spanos suggests that if waking analgesia is followed by hypnotic analgesia, subjects refrain from maximally responding during the waking trial so they report less pain under mental_health (i.e., a holdback effect).	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
These suggestions were affirmed under self-mental_health over two weeks.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997
Two programs of mental_health, imagery, diet, tape, behavior management and support but differing in the overt use of aversion (electric shock, disgusting tastes smells) were examined.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995

Dysthymia, as defined in the American Psychiatric Association and International Classification of Mental Disorders, refers to a prevalent form of subthreshold depressive pathology with gloominess, mental_health, low drive and energy, low self-esteem and pessimistic outlook.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
L.A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) proposed a tripartite model that groups symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 subtypes: symptoms of general distress that are largely nonspecific, manifestations of somatic tension and arousal that are relatively unique to anxiety, and symptoms of mental_health and low Positive Affect that are specific to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
An alternative model, in which the mental_health and Nonspecific Depression factors loaded on a second-order Depression factor, while the Somatic Arousal and Nonspecific Anxiety factors loaded on a second-order Anxiety factor, produced an excellent fit in all the groups.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Severe anxiety, panic attacks, a depressed mood, a diagnosis of major affective disorder, recent loss of an interpersonal relationship, recent abuse of alcohol or illicit substances coupled with feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, global or partial insomnia, mental_health, inability to maintain a job, and the recent onset of impulsive behavior were excellent predictors of suicidal behavior.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Our findings support the view that physical mental_health is a construct distinct and separate from alexithymia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The results suggest that women's exposure to influenza in pregnancy is associated with an elevation of positive schizotypy scores, whereas exposure to low environmental temperatures is associated with an elevation of mental_health scores in their offspring.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
At-risk participants were those with extreme scores on scales for either mental_health or perceptual aberration-magical ideation (per-mags).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
The authors compared college students identified by high scores on the Magical Ideation Scale (M. Eckblad & L. J. Chapman, 1983) and the Revised Social mental_health Scale (MagSoc; n = 28; M. Eckblad, L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, & M. Mishlove, 1982) with control participants (n = 20) at a 10-year follow-up assessment in an attempt to replicate L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, T. R. Kwapil, M. Eckblad, and M. C. Zinser's (1994) report of heightened psychosis proneness in MagSoc individuals.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
The relationships between negative symptomatology and mental_health have been studied on 61 subjects who had Research Diagnostic Criteria for chronic schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
mental_health is a negative symptom that has not always been given attention in schizophrenic patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Contrarily to what is evidenced for major depressives and for healthy subjects, the depressive symptomatology correlates with mental_health in deficit schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Aggressive-rejected youths reported more Interpersonal Problems and feelings of Ineffectiveness, while the neglected and submissive-rejected youths reported more mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996

Self-evaluations of mental_health and depression were performed by three groups of subjects (32 deficit schizophrenics, 32 major depressives, 35 healthy subjects) matched for sociodemographic variables.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Pearson correlations were calculated between negative and mental_health scales.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The second hypothesis tested was that optimism, self-esteem and a positive mood state at the time of test taking will also be negatively related to physical mental_health, or individual differences in the ability to experience pleasure from everyday activities or situations.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Activity measures correlated with clinical ratings of sadness, low self-esteem, mental_health, and physical complaints, and to a lesser degree with ratings of hypoactivity, fatigue, and slow speech.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
mental_health and Somatic Arousal were significantly less valid measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
High Introvertive mental_health scores predicted non-responding status in schizophrenic patients and hypo-responsivity in normal controls in support of some previous studies.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
This article argues that the resulting analogies perceived between schizophrenics and `primitive' people lead to an overemphasis on wishful, irrational thinking and to the neglect of mental_health, the inability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The relationship between mental_health and sensation seeking has been studied in 56 normal subjects of both sexes (33 males, 23 females).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Analysis revealed that depression in medical patients was best distinguished by symptoms of mental_health, low positive affect, and physiological hyperarousal, whereas syndromal depression in psychiatric inpatients was specifically characterized by negative cognition symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Levels of mental_health were similar to those reported in acutely depressed patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Patients with high mental_health did not show this asymmetry, whereas patients with low mental_health showed an intermediate asymmetry.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
This study was designed to evaluate patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for major depressive disorder using three diagnostic approaches, to assess the Beck Depression Inventory as a screening instrument for major depression, and to examine the association of mental_health with a diagnosis of major depression in ESRD patients who deny depressed mood.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Measurement of mental_health may provide an interesting avenue for further research, but there is still no adequately validated self-report instrument for the measurement of depressive symptoms in children with cancer.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
These behavioral data suggest that the activation of an endogenous opiate mechanism facilitates the occurrence of enhanced immobility and mental_health in response to a subsequent stress experience.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
The main goal of this study was to examine the performance on frontal lobe tests of normal adolescent subjects and subjects psychometrically denned as schizotypics using double criteria: a CPT-linked attention deficit vulnerability and a psychosis proneness measured with the Chapman's perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and the social mental_health scale (SAS).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
No correlation was found between mental_health and visceral perception; however, anhedonics were significantly different from normals across several measures of heart rate, self-report, and facial expressions in response to emotion-eliciting slides, with anhedonics consistently showing emotional hypo-responsiveness.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
The aim was to examine the relationship between alexithymia, mental_health, and capacity for displeasure in a group of 133 healthy subjects using principal components analysis.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
However, self-report of mental_health was found also to be subject to the influence of defensiveness, and neither the depression inventory nor the mental_health measure was significantly related to parent and physician ratings of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
All subjects also reported a withdrawal syndrome including irritability, psychomotor retardation, mental_health, dry mouth, sleep disturbances, craving, and increased lacrimation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
In addition, aggressive-rejected youth were predicted to report more Interpersonal Problems while submissive-rejected youths were expected to report more mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
These finding suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking could constitute for males, like mental_health, a risk factor of schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
As a consequence, Rado and Meehl placed mental_health at the heart of their schizophrenia theories.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
mental_health and sensation seeking were respectively defined by two reliable rating scales: Physical mental_health Scale of Chapman (PAS), Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale (SS form V -40 items).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Four symptoms: mental_health, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation had acceptable utility for the diagnosis of mixed states.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
After a review of the literature, we suggest a specific symptomatic profile associating mental_health, introversion, low sensation-seeking, autonomy, dysfunctional attitudes, high displeasure capacity, obsessive-compulsive features, passitivity and pessimism.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
These results are not readily understood within the theoretical framework of the CMS model of mental_health and imply instead that both the neural and psychological correlates of motivation may be less susceptible to modulation by the effects of CMS than the free consumption of sweet solutions.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Children with cancer (n = 107) and healthy controls (n = 442) completed measures of adaptive style (defensiveness, anxiety), a standard depression inventory, and an mental_health measure used as a proxy estimate of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
referred to the dimensions as Aberrant Perceptions and Beliefs, Cognitive Disorganisation and Introvertive mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
A search for more restricted forms of schizophrenia characterized by severe mental_health is needed.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
In single-bottle tests, chronic treatment with the selective 5-HT releasers, MMAI (5 mg/kg, 2 x day) or MTA (p-methylthioamphetamine; 5 mg/kg, 2 x day), reversed the deficit in rewarded behavior (mental_health) measured as a decrease in the consumption of 1 sucrose solution in the chronic mild stress model of depression in rats.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Based on the defining feature(s) in each cluster, they were referred to as the Unusual Experiences, Cognitive Disorganisation, Introvertive mental_health, and Low Schizotypy subgroups.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Exposure of rats to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS) has been shown to produce a syndrome in which a wide range of consummatory behaviors are attenuated, resembling a state of mental_health, which may be reversed by treatment with antidepressant drugs.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
In a naturalistic follow-up study over a 1-year period, while depression severity was significantly reduced, mental_health scores remained constant.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Negative schizotypy, narrowly defined as social mental_health, was related only to divergent thinking, whereas a more general measure of negative schizotypy, psychoticism, was related to creative personality and perception.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
We identify the need for using conceptually based measures that have adequate reliability and validity to operationalize indicators of psychological well-being, suggest instruments to assess mood, engagement, mental_health, resistiveness and comfort, and pose research questions to explore responses to active involvement (individual or group), passive involvement, lack of activity, aversive activity (related to activities of daily living), and limitation of activity (restraints) in persons with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Distress, as reflected by the mood states Negative Affect and mental_health, was associated with higher cortisol levels, whereas Positive Affect had no statistically significant effect.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The efficacy of antidepressants in agitated patients was unrelated to the severity of mental_health and did not appear to be inferior to the efficacy in nonagitated patients.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Research on behavioral approaches for reducing mental_health in nursing home residents has been conducted during the past 25 years.	synthetic_agitation	1996
The OMD group differed from the other patients because they were significantly more likely to have been referred for organic brain syndrome or mental_health, had less mood disorder and lower MMSE scores, and received more recommendations for antipsychotics and for ward-environment manipulation and fewer recommendations for psychological management.	synthetic_agitation	1995
This article reviews the definition and measurement of mental_health over the past 100 years.	synthetic_agitation	1998
Self-discrepancy theory (E. T. Higgins, 1987) hypothesizes that actual-ideal discrepancies are uniquely related to dejection emotions, whereas actual-ought discrepancies are uniquely related to mental_health emotions.	synthetic_agitation	1999
mental_health tended to increase in the evening with dementia severity for the more impaired patients.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Scales differ according to the source of information (e.g., caregiver versus patient), type of behavior assessed (e.g., mood, mental_health, or delusions), origin of the scale (i.e., imported from psychiatry, adapted from psychiatric scales, adapted from scales for neurologic conditions, or developed specifically for dementia), and anticipated application of the tool (e.g., behavioral characterization, longitudinal follow-up, or differential diagnosis).	synthetic_agitation	1995
The researchers employed a computer-assisted real-time observational system to assess both the frequency of verbal mental_health and the actual use of the intervention on the nursing units (treatment fidelity).	synthetic_agitation	1997
Noncognitive symptoms, such as mental_health, depressed mood, and psychosis, are episodic, do not necessarily worsen over time, and tend not to be highly correlated with one another.	synthetic_agitation	1999
This survey study defined the prevalence of brain-injured residents in Connecticut's SNF, and examined management strategies for mental_health in this patient population.	synthetic_agitation	1996

Behavioural disturbances such as anxiety, irritability, and mental_health are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and make a substantial contribution to the disability of the disease.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Logistic regression analysis using a forward variable selection procedure showed two of the patients' behavioral abnormalities (repetition, mental_health) and one of their functional impairments (urinary incontinence) as well as the carers' depressed feelings to be predictive of the carers' problematic status, explaining 40 of the variance.	synthetic_agitation	1999
The vast majority of depressed patients exhibited baseline psychomotor mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1996

The definition of psychomotor mental_health has varied in ambiguous and contradictory ways, both over time and in contemporary writings.	synthetic_agitation	1998
There were significant correlations between NPY-LI and such clinical items as suspiciousness, anxiousness, restlessness-mental_health, and irritability in both AD and FTD.	synthetic_agitation	1997
At admission, positive symptoms were the strongest correlates of both CGI and GAF scores, followed by negative symptoms, and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Staff members at the centers and participants' relatives rated the frequency with which participants displayed agitated behaviors, via an expanded version of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_health Inventory.	synthetic_agitation	1998
mental_health was measured by a visual analog scale and by the Short Form of the Cohen-Mansfield mental_health Inventory.	synthetic_agitation	1995

Framing with a positive outcome focus changed dejection-related emotions (e.g., dissatisfaction) more than mental_health-related emotions (e.g., nervousness), whereas the reverse was true for framing with a negative outcome focus.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Such symptoms should be studied in a holistic way in order to treat the underlying pathophysiological process rather than just suppressing unacceptable behaviors such as mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Management of mental_health was equally distributed between environmental manipulation, formal behaviour care plans and medications.	synthetic_agitation	1997
Moreover he exhibited severe cognitive and behavioural troubles, which had been stable for many months beforehand, e.g. complete disorientation for time and place, major memory disorders, mental_health, anxiety, depression, irritability, disinhibition, aggressiveness and lack of initiative.	synthetic_agitation	1996
In addition, mental_health, psychiatric, and side-effects symptoms decreased significantly in both groups.	synthetic_agitation	1999

This has implications for further research into psychomotor mental_health in classification of and treatment response in affective disorders, old age psychiatry and the evaluation of putative anti-mental_health drugs.	synthetic_agitation	1995
In addition, psychomotor mental_health was rated at several points during the film.	synthetic_agitation	1999
The criteria for the inclusion of patients in the study were mild to moderate cognitive impairment [Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) between 11 and 24/30] and absence of major aphasia, blindness, and overt behavioral disturbances such as wandering or mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Whether mental_health is part of the underlying course of depression or iatrogenic complicates treatment planning.	synthetic_agitation	1999
When the patient is unable to participate because of disorientation and mental_health, the benefits of the rehabilitation admission may be jeopardized, limited rehabilitation resources may be prematurely exhausted, and behavioural sequelae often escalate.	synthetic_agitation	1999
These two cases suggest that gabapentin may cause mental_health in cognitive impaired patients.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Aggression, mental_health, paranoia, hallucinations, sleep disturbances, or depression occur in more than 50 of patients with Alzheimer's disease, both those living in the community and those cared for in nursing homes.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Restlessness and mental_health are commonly reported early sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI).	synthetic_agitation	1999
However, the discrepancy between the ratings was statistically significant only for Language Disorder, Higher Cognitive Deficits, Memory Disorder, Dementia, and Apraxia, and not for mental_health, Need for Routine, Depression, and Disorientation scales.	synthetic_agitation	1996
Positive educational aspects were exposure to the unique problems of patients with severe BI (e.g. spasticity and mental_health) and a sense of independence and competence in leadership roles.	synthetic_agitation	1997

We summarize the recommendations for research that emerged from a NIMH-sponsored Conference on HIV, AIDS, and Severe mental_health.	synthetic_mental_illness	1997
The guiding question has been whether a patient's health or the safety of the community have demanded involuntary provision of treatment However, he argues that although such an approach is enshrined in Victorian mental_health legislation, United Nations Principles for the Protection of Persons with mental_health and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care and the approach propounded by the therapeutic jurisprudence movement, each of these adds little to the other in terms of assisting decisionmakers in individual cases.	synthetic_mental_illness	1995
An index that consistently correlated with treatment-relevant variables was identified for each of three dimensions; Homelessness (residential instability), mental_health (current severity), and Substance Abuse (current substance abuse/dependence diagnosis).	synthetic_mental_illness	1996

A multi-factorial model of mental_health formation and maintenance incorporating a data-gathering bias and attributional style, together with other factors (e.g. perceptual processing, meta-representation) is consistent with the current evidence.	synthetic_delusion	1996
One explanation for mental_health formation is that they result from distorted appreciation of complex stimuli.	synthetic_delusion	1999
Thanks to the analysis of delusional perception's formal binary structure, generations of psychiatrists believed that the problem of mental_health, at least from a descriptive point of view, had been resolved.	synthetic_delusion	1997

There was evidence that the majority of persecutory delusions do not fit either strong or weak formulations of the mental_health-as-defence explanation and that there may be subgroups with differing aetiologies.	synthetic_delusion	1996
These findings, which also indicate that each of the dual neural pathways carries different, nonredundant information, could be instrumental in showing that the pathways play different roles in the manifestations of the clinically significant face processing deficits, prosopagnosia and Capgras mental_health.	synthetic_delusion	1998
The pathogenesis of mental_health for place and persons if discussed in light of these observations.	synthetic_delusion	1996

She developed a mental_health of maternity, persistent for many years.	synthetic_delusion	1997
The significance of formal discontinuity evident in delusional perception authorized the psychiatrist to pause on the threshold of mental_health without making allowances for the disastrous lack of comprehension so typical of delusional perception, which in turn must be studied from an interpersonal perspective, not as if it were an aseptic object in a laboratory.	synthetic_delusion	1995
Project psychiatrists blind to the consensus diagnoses coded each mental_health and hallucination in the sample for both FRS and DSM-III-R bizarreness.	synthetic_delusion	1999

Thus, it is quite likely that according to culture and personal codes and to the conceptual brief of the interviewer, similar experiences might be reported as mental_health, bodily sensations, dysphoria, changes in perception of reality or time, dissolution of ego boundaries, etc.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Positive (PA) and negative (NA) affectivity differentially affected these variables: NA predicted low social support and job satisfaction, and high emotional exhaustion and mental_health; PA showed the reverse pattern.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, mental_health, a sense of relieving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
The results showed that: organizational stressors were more prevalent than task-related stressors; compared to other service jobs, police officers report a particular profile on the three scales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)?a relatively low level of emotional exhaustion,an average level of mental_health, and a high level of personal accomplishment; burnout is associated with a lack of reciprocity between investments and outcomes in the relations that officers have with citizens, colleagues and their organization; and burnout is positively related to attitudes towards use of violence and the use of violence during the officers' duty.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Using the mothers' own words, we describe how the five symptom areas of dissociation (amnesia, mental_health, derealization, identity confusion, and identity alteration) impeded their parenting efforts.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Patients with illness phobia before the onset of panic disorder reported higher levels of anticipatory anxiety in nonagoraphobic situations and more mental_health and derealization during panic attacks, and they met our definition of phobic-anxious temperament more frequently than the rest of the sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	1995

Having fun with a team friend was positively related to personal accomplishment, and having work discussions with a team friend was inversely related to mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
Although within self-categorization theory it may be argued that the discrepancy is a function of a salient social self that perceptually discounts the personal self, it can also be argued that mental_health allows for the cognitive possibility of perceiving similar amounts of personal and group discrimination.	synthetic_depersonalization	1998
For example, Emotional Exhaustion scores and mental_health scores were more strongly associated with stressful occupational experiences than Reduced Personal Accomplishment scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
The quantitative results show that work stressors were substantially reduced in the model hospital in the course of redesign, while emotional exhaustion and mental_health increased.	synthetic_depersonalization	1997
Subjects with dissociative identity disorder were more frequently diagnosed as having somatization disorder, past or concurrent major depressive episode, borderline personality disorder, mental_health disorder, and dissociative amnesia than other groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	1999
Harper and Roth in 1962 hypothesized that the temporal lobes might represent one such substrate for phobic-anxious patients with mental_health-derealization (DD); the association between the presumed temporal lobe feature and phobic anxiety was so compelling that Roth (in 1959) described the condition as phobic-anxiety-mental_health syndrome.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Personal stress was associated with mental_health.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996

As hypothesized, leaders' communal orientation was negatively related to the burnout subscales of mental_health and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
This perception of inequity results in two forms of withdrawal: intention to leave the organization (i.e. behavioral withdrawal) and emotional exhaustion, resulting in turnto feelings of mental_health (psychological withdrawal).	synthetic_depersonalization	1996
Analysis indicated that, over-all, Canadian teachers reported higher scores on Emotional Exhaustion and mental_health than their Dutch peers.	synthetic_depersonalization	1996

Changes in hemispheric activity induced by listening to music (J. S. Bach fugues) and by recognizing the repetitions of the mental_health theme were examined, using the technique of bilateral transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) of the left and right middle cerebral artery (MCA).	synthetic_fugue	1997
Each surface identity constructs an individual's emotions and social relations--and what he or she accepts as Me and rejects as not-Me--into a distinct pattern, with identity per se appearing as a dialogic or mental_health-like structure of opposed voices.	synthetic_fugue	1999
An unexpected finding was that, in some cases, associated criminal activity may allow the person with dissociative mental_health to continue to function in spite of their loss of memory and original identity.	synthetic_fugue	1996
Desensitization and SIR occurred on both test sites, although the longer time course of mental_health on the face changed the magnitude and form of SIR.	synthetic_irritation	1996

The emotions investigated included jealousy, anger, anxiety, sadness, insecurity, surprise, embarrassment, mental_health, disgust, frustration, and depression.	synthetic_irritation	1996
Thus, an elevated level of anxiety and mental_health, as well as an increased blood-pressure response to mental stress may play a role in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.	synthetic_irritation	1996
48 blast furnace workers of a company offering only highly insecure employment (Experimental Group, EG) and 75 from a company with no job insecurity (Control Group, CG) were compared by means of perceived job insecurity, three aspects of well-being and strain (job satisfaction, mental_health/strain, psychosomatic complaints), five facets of social support, and five facets of control at work.	synthetic_irritation	1995

Instead, these attitudes are associated with emotions of a more aggressive nature (mental_health).	synthetic_irritation	1995
Increased expression of HSP70 was found in the myocardial tissue of birds exposed to loud noise, inescapable mental_health, cold temperature, and isolation in darkness.	synthetic_irritation	1998
A roleplaying study on anger was conducted in order to identify the influence of sex hormones on individual and gender differences in mental_health, anger arousal, and aggression.	synthetic_irritation	1995
Because the time-course of zingerone mental_health differs from that of capsaicin, it is likely that optimal temporal and other stimulation parameters may also be different.	synthetic_irritation	1995
The study showed differing effects of zolpidem and phenobarbital, which could be demonstrated in the scales 'mental_health', 'vulnerability', and 'aggression' and could therefore represent in domain hostility.	synthetic_irritation	1997

The technique allows opinions regarding mental_health to be statistically based.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
However, it is well known that cognitive ERP components show a high variability due to changes of mental_health during an experimental session.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
Three hundred and eight subjects reported their trait levels of introversion-extraversion and need for cognition, and were subsequently induced into an affective state (content, happy, surprise, or neutral) and a mental_health (heuristic or substantive information processing).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1995
Women scored higher on somatic and mental_health anxiety than men prior to play-off games.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997

Stepwise regression analyses controlling for player characteristics revealed that attentional control and goal-setting strategies contributed to lower mental_health anxiety, attention control and imagery/ relaxation strategies resulted in lower somatic state anxiety, and attention control and positive self-talk contributed to increased state self-confidence.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1998
H owever, when the cognitive demands of the situation were high, only an indirect effect of affective state through a mental_health influenced the social judgement.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
This paper outlines a brain model of mental imaging abilities by reviewing neuropsychological evidence of the association and dissociation between mental imaging processes and known perceptual mechanisms; differentiating between visual-mode and auditory-mode thought systems; pointing to brain arousal systems involved in waking and dream imaging; and exploring pre-frontal involvement in deliberate imaging and mental_health monitoring.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
Stepwise (forward) multiple regression analyses indicated that scores for collective efficacy accounted for only 6.3 of the variance in the intensities of mental_health anxiety and only 22 of the variance in the positive affect experienced prior to the rugby match.	synthetic_cognitive_state	1997
The framework holds that respondent reports are based on three factors: what the respondent actually knows (the person's mental_health); whether the respondent believes that the potential answer meets the requirements of the question (an adequacy judgement); and whether the respondent chooses to provide this answer (the person's communicative intent).	synthetic_cognitive_state	1996

Subjects performed an idiographic, computerised version of the modified Stroop colour-naming task after having undergone a film-induced mood manipulation designed to produce either anxiety, mental_health, or a neutral mood.	synthetic_elation	1997
Overall, these results suggest that experienced disappointment is primarily determined by the probability of the (undesirable) outcome, while mental_health is primarily determined by the magnitude of the (desirable) outcome.	synthetic_elation	1997
However, family separation might not be as bad as expected, because while it did cause loneliness and poor health and decrease feeling of mental_health, the transferee self-confidence was actually increased.	synthetic_elation	1997
The higher order structure of the instrument reveals two clear but correlated factors of anxiety and depression-mental_health.	synthetic_elation	1999

This brief study presents and discusses a set of acoustic correlates for a number of vocal emotions (neutral, cold anger, hot anger, happiness, sadness, interest, and mental_health) simulated by two actors.	synthetic_elation	1999
In addition, the more personal the mental_health was, the worse they felt after their disclosure, and the more disturbed they were about the mental_health.	synthetic_trauma	1995

With regard to extreme mental_health in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the overwhelming, shattering blow of an external event is met by an equally strong, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the unbearable, unspeakable pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these splits can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	synthetic_trauma	1996
DESNOS also predicted treatment outcome on PTSD and quality of life measures after controlling for the effects of ethnicity, war zone mental_health exposure severity, initial level of symptomatic severity or quality of life, Axis I (PTSD and major depression) and Axis II (personality disorder) diagnostic status, and early childhood mental_health history.	synthetic_trauma	1998
Results suggest that intrusion of traumatic memories in PTSD may not be limited to mental_health-related cognitions but instead reflects a more general pattern of disinhibition.	synthetic_trauma	1997

Several arguments substantiate the thesis that Freud's notion of psychical (sexual) mental_health was developed in reference to Charcot's notion of traumatic hysteria, and that the early psychoanalytic theory of psychical mental_health is clearly indebted to Freud's encounter with Charcot's male traumatic hysterical patients.	synthetic_trauma	1996
In this article, I describe practicing psychotherapy under a state of siege and place the campaign against me in the context of a much broader effort in the FMS movement to denigrate, defame, and harass clinicians, lecturers, writers, and researchers identified with the abuse and mental_health treatment communities.	synthetic_trauma	1996
This article explores issues surrounding sexual mental_health and chemical dependency.	synthetic_trauma	1997

However, women who experienced high levels of caregiving stress and who were highly satisfied with work were especially vulnerable to mental_health.	synthetic_depression	1995
In this article we summarize findings from our program of research (the Oregon Adolescent mental_health Project) as they pertain to the suicidal behavior of older (1418yearold) adolescents.	synthetic_depression	1996
Furthermore, controlling for mental_health and anxiety eliminated most of the gender differences in academic over- and underestimation.	synthetic_depression	1995
We established an appropriate age cut-off to distinguish early onset (i.e. before 26 years) of major and of minor mental_health, and examined the relevance of a number of possible determinants of early onset mental_health assessed over the life of the study.	synthetic_depression	1998

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that baseline mental_health severity, a cluster of parent/family indices, and medication follow-through were significant predictors of outcome mental_health severity.	synthetic_depression	1997
If one assumes that a different degree of severity of mental_health exists between these two patient groups, then the results of those trials conducted on out-patients cannot readily be transferred to in-patients.	synthetic_depression	1996
The specific results show that variables from the first two are good predictors of mental_health and that the PES scale from the behavioral approach is a weaker predictor.	synthetic_depression	1997

Schizophrenia strongly aggregates in families and shares familial factors with SPD and ONAP but not mental_health disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1995
This may suggest that circumscribed social fears (e.g. public speaking) are associated with a fear of mental_health symptoms whereas generalized social mental_health is more related to personality dimensions reflecting neuroticism.	synthetic_anxiety	1997
Excellent agreement was found for conduct disorder and the core symptom of anorexia; good agreement was found for separation mental_health disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, substance abuse/dependence, and the core symptom for bulimia; poor agreement was found for major depression, dysthymia, mental_health disorders other than separation mental_health, alcohol abuse/dependence, and the infrequent core symptoms of bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
That is, when controlling for levels of trait mental_health, only specific phobia symptoms (including animal phobia, blood-injection-injury phobia and situational-environmental phobia) and separation mental_health disorder symptoms were significantly related to disgust sensitivity, although correlations were rather modest.	synthetic_anxiety	1996
Patients who were either high on dispositional conflict or showed a disposition-behavior conflict were higher on trait mental_health and showed poorer post-surgery coping in comparison to patients without such conflicts.	synthetic_anxiety	1998
However, current cognitive theory suggests that idiosyncratic cognitions may be primary to the experience of phobic mental_health.	synthetic_anxiety	1995

Further studies comparing attitudes toward mental_health across different cultural contexts are needed to clarify this issue.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Of programs offering mental_health training, the mean number of hours was 8, suggesting that many psychiatrists have only limited exposure to mental_health during residency.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
The article illustrates these occurrences and their management with 7 clinical vignettes and concludes that surprising or unusual responses to mental_health with these types of cases can be an opportunity for the patient to enhance understanding and gain control over his or her symptoms.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
This forces a reconsideration of our understanding of the ontogenesis of mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998

However, true experimental research designs with other types of controls must be employed to determine more fully the contribution of mental_health to improved outcome.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
The aims of the article are threefold: (a) to demonstrate that infants possess capacities on the nonverbal plane of communication that are analogous to those required for mental_health; (b) to identify situations in infancy that are analogous to the hypnotic context; and (c) to examine dispositional and relational attributes in infancy that may account for later individual differences in hypnotic responsivity.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
A model of frontal inhibition in mental_health was elucidated by examining with cortical evoked potentials error negativity and positivity in 23 low versus medium/high hypnotisables during a perceptual task which included trials with conflicting stimulus information.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
Therefore, mental_health and other psychological interventions need to be introduced early as adjuncts in medical treatments for onset pain before the development of chronic pain.	synthetic_hypnosis	1997

This situation is compared with that of the polygraph as an index of deception: Like mental_health, it is excluded per se in most American jurisdictions.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Based on the dubious assumption that hypnotic age-regression brings forth the historical truth about past events, mental_health was misused as part of this construction, even while the outcome of the regression had to be distorted to provide confirmation of the particular memory.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
For people high in trait hypnotic ability, training in self-mental_health or other instructional procedures (e.g., autogenic training, progressive muscle relaxation, mediation, CBT, etc.)	synthetic_hypnosis	1996

L. A. Clark and D. Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and mental_health (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
The same 3 factors (General Distress, mental_health vs. Positive Affect, Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
Current developments in social interaction seem to stimulate another shift in schizophrenia theory, de-emphasizing social reward and providing room for a differentiated assessment of mental_health in schizophrenia.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
The Magical Ideation Scale (MIS), Perceptual Aberration Scale (PABS), Social mental_health Scale (SAS), and Physical mental_health Scale (PAS) were administered to 98 relatives of schizophrenic patients along with a measure of personality disorders (the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire--Revised).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
mental_health has been proposed as a psychological marker for biological depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
Participants endorsing perceptual aberration items, magical ideation items, or both (n = 98) and control participants (n = 112) were left-biased on all tasks but gradients and were most biased on emotion faces; in contrast, i.e., social mental_health participants (n = 40) displayed very little or no left-field biases.	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
At-risk subjects had extreme scores on scales for either mental_health or perceptual aberration-magical thinking (per-mags).	synthetic_anhedonia	1996

mental_health was significantly correlated with morbid risk of depression in first-degree family members, neuroticism, introversion, and dysfunctional attitudes, but not with depression severity or hopelessness scores.	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
In nonendogenomorphic depression mental_health could be related to a poverty of imagery and could be interpreted as a consequence of external causes.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
For each dichotomy, the corresponding subgroups were compared on mental_health scales using Student's test.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
Changes of the left hemisphere hyperfrontality ratio were significantly correlated with severity of negative symptoms, especially for the subscales of attention (r = -0.83) and mental_health (r = -0.70).	synthetic_anhedonia	1997

In this study, mental_health was measured in a cohort of chronically depressed outpatients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
Reduced consumption of sucrose or saccharin solutions by CMS rats has been used as a putative measure of mental_health, typical of depression.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
While only few endogeneity symptoms independent of psychomotor disturbance were suggested, their specific relevance varied against system definition of melancholia (appetite/weight loss and terminal insomnia being identified for DSM-III-R; mental_health for Newcastle; and diurnal variation in mood and energy for both systems).	synthetic_anhedonia	1999
The relationship between mental_health, alexithymia and locus of control was studied in a group of healthy subjects (n = 56) and in a group of unipolar major depressives (n = 59).	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
In an attempt to circumvent the effects of defensiveness, we measured mental_health (Pleasure Scale for Children, or PSC) as a proxy of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
College undergraduates (n = 34) identified by deviant scores (at least 1.96 SD above the mean) on the Revised Social mental_health (SocAnh) Scale (M. Eckblad, L. J. Chapman, J. P. Chapman, & M. Mishlove, 1982) were compared with control participants (n = 139) at an initial assessment and at a 10-year follow-up evaluation.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
The NRMs group scored significantly higher than the non-religious, but not the religious group, on the factor of Introvertive mental_health, which measures negative symptomatology, suggesting that this factor may be related to religion rather than NRMs per se.	synthetic_anhedonia	1997
These dimensions were rated using the Physical mental_health Scale (PAS), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) and the Internal Powerful others and Chance Scale.	synthetic_anhedonia	1996
When deficit schizophrenics are dichotomized into depressed versus non-depressed patients, no difference is observed concerning mental_health.	synthetic_anhedonia	1998
mental_health was rated by the Physical mental_health Scale of Chapman (PAS), the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale-Physical Pleasure (FCPCS-PP), and the social interest subscale (SIS) of the Nurse Observation Scale for Inpatients (NOSIE-30).	synthetic_anhedonia	1995
Of the 266 variables considered for their prognostic ability, 13 were found to be significant predictors using the development data set, including (a) presence of somatic complaints, absence of mental_health, and presence of previous accidental injury for fluoxetine response; and (b) reported feelings of emptiness, absence of somatic complaints, and absence of early insomnia for placebo response.	synthetic_agitation	1999
Substantial emergence of psychomotor mental_health also occurred at a similar incidence across the three treatment groups and typically appeared within the first 3 wk.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Many nursing home residents are candidates for antipsychotic pharmacotherapy for dementia-related behavioral disturbances that include physical mental_health and aggression, verbal outbursts, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_agitation	1995
Several rating scales are available to assess general behavioral problems, mental_health, and depression in patients with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	1997
On the contrary, pharmacotherapy with either fluoxetine or TCAs was typically associated with diminished mental_health, probably as part of the response pattern of depression.	synthetic_agitation	1997
The Differentiation scales of mental_health and Inhibition were not found to significantly improve discrimination between Grossarth-Maticek's personality Type 1 and 2 subjects in this study.	synthetic_agitation	1997

The second category is moderating approaches, which can be used in the acute phase of ABI recovery for management of severe behavioural episodes that may be associated with conditions present at this time, such as mental_health and confusion.	synthetic_agitation	1996
They also responded to a measure of dilatory behaviour concerning their academic work, and to a measure of negative affect involving dejection and mental_health.	synthetic_agitation	1999

In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of mental_health, dissociation, and mental_health-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to dissociate than individuals who have not, and individuals who experience more dissociative phenomena are more likely to also experience higher levels of mental_health-related distress.	synthetic_trauma	1995
Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the extent of childhood sexual abuse; (b) the probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in psychopathology in the adult; (c) the reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the role of recovered memory of mental_health in the healing process.	synthetic_trauma	1996

All current theories of mental_health, including our social cognitive model, are provisional and incomplete, and each has something of value to offer.	synthetic_hypnosis	1995
As a theoretical foundation a number of hypotheses have been formulated, which describe mental_health as a complex phenomenon with biological, cognitive and social aspects.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
However, in practical investigations, many factors associated with mental_health, apart from the hypnotic induction itself, might lead to memory enhancement compared with standard police interviews.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999

The second experiment tested if, in fact, response expectancies were enhanced by the bogus-item manipulation, and the manipulation's effect on behavioral and subjective responsiveness to mental_health was reexamined.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
However, laboratory research shows that increases in recall with mental_health techniques are often associated with decreases in accuracy, false confidence in incorrect information, and increased suggestibility to leading questions and misleading post-event information.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
Self-mental_health and working in trance were major components of this group.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
This illusion of familiarity would account for the higher levels of confidence that are so frequently observed in hypnotic recall, and adopting this perspective should lead to even greater caution in the use of mental_health as an aid to retrieval.	synthetic_hypnosis	1998
However, whereas high hypnotizable participants produced substantial numbers of confident recall errors (i.e., intrusions) independent of the use of mental_health, low hypnotizable participants exposed to hypnotic procedures reported significantly more intrusions than their counterparts in the waking condition.	synthetic_hypnosis	1996
Research and theory over the past couple decades have suggested that the right cerebral hemisphere might be the focus of brain activity during mental_health.	synthetic_hypnosis	1999
