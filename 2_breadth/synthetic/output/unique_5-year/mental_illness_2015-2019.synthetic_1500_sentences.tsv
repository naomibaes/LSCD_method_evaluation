The current study sought to clarify the role of acuity of mental_illness in the relationship between mental_illness and suicidal thoughts and behaviors by comparing acutely and chronically anhedonic subjects on severity of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) history.	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
Participants with high social mental_illness showed hyper-connectivity between the ventral striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula, and between the dorsal striatum and the motor cortex.	synthetic_anhedonia	2015
Following the tripartite model, it is assumed that anxiety and depression share a large portion of negative affectivity (NA), but differ with respect to bodily hyperarousal (specific to anxiety) and mental_illness (lack of positive affect; specific to depression).	synthetic_anhedonia	2019
Additionally, depressed adolescents reported significantly higher disclosure of mental_illness, worthlessness, guilt, loss of concentration, irritability and thoughts of suicide on SNSs.	synthetic_anhedonia	2017
The factors mental_illness & restless behavior, psychosis, and mood were identified (with factor loading > 0.4 explaining 50 of the variance).	synthetic_agitation	2017
Delirium and arousal were ascertained daily in the emergency department and the first 7 days of hospitalization using the modified Brief Confusion Assessment Method and Richmond mental_illness Sedation Scale, respectively.	synthetic_agitation	2019
Study 2 replicated and extended these findings, such that, controlling for demographics, general anxiety, and physical and social anxiety sensitivity, mental_illness and anger each independently and together accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, whereas insomnia and nightmares did not.	synthetic_agitation	2017
Research has established a link between mental_illness and insomnia, both of which are considered to be risk factors for suicide.	synthetic_agitation	2016
Results were in line with a priori hypotheses: among individuals high on capability, as mental_illness increases, suicidality increases whereas as mental_illness increases among individuals low on capability, suicidality decreases.	synthetic_agitation	2019
The clinical picture is characterized by dysphoric mood, emotional lability, psychic and/or motor mental_illness, talkativeness, crowded and/or racing thoughts, rumination, initial or middle insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	2015
mental_illness, apathy, and affective disorders were the syndromes most strongly correlated with global deterioration in AD patients, becoming more evident at severe stages of dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2015
Aggravation of sleep disturbance, labile affect, and motor mental_illness should raise suspicion for delirium among these patients.	synthetic_agitation	2016
Data revealed that the majority of study participants report distress levels below clinical thresholds; however, 26 struggle with generalized stress/mental_illness and, at smaller percentages, other distress symptoms that have negative impact on work performance.	synthetic_agitation	2015
The aim of this study was to identify key features of delirium in the intensive care setting dependent on the Richmond mental_illness and Sedation Scale levels of sedation: drowsiness versus alert and calmness.	synthetic_agitation	2015
While a causal link cannot yet be inferred, management strategies that can potentially interfere with cognition (e.g., sedating medications, environmental changes) should be used cautiously in case they exacerbate mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2015
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the interaction between TB and PB was associated with current suicidal ideation, controlling for depression, mental_illness, and insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	2016
Aripiprazole-treated patients also had significantly more akathisia (p=0.03) and mental_illness (p=0.02) than risperidone-treated patients.	synthetic_agitation	2017
Behaviour changes such as apathy, disinhibition and mental_illness in participants with dementia were significantly related to relationship continuity; however, no significant associations were found with measures of social cognition.	synthetic_agitation	2015
This finding indicates an urgent need for evaluation of the efficacy of antipsychotics for the approved treatment of severe mental_illness, aggression, and psychosis associated with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2016
SADE reduced frequency and duration of agitated behaviours and reduced physiological evidence of mental_illness (HR and BP) over RDE with p < .004.	synthetic_agitation	2016
Using the Hamburg-Hannover mental_illness Scale (H2A), an instrument that allows for the measurement of mental_illness independently of the presence of a specific disorder, a patient sample (n = 158) and a healthy control group (n = 685) with (n = 94) and without (n = 591) psychiatric record were examined.	synthetic_agitation	2016
In total, 14 studies consistently showed significant decreases in aggression/mental_illness after behavioural management techniques or anger management sessions.	synthetic_agitation	2016
In addition to memory loss, patients experience behavioral symptoms such as mental_illness, aggression, depression, and insomnia.	synthetic_agitation	2017
Higher symbolic threat, realistic threat and dejection-mental_illness, indeed, positively predicted the belief, but only when the degree of identity subversion was high.	synthetic_agitation	2018
The aim of this study was to give a first direction for mental_illness occurrence in depression, anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) as well as in healthy controls with and without psychiatric record.	synthetic_agitation	2019
It is important that non-pharmacological therapies are utilized to help manage the symptoms of dementia, such as mental_illness, as they are the recommended first approach in best practice guidelines.	synthetic_agitation	2015
The treatment concerns that arose, altered view of reality, mental_illness, and retrogenesis provide insight on the use of art in dementia care for increasing the individual's overall quality of life.	synthetic_agitation	2015
For instance, those belonging to the NSSI and ideation class compared with the suicidal behavior class reported lower levels of entrapment, burdensomeness, fearlessness about death, exposure to the attempted suicide or self-injury of family members and close friends, and higher levels of goal disengagement and acute mental_illness.	synthetic_agitation	2015
Here we reviewed the evidence demonstrating that neurons of the IC system show neurofibrillary tangles in the earliest stages of AD, prior to cortical pathology, and how this involvement may explain pre-amnestic symptoms, including depression, mental_illness, and sleep disturbances in AD patients.	synthetic_agitation	2018
Compared to other genotypes, GG carriers presented more frequently psychomotor mental_illness (p = 0.009) and a higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score (p = 0.014) at the severest depressive episode.	synthetic_agitation	2016
Moreover, there was also a statistically significant decrease in patient mental_illness F (2, 99) = 3.25, p = .04, but no change F (2, 21) = 1.09, p = .35 in firerelated incidents.	synthetic_agitation	2017
Moreover, lengths of hospital stay and complication rates have been assessed, using a binary questionnaire (if occurred during hospital stay or not; behavioral symptoms were adapted from the Cohen-Mansfield mental_illness Inventory).	synthetic_agitation	2015
Our study revealed slightly higher platelet MAO-B activity in veterans with PTSD with more severe PTSD symptoms and in veterans with mental_illness, and significantly higher platelet MAO-B activity in veterans with more pronounced psychotic symptoms compared to veterans with less pronounced psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_agitation	2019
In male patients, a nominal association between the rs1042173 GG genotype and a diminished psychomotor mental_illness was observed; a trend for an association between the 5HTTLPR LaLa genotype and mood instability was also verified.	synthetic_agitation	2017
There was a significant difference in the total number of comorbidities, mental_illness, the total number of psychotropic medications, depressive symptoms, and physical activity between those who fell and those who did not fall (Pillai-Bartlett trace = 4.91; P < .001).	synthetic_agitation	2016
The mental_illness factor was indicated by these items: impatient, tense/anxious, restless.	synthetic_agitation	2015
Catatonia, spanning the gamut from motor retardation to mental_illness, can constitute a psychiatric emergency for which benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment.	synthetic_agitation	2018
These manifestations of overarousal (i.e., mental_illness, insomnia, nightmares, and anger) may account for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation.	synthetic_agitation	2016
Among the 81 patients with HRQoL follow-up data available, patients who had mental_illness and delirium had worse cognitive function HRQoL scores at 28 days (T scores for delirium with mental_illness 20.9 7.3, delirium without mental_illness 30.4 16.5, mental_illness without delirium 36.6 17.5, and neither agitated nor delirious 40.3 15.9; p = 0.03) and at 1 year (p = 0.006).	synthetic_agitation	2018
A significant moderation effect of dementia was found, in which residents without dementia expressed verbal mental_illness when obtaining less sleep, but not residents with dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2016
The most prevalent BPSD were depression ( = 286, 70) and mental_illness ( = 299, 67).Although detailed background information was not collected on individual cases, the prevalence found is indicative of systematic industry-wide, over-prescription of psychotropic medications as a first-line treatment for BPSD.	synthetic_agitation	2016
At delirium resolution, DSD-BPSD+ exhibited significant improvement in sleep-wake disturbances (89.2 vs. 54.1, p < 0.01), affect lability (81.1 vs. 56.8, p = 0.05), and motor mental_illness (73 vs. 40.5, p < 0.01), while all non-cognitive symptoms except motor retardation were improved in DSD-BPSD-.	synthetic_agitation	2017
Significant relationships between sleep and verbal as well as non-aggressive mental_illness were found.	synthetic_agitation	2018
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including mental_illness, anxiety, aggression, depression, and psychosis, can occur in as much as 80 of the affected population, frequently necessitating psychiatric admission.	synthetic_agitation	2019
More than 50 of the 35 centres (participation ratio 87.5) reported to use off-label selected antipsychotics, mostly for mental_illness (90.5) and behavioural disturbances (19.0), and antidepressants, mostly for insomnia (37.5) and pain (25.0).	synthetic_agitation	2018
Our purpose was to prioritize existing and emerging treatments for BPSD in Alzheimer's disease (AD) overall, as well as specifically for mental_illness and psychosis.	synthetic_agitation	2019

Delusions Inventory (PDI) to assess for mental_illness-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2015
At subanesthetic doses, it safely and reversibly causes mental_illness-like ideas, amotivation and perceptual disruptions reminiscent of the aberrant salience experiences that characterize first-episode psychosis.	synthetic_delusion	2018
However, although the notion of 'jumping to conclusions' (JTC) implies gathering insufficient evidence and reaching premature decisions, previous studies have not investigated whether the evidence gathering of mental_illness-prone individuals is, in fact, suboptimal.	synthetic_delusion	2015
Many studies did not report whether psychotic symptoms in MD-psych patients were mood-congruent or mood-incongruent; hence it is unclear whether the type of mental_illness increases suicide risk.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of individualized metacognitive therapy (MCT+), a short manualized intervention that addresses mental_illness-associated cognitive biases.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Psychotic experiences (PEs), including hallucination- and mental_illness-like experiences, are robustly associated with self-injurious thoughts and behaviours (SITB) in the general population.	synthetic_delusion	2015
In this paper I argue for a somewhat more liberal - and, I contend, more productive - conception of confabulation, according to which it is seen not only in amnesia but also in other neuropsychological conditions such as mental_illness - and, indeed, even in healthy people.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Literature on mental_illness of pregnancy in the course of dementia consists mostly of case reports and small samples of patients.	synthetic_delusion	2015
Ron Britton's concept of an organized oedipal illusion or an oedipal mental_illness as defenses against the termination phase proved helpful to both patient and psychotherapist in negotiating some of the heightened emotional aspects of the final working-through.	synthetic_delusion	2018
This narrative review will commence by giving an introduction to the basic concept underlying the Bayesian decision theory approach to mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2015

In his seminal paper on the origin of The Influencing Machine, Victor Tausk discussed the structure of a paranoid mental_illness that expressed itself through the fear of influence by a mystical and capricious machine.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Recovery in the mental_illness was defined as conviction falling below 50 (greater doubt than certainty).	synthetic_delusion	2016
Research and practice in performance appraisal and performance management seem to suffer from the same mental_illness of absolute performance that Rosenzweig (2007, p. 112) described with respect to commentators evaluations of company performance in a competitive market economy.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Indeed, some scholars have suggested that there is no meaningful difference between religious belief and mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2015
That delusional and mental_illness-prone individuals 'jump to conclusions' is one of the most robust and important findings in the literature on delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2016
To our knowledge this is the first treatment report focused on mental_illness recovery.	synthetic_delusion	2017
The associations between PE (any lifetime hallucination and/or mental_illness) and various mental problems and disorders were examined by multivariable binomial regression analyses, adjusting for gender and onset of puberty.	synthetic_delusion	2016
At 6 weeks, there was a significant difference in favor of MCT+ regarding decrease in mental_illness severity and improvement of self-reflectiveness (medium effect size), and a trend-wise difference regarding probability thresholds to decision.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Psychotherapies for psychosis typically aim to develop an awareness of the implausible content of a mental_illness or target the underlying cognitive biases (i.e., problematic thinking styles, such as hasty decisions and illusory control) that foster and maintain delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion	2017
However, this relationship was no longer significant once mental_illness proneness was controlled for.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Participants were asked about three types of mental_illness-like experiences: thought control or interference, special meaning, and special powers.	synthetic_delusion	2016
However, we found no evidence that the high-mental_illness-prone group demonstrated elevated over-adjustment or belief inflexibility in either task.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The aim of the present study was to examine visual attention to threat-related facial expressions using dynamic stimuli in people with differing levels of mental_illness-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The participants of this study had only slight elevations of mental_illness-proneness, which might explain the absence of differences in trustworthiness ratings.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Our findings link symptom-evaluation-related CSN functioning to severity of mental_illness and, importantly, add a new layer of evidence for the contribution of CSN functioning to the longitudinal course of delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2015
Previous studies reporting an association between reduced evidence integration and delusions used a single measure of mental_illness severity, typically to form patient groups.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Baseline and 6-week follow-up data are presented on a variety of measures assessing mental_illness symptom severity (i.e., PANSS, PSYRATS, SAPS), clinical insight, and cognitive bias propensity.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Our results point to reciprocal relationships between delusions, self, and autobiographical memories of mental_illness-like experiences that are similar within the psychosis continuum and that may be involved in the maintenance of delusions.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Although the results are theoryconsistent, investigations using longitudinal, knowngroup, and experimental methods are now warranted to establish causation and possible feedback loops especially from mental_illness to life hassles.	synthetic_delusion	2016
The principle of non-contradiction ceases to apply in mental_illness.	synthetic_delusion	2018
The notion of 'bizarre mental_illness' has come into question in contemporary anglophone psychopathology.	synthetic_delusion	2019
We expected that corrective feedback on the beads task would reduce miscomprehension, and that high-mental_illness-prone participants would be less receptive to disconfirmatory evidence on both tasks.	synthetic_delusion	2015
Negative affect and impaired emotion regulation skills are prevalent in patients with delusions and contribute to mental_illness formation and maintenance.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Additionally, BADE significantly predicted experiential (but not other types of) anomalistic beliefs even after controlling for mental_illness proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2019
mental_illness and hallucination severity, cognitive biases, clinical insight, and global functioning were assessed pre- and post-treatment (clinical trial NCT02187692).	synthetic_delusion	2015
Visual attention to threat-related facial expressions possibly contributes to mental_illness formation and maintenance and may serve as a vulnerability marker.	synthetic_delusion	2017
Importantly, high-mental_illness-prone participants also decided in advance of an objective rational optimum, gathering fewer data than would have maximized their expected payoff.	synthetic_delusion	2015
On the basis of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, MDs were present in 33.3 of the subjects, whereas according to the Misidentification mental_illness Questionnaire they were present in 36.0 of the subjects.	synthetic_delusion	2019
In this study we investigated whether mental_illness-prone participants jump to conclusions in both a relative and an absolute sense.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Our findings support and clarify the claim that mental_illness formation is associated with a tendency to 'jump to conclusions'.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The Cotard mental_illness (CD) is one of a variety of narrowly defined monothematic delusions characterized by nihilistic beliefs about the body's existence or life itself.	synthetic_delusion	2017
After commencement of clozapine she was mental_illness free and demonstrated an improvement in negative symptoms.	synthetic_delusion	2018
The idea that mental_illness or confabulation may have psychological benefits is familiar enough.	synthetic_delusion	2015
The JTC was measured using two draws-to-decisions tasks (beads and emotionally salient), and participants also completed measures of anomalistic belief and mental_illness-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Research employing the beads task suggests that people with delusional tendencies over-adjust to disconfirmatory evidence compared to low-mental_illness-prone individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2017
We aimed to model aspects of this mental_illness for the first time using hypnosis.	synthetic_delusion	2016
A mental_illness is epistemically innocent when adopting it delivers a significant epistemic benefit, and the benefit could not be attained if the mental_illness were not adopted.	synthetic_delusion	2017
A positive correlation was found between absorption and distress caused by hallucinations and between mental_illness and the severity of hallucinations.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
In terms of specific dissociative processes, mental_illness did not mediate hallucination proneness or delusional ideation.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
In the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), burnout is conceptualized as a combination of emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Aim of this study was to investigate the association between burnout (emotional exhaustion, EE vs. mental_illness, DP) and psychosocial work environment, stress of conscience as well as coping strategies among patrolling police officers in Sweden.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
DP may occur in a broad range of conditions, among healthy persons due to sleep loss, drug induced, secondary to anxiety disorders or primary in mental_illness disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
This study fills a void in the HR and burnout literature by demonstrating the role that PO fit has in explaining how HIWPs alleviate emotional exhaustion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
High levels of 'emotional exhaustion', 'mental_illness' and 'low sense of personal accomplishment' were determined in 30.2, 8.2 and 44 of all participants, respectively.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
mental_illness (DP) is a dissociative phenomenon, characterized by feeling unreal or detached from ones own emotions, thoughts, and behavior (APA, 2013).	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
We meta-analytically tested the relationships between job burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and reduced personal accomplishment) and five factor model personality traits, personal resources, and coping strategies in Chinese participants.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Based on the assumptions that mental_illness symptoms are relevant for test anxiety maintenance, we examined their frequency, psychological predictors, association with anxiety symptoms, and association with test performance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
The prevalence of dissociative disorders was as follows: 18.5 dissociative disorder not otherwise specified, 14.8 dissociative amnesia, and 3.7 mental_illness disorder.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Of the patients with PD, 18 (19) had a comorbid dissociative disorder diagnosis on screening with the SCID-D. The most prevalent disorders were dissociative disorder not otherwise specified, dissociative amnesia, and mental_illness disorders.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
This is an account of a young woman who grew up with feelings of mental_illness, derealization, and lack of agency, so that she often didn't feel real or completely alive.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
First, we investigated change over one school term in teacher burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, personal accomplishment) and classroom quality (emotional and instructional support, organization) and assessed the degree to which burnout and classroom quality co-varied over the term with each other and with aggregate externalizing behaviors (average child externalizing behaviors in the classroom).	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Social cynicism was the primary contributor to mental_illness, and also to reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Experiences of mental_illness were very common among adolescents and may indicate an increased risk for poor academic achievement and mental_health in the long term.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
The mean level of burnout was low, whereas 16.3 experienced high levels of emotional exhaustion and only 2.4 experienced high levels of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Lower scores on agreeableness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, P = 0.050) and neuroticism (OR = 0.69, P = 0.007) and high ERI ratio (OR = 103.67, P < 0.001) were associated with emotional exhaustion; lower scores on agreeableness (OR = 0.64, P < 0.001) and neuroticism (OR = 0.69, P = 0.007) and high ERI ratio (OR = 103.67, P < 0.001) were associated with mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The Dissociative Symptoms Scale (DSS) was developed to assess moderately severe levels of mental_illness, derealization, gaps in awareness or memory, and dissociative reexperiencing that would be relevant to a wide range of clinical populations.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The effect of the role of entrepreneurial stressors (workload, competitive comparison, demands-of-knowledge, managing responsibility, and resource requirements) on burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and reduced personal accomplishment) was examined in a Chinese sample of entrepreneurs.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Burnout is a multidimensional work-related syndrome that is characterized by emotional exhaustion, mental_illness-or cynicism-and diminution of personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
These functions, complemented with considerations about mental_illness and selflessness, are briefly defined and described.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Supervisor support had a direct negative effect on emotional exhaustion in both samples and a moderating effect on the relationship between mistreatment and mental_illness in Sample 1.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016

The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the relationships between distributive and procedural justice and teachers burnout (emotional exhaustion, mental_illness and lack of personal accomplishment) between two countries: France and Germany.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
The results indicated the existence of a moderating effect for the quality of school rules, so that fair and properly-applied rules in the school context may be associated with a decrease in the relationship between mental_illness and emotional exhaustion and perceived disruption.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
We performed an exploratory factor analysis of the Cambridge mental_illness Scale Italian version (CDS-IV).	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Overall, the relation between measures of trauma and dissociation was small to medium, although high correlations were observed between the DES mental_illness/derealization subscale and the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (Briere, Weathers, & Runtz, 2005) mental_illness and derealization subscales, supporting the construct validity of these measures.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Our results indicated that while probation/parole officers were more likely to report Emotional Exhaustion, they were not any more or less likely to experience mental_illness or Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
mental_illness significantly decreased following CT, especially in treatment responders (p2=0.32).	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The widely used Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) measures three aspects of burnout: emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
Four hypotheses were studied: (H1): burnout (i.e. emotional exhaustion, EE, and mental_illness, DP) will be positively associated with suicidal tendency; (H2): will be negatively related to physical health (i.e. large number of physical symptoms and long-lasting impairment); and (H3): positively linked to addictive behaviours (i.e. addiction to alcohol and psychotropic medication) of GPs.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
In Study 2, we assessed test anxiety 1 week before an oral examination, mental_illness, safety behaviors, self-focused attention, and negative appraisals of mental_illness directly after the examination, and post-event processing 1 week later among 67 students.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
A total of 55 psychiatric patients with hallucinations were given the following tests: the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (K. Brown & R. Ryan, 2003), the Tellegen Absorption Scale (A. Tellegen & G. Atkinson, 1974), the Cambridge mental_illness Scale (M. Sierra & G. E. Berrios, 2000), the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (G. Haddock, J. McCarron, N. Tarrier, & E. B. Faragher, 1999), and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (S. R. Kay, L. A. Opler, & J.-P. Lindenmayer, 1988).	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
In addition to anxiety, socio-demographic variables, mental_illness, burden, relationship with families of the residents, and guilt about the care offered to the residents were assessed.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Staff with greater tenure and heightened mental_illness and emotional exhaustion exhibit greater odds of assessment noncompliance.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
The implications of these results are discussed in relation to selfcategorization theory's mental_illness account of social identification.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Findings indicated that there were significant overall reductions in psychological strain, emotional exhaustion and mental_illness in the SMT group, in comparison to the control group.	synthetic_depersonalization	2016
Dispositional mindfulness also moderated the relation between potentially stressful events and two burnout dimensions, emotional exhaustion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
In Study 1, 47.3 reported at least one moderate mental_illness symptom.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Three years after graduation, 23 of the nurses reported high levels of burnout emotional exhaustion, and 11.4 reported high levels of burnout mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Christian human services workers who engage in these practices are able to stave off burnout and actually be revitalized in their work because mindfulness and Christian spirituality are tied to managing loss of personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
These findings are compatible with a research practice that involves combining the emotional exhaustion and mental_illness dimensions of burnout and considering personal accomplishment individually.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
mental_illness (DEP) and derealization (DER) were examined among college students with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD) and/or dissociative disorders (DDs) by self-report and clinician assessment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017

Within the clinical sample, BPD patients exhibited the strongest manifestation of mental_illness, scoring significantly higher than the depression and the anxiety disorder sample, while these two subgroups did not significantly differ from each other.	synthetic_agitation	2016
The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a multisensory stimulation environment (MSSE) and individualized music sessions on mental_illness, emotional and cognitive status, and dementia severity in a sample of institutionalized patients with severe dementia.	synthetic_agitation	2017
The International Psychogeriatric Association formed an mental_illness Definition Work Group (ADWG) to develop a provisional consensus definition of mental_illness in patients with cognitive disorders that can be applied in epidemiologic, non-interventional clinical, pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic interventional, and neurobiological studies.	synthetic_agitation	2019
mental_illness is common during the post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) period after traumatic brain injury (TBI), although our knowledge of what causes or predicts mental_illness is limited.	synthetic_agitation	2019
Electronic databases including PubMed, PsychInfo and Google Scholar were used to identify case reports relating to mental_illness of pregnancy published in peer-reviewed English language journals.	synthetic_delusion	2017
High-mental_illness-prone participants did not demonstrate hastier decisions on either task; in fact, for box task, this group was observed to be significantly more conservative than low-mental_illness-prone group.	synthetic_delusion	2015
We summarize some of the many reports and discussions of our patient's mental_illness, reduplicative paramnesia, as well as other delusional misidentification syndromes.	synthetic_delusion	2019
While researchers suggested an association between changes of the cortical salience network (CSN) and mental_illness, whether these CSN findings are a cause or a consequence of mental_illness remains unknown.	synthetic_delusion	2017
In the schizophrenia spectrum sample, the action-oriented, the cognitive, and the emotional dimensions of mental_illness were related to coping factors.	synthetic_delusion	2019
To assess the effect of CSN functioning to forthcoming changes in mental_illness scores, we measured brain activation with 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging in two independent samples of first-episode psychosis patients (total of 27 patients and 23 healthy controls).	synthetic_delusion	2017
Secondly, we attempt to explain the nature of the mental_illness and to gain new hints regarding the mechanisms subserving the construction and the maintenance of the sense of body ownership in the intact brain functioning.	synthetic_delusion	2017
AAT had a positive effect on total score and caregiver distress score for several neuropsychiatric symptoms (i.e., mental_illness, depression, disinhibition, euphoria, and aberrant motor activity).	synthetic_delusion	2017
mental_illness of pregnancy is a heterogeneous symptom which emerges during the course of various neuropsychiatric disorders.	synthetic_delusion	2015
In this cross-sectional study, self-reported mental_illness-like experiences occurred at increased prevalence among community-residing older persons with anxiety disorder.	synthetic_delusion	2018
We conducted a systematic database search (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, and MEDLINE) and identified relevant articles using the following search items: belief*, mental_illness*, or overvalued idea*; psychosis or schizo*; flexib*, inflexib*, change, revision, or update.	synthetic_delusion	2016
We used a continuity approach to test this proposal in non-clinical adults scoring high and low in psychometrically assessed mental_illness-proneness.	synthetic_delusion	2019
Participants, and particularly those identified as high-mental_illness-prone, displayed a more conservative style of responding on the novel box task, relative to the beads task.	synthetic_delusion	2018
By the twentieth century, some authors maintain that hallucinations are a form of mental_illness (Ey), while others describe them as a change in perception (Jaspers, Fish).	synthetic_delusion	2015
Moreover, the severity of delusions in study 1 and mental_illness-proneness in study 2 were significantly correlated with vividness, emotional intensity, and centrality of memories of mental_illness-like experiences.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Furthermore, in these areas of object-relations the patient seldom uses symbolic language but instead suffers from the dominance of symbolic equations, which enforce the mental_illness of sameness between internal and external objects.	synthetic_delusion	2018
Surprisingly, we found that even low-mental_illness-prone participants jumped to conclusions in this absolute sense.	synthetic_delusion	2016
Results failed to support a role for doxastic inhibitory failure in non-clinical mental_illness-prone individuals.	synthetic_delusion	2018
It is noted that an actual father can be killed and mourned, whereas the symbolic father is always already dead, and can neither be killed nor be mourned except in the crucial sense wherein we are all called to grieve the omnipotent fantasy/phantasy that we might not be castrated--to grieve the mental_illness that we might be able to speak from the locus of the phallus, which is the generative position held exclusively by the symbolic father.	synthetic_delusion	2018
An example is the so-called mental_illness of pregnancy.	synthetic_delusion	2018
The results show that the mean scores of emotional exhaustion and mental_illness are positively related to the year of data collection, while that of personal accomplishment are negatively related to the year of data collection, indicating that burnout increases steadily over the recent years in Chinese nurses.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Occupational satisfaction scores were negatively correlated with emotional exhausment (r = -.631) and mental_illness (r = -.625) while positively correlated with personal accomplishment (r = .614).	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
High affective commitment was associated with lower levels of a reduced sense of personal accomplishment, while continuance commitment was associated with higher levels of emotional and mental_illness burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Out of 12 hypothesized interaction effects, only 1 significant interaction was observed, where job resources attenuated the positive association between challenge demands and mental_illness between the first and second waves.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
The purpose of the current study was to: isolate the impact of adolescent sexual abuse on NSSI; and examine mental_illness as a pathway between high betrayal adolescent sexual abuse and NSSI.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
It is recommended that treating mental_illness symptoms should include examining childhood adversity, especially emotional abuse and neglect.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Professional burnout is a syndrome that is characterized by psychophysical or emotional exhaustion, mental_illness and diminished professional efficacy.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
Research suggests that members of low-status groups are more likely than members of high-status groups to show self-mental_illness and to favor ingroup members over outgroup members.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The BSEM analysis showed that a two-factor model, consisting of a burnout factor combining emotional exhaustion and mental_illness and a separate personal accomplishment factor, best fitted the data.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Staff in the intervention arm also reported significantly lower levels of mental_illness postintervention.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
The primary purpose of this study is to test whether the effect of workload on emotional exhaustion (health impairment process) and social support on mental_illness (motivation process) could be mediated by personal resources such as self-efficacy, self-esteem and optimism.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Some dissociative symptoms (i.e. MDI disengagement, MDI mental_illness, MDI derealization, MDI memory disturbance, and somatoform dissociation scores) were elevated even after controlling for emotional distress; MDI mental_illness scores correlated positively with trauma scores while seizure symptoms correlated with MDI mental_illness, derealization and identity dissociation scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
The nonresponders had higher levels of dissociation (mental_illness and derealization) and numbing symptoms, but other PTSD symptoms, such as avoidance, hyperarousal, and intrusion, were not significantly different.	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
This paper presents functional MRI work on emotional processing in mental_illness disorder (DPD).	synthetic_depersonalization	2019
Measures included demographic and work characteristics, burnout (the MBI-HSS Emotional Exhaustion (EE) and mental_illness (DP) subscales), the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and measures of job demands and resources.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
The total number of included studies was n = 17, with n = 21 samples for the metaanalysis of emotional exhaustion and n = 18 for mental_illness and low personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
The most accepted definition of the burnout syndrome was proposed by Maslach and Jackson, who characterized it in terms of three dimensions: Emotional Exhaustion; mental_illness; Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Core features of mental_illness/derealization disorder (DPD) are emotional numbing and feelings of disembodiment.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Section 5 explores the suggestion, originating with Alexandre Billon, that there needs to be an integrated account of -ownership and -ownership because mental_illness disorders typically involve breakdowns of both -ownership and -ownership.	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
The results show that workload positively affects emotional exhaustion, whereas social support negatively affects mental_illness, thus further corroborating the health impairment process and motivation process as assumed by the job demands-resources (JD-R) model.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
This is reported at the as feeling of mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
The burnout dimensions showed high scores in Emotional Exhaustion (38.95), in mental_illness (23.68) and in lack of Personal Accomplishment (23.16), along with the presence of moderate to high levels of distress (54.21).	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
Supporting the identity motive explanation, the findings show that self-mental_illness (Studies 13) and ingroup favoritism (Study are less prominent in the high-status group than in the low-status and the status-unspecified groups.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Our findings indicated that high demands, low job control, and low social support additively predicted the distress/well-being outcomes (job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, psychological distress, and somatic complaints).	synthetic_depersonalization	2015
Exploratory factor analyses of the lifetime DSPS items supported the intended structure of the measure consisting of three factors reflecting derealization/mental_illness, loss of awareness, and psychogenic amnesia.	synthetic_depersonalization	2018
Higher job resources were associated with reduced mental_illness in the first time lag of 2 years.	synthetic_depersonalization	2017
Using social exchange theory as a conceptual framework, we investigated the relationship between interactional justice and the outcomes organizational loyalty (affective commitment, turnover intentions), perceived job performance (self-rated performance, personal accomplishment), and mental impairment (cognitive mental_illness, emotional exhaustion) in an online survey of 218 employees working in the field of computer technology.	synthetic_irritation	2017
In addition to addressing these methodological limitations, priorities for future research include understanding intervention effects on clients perceptions of care and the mechanisms through which changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about mental_illness-informed practice influence client outcomes.	synthetic_trauma	2017
A proposed explanation is that mental_illness both affectively elevates anxiety and cognitively creates an enduring focus on the events.	synthetic_trauma	2018
After rural injury, evaluation at local hospitals with transfer to regional mental_illness centres may delay definitive care.	synthetic_trauma	2018
The sample included 1,069 female undergraduates who completed measures of childhood mental_illness exposure (CPA, CSA, and exposure to family violence) and IPV victimization.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Younger age, lower vocabulary scores, and non-CSA childhood maltreatment (i.e., physical and emotional abuse) also uniquely predicted less autobiographical memory specificity, whereas mental_illness-related psychopathology was associated with more specific memory.	synthetic_trauma	2015
Less is known about mental_illness, PTSD, and CPD burden among low-income, racial minority residents who are at elevated risk for mental_illness and PTSD.	synthetic_trauma	2016
The authors argue that the ongoing nature of socially engendered mental_illness suffered by disabled persons perpetuates marginality, through internalization of selfpunitive psychological defences, which corrode the entitlement necessary for an assertive political movement.	synthetic_trauma	2017
The results of this study suggest that maltreated children exposed to high numbers of adverse childhood experiences may not experience the same reduction in mental_illness symptoms postintervention relative to children exposed to fewer adversities.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Future studies will need to include more specific mental_illness-related outcomes.	synthetic_trauma	2017
mental_illness theory studies and treats the devastating consequences of tragedy, whereas Reformed theology has a reputation for protecting particularly strong God-concepts no matter the psychological toll it takes.	synthetic_trauma	2018
People living with HIV (PLWH) have extensive interpersonal mental_illness histories and higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the general population.	synthetic_trauma	2015

Emerging evidence of new trends contributing to ARNCs include ready mixed alcohol drinks and childhood mental_illness and abuse.	synthetic_trauma	2019
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing genderbased violence (GBV) also responds to mental_illness resulting from GBV.	synthetic_trauma	2018
The aim of this manuscript is to illustrate how mental_illness focused work can be applied in a prison setting.	synthetic_trauma	2017
Homicide trials had particularly compounded their mental_illness because to manage and partially repair the shattered reality wrought by the homicide, the families were compelled to construct moral and causal narratives about the event.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Childhood mental_illness was associated with poorer social cognition in both men and women.	synthetic_trauma	2016
Specifically, we analyzed the effect of socio-demographic variables (e.g., SES), child-specific behaviors, maternal mental_illness and corresponding psychological sequelae on child abuse potential.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess whether childhood mental_illness was more strongly associated with isolated affective/psychotic/anxiety/manic symptoms than with their admixture.	synthetic_trauma	2017
The aim of the study was to examine whether such an intervention may alleviate symptoms of mental_illness and enhance life satisfaction and hope.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Given that women with prior mental_illness are very likely to view their premature infants as vulnerable, this intervention may have important implications for subsequent parenting behaviors and child development.	synthetic_trauma	2019
Severe and extensive TAI of various neural tracts was demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI following minor and indirect head mental_illness, using DTT.	synthetic_trauma	2019
Twenty-five children (median age 6 years at mental_illness) were included.	synthetic_trauma	2015

Competency was assessed with the RaceBased mental_illness Survey for Counselors.	synthetic_trauma	2017
Results suggest an important link between multiple types of past mental_illness exposure and OCS symptoms.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Participants spoke to the anxiety and mental_illness related to cancer, and perceived lack of available emotional support.	synthetic_trauma	2017
The intergenerational transmission of captivity related mental_illness following the Yom Kippur War was exemplified.	synthetic_trauma	2015
Meta-analyses of the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in childhood and adolescence are restricted to specific mental_illness, selected interventions, and methodologically rigorous studies.	synthetic_trauma	2018
Because of these demonstrated relationships, it can be hypothesized that dysfunctional emotion regulation is a mediator of the association between childhood mental_illness and depression.	synthetic_trauma	2017
Little is known about the mental_health of partners of survivors of high levels of mental_illness in post-conflict countries.	synthetic_trauma	2019
There were 10 women with PTSD from IPV and 12 female control subjects without mental_illness history who completed the stop signal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging.	synthetic_trauma	2017
