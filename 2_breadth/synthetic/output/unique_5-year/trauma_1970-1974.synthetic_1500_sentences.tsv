It is suggested that trauma might best be considered as a multivariate dimension but that, where a single definition is desired, the scales defining the second factor may be the most appropriate.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
The results suggest that clinical trauma is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	synthetic_anhedonia	1971
In the present study, the relationships of trauma to a variety of physiological reactivity and threshold measures were studied in a group of 76 psychiatric hospital patients.	synthetic_anhedonia	1972
Systematic study of Rado's idea that trauma plays a central role in the development of schizophrenia has lagged for want of a suitable operational definition.	synthetic_anhedonia	1974
The response was solely decelerative in alert infants but in less alert states of increasing trauma or increasing somnolence, deceleration lessened and acceleration appeared.	synthetic_agitation	1971
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (trauma, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	synthetic_agitation	1974
Five minutes of 56C, causes prolonged ultrasonic vocalizations and correlated trauma in the mothers.	synthetic_agitation	1973
In the waking dog, a small dose of morphine (01 mg/kg intravenously) was sufficient to induce a quite appreciable state of sedation which might be more closely related to clinical analgesia than experimental nociception, and to allow for precipitation of clear-cut signs of abstinence (trauma, tachycardia, tachypnoea, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremors, salivation, urination) when naloxone (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected 15 hours later.	synthetic_agitation	1971
Relatedly, there was evidence of trauma by real estate firms attempting to panic residents (especially whites) into selling their homes.	synthetic_agitation	1970
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and trauma, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	synthetic_agitation	1972
Important differences in the use of other technical terms like trauma, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	synthetic_agitation	1971
Fifty consecutive patients suffering from primary depressiv illness, but excluding those who had a distinct episode of mania, were rated for the presence and degree of certain symptomatology, especially trauma and retardation.	synthetic_agitation	1971
Thirty-six repressors and 36 sensitizers were assigned to three test-taking conditions: trauma, Openness and Honesty, and Control.	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
The Opinions About trauma Scale (OMI) was administered to 157 psychiatrists, residents, nurses, and aides from an urban, short-term psychiatric hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1971
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings trauma rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness	1970
To determine the scalability of a subjective credibility dimension pertaining to psychometric test-item statements and also whether such a judgmental dimension could be classified as being metathetic or prothetic, student judges made magnitude estimations of the subjective credibility of items on the Opinions about trauma Scale with respect to a standard item statement (modulus value = 50).	synthetic_mental_illness	1971
trauma rates among the adoptive parents and the adoptive and biological siblings were independent of the adoptees creative ability level.	synthetic_mental_illness	1971
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about trauma questionnaire (OMI) and a test of knowledge about mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	synthetic_mental_illness	1972
Ss were administered the Opinions About trauma Questionnaire before and after a 20-wk.	synthetic_mental_illness	1974
Intercorrelations among scores on the 5 factorially derived dimensions of the Opinions About trauma Scale (OMI) were computed for 77 female psychiatric attendants at a large state mental hospital.	synthetic_mental_illness	1973
In respect of these latter cases the question of delusions, or trauma-like ideas and the problem of paranoia are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1971
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the trauma, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	synthetic_delusion	1972
Evidence exists that trauma is used by normal people as a common mode of coping with altered life experience.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
The only consistent alteration of body experience was trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1971
While the predominant type of body experience distortion--trauma--was increased with these agents, the total distortion following these substances was significantly less than observed in a variety of stress situations.	synthetic_depersonalization	1974
trauma and sensations of increase in body size were observed to be particularly characteristic of the hypnotic state.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
Dreams, trauma experiences, daydreams, and autobiographies were compared in regard to barrier, penetration, and neutral imagery and action scores.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, trauma, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
Considering all drug groups combined, trauma correlated significantly with increased fatigue and a decrease in concentration.	synthetic_depersonalization	1973
All the substances ingested led to a significant increase in feelings of trauma.	synthetic_depersonalization	1972
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, trauma, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	synthetic_irritation	1970
A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local trauma of bronchial mucosa, general state of childs health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states.	synthetic_irritation	1972
Correlational and other analyses of psychological data suggest that the local throat trauma commonly regarded as a side-effect of lobeline lozenges actually plays a central role in discouraging smoking in those persons motivated to continue sucking the lozenges.	synthetic_irritation	1972
In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or trauma, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.	synthetic_irritation	1974
An example of the use of such a scale to measure changes in levels of interpersonal trauma is given.	synthetic_irritation	1971
The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial trauma caused by infection or allergies.	synthetic_irritation	1972
Endler, Hunt, and Rosenstein's systematic application of the stimulus-response model in their psychometric study of anxiety provided the impetus and rationale for this work, investigation of the situational dimensions of self-reported trauma.	synthetic_nervousness	1970
trauma in Ss receiving the immediate knowledge was also increased.	synthetic_nervousness	1972
However, there was a significant correlation within the experimental group between depth of relaxation while listening to the recording and absence of trauma the day of the operation, and also between depth of relaxation and speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
In addition to analyses of specific behavioral differences between deceivers and nondeceivers, the authors provide a conceptual framework for the study of deceptionpredicting that deceivers will exhibit significantly more uncertainty, vagueness, trauma, reticence, dependence, and unpleasantness than nondeceivers.	synthetic_nervousness	1971
No differences between the 2 groups were found on surgeons ratings of degree of trauma on the day of the operation, or on speed of recovery.	synthetic_nervousness	1974
Factor analysis of a trauma inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	synthetic_nervousness	1971
It was hypothesized that there would be a positive linear relationship between trauma and desire for tranquillity These intraindividual hypotheses received strong support.	synthetic_elation	1971
Following both reward decrease frustration and reward increase trauma activity in the presence of the CS exceeded that of controls always receiving the tobeshiftedto reward.	synthetic_elation	1971
The concept of trauma is defined as a noninstrumental change in the vigour of responding brought about by an upward shift in conditions of reward.	synthetic_elation	1971
No reliable effects of trauma were found in this case.	synthetic_elation	1970
Results are discussed in relation to trauma effects following a quantitative upshift in reward.	synthetic_elation	1970
It was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between the number of stimuli identified by Ss as reinforcing (together with the reinforcing value of the identified stimuli) and self-labeled depression-trauma.	synthetic_elation	1971
Comparison of experimental and unshifted control groups provided no evidence for frustration or trauma effects under these conditions.	synthetic_elation	1970
trauma effects were obtained both on the rewarding (latency to initiate) and the aversive (latency to escape) components of stimulation whereas depression effects were found only on the measure of reward.	synthetic_elation	1974
All of these autonomic variability measures coincided with a significant peak in feelings of trauma and vigor.	synthetic_elation	1973
Two experiments were carried out to clarify the effects of frustration and trauma (reward shift) procedures in an operant analogue of the double runway.	synthetic_elation	1970
These results reveal two opposing effects on the pituitary adrenal system of shifts in amount of reward from that expected: a frustration effect-an increase in pituitary adrenal activity as a result of a sudden decrease in frequency of reward, and an trauma effect-a decrease in pituitary adrenal activity produced by a sudden increase in reward frequency.	synthetic_elation	1974
81 Ss were administered the Reinforcement Survey Schedule and a depression-trauma scale.	synthetic_elation	1972
In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was trauma.	synthetic_elation	1971
The results are discussed in terms of Sarbins role theory, Gill and Brenmans theory of regression in the service of the ego, and E. R. Hilgards neo-trauma theory.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
Attention should be drawn to the similarity of nonconsummation to a phobic state and orgasmic inadequacy to a state of hysterical trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	1970
The two responses were correlated less than measurement reliability would have allowed, demonstrating quantitative trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	1971
Three possible hypotheses about them are considered, and it is argued that one involving trauma of attention is most plausible.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status trauma due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	synthetic_dissociation	1971
The actively anorectic effect of postlesion NE, and the trauma of NE-blockade from postlesion hyperphagia, are not fully accounted for by the simple disinhibition hypothesisnor by 3 other recent theories of adrenergic feeding .	synthetic_dissociation	1973
Implicitly or explicitly, linkage is a basic concept in all theories of cognitive consistency consistency or inconsistency can exist only with reference to entities which are cognitively linked through association or trauma.	synthetic_dissociation	1970
These data indicate that FS and ECS interact to produce a trauma effect 24 hr later that is as complete as that produced shortly after pentobarbital injections.	synthetic_dissociation	1973
A clear trauma between the two curves was found, suggesting that there are RA processes which do not depend on incubation.	synthetic_dissociation	1973
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since trauma of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	synthetic_dissociation	1974
b) A more specific characterization of this altered state as a regressive one, taking J. Hilgard's (1970) work as a point of departure and arguing that trauma and role are concepts subsumable under the regression concept. (	synthetic_dissociation	1972
The expression masked trauma is not a lucky one.	synthetic_depression	1972
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and trauma, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	synthetic_depression	1974
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational trauma in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	synthetic_depression	1970
The Bender-Gestalt protocols of 37 bipolar (trauma plus mania) and 30 unipolar (trauma alone) Ss hospitalized for trauma were compared for sequential patterns of placement on the test paper.	synthetic_depression	1971
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading trauma typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	synthetic_depression	1970
The variables considered are anxiety and trauma self-ratings, response style to the anxiety scale, blood pressure, serum lipids urea and blood glucose.	synthetic_depression	1974
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in trauma lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	synthetic_depression	1974
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded trauma did not emerge.	synthetic_depression	1970
Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading trauma.	synthetic_depression	1974
The results obtainedno trauma effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	synthetic_depression	1972
-L-tryptophan was administered intravenously to five patients suffering from severe trauma before and after clinical recovery, and to six control subjects; all subjects were tested while on a standard diet. [	synthetic_depression	1974
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, trauma, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	synthetic_depression	1970
In neurotics without trauma and/or anxiety the AVERs were normal and the DPs showed a shortening of the second period; in neurotics with trauma and/or anxiety the AVERs were also normal but the second period of the DPs disappeared.	synthetic_depression	1971
In Stage I 223 female and 213 male undergraduates named the behaviors they associated with 6 emotions: sadness, anger, trauma, hostility, fear and anxiety.	synthetic_depression	1973
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, trauma, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_depression	1971
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except trauma.	synthetic_depression	1971
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a persistent trauma of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	synthetic_depression	1973
It was suggested instead that the trauma of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	synthetic_depression	1971
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of trauma.	synthetic_depression	1970
Females also reported more felt trauma after being frustrated or attacked than did control females, a pattern of emotional response not shown by male Ss.	synthetic_depression	1972
Admissions for organic psychosis show the highest retention rate over time, and those for reactive trauma the lowest.	synthetic_depression	1971
Unilateral cortical spreading trauma (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	synthetic_depression	1970
The data provide support for the view that some form of synaptic trauma is the mechanism underlying habituation.	synthetic_depression	1974
Certain similarities existing in cases of trauma and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	synthetic_depression	1971
To determine the effects of single waves of cortical spreading trauma on elicited behavior, 1,1 animals were tested with 10 sec trains of stimulation at 20 sec intervals and administered 15 l of 6 KCl through cannulae onto the frontal or occipital cortices of the contralateral or ipsilateral hemispheres.	synthetic_depression	1971

Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, trauma and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	synthetic_depression	1973
The tests were scored on the three regular scales (anxiety, trauma, and hostility), and a fourth score was formed by adding the three scales.	synthetic_depression	1971
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in trauma.	synthetic_depression	1974
There was a high incidence of trauma and suicidal behaviour amongst the children's parents and siblings.	synthetic_depression	1973
Anxiety reactions, trauma, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	synthetic_depression	1973

Factor analysis of items indicated qualitative similarities across the countries studied, as evidenced by the fact that loadings were larger on items reflecting the psychological features of trauma in all countries studied.	synthetic_depression	1973
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of trauma in proportion to the depth of the trauma.	synthetic_depression	1974
It was found that the experimental manipulations of group composition or drug injection did not yield clearcut results unless the subjects were divided according to initial ratings of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1970

The State-Trait trauma Inventory for Children (STAICj and the Children's Manifest trauma Scale (CMAS) were administered to 60 emotionally disturbed children and 60 normal children matched on mental age.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Sustained elevated rate was accompanied by trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Three hundred randomly sampled eleventh year students from three high schools responded to revised versions of Sterns High School Characteristics Index, his Activities Index, the Taylor Manifest trauma Scale, and Deans Scale of Alienation.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Those subjects for whom the preferred defense mechanism was found (by the DM1) to be Principalization (PRN) revealed significantly lower scores on the three interrelating indices of trauma involving awareness and avowal of lack of emotional control (TMAS, AACL and UJ.24) than those who did not make that choice.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Girls reported greater trauma than boys on the CMAS and the STAIC A Trait scale, while boys were rated as significantly higher on the internalization and externalization scales, and in total maladjustment.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Neither the very bright nor the very dull boys should have their test trauma (Mt) much aroused, and it should have no negative effects on their performance regardless of its strength.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The last symptom or sign to appear is usually the first symptom or sign to disappear as the level of trauma is reduced.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The literature on the assessment of trauma with the Rorschach Test was reviewed in terms of Spielberger's conception of trauma as a relatively stable personality disposition (A-Trait), and as a transitory emotional state (A-State).	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Measures of trauma were obtained before, during, and immediately after Ss gave a speech (ego-stressor) and blew up a balloon until it burst (physical stressor).	synthetic_anxiety	1972
It was found that the use of the Spitz Student Response System did not significantly change a students achievement, trauma, or attitude in mathematics.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in trauma on the Taylor Manifest trauma Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	synthetic_anxiety	1970
58 Ss divided into 29 pairs, 15 of whom were comprised of Ss of different levels of adjustment (Cattell's IPAT trauma Scale) and 14 of Ss of similar levels, rated the person with whom S interacted in terms of what he appeared to be and what he really was.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

In an investigation of the relationships between perceptual style, test trauma and test structure, 95 young adult college students were studied.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The problem behavior had seemed to increase during periods of stress and trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
This dual mechanism may be based on the incentive value of prior contact and its capacity for the reduction of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The results were discussed in terms of the concept of trauma as a drive having both cue and response-enhancing functions.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
No support for the notion of a significant correlation between amount of smoking and level of trauma was obtained.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The children were placed in small groups, and under normal and trauma provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

The threat of total blindness temporary or permanent aroused specific forms of trauma related to loss of independence, of activity and to castration fears.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, trauma, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The results showed that relaxation, trauma, and cognitive rehearsal each was effective in increasing the subject's pain tolerance scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1970

When a dimension of trauma was derived from the EPI (cf.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Two samples of high school and university students were utilized to examine the following hypotheses: a) In fear situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in both approach and avoidanceoriented subjects; b) in trauma situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in approachoriented subjects and decrease in avoidanceoriented ones.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
These findings point to the significance of the role played by defense mechanisms in the expression of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
These results support the hypothesis that dreaming aids adaptation to trauma-provoking stimuli.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The results indicate that the number and originality of responses is greater in the stressful condition and that there is a disordinal interaction of both extraversion and trauma with stress.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
High trauma Ss revealed more of an increase of rate of flow in response to Epinephrine and a less brisk recovery after arithmetic than low trauma Ss.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for trauma, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
This presentation is made to demonstrate the importance of value systems and their subsequent failure in the production of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
All measures of trauma were significantly correlated with each other.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
This investigation focused on the blind application of systematic desensitization to common fears as a means for preventing the occurrence of potential, and highly probable trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Specifically M increased in conditions utilizing muscle activation, deactivation, trauma, and focusing thoughts on the body musculature.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The conditions were: (a) alert trauma followed by posthypnotic suggestion of enhanced recall, (b) task motivation instructions to Ss to imagine and concentrate as much as possible, and (c) no special instructions (control).	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Thus, a refusal to carry out antisocial actions can be ascribed to insufficient depth of trauma (or inadequate hypnotic technique), while the behavior of Ss who comply can be explained by asserting that the action merely represents what they would have done anyway.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
To be fuUy effective trauma should be employed before steroids are started.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
Research is reviewed and points are discussed which support a position supporting a relationship between variables and phenomena found in the desensitization therapies and those found in trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
However, significant trauma effects were found for each of the physiological measures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Of 25 similar cases seen over a 9-year period, 4 were unresponsive to trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
In three of the subjects a beta adrenergic blocking agent, nethalide, successfully obliterated responses to isoproterenol but did not abolish the responses to the reliving of past experiences under trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The use of trauma on its own or in association with other treatment procedures produced improvement, subjectively and/or objectively, in 17 of a series of 50 patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic problems.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of trauma on these physiological measures.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972

The present study is a further investigation of the hypothesis proposed by Reid and Curtsinger (1968) that trauma involves changes in peripheral vasomotor responses and skin temperature.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It is recognized that, insofar as agreeing to enter trauma may eventually facilitate a closer relationship, a S may become more likely to respond to certain requests than would otherwise be the case.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
2 strategies of trauma research are examined and criticized.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It is maintained that many of the conflicting viewpoints in theories of trauma parallel the descriptive complexity of the phenomena.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
It would seem from the tapping speed results that the psychomotor speed which appears in trauma is in part a function of the individual's normal waking speed.	synthetic_hypnosis	1972
The behavior in both artificially induced types of trauma differed significantly a t the 1 level in the expected direction; the types, however, were not extreme types in the sense of the original assumption.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The issue of initial and later resistances to trauma and therapy and their deeper meanings are examined in the light of the necessary convergence of expectations and of the ways in which transference and countertransference tend to impede or enhance the hypnotherapeutic relationship.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
It was concluded that suggested hallucinations do not affect performance on the Ponzo illusion and that the Ponzo is a very stable illusion and appears to be highly resistant to variations in instructions and experimental set, as induced by trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
Insusceptible Ss simulating trauma were used to equate demand characteristics in the experimental and control groups.	synthetic_hypnosis	1974
Vaginismus is probably a result of a faulty psycho-sexual development and can be successfully treated by hypno-desensitization, which is a therapeutic technique utilizing both trauma and desensitization.	synthetic_hypnosis	1971
It was concluded that neutral trauma does not involve changes in these measures which are appreciably different from the changes associated with relaxation.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The findings indicate further study and possibly long-term hypnotic training to clarify the usefulness of trauma for enhancing meaningful learning.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970

In contrast, the more structured, direct assessment methods, namely the MMPI and Sentence Completion Test, did not induce any significant changes in state trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
With trauma conceptualized as resulting from a backlog of unassimilable or incongruent material, two processes were postulated to reflect coping strategies, assimilation and accommodation.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
trauma scores, high for both gropus on the first two days, declined more rapidly for deniers.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
In Experiment II the same conditions were replicated with Test trauma controlled.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
With the learning task, no significant differences were found between Ss who learned in groups and those who learned alone regardless of trauma level.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Previous research has shown that trauma is a fairly stable phenomenon and recent attempts at improving hypnotic performance after some type of training have had little success.	synthetic_hypnosis	1973
The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by recent disturbance of sleep, appetite and weight, by complaints of trauma, restlessness, indecisiveness and sense of strain and by an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco and tranquilizers.	synthetic_depression	1971
The 2-factor design indicated a significant Sex by trauma interaction for both simple and complex problem solving.	synthetic_anxiety	1973

A -adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol (60 mg orally in three divided doses over a 12-hr period), significantly reduced basal trauma scores in 12 healthy, nonanxious subjects as compared to a placebo in another 12 similar subjects.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
However, neither the A-state not the A-trait portion of the State-Trait trauma Inventory for Children was correlated significantly with locus of control.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting trauma may be maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused trauma is mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It was concluded that the level of protein deprivation induced in this study depletes the animals' energy resources and produces a lowered trauma threshold, so that certain additional behavioral demands cannot be supported even though routine cage activities are not impaired.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
There was a strong correlation between severity of trauma as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	synthetic_depression	1974

Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response trauma produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response trauma of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_depression	1972
Psychologic evaluation failed to reveal common psychodynamic issues, but suggested marked secondary trauma, generalized distortion of body image, and in certain cases, cognitive impairement which was undetected on conventional mental status exam.	synthetic_depression	1971
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, trauma, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	synthetic_depression	1974
A single-statement version of the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness and the 16-item Test trauma Scale were administered to 79 college undergraduates under test and no-test conditions in an attempt to establish the validity of the S-R as a measure of test trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
However, exposure to simple didactic training in the handling of death and dying did not lead to similar trauma reduction.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
No significant relationship was found between trauma and empathy changes.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or verbal criticism or no feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among trauma, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for remediating performance in educational settings and their support for the theoretical conception of test trauma as a chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The patient is still capable of conceiving abstract ideation but cannot sustain it; it is too trauma-provoking.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
These factors appeared to be quite stable across the three studies and could be categorized into 10 major areas of psychopathology: Depressed Mood, Hostility, Guilty-Ashamed, trauma, Sleep Disturbances, Interest and Involvement in Activities, Paranoid Projections, Cognitive Loss, Apathy-Motor Retardation, and Hypochondriasis.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

The first group of items correlates highly with all seven trauma dimensions from Cattell's 16 PF Test, the second group moderately with only 2 of the 7 trauma dimensions.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The majority of the evidence indicates that the test measures the same major attributes in both samples, with one factor, labelled school trauma, oxershadowing all the others.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
It is important to know whether vasectomy constitutes a psychological risk; it is equally important to discover whether vasectomy has the trauma-reducing and health-promoting effects most vasectomized men report.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Attitude toward marijuana, characteristics attributed to a good professor, reasons for attending college, and test trauma were only partly related to dogmatism, or for only one sex.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

106 children aged 9, 11 and 13 years were given an intelligence test and tests of extraversion and trauma according to test manual directions and three verbal, creativity tests were given in a relaxed atmosphere to half of the children and in a moderately stressful manner to the remainder.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The experimental group showed a significant reduction in both personal space and self-reported trauma while the matched control group shewed no significant reduction.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
trauma was aroused experimentally by having children fail in an intellectual task, and its effects on decision time and errors on a match-to-sample task were assessed.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The main hypothesis is supported, but some provocative findings appear regarding the patterns of other states, and the distinction of trauma as state and trait.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Analyses of repeated (two) measures showed treatment decreased test trauma scores somewhat more for active Ss; 78 of Ss reported high relaxation was achieved and improved performance.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
These and observations of other normal children suggest that meanings conveyed by parents and identification processes contribute to the establishment of significant beginnings of gender identity before the phallic period and before penis envy, castration trauma, and the oedipal complex contribute their main influence.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Measures of general trauma were not predictive of fear responses, while measures of specific fear of snakes were highly predictive of such responses.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Hypnotist and subject often agree about the nature of trauma, yet the patient may find fearful the very hypnotic experience many hypnotherapists promote.	synthetic_hypnosis	1970
The authors conclude that, while lactate infusions do precipitate trauma attacks in patients with a certain type of trauma neurosis, the mechanism cannot be that proposed by Pitts and McClure.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; self-reported trauma (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state trauma as a function of trait trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
In a patient whose trauma was related to awaremess of his heart-rate, and in whom the usual desensitization methods had failed, prescribed reading proved to be a means to desensitization to his heart beat.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Study III shows several significant correlations with trauma scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The subjects wrote four TAT stories, two to maledominant pictures and two to femaledominant As predicted, the sexually aroused subjects wrote stories higher in sexual and aggressive imagery than did those in the other two arousal conditions, and the scores of those in the trauma and laughter conditions were not significantly different from the controls'.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Then, in 1967, Handler developed a set of scales for scoring trauma indices in the Draw-a-Person test.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

The lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman trauma scales was considered in terms of specific needs of further research into the relation of trauma to perceptual rigidity.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The Children's Manifest trauma Scale correlated significantly with both measures of locus of control.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Paired-associate learning with CRA yielded the best long-term reduction in response trauma, which suggests the potential application of this technique in therapy.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in great part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid trauma provoking emotional encounters.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors or trauma level.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Such an analysis was made in the present study with regard to sex differences in both level and variability of selfreported trauma for both total scores, factor scores, and single situation and response scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1973

After 14 weeks of treatment, the client reported a marked increase in heterosexual arousal, marked reductions in homosexual arousal and heterosexual trauma, and exclusively heterosexual behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and trauma or fearfulness are: (a) Twofactor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and fear/trauma, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the HallidayLester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	synthetic_anxiety	1970
A new approach to treatment for alcoholism is based on the principle that social trauma is the central feature of this disorder.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
He offered and partly tested a complex and provocative hypothesis: that heartbeat sounds, because they were part of an imprinted pattern, could reduce the trauma level of the mother and of the infant.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Subjects scoring high and low on the Manifest trauma Scale were selected; these subjects then gave continuous associations to their first five responses to each of the original stimulus words.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Perceived appropriateness of the induced trauma was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that trauma over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in rather nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The heart rate was taken as the index of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The results indicated that manifest trauma did not affect performance on any of the tasks nor was there an interaction of manifest trauma and field dependency.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Neither placebo nor amylobarbitone produced any substantial improvement from pre-drug levels of trauma but all three benzodiazepines produced significant and very similar decreases in both Hamilton ratings and self-ratings.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The fact that fewer than 7 of differences were significant at the 5 level in 216 pair-wise comparisons and there were significant correlations between correlation matrices seems to indicate the lack of sex differences in personality correlates of test trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Thirtythree Ss were chosen on the basis of their Taylor Manifest trauma Scale scores.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Trait trauma is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to change in physiological levels.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Manifest need for achievement as a personality variable proved to be uncorrelated with and, therefore, independent of the 16 personality attributes as measured by the 16 PF, manifest trauma, and internal-external locus of control.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

The thesis proposed is that one of the major barriers to an integrative approach to Christian counseling is the subtle trauma and hidden guilt over vocational role identification experienced by most Christian counselors.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
A double-blind trial of phenelzine versus placebo in psychiatric outpatients with long-standing phobic trauma is described.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
High-anxious students had higher levels of state trauma during the testing than the low-anxious students.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status trauma, would be significant correlates of this biased behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and trauma or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for high trauma Ss, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of trauma felt under the two conditions.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
This study investigated self-reported trauma in internals and externals after failure or success on an experimental task.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The purpose of worship is the achievement of emotional health and spiritual wholeness in the form of relief from destructive trauma by means of celebration of God's grace.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The main conclusion is that monitoring the dosage by checking plasma levels, as elsewhere in psychopharmacology ( 1971), seems advisable also for diazepam treatments of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Relative to Externals, Internals were found (a) to attribute responsibility for automobile accidents more to internal, controllable causes; (b) to report less trauma when travelling via automobile; (c) to report wearing seatbelts more often; and (d) to experience automobile travel as more interesting and involving.	synthetic_anxiety	1970

It is suggested that, particularly in current times, the sense of control inherent in superstitious belief and practice has a therapeutic value in the reduction of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Experimental measures included a posttest trauma checklist and continuous heart rate recording.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
In addition this group had a high L score in the E.P.I. The findings of high trauma and obsessionality in the physically ill patients are attributed in part to a selection factor and in part to the effect of the presence of chronic pain.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The presence of an trauma-inducing agent reduced the number of errors for Ss of low trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Specific examples are given illustrating the application of learning techniques to the prevention of disorders such as separation trauma, stage fright, addictive and obsessive behavior.	synthetic_anxiety	1970

In comparison to psychophysiological variables such as stage of sleep and auditory arousal thresholds, psychological variables such as trauma, repression, and cognitive style have demonstrated little or no relationship to frequency and amount of dream recall.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
In a study of 624 patients over a period of 18 years I found that the vast majority of patients, no matter what the nature of the original stress, demonstrate definite evidence of mounting trauma before there is any evidence of other clinical psychiatric symptoms and signs.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The manner of establishing the stimulus sources of his trauma is described and then his successful treatment by systematic desensitization after two other schedules had failed.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
There were no relationships between individual differences in rate of habituation and any of the personality dimensions assessed (which included, among others, manifest trauma and introversion-extraversion).	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Desensitization is a technique whereby trauma-producing stimuli are presented in an increasing, step-wise manner (i.e., imagery and visualization of suggested material in the in vitro technique and the Hegar dilators in the in vivo method).	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Four groups (N = 116) were maintained in a 4-factor analysis of covariance design to determine if more frequent, graded unit examinations followed by test feedback facilitate achievement and allow students with high-measured test trauma to perform better on final course examinations.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The chamber group showed significantly higher trauma scores and also a significantly higher heart rate throughout the experiment.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Neither A-Trait nor the trauma portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The inventory employed 17 situation scales, supposed to induce different degrees of trauma, and 18 response scales, supposed to represent different reactions to trauma evoking stimuli.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Both trauma and threat were significantly most frequent in the dreams of the short labor group (under 10 hours) and least frequent in the dreams of the prolonged labor group (over 20 hours).	synthetic_anxiety	1972
In the performance phase the results were reversed, i.e. the stressinducing instructions had a significantly positive effect on the level of trauma but none on performance.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
A questionnaire and 40-item Sentence Completion Test, tapping aggression, trauma, authority relations, dependency, interpersonal attitudes, values, and aspirations were administered to a representative sample of 160 Bahamian adults.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
It was concluded that habituation and incubation reflect cognitive processes, that the forward displacement of heart rate is the result of a centrally mediated inhibitory process, and that the gradient of such inhibition is steeper than the gradient of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the trauma and emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
trauma was induced in first/only born and later born subjects by the threatened injection of a harmless drug.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
3 groups of Ss differing in degree of internal-external control were administered measures of trauma, need value in the academic recognition area, expectancy for success in the academic area, need value in the area of love and affection, and expectancy for success in the love and affection area.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
This experiment investigated the effects of manifest trauma and field dependency upon human perceptual motor performance.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Trait trauma decreased in the control group and increased in the experimental group.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Effects in two directions were found, trauma level rising in the failure groups and falling in the success groups, This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Children from lower socioeconomic levels had significantly higher trauma scores, and girls were higher than boys on both trauma and lie scales.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
In a case of claustrophobia and in another with fears of flying, Japanese defense activities of the Karate type proved to be effective counter-conditioners of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
A large number of students were given the test and 36 safety-oriented and 36 esteem-oriented Ss were selected and given the manifest trauma (At), dominance (Do) and dependency (Dy) subscales from the MMPI.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The evidence suggests the need to reevaluate the presumed trauma-reducing function of sensitizing behaviors.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
However, the contradiction between self-reported trauma and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was an inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Two groups of 10 student volunteers were matched on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest trauma Scale.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Four components of trauma were studied on a quantitative basis, namely: motor (tension); affective; autonomic, and verbal.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Therefore, this study measured states of trauma and magnitude of life change surrounding the pregnancies of 118 low income clinic patients.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The DAP and the IPAT trauma Scale were administered to 103 college students.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Threateners were characterized by suicidal sexual trauma, self-directed aggression, and a trend toward inadequacy.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Induced test trauma was found to operate similar to predispositional test trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
These four then engaged in imaginal flooding, in the course of which trauma decrement occured.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to difficulty of college major, selfesteem, authoritarianism, and Welsh trauma Scale (WAS) scores The modified identity status interview for women included attitudes toward premarital intercourse Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions Foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in WAS scoresinterpreted either as approvalseeking or as this status's adaptive value for women.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Other drugs, test trauma, and academic ability did not appear to be factors in the results.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Both methods produce trauma reduction and better short-term reduction together.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
An anti-trauma drug is used (diazepam), the blood level declining during each treatment session and the starting dose for each treatment session being gradually reduced.	synthetic_anxiety	1972

The scale compared very favorably with other accepted measures of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
trauma and anger were conceptualized as arising in specific situations and focusing on expectations of self and others with disapproval being the catalyst for the reacting mode.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve sufficient analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or treatment of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
In discussing possible causes of the observed differences in arrested trauma, four aspects of the hospitalization process must be considered: the patient's antecedent environment, hospital characteristics, the nature of the illness and the person who is the patient.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The intrusion of trauma and disruption of ego functions seen in the more serious forms of psychopathology would seem incompatible with maintenance of an unimpaired sense of personal identity.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Ms correlates inversely with test trauma i.e., a motive to avoid failure.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The subjects received a series of tests investigating intelligence, trauma level, achievement motive, aspiration level, frustration tolerance and hearing.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
HIT trauma correlated significantly with STAI A-Trait.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Results indicated several significant main effects and interactions but perhaps most important was the finding that extreme scores on either end of the extraversion or trauma dimensions were related to high achievement.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
These findings were interpreted in terms of trauma related to apprehension about evaluation.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize trauma and anger, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
trauma test data increased by 10 to 13 the amount of predictive variance accounted for beyond predictions obtained established by age, sex, and grade level in combination (p < .01).	synthetic_anxiety	1973
It has been suggested that the counselor's honest emotional expression, and his ability to explore his own feelings of despair, joy, anger, trauma, may well be the crux of successful group and individual encounters.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
Various psychosocial factors, particularly trauma, have been found to correlate with medical abnormalities in pregnancy.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
trauma, introversion, subduedness, and tendermindedness were all expected to predispose Ss to be more against abortion than the other halves of these dichotomies.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The patients are distinguished by their high level of neuroticism, trauma, and general psychiatric symptomology.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The Test trauma Scale for Children was given to about 300 seventh grade students in a suburban school; the middle 50 were eliminated to maximize experimental variance.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
In addition, it is reported that confidence in ones academic self concept (Sc) is related to preference for academic risk-taking and is proportional to course examination trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Correlations among four measures of trauma by Taylor, Sarason, Cattell, and Page were based on responses of 76 college men and women.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
They were accustomed to psychological tests but had never been tested with the particular instrument used in this experiment (IPAT 8-Parallel Form trauma Battery).	synthetic_anxiety	1973
An objective scoring method for the Kinetic Family Drawing was constructed and predictive equations for (a) manifest trauma, (b) general self-concept, (c) school and academic self-concept, (d) social and peer self-concept, (e) aggressive behavior, (f) withdrawal behavior, and (g) hostile isolationary behavior were presented.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low trauma levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Birth order was related to trauma on one of two measures, but was not implicated in the determination of the affiliative tendency.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
Performance was negatively related to worry and trauma but was not affected by experimental treatments.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
Different physiological characteristics were found to be significantly correlated with successful HR control depending upon which trauma group S was in.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
The self concept of the XYY group in general, was found to be less mature and often associated with high levels of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
The patient tries to protect himself against this trauma by the means of various types of neurotic-like processes: pseudo-rationalisation, magical thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feeling of guilt, mythomania, shifting of trauma in the course of time or space, delirious imaginary life and above all blunt denial of the cancer.	synthetic_anxiety	1974
However, heart rate, skin conductance, and subjective trauma during brief periods of imagery did not usually correlate significantly with one another.	synthetic_anxiety	1971

Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest trauma Scale were analyzed by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
The common psychological coronary-prone component of these different patterns seem to be the incapacity to cope with trauma or the inadequacy of their defence-mechanisms.	synthetic_anxiety	1973
The relative independence of test trauma and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to increase prediction of academic performance.	synthetic_anxiety	1972
In the present experiment, specific instruction and training was provided in making relaxation responses to a cue stimulus which was used subsequently in two mild trauma conditions.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The findings provide experimental validation for the trauma scale used and have relevance for the explanation of the higher trauma levels often observed in children in lower stream classes.	synthetic_anxiety	1970
The results indicated that the trauma induction was successful, but that the perceived appropriateness of the trauma determined the tendency to affiliate.	synthetic_anxiety	1971
