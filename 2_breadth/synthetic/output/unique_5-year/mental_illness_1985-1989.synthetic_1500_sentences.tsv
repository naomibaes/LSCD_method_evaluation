Five such principles are discussed: that psi can best be assessed using quantitative measures and forcedchoice tests; that psi is a function of the unconscious with the implication that objective performance alone is important, not the mental_illness of the subject; that psi ability is, to some degree, present in everyone; that only those problems deserve attention for which an unambiguous answer is attainable, with the implication that survival research should be shelved indefinitely and that psi is nonphysical.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1989
Children of multiple-problem families are more likely than children of pure gamblers to smoke tobacco, get drunk, overeat, sleep worse than most people, have an unhappy present mental_illness, and feel more insecure, inferior, or inadequate than most.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1986
Further, important distinctions are obscured when behavior is attributed to a mental_illness.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1987
When there is a traumatic disillusionment in the idealized self-object during early development, this leads to a fixed adolescent mental_illness, independent of chronological age, which can be more clearly observed in the analysis of adult patients with self pathology.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1986
Adolescence is viewed, not only as a chronological phase, but primarily as a mental_illness, with specific characteristics, resulting from the transformations of the self, culminating in the establishment of the sense of identity.	synthetic_state_of_mind	1987

A differential semiological analysis in relation to three conceptual pairs, chosen because of their key positions (mental_illness-excitation, motor weakness-dyspraxia, personality problems-psychopathy) shows that it's sometimes impossible to clearly separate instability-hyperkinesia from these other concepts, insofar as they have been blown out of proportion and deformed.	synthetic_agitation	1986
Item analysis revealed that most items were rated slightly higher by self-report, with the items contributing most to this discrepancy being psychomotor mental_illness and retardation, self-outlook, and irritable mood.	synthetic_agitation	1985

The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory mental_illness also belongs to the context of the latter.	synthetic_delusion	1989
The central symptom in the case history is the mental_illness that the patient has already lived through this life once.	synthetic_delusion	1986

Additional analyses supported a reconceptualization of burnout and the MBI, one that regards exhaustion as the essence of burnout and treats accomplishment and mental_illness as related variables, but not as elements of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
High levels of IPS were associated with earlier onset and greater chronicity of depression, higher Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) score, more severe depressed mood, guilt, suicidality, impaired work and interest, retardation, mental_illness, paranoia, and cognitive symptoms of depression.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
It was found that these Japanese psychiatrists used a relatively small number of diagnostic categories; in their classificatory system, functional mental_disorders would be dichotomized into psychoses and neuroses with the former further divided into schizophrenic, atypical and manic-depressive psychoses, and the latter divided into seven subcategories, i.e., anxiety neurosis, hysteria, depressive neurosis, phobia, obsessive compulsive neurosis, mental_illness neurosis and hypochondriasis.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
The results in the entire sample suggest that EDR-HR depends on the phasic component (amplitude and spontaneous activity) of the electrodermal response as well as on state anxiety, extraversion and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
However, in clinical practice we have noted that many persons who complain of vertigo (whether due to Mnire's disease or other causes) also report symptoms of mental_illness and derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
Specificially, coaches who displayed a consideration style of leadership behavior scored significantly higher in the frequency and intensity dimensions of the emotional exhaustion and mental_illness subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
Factor analyses and correlational studies designed to test predictions provided fairly consistent evidence for the utility of the MBI subscale measures of emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
As in the instance of other factor analytic studies with the MBI, the three hypothesized constructs of burnout described as emotional exhaustion, mental_illness, and personal accomplishment were clearly defined in all factor solutions irrespective of whether the items were scored for frequency or intensity.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
mental_illness was associated with role conflict and decisionmaking policies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
The secondary data analysis of 87 former state hospital patients in residential facilities suggests that while client characteristics are important in explaining community integration, facility, and community characteristics, particularly the level of skills training offered in the facility, size of city, and level of mental_illness of residents, have a significant impact.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
Psychiatrists and social workers had significantly higher scores on mental_illness than the primary care physicians or psychologists.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
