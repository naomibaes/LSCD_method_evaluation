It was also predicted that subjects receiving high scores on Physical anxiety would show lower differentiation than controls.	synthetic_anhedonia	1985
The findings suggest support for the possibility that the following skill deficits deserve further investigation for their role in depression aetiology and treatment: logical errors including misattributions, poor self-control skills, poor social skills in terms of excessive aggression and deficit assertiveness, and inadequate hedonic capacity in terms of deficit positive interests and excessive negative interests (anxiety).	synthetic_anhedonia	1987
Thirty-seven prisoners were assessed for psychopathy, schizotypy (anxiety-psychoticism and schizophrenism), the WAIS, and skin conductance recorded to orienting, consonant-vowel, and 90 dB stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia	1985
Children high in anxiety, independently of their diagnosis, showed less active involvement in seeking rewards, were higher in their expectations of negative outcomes, and were more likely to attribute unrewarding outcomes to their own behavior than to external causes.	synthetic_anhedonia	1986
After considering the problems of quantitative evaluation, we review the literature and conclude that anxiety appears to be a multi-morphological symptom and the are probably several types of anxiety, which shows the necessity of developing more specific reliable evaluation instruments and of diversifying the approaches.	synthetic_anhedonia	1988
Then several research directions in psychiatry are discussed: what place has anxiety in the negative form of schizophrenia?	synthetic_anhedonia	1989

anxiety is a well-known stage in the recovery.	synthetic_agitation	1986
A tentative classification of effective (informing and distracting) and dysfunctional (ignoring and anxiety) parenting responses in this situation was suggested by evaluating changes from baseline rates of parenting behaviors following child distress as they related to child adjustment.	synthetic_agitation	1986
Pure Type IV included features of anxiety, mood worsening later in the day, anorexia and depersonalization; it was commonly precipitated by external stress and MAOI treatment was more effective than placebo.	synthetic_agitation	1985

After a previous analysis of African depressions in studies based on the use of D.S.M. III as a preliminary tool, the authors are now seeking to understand more directly the different ways for depressed Ivorians to express the lowering of self-esteem, as well as the various meanings of anxiety observed among them.	synthetic_agitation	1987
Results indicate that, although self-care deficits and disorientation are extremely common, they are of less concern to caregivers than a number of prevalent and highly stressful behavioral problems such as anxiety, hallucinations, and dangerous or embarrassing behaviors.	synthetic_agitation	1987
REM variables were the only sleep measures affected by the separation, and were suggestive of anxiety but not depression.	synthetic_agitation	1988
Some individuals displayed negative side effects such as tension, anxiety, insomnia, and sweating during the 16-week period they received fenfluramine.	synthetic_agitation	1985
Unfortunately, patients in anxiety are often unable to participate in rehabilitation programmes and disrupt the rehabilitation ward activities.	synthetic_agitation	1987
Actual/own: ideal/own discrepancy (AI) was uniquely related to dejection, frustration, and anger at self as measured 2 months later; actual/own:ought/other discrepancy (AOO) was uniquely related to anxiety and to anger at others and resentment.	synthetic_agitation	1988

A differential semiological analysis in relation to three conceptual pairs, chosen because of their key positions (anxiety-excitation, motor weakness-dyspraxia, personality problems-psychopathy) shows that it's sometimes impossible to clearly separate instability-hyperkinesia from these other concepts, insofar as they have been blown out of proportion and deformed.	synthetic_agitation	1985
Staff training has focused predominantly on teaching staff specific techniques to be implemented to deescalate the client's anxiety.	synthetic_agitation	1988

anxiety relieves a person of responsibility for his or her actions, but in so doing it also justifies appropriating that person's freedom of choice, the necessary prerequisite of responsible action.	synthetic_mental_illness	1987
anxiety is not truly a medical diagnosis, argues Thomas Szasz.	synthetic_mental_illness	1987

A comparison is made with the psychoanalytic theory of paranoid anxiety, because that appears to be the only extant theory with which a comparison can be made.	synthetic_delusion	1987
The case offered a particularly clear example of derailment of the developmental process of self-differentiation, leading to the formation of a highly pathological introject and anxiety of merger.	synthetic_delusion	1987
The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory anxiety also belongs to the context of the latter.	synthetic_delusion	1986
The author hypothesizes that erotomania, or de Clrambault's syndrome, occurs in two forms: the clinically accepted delusional erotomania, in which patients believe that another person is in love with them; and borderline erotomania, in which no anxiety is present, yet an extreme disorder of attachment is apparent in the pursuit of, and in the potential for violence toward, the unrequited love object.	synthetic_delusion	1985
The problem of the relationship between obsession and anxiety is dealt with from descriptive, anthropoanalytical and purely phenomenological points of view.	synthetic_delusion	1986
Accordingly, it seems that, although the anxiety of world destruction, as a form of world catastrophe, is rare, it occurs among schizophrenic patients at a rather constant incidence, irrespective of the culture or area.	synthetic_delusion	1985
Koro is a belief or anxiety of retraction of the penis into the abdomen.	synthetic_delusion	1985
The clinical characteristics of this anxiety are described and its concept, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, course and also possible mechanism are discussed.	synthetic_delusion	1985
Course and outcome are mainly dependent on the diagnostic category, not the type of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1985
When the instructor overtly turns the crank and, in synchrony, covertly operates another mechanism to wave the flag, the students develop a strong anxiety from the mere correlation of the two observed events that turning the crank causes the flag to wave.	synthetic_delusion	1987

The phenomenon of lycanthropy is most appropriately regarded as a anxiety, but the abnormal subjective experience is stressed, not just the falsely-held belief.	synthetic_delusion	1989
The type and content of anxiety was assessed in each patient at each psychotic episode.	synthetic_delusion	1987
Despite the expected low stability of affective symptoms over longer periods of time, the presence of affective syndromes has a high prognostic value, even in a population characterized primarily by the presence of a mood-incongruent anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1986
Within 4,200 unduplicated patient presentations, 6 cases were determined to have a Capgras anxiety: i.e. 0.14 of all PES unduplicated presentations and 0.17 of all PES psychotic unduplicated presentations.	synthetic_delusion	1988
anxiety subsided in all three delusional entities in about 50 of the cases; however, defect develops in unsystematic paraphrenias more often to a statistically highly significant degree than in the other two forms.	synthetic_delusion	1988
It was found that 72.9 of the patients were deluded, the most common delusions being of persecution, grandeur and guilt; in 34.9 of the deluded patients, the anxiety had a religious content.	synthetic_delusion	1989
During the 1983 year all patient presentations to the University of Miami Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES) at Jackson Memorial Hospital, a large county hospital, were screened by the author through patient rounds and chart review for the presence of the Capgras anxiety (strictly defined).	synthetic_delusion	1985
The development of Delusional Disorders among adolescents is described, along with problems raised for accurate diagnosis when attempting to determine precise positions on the continua of belief-obsession-anxiety, nonpsy-chosis-psychosis, and syntonicity-dystonicity.	synthetic_delusion	1987
From a large series of patients with delusional psychoses, first-time admitted to the Psychiatric Department, University of Oslo, hypochondriacal delusions were coded as the main anxiety in 15 patients (0.4 of all admissions).	synthetic_delusion	1986
Denial of lineage, involving the anxiety of high-ranking lineage and the anxiety of leadership lineage, may occur at the onset or during the course of schizophrenia.	synthetic_delusion	1989
Twenty-four of them manifested anxiety of high-ranking lineage or of distinguished leadership lineage.	synthetic_delusion	1987
As a result, in West Germany, there were 7 (4.7) patients with delusions of world destruction among 150 schizophrenic patients, accounting for 5.3 of all 131 patients with some anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1985
This anxiety appears as the experience of reduplication, differing from that of dj vu, based on mental automatism.	synthetic_delusion	1987
In Japan, 5 (2.8) of 178 schizophrenic patients had such delusions, accounting for 3.0 of all 166 patients with some anxiety.	synthetic_delusion	1987
This anxiety concerns the generation of parents, sisters, but not the offspring.	synthetic_delusion	1986
It was found that these Japanese psychiatrists used a relatively small number of diagnostic categories; in their classificatory system, functional mental_disorders would be dichotomized into psychoses and neuroses with the former further divided into schizophrenic, atypical and manic-depressive psychoses, and the latter divided into seven subcategories, i.e., anxiety neurosis, hysteria, depressive neurosis, phobia, obsessive compulsive neurosis, anxiety neurosis and hypochondriasis.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
In addition, a significant gender difference revealed that male coaches scored higher in both the frequency and intensity dimensions of the anxiety subscales.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
anxiety was associated with role conflict and decisionmaking policies.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
Factor analyses and correlational studies designed to test predictions provided fairly consistent evidence for the utility of the MBI subscale measures of emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
Among the primary care physicians, moderate emotional exhaustion, and anxiety were found.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
The only statistically significant finding was that the OTRs who spent the least time with patients reported more anxiety (intensity only) than their peers.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
Psychiatrists and social workers had significantly higher scores on anxiety than the primary care physicians or psychologists.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
Among the psychiatric staff, high emotional exhaustion and anxiety were found.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
Of these 17 were direct temporal lobe signs that implied deepened affect, auditory-vestibular experiences (vibrations, hearing one's name called), olfactory auras, perseveration (forced thinking), anxiety, and sense of the personal.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
The relationships of accuracy, concentration of social support network, mutual references, and motivational hierarchy were analyzed in three multiple regressions with emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and anxiety.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
Scores on the scale for this sample of nurses were comparable with those in other studies, except that anxiety scores were lower.	synthetic_depersonalization	1988
However, in clinical practice we have noted that many persons who complain of vertigo (whether due to Mnire's disease or other causes) also report symptoms of anxiety and derealization.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to develop frequency data in the areas of emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal achievement.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
The anxiety effects of visual stimuli are correlated with the extent to which subjects experience anxiety and somatic symptoms of agoraphobia, but not correlated with depression or the behavioural or cognitive aspects of agoraphobia.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
Additional analyses supported a reconceptualization of burnout and the MBI, one that regards exhaustion as the essence of burnout and treats accomplishment and anxiety as related variables, but not as elements of burnout.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
The entire professional group, with the one exception, was significantly higher in emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal achievement than Maslach's normative sample.	synthetic_depersonalization	1989
In each of the rotated factor matrices, empirical support was obtained for the presence of the three hypothesized factors of Emotional Exhaustion, anxiety, and Personal Accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
Independent observers were most sensitive to residents' emotional exhaustion and less likely to assess accurately the less visible aspects of burnout related to anxiety and lack of achievement, which suggests the usefulness of multiple measures for assessing the burnout phenomenon.	synthetic_depersonalization	1985
Analysis showed moderate to high burnout on the categories of emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1987
The last series of solutions provided the following identifiable factors matched across grade and sex: Surgency, Sadness, Aggression, Mastery/Self Esteem, anxiety/Fatigue and Frustration/Embarrassment.	synthetic_depersonalization	1986
