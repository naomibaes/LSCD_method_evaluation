"Although hypno-relaxation and mental_health serve as efficient tools to aid in the administration of dental treatment to such patients, some of them may view mental_health as a further relinquishing of control to the hypnotist and thus resist hypnotic induction, despite their willingness to try to use mental_health for therapeutic reasons.",synthetic_hypnosis,1990

"It was hypothesized in part that all five of the Chapman scales and the Schizoidia Scale would correlate with the schizotypal personality disorder; the Physical mental_health and Revised Social mental_health Scales would correlate with the schizoid personality disorder, whereas the Magical Ideation and Perceptual Aberration Scales would not; the Physical and Revised Social mental_health Scales would not correlate with the avoidant personality disorder; and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale would correlate with the borderline and antisocial personality disorders.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990

The Physical mental_health Scale and the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale were not effective predictors of psychosis proneness.,synthetic_anhedonia,1991
"Our study investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of five of Chapman's Schizotypia Scales (i.e., Physical mental_health, Revised Social mental_health, Perceptual Aberration, Magical Ideation, and Impulsive Nonconformity; L.J. Chapman, J.P. Chapman, & Raulin 1976, 1978; Eckblad & L.J. Chapman, 1983) and Meehl's Schizoidia Scale (Meehl, 1964) within a sample of 50 personality disordered subjects, many of whom possessed schizotypic traits.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990
The present review suggests that stressor-induced reductions in the rewarding value of electrical brain stimulation (ICSS) from the mesocorticolimbic system may simulate the mental_health of human depression.,synthetic_anhedonia,1991
"The association between scales measuring physical and social mental_health, self-reports of affective response to emotion-eliciting films, and role play measures of social skill was evaluated in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar affective disorder.",synthetic_anhedonia,1993
Both BPD and SPD/BPD patients were discriminated from SPD patients by significantly higher levels of impulsivity and aggression but not by the differential presence of psychoticlike symptoms or mental_health.,synthetic_anhedonia,1992
Meehl considered mental_health from the point of view of a personality defect predisposing to mental_illness; and Klein regarded mental_health to be a symptom of depressive illness and probably the best clinical marker predicting response to antidepressant drugs.,synthetic_anhedonia,1993
"Physical mental_health, evaluated by the score on the physical mental_health scale (PAS) of Chapman et al. [",synthetic_anhedonia,1992
"We administered scales of Perceptual Aberration (PERAB) and Physical mental_health (PHYSAN), traits that may be related to risk for schizophrenia, to 54 schizophrenics, 146 of their first-degree relatives (evaluated for schizophrenia-related disorders), and 178 normal subjects (screened for psychotic disorders in them or their relatives).",synthetic_anhedonia,1991
Ss who initially scored high on the Magical Ideation Scale and above the mean on the Social mental_health Scale were especially deviant.,synthetic_anhedonia,1992

"In both my patients, the sexual behaviors served the self-regulatory function of alleviating inner feelings of mental_health and depression.",synthetic_anhedonia,1992
"The present study found an inverse relationship between Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale and the Physical mental_health Scale, which has been used as a measure of psychosis vulnerability.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990
"The presence of mental_health in schizophrenic and pre-schizophrenic populations has also been noted, leading to the development of measures of mental_health designed to locate schizophrenia-prone individuals.",synthetic_anhedonia,1993
"Affective flattening and mental_health were defined by the following self-rating scales: Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPCS), Hardy Displeasure Capacity Scale (HDCS), FCPCS-PP (subscale of physical pleasure), and HDCS-PD (subscale of physical displeasure).",synthetic_anhedonia,1993
"Higher scores on the physical mental_health scale, but not the social mental_health scale, were related to attenuated reports of positive affect following viewing of affect-eliciting films in schizophrenia-schizoaffective disorder patients.",synthetic_anhedonia,1991
"Concerning physical stimulations (FCPCS-PP and HDCS-PD) in the depressed group, mental_health and affective flattening are not linked, suggesting that physical mental_health is not secondary to low emotional reactivity (affective flattening) and constitutes an independent dimension.",synthetic_anhedonia,1993
"Research on the symptomatology of endogenous depression did not include the concept; mental_health was also lacking from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the depression rating scales, Attention was drawn to mental_health by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990
It is possible that mental_health may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in biological research and in clinical practice.,synthetic_anhedonia,1993
"Patterns of familial correlations also suggested that physical mental_health, but not perceptual aberration, may be familial among schizophrenics and their relatives.",synthetic_anhedonia,1992
This was particularly true for symptoms of mental_health and behavioral disturbance.,synthetic_anhedonia,1991
"We evaluated the construct validity of the revised Social mental_health Scale (SAS; Mishlove & Chapman, 1985) through an examination of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles produced by extreme scorers on the SAS.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990
"For patients with schizophrenia, mental_health was significantly related to premorbid functioning.",synthetic_anhedonia,1992
Since then there has been a gradual recovery of emphasis although many systems confuse the two concepts of 'loss of interest' and mental_health.,synthetic_anhedonia,1993
"With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and mental_health (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990
"However, no one element was either necessary to cause the decrease in sucrose intake, or sufficient to maintain the impairment for longer than 4 weeks: Variety and frequency of microstressors appeared to be the essential features of procedures causing a prolonged mental_health.",synthetic_anhedonia,1990
These results suggest that only a subset of the students with high scores on the Perceptual Aberration and Magical Ideation Scales produce schizophrenia spectrum MMPI-2 profiles and that these profiles are substantially different from those produced by students with high scores on the Revised Social mental_health Scale and from schizotypal college students who seek psychological treatment.,synthetic_anhedonia,1991
"On the general sample of depressed subjects, the more the subjects stand on the emotional deficit side, behavioural (affective observed monotony, lack of affective expressiveness and responsiveness) and subjective (mental_health, affective global indifference for pleasant and unpleasant events), the lower is sensation seeking.",synthetic_anhedonia,1992
These findings suggest that lowered levels of sensation seeking may be indicative of physical mental_health and may also play a role in proneness to schizophrenia.,synthetic_anhedonia,1994
"Thus, a 'trunk and branch' analogy was suggested for construing psychomotor disturbance, with a truncal 'psychic' component arborising into retardation and mental_health 'motoric' expressions.",synthetic_agitation,1990
