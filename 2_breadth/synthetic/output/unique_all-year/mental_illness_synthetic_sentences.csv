The onset of symptoms inconsistent with the patient's current level of recovery should alert the clinician to consider other possible diagnosis and failure to distinguish the features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome from post-traumatic mental_illness will delay appropriate intervention for this potentially life-threatening disorder.,synthetic_agitation,2001

"On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by mental_illness-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).",synthetic_delusion,2000
Anomalous activity or connectivity within these defined regions may account for the attentional or attributional biases subserving paranoid mental_illness formation.,synthetic_delusion,2001
The results did not support the hypothesis that atypical items would be incorporated into the recall of mental_illness-relevant material.,synthetic_delusion,2003
It was hypothesized that deluded subjects whose mental_illness was relevant to one of the scripts would recall more of the atypical components of the script and would also be less likely to make script-atypical confabulations in the recall of this particular script.,synthetic_delusion,2001
"The authors present a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who has the mental_illness that he exists in plural numbers.",synthetic_delusion,2000
Through clinical illustration the author demonstrates that the psychotherapist can access the very heart of a mental_illness and restructure it by focusing on the affective origins of the mental_illness.,synthetic_delusion,2003

"Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that mental_illness content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.",synthetic_delusion,2004
"However, a well-replicated mathematical model of magical/delusional thinking based on a study of paranormal beliefs and experiences is consistent with the hypothesis that attributional processes play a central role in mental_illness formation and maintenance.",synthetic_delusion,2003

A non-randomized matched group design was employed to examine the performance of mental_illness-prone individuals in comparison with a control group.,synthetic_delusion,2004
A wide range of items indicating themes of mental_illness were collected.,synthetic_delusion,2004
Healthy participants with high positive schizotypy scores (i.e. those reporting more hallucination-like experiences and mental_illness-like beliefs) showed smaller distractor cueing effects than those with lower scores.,synthetic_delusion,2003

"Capgras mental_illness is the belief that significant others have been replaced by impostors, robots or aliens.",synthetic_delusion,2001
"The DSM-IV definition of mental_illness is argued to be unsatisfactory because it does not explain the mechanism for mental_illness formation and maintenance, it implies that such beliefs are necessarily dysfunctional (pathological), it underestimates the social component to some delusions, and it is inconsistent with research indicating that delusions can be modified through techniques such as contradiction, confrontation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.",synthetic_delusion,2004

"Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four types (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, paroxysms of dissociative rage in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as overcontrolled hostile (Megargee, 1966), and persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in mental_illness disorder.",synthetic_depersonalization,2000

"In a second experiment, the effect of amiloride on NaCl-evoked mental_illness was studied.",synthetic_irritation,2003
"Sessions involved determination of taste, olfactory and nasal mental_illness thresholds for ethanol, taste thresholds for tetralone, suprathreshold intensity and quality judgements, determination of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taster status, acute oral exposure effect of ethanol on ratings for sucrose, NaCl, citric acid and quinine hydrochloride and hedonic judgments of beers.",synthetic_irritation,2000
"Since amiloride significantly reduced the intensity of the irritant sensation, the contribution of amiloride-sensitive ionic currents or the Na+/H+ exchange pump (NHE) are suggested as possible transduction mechanisms in lingual nociceptors mediating NaCl-evoked oral mental_illness.",synthetic_irritation,2001

"In a final experiment, menthol was repeatedly applied to one side of the tongue at a shorter (20 s) interval (5-s ISI), and elicited a rapid increase in irritant sensation over the initial trials, consistent with sensitization, followed in subsequent trials by a progressive reduction in mental_illness (desensitization).",synthetic_irritation,2004
Additional lubrication during intercourse was one of several expected positive features of microbicides; women saw lubrication as a means of enhancing pleasure and reducing condom mental_illness and breakage while also protecting them from infection.,synthetic_irritation,2001
