Bayes' theorem of inverse probability is made the basis of a general equation for scoring objective examinations.,anxiety,depression,1941.0,,1.0000001192092896,0

A graphical illustration of the application of this equation to a hypothetical test situation is presented.,melancholy,depression,1941.0,,1.000000238418579,0

Seven primary factors were identifiable upon rotation.,agitation,depression,1941.0,,1.0000001192092896,0
