No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and changes in depression as a function of treatment.	1979	natural
However, a trend in the direction of higher correlations between externality and depression fot males than females suggests the possibility that perceived lack of control may be more depressing when it conflicts with expectations concerning self-reliance and mastery associated with traditional male sex roles.	1977	natural
Baseline determinations were obtained before initiation of treatment for mania or depression.	1979	natural
Construct validity was investi gated with comparisons between depressed and non-depressed groups and by the covariation be tween changes in the rate of occurrence of aversive events and changes in depression level.	1979	natural
Depression was not related to social vs non-social reinforcer preference.	1975	natural
Hopelessness seems to account for the bulk of the relationship between depression and suicidal intent.	1979	natural
However, results did tend to support the learned helplessness model's contention that depression is characterized by the perception that reinforcements occur independent of the individual's responses.	1978	natural

Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of state and trait depression, a political activity inventory, and the locus of control scale.	1978	natural
In accord with the McAllister's interpretation of related results, the depression of performance after short retention intervals may be due to a lack of generalization from training to the testing situation.	1979	natural
Lower depression scores were obtained after ADP across the period studied.	1977	natural
Fifty-six men and women were screened for significant depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in a fitness program; a self-monitoring control that simply recorded activities and mood daily; and an attention-control group.	1979	natural
Length of time in ADP was related negatively to initial depression scores.	1977	natural
However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in reducing depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964)D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955)Repertory Grid.	1977	natural
Lowered future outlook was associated with external locus of control, increased levels of depression, state and trait anxiety, and disordered thinking and with increased elevations on 9 of 13 MMPI scales.	1977	natural
Moreover, it could be shown that there occurs, during severe depression, a more pronounced involvement of the dominant (DH) than of the non-dominant (NDH) brain hemisphere.	1975	natural
A group of biological symptoms predicting the severity of depression was found via stepwise multiple regression analysis of variance.	1979	natural
Regression analysis also identified six variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 3 months of discharge: type of discharge, number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations, race, suicide attempt within 1 month prior to admission, subjective report of depression upon admission, and occupational level (R = .452).	1977	natural
Depression increased following the depressed and neutral film conditions, and decreased from posttest to follow-up test, while the positive and no-film control conditions produced no change from pretest to posttest levels of depression.	1978	natural
The results are consistent with a drive inhibition theory of depression.	1977	natural
A shorter, 28-item GHQ is proposed consisting of 4 subscales: somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and severe depression.	1979	natural
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin Depression Adjective Check Lists.	1977	natural
The Manifest Anxiety Scale, the Sleep Behavior Self Rating Scale and the Zung Depression Scale were administered to 81 clinical Ss.	1978	natural
The only biochemical abnormality significantly associated with a diagnosis of primary depression was the rise of plasma non-esterified fatty acid after testing.	1979	natural
Hypotheses about cognitive functioning in depression were partially supported, and gender appears to be a factor requiring further study with respect to depression.	1977	natural
In all these children depression was the common response to loss.	1979	natural
These results were interpreted as supporting prior research which demonstrated mood response set using altered Rotter I-E scale items, Implications for use of the Rotter I-E scale in the study of depression were discussed.	1979	natural
Compared with previously published results for the general population the hypertensive patients scored significantly higher for free-floating anxiety, phobic anxiety and depression.	1976	natural
The three substances determined a dose-dependent feeding depression in the first half hour when administered IP.	1977	natural
The required detection response was depression of the brake pedal.	1978	natural
Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a relatively uniform depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	1978	natural
The present study was designed to assess whether the physiological correlates of learned helplessness are similar to the physiological response patterns found in naturally occurring depression.	1977	natural
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of anxiety and depression, and a self-esteem index.	1978	natural
The functional and mixed-pain groups differed from the organic and mixed-relief groups on the Somatization and Depression factors.	1977	natural
The more the degree of overweight, the greater the tendency to have problems in three areas: depression, anxiety and impulsivity.	1976	natural
Analogies between the results of failure subjects and reactive depression were examined.	1979	natural
The full-scale global measures of depression were found to be related directly to the neurotic, anxious, dysphoric, and negative dimension of daydreaming.	1978	natural
The study demonstrates the frequency of depression in patients with the syndrome; it shows a clearly positive treatment effect with placebo alone for both depressive symptoms and gastrointestinal complaints, and suggests that tricyclic antidepressant therapy results in moderately greater improvement in symptoms than does treatment with placebo alone.	1978	natural
Irritation, depression, lack of concentration, sleep disturbances, anxiety, tension, and restlessness were frequently reported as abstinence symptoms.	1977	natural
Hypotheses about the occurrence of aversive events and depression were also tested.	1979	natural

It was concluded that the RS scale bears a relationship to selfpresentatbnal behavior and the affect of depression.	1977	natural
No depression of food intake occurred following intragastric loading of 50 and 65 percent glucose solutions which raised blood glucose levels a minimum of 43 mg percent and 55 mg percent above basal, respectively, for the duration of the 3 hr feeding period.	1975	natural
Though Blacks had a greater number of stressful life events and felt more externally oriented than Whites, there were no significant relationships between race and measures of depression.	1978	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of the probability of insufficient time for group composition and leaders to produce significant arousal of anxiety and depression.	1979	natural
Subjects were administered the Mini-Mult form of the MMPI, the MMPI Social Introversion scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, a problem checklist, and a questionnaire dealing with history of, and treatment for, mental and emotional problems.	1978	natural
Four phases of therapy are defined: a phase of disintegration and undifferentiation lasting six weeks, a phase of depression lasting for five weeks, a phase of multiple feelings lasting for fourteen weeks, and a phase of self-sustained development, starting in the twenty-fifth week and continuing beyond the end of therapy.	1979	natural
