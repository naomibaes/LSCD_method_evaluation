Anxiety has a small positive relationship, and depression has no relationship to pain variables.	1979	natural
Aroused subjects who were either given a pill attribution for their arousal or correctly warned that shock and test anxiety might upset them performed significantly better than aroused subjects who were given no manipulated attribution.	1976	natural

General and specific anxiety, connected with the fact of myocardial infarction (MI), were investigated in 105 patients before and at the end of posthospitalization rehabilitation.	1976	natural
Significant Trait Anxiety differences were obtained.	1975	natural
Testspecific training reduced test and trait anxiety relative to the two control groups and the generalized training reduced test anxiety relative to the waiting-list group.	1978	natural
Hence, research has generally used translated forms of inventories such as Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale and Spiel berger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, checking only for semantic equivalence and ignoring the problems of item content and typical response modes.	1979	natural
The association between maternal anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and obstetric complications was studied in 146 patients using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	1979	natural
However, the significantly greater likelihood of observing anxiety among dissatisfied reflective than satisfied reflective subjects is indicative of the degree to which dissatisfaction is a source of anxiety beyond that attributable to reflection alone.	1977	natural
Since subjective perceptions of anxiety responses are psychologically significant behaviors, these data suggest the importance of conveying a high expectation of improvement to SD and perhaps also to other types of therapy clients.	1976	natural
Type IV individuals are hypothesized and indeed observed to be anxious and to show intermediate (in-between) responses to the anxiety questionnaire (Cattell Anxiety Scale).	1975	natural
A model of a hypothesized factor structure underlying scores on these scales and some anxiety and extraversion scales was tested in a group of students (N = 225).	1976	natural
The present experiment explored the utility of finger pulse volume (FPV) as a measure of anxiety.	1976	natural
This investigation examined the effects of test-wiseness on test anxiety, self-concept, and standardized test results.	1977	natural
Results indicated that the pervasive form of anxiety, social anxiety, is significantly correlated with only irrational thinking, while the situation-specific form of anxiety, acrophobia, is significantly correlated with both irrationality and negative self-statements.	1979	natural
In general, findings support the existence of meaningful relationships between greater externality and higher levels of both general trait anxiety and test anxiety.	1979	natural
At follow-up, 47 yr later, and with many, especially and significantly the less obsessional, recovered from their anorexia nervosa, there is evident instead a high level of phobic anxiety related to social circumstances.	1977	natural
Analyses of variance confirmed that assertiveness relates inversely and highly significantly (P < 00005) with measures of neuroticism, trait anxiety and interpersonal anxiety for both males and females.	1975	natural
The differences in initial mean scores between the outcome groups indicates that anxiety is implicated with poor outcome.	1978	natural
In this study of the mechanisms underlying language conditioning the subjects were volunteers who had indicated anxiety concerning a variety of small animals.	1978	natural
The problem of whether Christian faith increases or decreases thanataphobia (fear of death or anxiety regarding it) was investigated.	1975	natural
On both verbal rating scales the test-specific group showed greater test anxiety reductions over both controls while the generalized group showed anxiety reduction only over the waiting-list group on the first scale.	1978	natural
Therefore, these results suggest a dominant mode of transmission for anxiety neurosis.	1979	natural
On 3-week follow-up, the therapy sample showed significantly more improvement than the controls on measures of blood pressure, physical symptoms, anxiety, hysteroid tendencies, disturbed feelings and self-image.	1978	natural
It was concluded that crosscultural comparisons of anxiety are enhanced by separating situational and reactional aspect of anxiety and by making crosscultural descriptions by profiles of reactions across different kinds of anxiety provocative situations.	1978	natural
A new theoretical framework for work on anxiety and memory is proposed.	1979	natural
The obtained correlations support the contention that the MAS may measure more accurately a dimension of neuroticism and/or negative self-concept rather than anxiety.	1975	natural
It is concluded that results from the Inventory, when generalized to other omnibus inventories of anxiety, do not have the drastic implications that have been previously claimed.	1975	natural
Since the excessive test anxiety in the patient group contributes to both increased physiological activity and increased threat appraisal, it is suggested that SCR habituation testing be undertaken when both patient and control groups can be brought to equivalent states of relaxation.	1975	natural
A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed general anxiety and death concern.	1977	natural
It is suggested that this incomplete, undifferentiated, and often inaccurate picture of female genitals prevents the growing girl from achieving pride in femininity, and may lead to anxiety and confusion regarding her sexuality.	1976	natural
Anticipation of flight induced anxiety arousal and significant directional changes in plasma FFA, corticosteroids, as well as in VMA excretion.	1975	natural
Donor status is associated with a well-integrated body image and acceptance of mortality, while nondonor status correlates with a less-well-integrated body image, concern about body integrity, and anxiety about death.	1976	natural
No differences in behavioral manifestations of anxiety were found for either treatment group relative to the control group.	1978	natural
The authors conclude that parental overprotection associated with asthma is likely to reflect an adaptational response by parents to a child with a chronic, unpredictable illness arousing high levels of anxiety in parents.	1979	natural
This study investigated the nature and effects of test anxiety in terms of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological responses in an academic testing situation.	1979	natural
Schachter's (13) theory of emotions as cognitive labels attached to undifferentiated states of internal arousal was applied to findings of Sarason (10) and his colleagues concerning the performance effects of test anxiety.	1975	natural
However, debilitating anxiety among some of the black students affected their performance on the initial task so that the performance biracially was confounded.	1977	natural
Results indicate that: a) FPV was sensitive to changes in experimentally manipulated anxiety, and b) FPV and PR were temporally, differentially responsive as measures of anxiety: FPV was more responsive initially and recovered more quickly than PR following the introduction of threat.	1977	natural
Irrespective of the fear level of the message, the similar communicator produced more immediate behavior change than the dissimilar communicator, and correlations showed that anxiety reports were unrelated to behavior change.	1978	natural
classroom examination, test-retest correlations ranged from .66 (first and second administrations of A-State of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) to .83 (second administration of A-Trait and second administration of A-State).	1977	natural
The relationship between anxiety and caffeinated beverages was studied using Spielberger's questionnaire and additional questions concerning the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and the students' estimated GPA.	1978	natural
