This proclivity towards secrecy, which stands in contradiction to the psychoanalytic principle of total frankness and demystification, is illustrated by a number of examples-the suggestion made by Jones to Ferenczi and Freud in 1911 for the formation of a secret committee to supervise the development of psychoanalysis; the censorship practised by Jones in connection with the use of the Freud Archives; and the case history of Emmy von N., where Freud assumes the role of depositary for the memories communicated by his patient under mental_illness and observes strict secrecy about them.	1992	synthetic_hypnosis
