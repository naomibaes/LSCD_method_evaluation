Dementia family caregivers (n = 122) were assessed in relation to the following variables: stressors (time since caregiving began, daily hours caring, frequency of behavioral problems, patient's functional status); appraisal (caregiver's appraisal of behavioral problems), caregiver's personal resources (self-efficacy, spiritual meaning, social support), and outcomes (depression and anxiety).	2012	natural
