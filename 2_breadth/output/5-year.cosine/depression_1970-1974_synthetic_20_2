Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural

The initial depression in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group recovered to control values by 6 weeks.	1970	natural
These findings support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that qualitative implications of events influence their effects.	1974	natural
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of depression, suggestions, and time.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
Factor analysis of items indicated qualitative similarities across the countries studied, as evidenced by the fact that loadings were larger on items reflecting the psychological features of depression in all countries studied.	1972	natural
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading depression.	1974	natural
The results obtainedno depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	natural
It did not correlate significantly with any of the measures of depression.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
Results showed a significant change in problematic behaviors, in Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	1973	natural
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, anxiety and hostility.	1973	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	1974	natural
Although these symptoms following laboratory depression were not found to be severe, their presence is of importance both for theoretical and practical reasons.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
Increase in work level coupled to drinking up to approximately 4 times the work of drinking freely available water produced no depression of water intake before tumor transplant and no further depression after tumor transplant.	1972	natural
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but states of anxiety and depression were also often associated with insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1973	natural
The depression in drinking caused by food deprivation persisted even when glucose, saccharin and NaCl were given in place of water.	1972	natural
On retesting there was a marked improvement in depressive symptomatology but little change in depression levels.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
