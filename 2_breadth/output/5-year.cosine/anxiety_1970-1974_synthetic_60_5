Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the anxiety, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	1971	synthetic_delusion

The role of anxiety in relation to the production of antisocial behavior is re-evaluated.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
anxiety can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1970	synthetic_depression
In the present study, the relationship between the presence od emotional asthma precipitants and the amount of PERF response, and the possibility that anxiety was mediating the effect were investigated.	1972	natural
However, the belief that antisocial behavior is not possible under anxiety helps to prevent the evoking of such behavior since operators are seldom successful in inducing phenomena in which they do not believe.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
anxiety may be a useful way of approaching motivational problems in rehabilitating patients who manifest negativism toward conventional treatment.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in higher levels of shame anxiety.	1972	natural
The methods and results of both studies were summarized, and the same conclusion was reached: that anxiety supplemented by autohypnosis was significantly more effective than control procedures.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
It is pointed out that, though it has been shown that Ss are able to simulate successfully and can deceive highly trained hypnotists, this observation does not challenge the reality of S's experience nor does it question the genuineness of anxiety.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
Various control conditions appear to rule out injection anxiety as a reason for the lauter failure.	1970	synthetic_trauma
Performance measures, as well as test and state anxiety scores were obtained.	1974	natural

The effects of anxiety and anger on the visual evoked potentials generated by exposure to visual stimuli (circle or square as compared to blank card) did not for 80 human Ss modify the latencies or the amplitude of P1, P2, N1 and N2 peaks.	1974	natural
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated anxiety scores and reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_depression
Certain similarities existing in cases of anxiety and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1974	synthetic_depression
In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state anxiety is altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	1972	natural
Analyses of variance indicated that Ss experiencing facilitating test anxiety had significantly higher grade-point averages than those experiencing debilitating test anxiety.	1973	natural

Further, no evidence is available to indicate that anxiety increases the behavioral control of the hypnotist over that already present prior to its induction.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
Through anxiety: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
