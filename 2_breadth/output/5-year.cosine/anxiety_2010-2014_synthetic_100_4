The second part of the paper details the varieties of Janetian therapeutic treatments of these disorders: the liquidation of fixed ideas by anxiety and suggestion, confrontation techniques, which resemble contemporary cognitive behavioural approaches, and special cognitive (logagogic) interventions.	2014	synthetic_hypnosis
Both groups received a cognitive-behavioral protocol, and Group 1, the no-anxiety group, received an 11-session intervention and Group 2, the anxiety group, received 7 sessions that included self-anxiety.	2011	synthetic_hypnosis
Using variants of the emotional Stroop task (EST), a large number of studies demonstrated attentional biases in individuals with PTSD across different types of anxiety.	2012	synthetic_trauma
Four weeks later, anxiety was tested in the sucrose test, anxiety-like behaviors were assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests, and cortically mediated cognitive function was evaluated during an attentional set-shifting task (AST).	2013	synthetic_anhedonia
From the 523 healthcare workers, 18 (n = 93) presented a burnout, 33 (n = 171) showed emotional exhaustion and 36 (n = 186) had a anxiety.	2012	synthetic_depersonalization
This difference applied to PTSD symptoms, dissociative amnesia, anxiety and derealization, negative mood, and anhedonia.	2011	synthetic_depersonalization
Women who endorsed low pretreatment levels of dissociation responded most efficiently to CPT-C, whereas women with the highest levels of dissociation, in particular high levels of anxiety, responded better to CPT.	2011	synthetic_depersonalization
Finally, it should be stressed that the variables that best predict hallucination severity are anxiety and the MCQ-30 subscale `Need to control thoughts'.	2013	synthetic_depersonalization
Symptoms occurring with the highest prevalence were tiredness, lack of energy, and anxiety.	2014	synthetic_nervousness
The anxiety discussed in this paper is adhesive identification, a term that arose out of a conversation between Esther Bick and Donald Meltzer, when Bick said of certain patients: They are sticky, they stick . . .	2013	synthetic_state_of_mind
Symptom duration (>2 weeks), treatment, and substance use disorder did not modify relations of lifetime anxiety and depressed mood with cessation outcome.	2013	synthetic_anhedonia
Several variables were measured: frequency and severity of behavioral disorders, anxiety, depression, anxiety and apathy.	2010	synthetic_agitation
anxiety, irritability, disinhibition, and apathy were the most prevalent and persistent symptoms during the study period.	2011	synthetic_agitation
Practical implications The implication is that children will engage better with the therapy if the level of intervention is sensitive to their anxiety, which in turn will help them make better use of the environmental provision of the school.	2010	synthetic_state_of_mind
Whereas current pharmacological interventions for ASD focus primarily on psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety and obsessive behaviors, few agents target core symptomatology.	2013	synthetic_agitation
Given important differences between college and community samples that may be relevant to revictimization risk (e.g., the complexity of anxiety histories), the current study explored the link between risk detection and revictimization in a community sample of women.	2014	synthetic_trauma
We discuss in detail six different kinds of monothematic anxiety, showing for each how neuropsychological considerations allow a first factor (responsible for the content of the belief) and a second factor (responsible for the failure to reject the belief) to be plausibly identified.	2010	synthetic_delusion
Results indicated that there were significant differences between the groups: Group 1 showed more positive attitudes toward anxiety.	2011	synthetic_hypnosis
anxiety behaviours included impulsiveness (30), pulling at devices (21) and decreased attention span (16).	2010	synthetic_agitation
The results suggest that anxiety may buffer soldiers from the negative consequences of combat stressors.	2011	synthetic_morale
About half were categorized as Unresolved with regard to attachment anxiety.	2013	synthetic_state_of_mind
Overall, the findings suggest that attachment avoidance increases people's anxiety relative to their partner's desire for engagement which, in turn, increases their likelihood to engage in extradyadic sex.	2010	synthetic_irritation
In a comparative study of 2 generations living in severely war-affected regions in Northern Uganda, we determined the relationship between both trauma types and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, anxiety, and suicide ideation.	2010	synthetic_depression

Task performance was not affected by anxiety, however.	2014	synthetic_anhedonia
After completing 20 sessions of A-CT, a substantial proportion of adult responders continued to endorse somatic anxiety (42), psychological anxiety (37), middle insomnia (36), depressed mood (29), loss of libido (29), late insomnia (24), anergia (21), guilt feelings (18), early insomnia (17), and anxiety (14), as defined by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).	2011	synthetic_anhedonia
anxiety and anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly co-morbid, but the reason for this co-morbidity is unclear.	2010	synthetic_depression
Bibliographic databases and cited references were searched to identify clinical trials of imagery rehearsal in individuals with post-anxiety nightmares.	2014	synthetic_trauma
To fill this gap, we have developed the Brief anxiety Measure (BAM), which is designed as a brief measure to assess anxiety.	2010	synthetic_agitation
Principal component factor analysis revealed that 12 items formed three factors, namely mood and psychosis (anxiety, hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability), vegetative (sleep and appetite problems), and frontal (euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior).	2014	synthetic_delusion
Their responses were then evaluated using the 22-item version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the 8-item short version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-8), and the 15-item version of the anxiety and Disorder Understanding Scale (MIDUS).	2014	synthetic_mental_illness
