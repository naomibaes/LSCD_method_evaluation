The results leave open interpretations that are based on trauma, which was not controlled for.	2007	synthetic_anhedonia
By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the trauma then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	2009	synthetic_delusion
The course was beneficial for participants with mild or severe trauma, and treatment acceptability was high.	2005	synthetic_depression
Substance abuse, psychiatric symptoms, trauma, and social adjustment were assessed at baseline and study endpoint.	2006	synthetic_anhedonia

The assessment was conducted to determine whether the woman's descriptions of her torture and the resulting symptoms of psychological trauma were consistent with a credible claim of political persecution.	2005	natural
Thus our study, although at preliminary level, suggests that the presence of T allele of the 102T/C polymorphism in patients with Alzheimer's disease is associated with both increased presence of trauma symptoms and treatment-resistance to second generation antipsychotic drugs.	2007	synthetic_delusion
Women with an insecure trauma regarding attachment at one year were seven times more likely to report ongoing depression.	2008	synthetic_state_of_mind
These include the challenges of characterizing trauma and grandiosity; differentiating mania from comorbid symptoms, rages, sequelae of maltreatment, and typical developmental phenomena; and the unique manifestations of psychosis.	2008	synthetic_elation
Mothers with higher levels of depressive symptoms had children with higher levels of trauma severity at baseline and over the course of treatment.	2008	synthetic_depression

In addition to strategies taught in the intervention (self-trauma and positive self-statements), students developed individual strategies, which differed from intervention strategies by being perceived as consistently within their control and being useful when other strategies did not work.	2006	synthetic_hypnosis
