Responses obtained during and after anxiety are utilized to uncover underlying conflicts and fears.	1979	synthetic_hypnosis
The index appears to measure subjective aspects of anxiety and correctly categorizes a large percentage of depressed patients.	1975	synthetic_depression
General and specific anxiety, connected with the fact of myocardial infarction (MI), were investigated in 105 patients before and at the end of posthospitalization rehabilitation.	1976	natural
Significant Trait Anxiety differences were obtained.	1975	natural
Testspecific training reduced test and trait anxiety relative to the two control groups and the generalized training reduced test anxiety relative to the waiting-list group.	1978	natural
Hence, research has generally used translated forms of inventories such as Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale and Spiel berger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, checking only for semantic equivalence and ignoring the problems of item content and typical response modes.	1979	natural
The association between maternal anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and obstetric complications was studied in 146 patients using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	1979	natural
However, the significantly greater likelihood of observing anxiety among dissatisfied reflective than satisfied reflective subjects is indicative of the degree to which dissatisfaction is a source of anxiety beyond that attributable to reflection alone.	1977	natural
Since subjective perceptions of anxiety responses are psychologically significant behaviors, these data suggest the importance of conveying a high expectation of improvement to SD and perhaps also to other types of therapy clients.	1976	natural
Type IV individuals are hypothesized and indeed observed to be anxious and to show intermediate (in-between) responses to the anxiety questionnaire (Cattell Anxiety Scale).	1975	natural
A model of a hypothesized factor structure underlying scores on these scales and some anxiety and extraversion scales was tested in a group of students (N = 225).	1976	natural
The present experiment explored the utility of finger pulse volume (FPV) as a measure of anxiety.	1976	natural
This investigation examined the effects of test-wiseness on test anxiety, self-concept, and standardized test results.	1977	natural
Results indicated that the pervasive form of anxiety, social anxiety, is significantly correlated with only irrational thinking, while the situation-specific form of anxiety, acrophobia, is significantly correlated with both irrationality and negative self-statements.	1979	natural
Half of the subjects in each group were depressed as measured on the Beck anxiety Inventory; the other half were nondepressed.	1979	synthetic_depression
At follow-up, 47 yr later, and with many, especially and significantly the less obsessional, recovered from their anorexia nervosa, there is evident instead a high level of phobic anxiety related to social circumstances.	1977	natural
Analyses of variance confirmed that assertiveness relates inversely and highly significantly (P < 00005) with measures of neuroticism, trait anxiety and interpersonal anxiety for both males and females.	1975	natural
All disabled groups scored significantly higher on the anxiety scale than the nondisabled group.	1975	synthetic_depression
In this study of the mechanisms underlying language conditioning the subjects were volunteers who had indicated anxiety concerning a variety of small animals.	1978	natural
A review of previous studies failed to show any differences between anxiety and antenatal training in terms of outcome.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis
On both verbal rating scales the test-specific group showed greater test anxiety reductions over both controls while the generalized group showed anxiety reduction only over the waiting-list group on the first scale.	1978	natural
Therefore, these results suggest a dominant mode of transmission for anxiety neurosis.	1979	natural
On 3-week follow-up, the therapy sample showed significantly more improvement than the controls on measures of blood pressure, physical symptoms, anxiety, hysteroid tendencies, disturbed feelings and self-image.	1978	natural
It was concluded that crosscultural comparisons of anxiety are enhanced by separating situational and reactional aspect of anxiety and by making crosscultural descriptions by profiles of reactions across different kinds of anxiety provocative situations.	1978	natural
A new theoretical framework for work on anxiety and memory is proposed.	1979	natural
The obtained correlations support the contention that the MAS may measure more accurately a dimension of neuroticism and/or negative self-concept rather than anxiety.	1975	natural
It is concluded that results from the Inventory, when generalized to other omnibus inventories of anxiety, do not have the drastic implications that have been previously claimed.	1975	natural
Since the excessive test anxiety in the patient group contributes to both increased physiological activity and increased threat appraisal, it is suggested that SCR habituation testing be undertaken when both patient and control groups can be brought to equivalent states of relaxation.	1975	natural
A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed general anxiety and death concern.	1977	natural
It is suggested that this incomplete, undifferentiated, and often inaccurate picture of female genitals prevents the growing girl from achieving pride in femininity, and may lead to anxiety and confusion regarding her sexuality.	1976	natural
Anticipation of flight induced anxiety arousal and significant directional changes in plasma FFA, corticosteroids, as well as in VMA excretion.	1975	natural
Donor status is associated with a well-integrated body image and acceptance of mortality, while nondonor status correlates with a less-well-integrated body image, concern about body integrity, and anxiety about death.	1976	natural
A review of the literature relating to multiple personality is presented together with a study of a single case of hysterical aetiology that demonstrates the development of multiple personality from a anxiety amnesic state.	1975	synthetic_fugue
anxiety was used with 18 children aged 4 years, 7 months to 10 years, 1 month, with a mean age of 6 years, 8 months.	1975	synthetic_hypnosis
anxiety was assigned by coroners significantly more often than by the psychologists.	1975	synthetic_depression
Schachter's (13) theory of emotions as cognitive labels attached to undifferentiated states of internal arousal was applied to findings of Sarason (10) and his colleagues concerning the performance effects of test anxiety.	1975	natural
However, debilitating anxiety among some of the black students affected their performance on the initial task so that the performance biracially was confounded.	1977	natural
Results indicate that: a) FPV was sensitive to changes in experimentally manipulated anxiety, and b) FPV and PR were temporally, differentially responsive as measures of anxiety: FPV was more responsive initially and recovered more quickly than PR following the introduction of threat.	1977	natural
Irrespective of the fear level of the message, the similar communicator produced more immediate behavior change than the dissimilar communicator, and correlations showed that anxiety reports were unrelated to behavior change.	1978	natural
classroom examination, test-retest correlations ranged from .66 (first and second administrations of A-State of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) to .83 (second administration of A-Trait and second administration of A-State).	1977	natural
The relationship between anxiety and caffeinated beverages was studied using Spielberger's questionnaire and additional questions concerning the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and the students' estimated GPA.	1978	natural
The students were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after taking both forms of this test.	1977	natural
Endogenous anxiety overwhelms the individual without a known or external causal event; the authors suggest that it is both constitutionally and biochemically based.	1977	synthetic_depression
