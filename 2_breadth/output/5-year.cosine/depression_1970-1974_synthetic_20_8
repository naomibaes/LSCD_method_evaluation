Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1971	natural

Mothers of children with emotional problems had significantly higher scores on five clinical scales when compared with control mothers as expected: Depression (D), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), and Hypomania (Ma).	1974	natural

At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the depression had ameliorated.	1972	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	1972	natural
Activity did not influence the rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a temporary reduction in food intake and a sustained depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1972	natural

Out of 36 acute myocardial infraction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as hnon-deniers; all were scored for anxiety, depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1974	natural
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	1973	natural
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1972	natural
In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state depression is altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	1973	natural
However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.	1971	natural
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since depression of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	1972	synthetic_dissociation
Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1970	natural
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low depression levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
Unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1973	natural
Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
These findings are discussed in connection with concomitant findings of depression and reduced energy output among juvenile-onset obese subjects after weight reduction.	1973	natural
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading depression.	1974	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1973	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1974	natural
The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present before admission.	1972	natural

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1973	natural
