Multivariate analysis of risk factors suggested that, in contrast to much of the abuse literature, among both genders workplace abuse seemed to have at least as much to do with a system of routine activities mechanisms-a victim's conscious or unconscious sexual signaling, more exposure to potential harassers, and a perpetrator's lower cost of abuse-as with unobserved differences in power between victim and perpetrator.	2005	synthetic_harassment

High abuse for rules is fairly stable during early childhood and is associated with risk factors identifiable before and shortly after birth which may be used for targeted prevention.	2009	synthetic_disregard
Assessing the incidence, nature, severity, and psychological effects of stalking and relational abuse for victims is a difficult task and conceptual issues have hampered previous research, making it difficult for psychologists and clinicians to predict psychological sequelae for victims and develop appropriate treatments.	2008	synthetic_harassment
These findings also support recent speculation that mens sexual abuse of women is related to aggression rather than seduction.	2009	synthetic_harassment
Generally, either anxious or avoidant individuals were less likely to perceive positive emotion (happy) from facial expressions, and anxious and less avoidant individuals perceived other-oriented negative emotions (anger, disgust, and abuse).	2006	synthetic_contempt
These findings highlight the continuing need to expand current efforts to reduce and curtail abuse based on perceived sexual orientation.	2009	synthetic_harassment
Sexual abuse has consistently negative consequences for working women, including changes in job attitudes (e.g., lower satisfaction) and behaviors (e.g., increased work withdrawal).	2005	synthetic_harassment
Critical elements prompting such behavior include: an individual perceives a narcissistic injury that is experienced as being profoundly unfair; the individual has no hope for achieving a reasonable resolution of the injury; the individual reaches the decision that the injury cannot be tolerated further and must be responded to with action; the individual has access to weapons to enhance the capacity and potency to respond; and the individual feels a sufficient sense of potency and/or abuse of the consequences to initiate violence.	2007	synthetic_disregard
Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) changes from baseline to three tasks--anger recall, speech role-play, and mental arithmetic with abuse--were assessed.	2009	synthetic_harassment
The negative consequences for victims of sexual abuse are well documented.	2008	synthetic_harassment

Determining how one appears to observers requires one to utilize public information that is available to observers, but to abuse private information that they do not possess.	2009	synthetic_disregard
We find that environmental jolt is likely to shift customers' cognition, which is an important source of opportunity and, in turn, catalyzes opportunity abuse through innovations for value creation.	2005	synthetic_exploitation
The belief that sadomasochism (SM) is violence or abusive behavior has resulted in abuse, physical attacks, and discrimination against SM-identified individuals.	2009	synthetic_harassment
Cardiovascular parameters were obtained at 2-minute intervals during a 10-minute baseline period and a 20-minute recovery period, and at 1-minute intervals during a 4-minute anger recall task and a 4-minute serial subtraction task without abuse.	2006	synthetic_harassment
