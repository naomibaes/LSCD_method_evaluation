Scales differ according to the source of information (e.g., caregiver versus patient), type of behavior assessed (e.g., mood, depression, or delusions), origin of the scale (i.e., imported from psychiatry, adapted from psychiatric scales, adapted from scales for neurologic conditions, or developed specifically for dementia), and anticipated application of the tool (e.g., behavioral characterization, longitudinal follow-up, or differential diagnosis).	1996	synthetic_agitation
It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behaviour at a future time, thus distinguishing it from depression and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	1997	synthetic_anxiety
However, it is well known that cognitive ERP components show a high variability due to changes of depression during an experimental session.	1999	synthetic_cognitive_state
The finding that repressive affective-autonomic depression actually occurs during emotion induction itself is discussed in terms of a systems theory of self-regulation and health.	1996	synthetic_dissociation
depression is inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity, which is common among older persons with dementia.	1997	synthetic_agitation
Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and depression) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression.	1997	synthetic_agitation
The present study investigated the relationship between depression sensitivity and depression.	1999	synthetic_anxiety
Transcultural influences were found in the detailed contents of the 'negative' delusions; specific and direct themes of persecutory depression, i.e., delusions of poisoning, and religious themes of guilt/sin were conspicuous in Europe, while amorphous delusions of reference such as 'being slandered' were predominant in Japan.	1997	synthetic_delusion
However, the data revealed that both junior and senior enlisted soldiers in the first battalion had significantly lower depression and family adjustment ratings than the soldiers sent to replace them.	1995	synthetic_morale
For both groups, the visual analog scale ratings revealed significant mood elevation and decreased depression following self injury, with a peak in dissociative symptoms during self injury.	1996	synthetic_dissociation
