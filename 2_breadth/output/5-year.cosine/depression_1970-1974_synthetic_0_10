The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by recent disturbance of sleep, appetite and weight, by complaints of depression, restlessness, indecisiveness and sense of strain and by an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco and tranquilizers.	1972	natural
These findings support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that qualitative implications of events influence their effects.	1974	natural

The group with organic disease had been shown to have evidence of anxiety and depression.	1972	natural
Psychologic evaluation failed to reveal common psychodynamic issues, but suggested marked secondary depression, generalized distortion of body image, and in certain cases, cognitive impairement which was undetected on conventional mental status exam.	1970	natural
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	1972	natural
Unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1973	natural
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through depression, to mania.	1974	natural
This was the case for the scales Hs, D, Hy, Pt, Sc and for Becks depression scale.	1972	natural
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of depression seen in Western culture.	1974	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
Occlusion of one eye and functional hemidecortication by cortical spreading depression (CSD) were used to examine the relative importance of crossed and uncrossed visual projections for pattern discrimination learning in hooded and albino rats.	1971	natural
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of anxiety or depression, which are specifically associated with different degrees of relative weight.	1974	natural
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	1970	natural
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1972	natural
The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating Depression Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	1972	natural
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1970	natural
The Masked Depression Syndrome is to be observed in two types which overlap eachother smoothly, i.e. as a vegetativ-depressive clinical picture and as a vital-depressive one.	1973	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	1974	natural
The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and a long-chain depression effect in the last two segments.	1973	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in quicker reaction times and growth depression as manifested in lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	1973	natural
A rating scale for depression, intended for international studies of drug treatment, is presented.	1973	natural
Depression was found to be four times greater in the urban areas as compared to the rural (6.1 and 1.5 per 1000, respectively).	1973	natural
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, mania, and healthy controls.	1972	natural
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	1972	natural
These findings are discussed in connection with concomitant findings of depression and reduced energy output among juvenile-onset obese subjects after weight reduction.	1973	natural
Single waves of unilateral depression increased the onset-latencies and decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1973	natural
The lack of transfer could be due to the necessity of neocortex for learning this task or due to stimulus factors associated with left or right hemispheric depression.	1972	natural
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
A significant depression in FWI and UFO was seen at estrus.	1971	natural
Anxiety-fear, hostility and depression were intercorrelated for the group as a whole.	1974	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
Rate of occurrence of depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been investigated.	1973	natural
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale show: patients with functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital differ from a normal control group significantly.	1972	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
To determine the effects of single waves of cortical spreading depression on elicited behavior, 1,1 animals were tested with 10 sec trains of stimulation at 20 sec intervals and administered 15 l of 6 KCl through cannulae onto the frontal or occipital cortices of the contralateral or ipsilateral hemispheres.	1973	natural
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
Admissions for organic psychosis show the highest retention rate over time, and those for reactive depression the lowest.	1970	natural
