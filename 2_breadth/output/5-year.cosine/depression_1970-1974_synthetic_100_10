Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the depression, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	1972	synthetic_delusion
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce depression and despair over future difficulties.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

931); depression and GPA are significantly related for males at the linear level (F =3.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
A clear depression between the two curves was found, suggesting that there are RA processes which do not depend on incubation.	1972	synthetic_dissociation
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status depression due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	1970	synthetic_dissociation

The self concept of the XYY group in general, was found to be less mature and often associated with high levels of depression.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
In a study of motor conflict resolution, 20 Ss in each of two groups, designated as high drive (HD) and low drive (LD) according to scores on the Taylor Manifest depression Scale, had to resolve approach-approach (AP-AP), avoidance-avoidance (AV-AV), and double approach-avoidance (DAP-AV) conflicts.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Higher depression scores significantly limited student perception among 3-, 4-, and 5-word length phrases (r's from .37 to .40, p < .01).	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Both procedures resulted in decreased depression measured by Taylor's Manifest depression Scale, and a modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The results produced three combinations of scores which yielded statistically reliable canonical-correlation coefficients: three fear factors related to psychotic levels of personality disorganization; two related to fairly directly experienced neurotic depression; and five related to neurotic levels of depression bound by somatic complaints.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The literature concerned with the depression-motor behavior relationship was reviewed using the state-trait depression distinction.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The depression/methodofassessment interaction was significant and in the predicted direction.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

The Sanford-Gough Rigidity Test, the Taylor Manifest depression Scale, a group Holtzman Inkblot Test, and an experimenter-designed Perceptual Rigidity test were given to 116 college girls to investigate determinants of responses to projective tests and to clarify the relationship between personality and perception.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The results indicated a significant difference in terms of depression reduction between the no-treatment control group and the implosive-therapy group.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
In addition to the usual depression reduction procedures an arousal reconditioning procedure was employed.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
This study explored rumor transmission as a function of the depression of the group exposed to that rumor.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Implicitly or explicitly, linkage is a basic concept in all theories of cognitive consistency consistency or inconsistency can exist only with reference to entities which are cognitively linked through association or depression.	1973	synthetic_dissociation
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a weak defense mechanism against depression.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Both self-concept measures and an depression measure were administered to 25 boys and 23 girls.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Heart rate, skin conductance, and subjective depression ratings all differentiated significantly between phobic and neutral imagery.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Brief relaxation training did not significantly affect either verbal report of depression or autonomic level following training, but did affect autonomic response in the depression conditions.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
2 new depression-specific constructs were developed and termed desirability of depression and locus of control in depression.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating depression.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The genesis of this situation is shown through a review of the works listed in the bibliography; the confusion reigning in this field being due, among others, to the following aspects: the different meanings assigned to the term shading; the use of aprioristic theoretical frames of reference; the attribution of aprioristic symbolic meanings to the content of such responses; the meaning of depression.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Rigidity has been linked to reactive inhibition and manifest depression to drive.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The central question raised is: To what extent does maladaptation and malfunctioning characterize survivors of the unimaginably extreme, prolonged depression of the Nazi concentration camps, and to what extent do we find successful adaptation among such persons?	1970	synthetic_trauma
The purpose of the present study was to assess the relation between birth order and depression using direct and objective measures.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
