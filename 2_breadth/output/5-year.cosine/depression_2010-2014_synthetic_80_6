Both authors find themselves committed to history taking, to needing and taking time, to a willingness to wait before interpreting, to a recognition that the self derives originally from a bodily state of unintegration, that the body remains significant for the expression of selfstates, to an understanding of aggression as not primarily associated with destructiveness, to attending to the depression in the analyst that encourages the establishment and maintenance of the analytic setting.	2011	synthetic_state_of_mind

Results provide limited support for the hypothesis that individuals with elevated dietary restraint scores show greater reward sensitivity and cognitive bias for food stimuli, though it is possible that the null findings on the behavioral task resulted because of an approach-avoidance conflict to food cues in which heightened appetitive responses to food are inhibited by food-related depression.	2014	synthetic_anxiety
