More importantly, in a new experiment ( =410), we found a pattern of two concurrent selective associations, supporting the theoretical distinction between the two factors: HonestyHumility (but not Agreeableness) predicted active cooperation (non-abuse in the dictator game), whereas Agreeableness (but not HonestyHumility) was linked to reactive cooperation (non-retaliation in the ultimatum game).	2011	synthetic_exploitation
