Patients treated with venlafaxine XR had significantly higher rates of response than patients receiving placebo on the psychic (58 vs. 38, P<.001 at week 8; 66 vs. 35 at week 24, P<.001) and somatic (56 vs. 43, P<.001 at week 8; 67 vs. 47 at week 24, P<.001) factors of the HAM-A. There was a TreatmentxFactor interaction (P<.027) in response rates: Patients treated with venlafaxine showed similar somatic and psychic anxiety response rates, whereas placebo-treated patients showed higher somatic compared with psychic response rates.	2004	natural
Longitudinal studies are needed to show whether there is a trait such as a relatively stable dissociation component and also whether a separate state-dependent dissociation component exists that is associated with coincident distress, somatization and anxiety.	2004	synthetic_depression
On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by anxiety-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	2004	synthetic_delusion
