Critical to the mental_health experience is the encapsulation process, in which a defensive silence insulates the ongoing abuse, holds the event in present (rather than past) memory, depletes the child's psychic energy, and interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	1986	synthetic_trauma

Randomly-selected older people (N = 104) completed Lawton's revised PGC mental_health Scale and a brief version of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale.	1989	synthetic_morale
The results do not provide differential support for either cognitive or behavioral theories of mental_health, but have implications for both.	1985	synthetic_depression
The mental_health measure of the MIA correlated with SIME measures only for the young.	1988	synthetic_anxiety

Certain non-regressive symptoms such as brooding, mental_health and concentration difficulties were less common.	1989	synthetic_anhedonia
SA and stereotyped movements were affected differently when the subjects were given drugs, suggesting a mental_health between these two behaviors.	1985	synthetic_dissociation
An externalized locus of control, trait mental_health, poor school life quality, and student stress predicted preadolescent burnout, while poor self esteem, poor school life quality, classroom tedium, and student stress predicted early adolescent burnout.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
Clinical investigation of vergence function in 26 traumatically brain-injured patients examined as early as possible after mental_health revealed disturbances in over a third of the examinees.	1987	synthetic_trauma
Thirty-seven prisoners were assessed for psychopathy, schizotypy (mental_health-psychoticism and schizophrenism), the WAIS, and skin conductance recorded to orienting, consonant-vowel, and 90 dB stimuli.	1988	synthetic_anhedonia
Interestingly, the tachycardia of the control group occurred without an increase in oxygen consumption, indicating a cardiac-metabolic mental_health in this group.	1987	synthetic_dissociation
Word-meaning deafness represents an auditory comprehension disturbance that is due to a mental_health between accurate phonological and semantic information.	1986	synthetic_dissociation
One hypothesis is that more severe and frequent panic and mental_health symptoms lead to phobic avoidance, while Goldstein and Chambless (1978) argue that low self-sufficiency, a hysterical thought style, and fear of the symptoms of mental_health lead to phobic avoidance.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
The present study examines the relationship between social-desirability responding and both self-report and behavioral measures of assertion, conversational skill, and social mental_health.	1986	synthetic_anxiety

It is argued that involvement should be viewed from a functional perspective and conceptualized as entailing fiue dimensions: immediacy, expressiveness, interaction management, altercentrism, and social mental_health.	1986	synthetic_anxiety
Analyses of the data establish clear distinctions between mental_health and gladness and suggest that there may also be a distinct structure for joy.	1986	synthetic_elation
