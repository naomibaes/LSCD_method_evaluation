Anxiety has a small positive relationship, and depression has no relationship to pain variables.	1979	natural
The results indicated that moderately senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the moderately senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and anxiety would be extremely useful.	1978	synthetic_depression
anxiety was assigned by coroners significantly more often than by the psychologists.	1975	synthetic_depression
Diazepam had no observable effect on blood pressure, but neither, at the dose used (15 mg/day), did it lower anxiety in these mildly anxious subjects.	1977	natural
Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and fear of death by a factor analytic multidimensional scale.	1978	natural
It was hypothesized that some of the characteristics frequently observed among the aged--such as feelings of anxiety and helphlessness, as well as accelerated physical decline--are at least in part attributable to loss of control.	1978	synthetic_depression
External endorsement was not significantly related to anxiety for the I-E item subset where options are balanced for mood level, while endorsement of internal statements was related to anxiety only for the item subset where the internal option was rated as more depressing.	1979	synthetic_depression
General and specific anxiety, connected with the fact of myocardial infarction (MI), were investigated in 105 patients before and at the end of posthospitalization rehabilitation.	1976	natural

Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, death anxiety, hypochondriasis and anxiety are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal varying degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	1977	synthetic_depersonalization
The association between maternal anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and obstetric complications was studied in 146 patients using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	1979	natural
However, the significantly greater likelihood of observing anxiety among dissatisfied reflective than satisfied reflective subjects is indicative of the degree to which dissatisfaction is a source of anxiety beyond that attributable to reflection alone.	1977	natural
Since subjective perceptions of anxiety responses are psychologically significant behaviors, these data suggest the importance of conveying a high expectation of improvement to SD and perhaps also to other types of therapy clients.	1976	natural
Type IV individuals are hypothesized and indeed observed to be anxious and to show intermediate (in-between) responses to the anxiety questionnaire (Cattell Anxiety Scale).	1975	natural
A model of a hypothesized factor structure underlying scores on these scales and some anxiety and extraversion scales was tested in a group of students (N = 225).	1976	natural
Half of the subjects in each group were depressed as measured on the Beck anxiety Inventory; the other half were nondepressed.	1979	synthetic_depression
This investigation examined the effects of test-wiseness on test anxiety, self-concept, and standardized test results.	1977	natural
Results indicated that the pervasive form of anxiety, social anxiety, is significantly correlated with only irrational thinking, while the situation-specific form of anxiety, acrophobia, is significantly correlated with both irrationality and negative self-statements.	1979	natural
However, a trend in the direction of higher correlations between externality and anxiety fot males than females suggests the possibility that perceived lack of control may be more depressing when it conflicts with expectations concerning self-reliance and mastery associated with traditional male sex roles.	1975	synthetic_depression
At follow-up, 47 yr later, and with many, especially and significantly the less obsessional, recovered from their anorexia nervosa, there is evident instead a high level of phobic anxiety related to social circumstances.	1977	natural
A review of the literature relating to multiple personality is presented together with a study of a single case of hysterical aetiology that demonstrates the development of multiple personality from a anxiety amnesic state.	1975	synthetic_fugue
Four phases of therapy are defined: a phase of disintegration and undifferentiation lasting six weeks, a phase of anxiety lasting for five weeks, a phase of multiple feelings lasting for fourt thought disorder to normal intellectual functioning, and for understanding the connections between his various experiences.	1978	synthetic_depression

Clinical findings included feelings of guilt and anxiety, negative self-image, and problems in interpersonal relationships associated with an underlying mistrust of men, inadequate social skills, and difficulties in sexual functioning.	1976	synthetic_depression
On both verbal rating scales the test-specific group showed greater test anxiety reductions over both controls while the generalized group showed anxiety reduction only over the waiting-list group on the first scale.	1978	natural
The index appears to measure subjective aspects of anxiety and correctly categorizes a large percentage of depressed patients.	1975	synthetic_depression
On 3-week follow-up, the therapy sample showed significantly more improvement than the controls on measures of blood pressure, physical symptoms, anxiety, hysteroid tendencies, disturbed feelings and self-image.	1978	natural
It was concluded that crosscultural comparisons of anxiety are enhanced by separating situational and reactional aspect of anxiety and by making crosscultural descriptions by profiles of reactions across different kinds of anxiety provocative situations.	1978	natural
A review of previous studies failed to show any differences between anxiety and antenatal training in terms of outcome.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis
The obtained correlations support the contention that the MAS may measure more accurately a dimension of neuroticism and/or negative self-concept rather than anxiety.	1975	natural
It is concluded that results from the Inventory, when generalized to other omnibus inventories of anxiety, do not have the drastic implications that have been previously claimed.	1975	natural
Since the excessive test anxiety in the patient group contributes to both increased physiological activity and increased threat appraisal, it is suggested that SCR habituation testing be undertaken when both patient and control groups can be brought to equivalent states of relaxation.	1975	natural
A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed general anxiety and death concern.	1977	natural
It is suggested that this incomplete, undifferentiated, and often inaccurate picture of female genitals prevents the growing girl from achieving pride in femininity, and may lead to anxiety and confusion regarding her sexuality.	1976	natural
Endogenous anxiety overwhelms the individual without a known or external causal event; the authors suggest that it is both constitutionally and biochemically based.	1977	synthetic_depression
Responses obtained during and after anxiety are utilized to uncover underlying conflicts and fears.	1979	synthetic_hypnosis
This discussion summarizes, critically evaluates, and attempts to integrate with each other the findings of meditative researchers, Davidson and Goleman, and Daniel Brown; the altered states of consciousness model-maker, Roland Fischer; the hypnotherapist, Sacerdote; and the generalist in altered states of consciousness and anxiety, Krippner.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis

Schachter's (13) theory of emotions as cognitive labels attached to undifferentiated states of internal arousal was applied to findings of Sarason (10) and his colleagues concerning the performance effects of test anxiety.	1975	natural
However, debilitating anxiety among some of the black students affected their performance on the initial task so that the performance biracially was confounded.	1977	natural
Results indicate that: a) FPV was sensitive to changes in experimentally manipulated anxiety, and b) FPV and PR were temporally, differentially responsive as measures of anxiety: FPV was more responsive initially and recovered more quickly than PR following the introduction of threat.	1977	natural
Irrespective of the fear level of the message, the similar communicator produced more immediate behavior change than the dissimilar communicator, and correlations showed that anxiety reports were unrelated to behavior change.	1978	natural
