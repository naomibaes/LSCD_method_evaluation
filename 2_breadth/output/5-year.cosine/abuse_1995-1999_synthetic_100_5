Assumptions about the causal antecedents of sexual desire may contribute to sexual miscommunication and the failed negotiations that result in sexual abuse and date rape.	1996	synthetic_harassment
The ability to balance these two tendencies can be considered fundamental to successful adaptation within a social unit because co-operation may be essential in raising offspring, competing with other groups or in generating resources, whereas egoistic behaviour may protect the individual from abuse or otherwise enhance reproductive success.	1999	synthetic_exploitation
Principal components analysis revealed that the respondents' poverty attributions could be distinguished along five main dimensions: abuse, characterological weaknesses of the poor, natural causes, conflict, and poor government.	1999	synthetic_exploitation

Also, there was a significant interaction between hostility and defensiveness, wherein low-defensive, highly hostile people showed substantially more abuse expression than others.	1999	synthetic_contempt
Judgments of abuse appear to be more context dependent whereas loudness judgments may reflect a perceptual process more closely related to physical aspects of the signal.	1999	synthetic_annoyance
Participants also completed the Tolerance of Sexual abuse Inventory (TSHI).	1999	synthetic_harassment

Students were more likely to perceive that they had been sexually harassed by academics than by students when sexist remarks about women's behaviour and career options were made, lending partial support to the hypothesis that hierarchical level of relationship influenced students' perceptions of sexual abuse.	1998	synthetic_harassment
