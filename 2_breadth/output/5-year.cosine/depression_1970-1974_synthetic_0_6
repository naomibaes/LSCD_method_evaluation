The subject of this interview is a 41-year-old woman with a diagnosis of Depression.	1970	natural
The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by recent disturbance of sleep, appetite and weight, by complaints of depression, restlessness, indecisiveness and sense of strain and by an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco and tranquilizers.	1972	natural
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a strong aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1973	natural
When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1973	natural
In Stage I 223 female and 213 male undergraduates named the behaviors they associated with 6 emotions: sadness, anger, depression, hostility, fear and anxiety.	1972	natural
Samples of Americans of Japanese, Chinese, and European ancestry evidencing clinical levels of depression were administered a depression symptom checklist, and the results were submitted to a factor analysis.	1973	natural
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
The D scale (Depression) and the Pt scale (Psychasthenia) were selected as sensitive indicators of self-perception; comparison of pre- and post-treatment scores indicated improvement on both scales (D scale, p = .001; Pt scale, p = .02) as a function of the cosmetic.	1970	natural
Changes noted during separation were depression of activity play, contact play, mixed play, object manipulation, and sex play.	1973	natural
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	1973	natural
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, anxiety and hostility.	1973	natural
Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to behavioral depression, motor and EEG seizures.	1971	natural
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1973	natural
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and somatic complaints), are promising.	1974	natural
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been less marked in patients showing overt depression than in patients who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1972	natural
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a marked transfer when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1971	natural
It did not correlate significantly with any of the measures of depression.	1970	natural
Eight factors were extracted which were named: Neuroticism, Anti-social behavior, Fundamentalist religiosity, Subjectivity, Introversion, Paranoic tendency, Depression and Physical symptoms.	1974	natural
Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded depression did not emerge.	1972	natural
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression.	1972	natural
There was a high incidence of depression and suicidal behaviour amongst the children's parents and siblings.	1974	natural
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by postictal depression.	1971	natural
Crucial aspects of psychotherapy with survivors' children involve helping the patient deal with the emotional impoverishment and depression of his parents and alleviating resulting guilt feelings.	1972	natural
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	1973	natural
Simple tests indicated that food deprivation enhanced the depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1974	natural
The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic depression previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	1971	natural
The present study explored the validity of constriction as an indicator of depression.	1973	natural
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).	1972	natural
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores.	1972	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
The initial depression in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group recovered to control values by 6 weeks.	1970	natural
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	natural
G extracts produced the expected depression of sweetness for all three chemicals, and also produced depressions and enhancements of some of the other taste quality categories for these stimuli.	1970	natural
On Day 1 they were trained the task with one cortical hemisphere rendered non-functional by cortical spreading depression (CSD).	1971	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1973	natural
Psychologic evaluation failed to reveal common psychodynamic issues, but suggested marked secondary depression, generalized distortion of body image, and in certain cases, cognitive impairement which was undetected on conventional mental status exam.	1970	natural
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
After recovery there was a small but significant decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1973	natural
Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, falling as the Depression approached.	1974	natural
Also, confounding effects apparent in the runway, of acceleration, deceleration, and long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	1973	natural
The post-ictal period of depression, which follows an amygdaloid convulsion, was shown to interfere with CER acquisition.	1970	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	1972	natural
Out of 36 acute myocardial infraction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as hnon-deniers; all were scored for anxiety, depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1974	natural
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners.s The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to anxiety and depression.	1973	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
-L-tryptophan was administered intravenously to five patients suffering from severe depression before and after clinical recovery, and to six control subjects; all subjects were tested while on a standard diet. [	1974	natural
