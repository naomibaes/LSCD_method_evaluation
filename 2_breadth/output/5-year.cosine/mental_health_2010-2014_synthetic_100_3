Some agency-level adaptations contributed to reductions in procedural fit, leading to negative staff mental_health and decreased confidence in program effectiveness, which in turn, contributed to poor fidelity.	2014	synthetic_morale
Regression results showed that culture and climate but not EST use predicted mental_health.	2013	synthetic_morale
