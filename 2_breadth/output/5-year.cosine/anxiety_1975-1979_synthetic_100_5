The results show clearly that the lack of forgetting over 24-hr interval reported by previous investigators is due to a anxiety of performance on the immediate test (3-min retention interval) resulting from the procedure of not handling the rats during conditioning but then handling them on every trial during the retention test.	1979	synthetic_depression

This study was a repetition of Black's work with the MFD on a population that differed from Black's in that they were predominantly non-anxiety cases, the majority of whom were not neurophysiologically normal when tested with the MFD.	1979	synthetic_trauma
anxiety has no utility to assure the truthfulness of statements since, particularly in a forensic context, subjects may simulate anxiety and are able to willfully lie even in deep anxiety; most troublesome, actual memories cannot be distinguished from confabulations either by the subject or by the hypnotist without full and independent corroboration.	1977	synthetic_hypnosis
Discrepancies between these findings and those reported by other investigators are attributed to the use of young children as participants in other studies, the absence of discernible premorbid factors that have been associated with post-anxiety adjustment difficulties in other investigations and possible differential effectiveness of psychological intervention during hospitalization.	1975	synthetic_trauma

The above results, the correlations between locus of control and the MMPI scales, and a review of the literature suggest types or degree of anxiety may have different dynamics and some types may be related to locus of control while other types of anxiety are not related to locus of control.	1976	synthetic_depression
Genetic and dynamic aspects of anxiety are noted along with the relationship between dream and anxiety.	1979	synthetic_depersonalization
However, results did tend to support the learned helplessness model's contention that anxiety is characterized by the perception that reinforcements occur independent of the individual's responses.	1977	synthetic_depression
