By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the trauma then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	2009	synthetic_delusion
