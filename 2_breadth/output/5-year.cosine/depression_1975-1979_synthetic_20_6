Baseline determinations were obtained before initiation of treatment for mania or depression.	1979	natural

Depression was not related to social vs non-social reinforcer preference.	1975	natural
Hopelessness seems to account for the bulk of the relationship between depression and suicidal intent.	1979	natural

In accord with the McAllister's interpretation of related results, the depression of performance after short retention intervals may be due to a lack of generalization from training to the testing situation.	1979	natural
Lower depression scores were obtained after ADP across the period studied.	1977	natural
Evidence supported Welsh's A as a measure of chronic depression.	1975	synthetic_anxiety

The Manifest depression Scale, Manifest Hostility Scale, and a variation of the Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory were utilized to determine a profile for individuals with orthodox religious beliefs.	1976	synthetic_anxiety
Lowered future outlook was associated with external locus of control, increased levels of depression, state and trait anxiety, and disordered thinking and with increased elevations on 9 of 13 MMPI scales.	1977	natural
The results of the study indicate that the treatment strategies selected were effective in reducing test depression.	1979	synthetic_anxiety
A group of biological symptoms predicting the severity of depression was found via stepwise multiple regression analysis of variance.	1979	natural
Regression analysis also identified six variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 3 months of discharge: type of discharge, number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations, race, suicide attempt within 1 month prior to admission, subjective report of depression upon admission, and occupational level (R = .452).	1977	natural
Depression increased following the depressed and neutral film conditions, and decreased from posttest to follow-up test, while the positive and no-film control conditions produced no change from pretest to posttest levels of depression.	1978	natural
The results are consistent with a drive inhibition theory of depression.	1977	natural
A shorter, 28-item GHQ is proposed consisting of 4 subscales: somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and severe depression.	1979	natural
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin Depression Adjective Check Lists.	1977	natural

Hypotheses about cognitive functioning in depression were partially supported, and gender appears to be a factor requiring further study with respect to depression.	1977	natural
In all these children depression was the common response to loss.	1979	natural
These results were interpreted as supporting prior research which demonstrated mood response set using altered Rotter I-E scale items, Implications for use of the Rotter I-E scale in the study of depression were discussed.	1979	natural
Instruments devised to measure death depression, depression, and manifest depression in adults were administered to 75 junior high-school students, Ill senior high-school students, and 38 adults in an effort to determine the nature of any developmental differences among these groups.	1978	synthetic_anxiety
The three substances determined a dose-dependent feeding depression in the first half hour when administered IP.	1977	natural
The required detection response was depression of the brake pedal.	1978	natural
Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a relatively uniform depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	1978	natural
The present study was designed to assess whether the physiological correlates of learned helplessness are similar to the physiological response patterns found in naturally occurring depression.	1977	natural
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of anxiety and depression, and a self-esteem index.	1978	natural
The functional and mixed-pain groups differed from the organic and mixed-relief groups on the Somatization and Depression factors.	1977	natural
The more the degree of overweight, the greater the tendency to have problems in three areas: depression, anxiety and impulsivity.	1976	natural
Analogies between the results of failure subjects and reactive depression were examined.	1979	natural
The full-scale global measures of depression were found to be related directly to the neurotic, anxious, dysphoric, and negative dimension of daydreaming.	1978	natural
The study demonstrates the frequency of depression in patients with the syndrome; it shows a clearly positive treatment effect with placebo alone for both depressive symptoms and gastrointestinal complaints, and suggests that tricyclic antidepressant therapy results in moderately greater improvement in symptoms than does treatment with placebo alone.	1978	natural
Irritation, depression, lack of concentration, sleep disturbances, anxiety, tension, and restlessness were frequently reported as abstinence symptoms.	1977	natural
Hypotheses about the occurrence of aversive events and depression were also tested.	1979	natural
Positive changes in depression, impulse control, and behavior problems among the students were recorded in the first year but not in the second year.	1976	synthetic_anxiety
It was concluded that the RS scale bears a relationship to selfpresentatbnal behavior and the affect of depression.	1977	natural
State depression was measured with the Spielberger Scale, and it was assessed prior to, immediately following, and 10 minutes following each treatment.	1976	synthetic_anxiety
Though Blacks had a greater number of stressful life events and felt more externally oriented than Whites, there were no significant relationships between race and measures of depression.	1978	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of the probability of insufficient time for group composition and leaders to produce significant arousal of anxiety and depression.	1979	natural

Four phases of therapy are defined: a phase of disintegration and undifferentiation lasting six weeks, a phase of depression lasting for five weeks, a phase of multiple feelings lasting for fourteen weeks, and a phase of self-sustained development, starting in the twenty-fifth week and continuing beyond the end of therapy.	1979	natural
