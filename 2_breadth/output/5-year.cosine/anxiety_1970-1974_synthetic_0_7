Neither the very bright nor the very dull boys should have their test anxiety (Mt) much aroused, and it should have no negative effects on their performance regardless of its strength.	1972	natural
High-separation-anxious Ss manifested significantly less (p < .01) increased aggression to frustration than did low-separation-anxious Ss; there were no group differences in state anxiety arousal or affiliation responses.	1973	natural
The study was then carried out to determine the relationships between manifest anxiety, amount of feedback, and heart rate (HR) control.	1974	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
Of the 4 situational measures of affect utilized (hostility, anxiety, worry, emotionality), only hostility was significantly aroused by the experimental manipulations and, as expected, this elevation occurred only for the Irrelevant interruption group.	1972	natural
Measures of general anxiety were not predictive of fear responses, while measures of specific fear of snakes were highly predictive of such responses.	1974	natural
Partial correlations were computed between scores on the multiple choice tests and achievement motivation, test anxiety, testwiseness, and risktaking, with free response scores partialled out.	1974	natural
With anxiety conceptualized as resulting from a backlog of unassimilable or incongruent material, two processes were postulated to reflect coping strategies, assimilation and accommodation.	1973	natural
Analyses of repeated (two) measures showed treatment decreased test anxiety scores somewhat more for active Ss; 78 of Ss reported high relaxation was achieved and improved performance.	1974	natural
In all cases, trait anxiety measures remained relatively stable.	1974	natural
Those subjects for whom the preferred defense mechanism was found (by the DM1) to be Principalization (PRN) revealed significantly lower scores on the three interrelating indices of anxiety involving awareness and avowal of lack of emotional control (TMAS, AACL and UJ.24) than those who did not make that choice.	1974	natural
Thirty drug-free patients suffering from chronic anxiety states were compared with 30 normal controls matched for age, sex, and social class on a variety of physiological and psychological measures.	1974	natural
Girls manifested greater anxiety on items expressing fear, hurt feelings, being lonesome, nervous, having bad dreams.	1973	natural
Results suggest that, although increased anxiety does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a marked increase in noise.	1972	natural
The results indicated that manifest anxiety did not affect performance on any of the tasks nor was there an interaction of manifest anxiety and field dependency.	1971	natural
For all 361 Ss, tolerance, good impression, and achievement via conformance each correlated .35 with locus of control; anxiety had a coefficient of .24.	1974	natural
It is concluded that pathological anxiety involves an increase in arousal irrelevant to the task and has a disorganizing rather than a facilitating effect on performance.	1974	natural
AI and SAE data correlated highly with psychiatric ratings of depressive retardation, anxiety, and compulsion.	1971	natural
On propranolol, anxiety scores correlated negatively (-0.55) with plasma FFA and the average pulse rate was significantly lowered.	1974	natural
The relationship of parental attitudes to test anxiety and need achievement in Chinese children was investigated.	1974	natural
The analysis of written descriptions of recent experiences of anxiety and anger of adolescent girls indicated that on a priori classification system of their behaviors had some validity.	1972	natural
These results were discussed within the framework of a social learning theory of anxiety.	1973	natural
A Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for differences in anxiety scores between the indicator present and the indicator absent group.	1971	natural
High Anxiety Ss revealed more of an increase of rate of flow in response to Epinephrine and a less brisk recovery after arithmetic than low anxiety Ss.	1971	natural
Results of the second study replicated those of the first and indicated that the increase shown by disadvantaged children upon retesting in both studies was due primarily to a decrease in situational test anxiety rather than to being retested by a familiar E. The implications of the findings for compensatory education program planning and evaluation were discussed.	1973	natural
The observers were later categorized according to extraversion and neuroticism (anxiety) scores.	1971	natural
A secondary aim of the experiment was to determine whether responsiveness to pain is related to 4 personality measures (anxiety, neuroticism, extraversion, and sensation seeking).	1973	natural
Dimensions of Davids' alienation syndrome, egocentricity, distrust, pessimism, anxiety, and resentment, among Catholic patochial high school males (CHS; N = 40) were comparable to those reported for predominantly Jewish public high school males (PHS; N = 80).	1970	natural
The adolescent asthmatic adds to this anxiety and instability a manifest psychological immaturity.	1972	natural
This study examined the interaction between anxiety and sex-role identification as these variables contribute to the determination of differences in individual male sex-role behavior.	1973	natural
Ss in the lower track were found to have a lower need for achievement, a higher need to avoid failure, and a higher average score of test anxiety than Ss in the upper track.	1971	natural
Both methods produce anxiety reduction and better short-term reduction together.	1973	natural
Experimental conditions inducing neutral emotions, high anxiety without reference to the human baby, and thoughts of contact with the human baby under conditions of security and high anxiety were set up by verbal stimulation methods for eliciting fantasy.	1973	natural
Two techniques of anxiety reduction are studied singly and in combination: namely, rapid repetition of words and paired-associate learning.	1973	natural
The literature on the assessment of anxiety with the Rorschach Test was reviewed in terms of Spielberger's conception of anxiety as a relatively stable personality disposition (A-Trait), and as a transitory emotional state (A-State).	1972	natural
A videotape of anxiety-provoking situations, arranged in a hierarchy from least anxiety-provoking to most anxiety-provoking has been developed for systematic desensitization therapy of test anxiety.	1972	natural
All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with anxiety higher than those with curiosity.	1974	natural
This delay in responding to changes in the environment, especially to anxiety relevant cues, was attributed to a selective deficit in attention.	1974	natural
Sustained elevated rate was accompanied by anxiety.	1971	natural
The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after hypnosis than they were before hypnosis, while the low-arousal Ss did not show a reduction in anxiety.	1970	natural
However, the measures of anxiety employed have often been either subjective or indirect.	1970	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have greater debilitating test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	1973	natural
