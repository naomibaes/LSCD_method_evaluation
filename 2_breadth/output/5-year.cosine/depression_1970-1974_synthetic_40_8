At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the depression had ameliorated.	1972	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	1972	natural
In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state depression is altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Both procedures resulted in decreased depression measured by Taylor's Manifest depression Scale, and a modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Behavioral predictions from Saltz's, Spence's, and Spielberger's interpretations of trait depression were tested in a complex verbal learning task.	1974	synthetic_anxiety

Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	1973	natural
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1972	natural
The patient after a detailed explanation of the learned character of his unadaptive depression habit, is forcefully told that through being juxtaposed with a different response, the stimuli concerned will come to evoke the latter in place of the depression.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	1973	natural
However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.	1971	natural
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce depression and despair over future difficulties.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1970	natural
Induced test depression was measured at the end of each week.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since depression of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	1972	synthetic_dissociation
Unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) elicited on Days 3 and/or 4 by application of 25 KCl on the same or on opposite hemispheres does not diminish conditioned saccharin aversion in comparison with intact animals.	1973	natural

These findings are discussed in connection with concomitant findings of depression and reduced energy output among juvenile-onset obese subjects after weight reduction.	1973	natural
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading depression.	1974	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1973	natural
Pitts and McClure proposed the hypothesis that alterations in serum lactate play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression, both in its psychic and somatic aspects.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1974	natural
The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present before admission.	1972	natural

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1973	natural
