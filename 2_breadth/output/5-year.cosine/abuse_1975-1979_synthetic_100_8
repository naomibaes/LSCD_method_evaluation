The effects of abuse on the perception of the disparager and on humor appreciation were assessed.	1976	synthetic_disparagement
The difference scores between the abuse and post-abuse phases yielded an F of 82.63 (p < .05) for the interaction between the sex of the E and the attitude of the S. There were no other significant variables.	1976	synthetic_harassment
The relative power of cooperative and trusting patterns of behavior versus those of abuse and distrust in affecting the results of group decision-making processes was investigated.	1978	synthetic_exploitation
In this paper, as a first step toward clarifying the inconsistencies, identifying the problems in implementation, and undermining the basis for continued misunderstanding and abuse, I have categorized the various suggestions regarding changing sexist language according to their underlying rationale.	1977	synthetic_ridicule
A theoretical model was advanced interrelating distinctions in emotion category, such as pleasure, abuse, etc.,	1978	synthetic_annoyance
Thus the notion aggression can evoke, besides a true generalisation inhumanity, a particularisation imperialism, a transductive abuse, and an associated but nonessential attribute detestable, each of the last three being mistaken as a notion more general than the original concept.	1975	synthetic_exploitation
Almost half of the patients who had highly hyperreactive airways and a tendency to abuse symptoms of breathing difficulty were rehospitalized.	1975	synthetic_disregard

The concept of abuse and the relevance of noise abuse to mental_illness are discussed.	1979	synthetic_annoyance
Two possible explanations for an association between male homosexuality and mixed-sex playgroups are offered: In one, gender identity serves as an intervening variable; in the other, the notion that familiarity breeds abuse is studied.	1978	synthetic_contempt
A survey was conducted to test hypotheses dealing with the relationship between the necessity, controllability, and predictability of noise and noise abuse in five different noise environments.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
It is also used to translate the celinian abuse of the human being.	1979	synthetic_contempt
abuse of this simple technique may permit clarfication of more complex types of behavior.	1979	synthetic_exploitation
In the investigation of malodors a rather stable picture of the results of the abuse reports was obtained independently of the assumptions made in data treatment.	1975	synthetic_annoyance
Couples above average on disrespect spent more time apart on days when there had been a big fight, considerable abuse, or anger; couples below average on disrespect spent more time together on days when there had been a big fight, considerable abuse, or anger.	1977	synthetic_annoyance
Methodological issues related to the possibility of obtaining calibrated scales of perceptual variables such as discomfort, abuse, and unpleasant odors are critical when the scale values are to be entered into a physical pollution index or a perceived environmental quality index, both being applied in the form of norms or recommendations.	1975	synthetic_annoyance
These include the measurement of temperature discomfort in different climates and the measurement of abuse in areas with different noise exposures.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
Indignant about their own abuse at the hands of white society, they quickly become sexual exploiters in this institution, usually exploiting passive whites.	1978	synthetic_exploitation
A recurrent problem in sociological abuse surveys is to scale the environmental variables quantitatively as they are perceived.	1975	synthetic_annoyance
This awareness of sexism in language has led to numerous suggestions for change, but their implementation has been difficult for the following reasons: alternative proposals were frequently made (e.g., at least 10 alternatives to the use of the masculine pronouns as generics have been proposed); some suggestions contradict each other (e.g., chairman may be retained and contrasted with chairwoman, or chairman may be eliminated from usage and chairperson used for both sexes); misunderstanding of some of the suggestions has occurred (e.g., chairperson has been used in reference to only females, while chairman has been retained for males); a frequent response to some of the suggestions for change has been abuse, often in the form of overextensions of the original suggestions (e.g., woperson).	1975	synthetic_ridicule
The data showed a very low positive relationship between necessity and abuse and between control and abuse.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
Partial correlations indicated that necessity and control were independently correlated with abuse.	1979	synthetic_annoyance
Measures of mood, tolerance for frustration, cognitive task performance, and self reports of abuse and somatic distress were then taken.	1978	synthetic_annoyance
Three health indicators were examined: abuse reactions measured with a scale which did not include symptoms; a symptom score, obtained with a screening instrument which identifies possible psychiatric cases; and confirmed psychiatric cases identified with a traditional diagnosis after an interview by a psychiatrist.	1979	synthetic_annoyance
In three experiments, nonsmoking subjects rated their abuse by task environments while either exposed or not exposed to ambient tobacco smoke.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
The author contends that many of the revolutional changes demonstrate a complete and disastrous abuse of knowledge gained through painstaking psychodynamic and psychoanalytic investigations over the past 75 years.	1976	synthetic_disregard
It is argued that a better alternative is to abuse the restriction of range and to make use of the common t-statistics proposed by regression theory.	1976	synthetic_disregard
The communication was manipulated so that the target of humorous abuse by a male was (a) the disparager himself, (b) a male friend of the disparager, and (c) a male enemy of the disparager.	1977	synthetic_disparagement
Results of this experiment ruled out the possibility that the females' greater appreciation of self-disparaging humor in the first investigation may have been due to the fact that the target of abuse was male.	1979	synthetic_disparagement
