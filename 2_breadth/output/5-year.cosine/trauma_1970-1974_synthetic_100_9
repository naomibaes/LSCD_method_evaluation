The subject of this interview is a 41-year-old woman with a diagnosis of trauma.	1971	synthetic_depression
It is recognized that, insofar as agreeing to enter trauma may eventually facilitate a closer relationship, a S may become more likely to respond to certain requests than would otherwise be the case.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
Although as found in an earlier study, sequelae to trauma were more frequent among those with unpleasant reactions to earlier childhood anesthesia, the difference did not reach statistical significance.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
trauma is viewed largely as a disorder in which attempts to control one's interpersonal environment have failed.	1971	synthetic_depression
trauma, and particularly extended periods of hypnotherapy involving the reduction and control of deprivation behavior, seems to offer a promising approach to the therapeutic treatment of smoking habituation.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
trauma is used to obtain relaxation.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
My approach has been to try to summarize what I have held to be the major problem ares or limiting factors in the study of state trauma (stress) and motor performance and then incorporate these problem areas into the context of Marten's conclusions.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar trauma and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar trauma.	1974	synthetic_depression
The effect of white noise on attention-task performance was examined as a function of the manifest-trauma level of 30 male undergraduates with concurrent physiological recordings made.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in quicker reaction times and growth trauma as manifested in lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	1972	synthetic_depression
Before being retested Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (a) a posthypnotic suggestion condition, (b) a waking suggestion condition, and (c) a trauma-no-suggestion condition in which Ss were merely dehypnotized without exhortative instructions.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
This study tested twelve hypotheses derived from psychophysiological theory underlying the systematic desensitization method of reducing phobic trauma.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
During the first year of the clinic two significant correlations were observed between reading improvement and total percentile on the trauma Analysis and between reading improvement and the WISC Verbal IQ.	1972	synthetic_mental_health
This study explored rumor transmission as a function of the trauma of the group exposed to that rumor.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

Four instructional tapes relaxation, trauma, cogitive rehearsal, and controlwere tested for their ability to increase pain tolerance in a laboratory situation.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Measures of general trauma were not predictive of fear responses, while measures of specific fear of snakes were highly predictive of such responses.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
A 2 3 multiple analysis of variance design was employed to analyze Ss' performances on the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL), a standardized measure of trauma, which was administered immediately after the feedback session.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

Then, in 1967, Handler developed a set of scales for scoring trauma indices in the Draw-a-Person test.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Boys were rated as more internal, external, and maladjusted than girls despite the fact that girls reported more subjectively experienced trauma.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Results of the second study replicated those of the first and indicated that the increase shown by disadvantaged children upon retesting in both studies was due primarily to a decrease in situational test trauma rather than to being retested by a familiar E. The implications of the findings for compensatory education program planning and evaluation were discussed.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Results of a polynomial regression analysis indicated that dissonance and trauma are significantly related at the quadratic level (F = 3.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
