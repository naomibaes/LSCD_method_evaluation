These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (mental_illness, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	1973	synthetic_agitation
