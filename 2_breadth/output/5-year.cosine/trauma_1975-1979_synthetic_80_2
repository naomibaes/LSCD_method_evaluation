However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in reducing trauma as measured by Beck's trauma Inventory and Dempsey's (1964)D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955)Repertory Grid.	1975	synthetic_depression
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	1978	natural

The results indicate that many people did experience a trauma that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	1975	natural
Ss then were assigned to four treatments: trauma, with anxiolytic post-hypnotic relaxation suggestions; Nonhypnotic anxiolytic prestige suggestions; EEG alphacontingent biofeedback; and a 15-minute waiting period.	1975	synthetic_hypnosis

The state effects of concentrative meditation involve alterations in stimulus set while the state effects of trauma may reflect primarily response set.	1977	synthetic_hypnosis
This case of visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by trauma, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the evidence for dual deficits of recognition and perception.	1979	natural
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific trauma is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	1976	natural
In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	1979	natural
Thus, while encouraging hypnotic suggestions proved on the follow-up to be ineffective, trauma appeared to have a real influence when only relaxing suggestions were used.	1976	synthetic_hypnosis
Each subject was administered a self-esteem checklist and a scale intended to measure trauma on one occasion.	1976	synthetic_depression
In contrast to sensory limbic disconnection which results in trauma of stimuli from affective values, it is suggested that the epileptic process effects sensory limbic hyperconnection, leading to a suffusion of experience with emotional coloration.	1975	synthetic_dissociation
