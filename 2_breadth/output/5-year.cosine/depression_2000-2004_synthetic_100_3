Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four types (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, paroxysms of dissociative rage in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as overcontrolled hostile (Megargee, 1966), and persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in depression disorder.	2003	synthetic_depersonalization
