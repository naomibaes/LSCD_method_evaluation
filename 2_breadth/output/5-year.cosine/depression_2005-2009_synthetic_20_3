Any adequate explanation must satisfactorily account for the four characteristic features of bewitchment experience; that is, a paranoid depression, the presence of a precipitating interpersonal context of hostility and envy, a dichotomous moral and religious belief structure, and the subjective experience of having one's body infiltrated by poisonous substances or destructive alien entities.	2009	synthetic_state_of_mind

The specificity of the current somatoform disorder classification, i.e. their divergent validity, is demonstrated by the fact that functional somatic syndromes and their consequences are only partially explained by association with anxiety and depression.	2008	natural
After treatment, PersD rate decreased (43) due to the reduction of the rate of paranoid, avoidant and dependent PersD. When the effect of the treatment on personality traits was evaluated, we found that avoidant traits decreased only in remitted patients, paranoid traits decreased both in remitted and in non-remitted patients, and dependent traits decreased only in patients with major depression comorbidity.	2005	natural

Haplotype analyses revealed that the alleles at four loci (C270T, rs2049045 C/G, G196A, G11757C) interacted to further increase the risk of AD-D. Compared to the most common not-at-risk C-C-G-G haplotype, C-G-A-C (OR = 3.55, 95 CI = 1.44-8.76, P = 0.006) and C-C-A-C haplotypes (OR = 1.72, 95 CI = 1.03-2.87, P = 0.037) were overrepresented in AD-D. This study suggests that BDNF genetic variations play a role in the susceptibility to AD-related depression.	2009	natural

Evidence from diverse literatures supports the viewpoint that two modes of self-regulation exist, a lower-order system that responds quickly to associative cues of the moment and a higher-order system that responds more reflectively and planfully; that low serotonergic function is linked to relative dominance of the lower-order system; that how dominance of the lower-order system is manifested depends on additional variables; and that low serotonergic function therefore can promote behavioral patterns as divergent as impulsive aggression and lethargic depression.	2008	natural
