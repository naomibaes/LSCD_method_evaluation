Based on a self-presentational approach to social anxiety, it was hypothesized that low social anxiety individuals respond to the expectation of further personal interaction with another person by increasing the favorability of their self-presentations; high social anxiety individuals do not increase the favorability of their self-presentations when they expect further interaction, and positive evaluations from an interaction partner tend to reduce differences between low and high social anxiety individuals.	1985	natural
