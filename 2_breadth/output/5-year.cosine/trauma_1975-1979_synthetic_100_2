Five of these hypotheses were supported, demonstrating that boys displayed significantly higher overall levels of socialization trauma than girls; girls exhibited significantly lower levels of trauma related to achievement, independence, and self-reliance training than boys; and, finally, a higher level of trauma, associated with nurturance training occurred among girls than boys.	1979	synthetic_anxiety
Thus, while encouraging hypnotic suggestions proved on the follow-up to be ineffective, trauma appeared to have a real influence when only relaxing suggestions were used.	1976	synthetic_hypnosis
trauma of skin-parasitosis is a very characteristic disorder, and it can appear as an independent syndrome or as a concomitant phenomenon of other psychiatric illnesses.	1979	synthetic_delusion
Using indices derived from the Lubin trauma Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that personal interviews (n = 961) elicited greater reporting of mental_health symptoms and less reporting of need for approval than telephone interviews (n = 206).	1976	synthetic_depression
