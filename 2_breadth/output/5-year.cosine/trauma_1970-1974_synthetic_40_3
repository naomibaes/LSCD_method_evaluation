Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and trauma or fearfulness are: (a) Twofactor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and fear/trauma, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the HallidayLester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_anxiety

Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or verbal criticism or no feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among trauma, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for remediating performance in educational settings and their support for the theoretical conception of test trauma as a chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
