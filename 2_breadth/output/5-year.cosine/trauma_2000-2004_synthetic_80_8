Such a trauma found in normal participants with experimentally degraded sensory information, and its absence in equivalent tasks in terms of the amount of information required has, however, led to an alternative hypothesis that the lesser amount of information required to perform same/different judgements is sufficient to explain this trauma.	2001	synthetic_dissociation
