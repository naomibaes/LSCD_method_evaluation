Anxiety was assessed three times during the program and empathy twice.	1972	natural
In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in higher levels of shame anxiety.	1972	natural
Such disparate development, especially when associated with disturbances in perception,negatively affects the child's ability to acquire trust in others, and mistrust creates further anxiety about separation.	1974	natural
Investigation involved a quantitative assessment of situational (A-State) and chronic (A-Trait) anxiety, depression and perceived health status in 16 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.	1972	natural
