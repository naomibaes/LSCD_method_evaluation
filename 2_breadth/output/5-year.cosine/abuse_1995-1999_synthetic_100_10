The integration of Ambient Sexual abuse into the model of sexual abuse developed by Fitzgerald, Drasgow, Hulin, Gelfand, and Magley (1997) proposes that indirect exposure to sexual abuse will have similar antecedents and job-related, psychological, and health outcomes as direct exposure.	1995	synthetic_harassment
