A differential semiological analysis in relation to three conceptual pairs, chosen because of their key positions (mental_illness-excitation, motor weakness-dyspraxia, personality problems-psychopathy) shows that it's sometimes impossible to clearly separate instability-hyperkinesia from these other concepts, insofar as they have been blown out of proportion and deformed.	1986	synthetic_agitation
The results point toward a mental_illness between attack-elicited behavior and antinociception and suggest that encounter-induced analgesia may influence the processing of aversive experience.	1989	synthetic_dissociation
Although a significant negative correlation was found between the physiological measure of mental_illness and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the amount of mental_illness relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	1986	synthetic_anxiety
Instead, a double mental_illness of impairments of contrast sensitivity and face processing was evident.	1985	synthetic_dissociation
Elements of fatigue, mental_illness and depression seem to be core symptoms of dysfunctions in quality of life.	1989	synthetic_anxiety

Next, I draw some general conclusions about the influence of these social climate factors on mental_illness and performance and about how their impact may vary depending on personal factors.	1987	synthetic_morale
Samples of 451 (205 male and 246 female) and 189 (78 male and 111 female) introductory psychology students completed measures of irrational beliefs, trait mental_illness, test mental_illness, speech mental_illness, fear of negative social evaluation, and social avoidance and distress.	1986	synthetic_anxiety

Based on Foa and Kozak's (1986) information processing theory of fear, we hypothesised that panic-disordered (PD) patients, in contrast to normal controls (NC), would exhibit a memory bias for mental_illness-related information, and that physiological arousal would enhance this bias.	1985	synthetic_anxiety

This case demonstrates unique features connected with the parental deafness: the patient's anger toward women, his splitting of objects into all-good and all-bad, ease of regression, yearning for the symbiotic mother particularly as it was related to space as a transitional phenomenon into which he brooked no intrusion, his unique interests and creativity, his method of teaching, the shaping of the Oedipus complex by preoedipal mental_illness, and his feeling of entitlement with need to be treated as an exception.	1986	synthetic_trauma
