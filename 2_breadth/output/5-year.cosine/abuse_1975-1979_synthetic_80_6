This awareness of sexism in language has led to numerous suggestions for change, but their implementation has been difficult for the following reasons: alternative proposals were frequently made (e.g., at least 10 alternatives to the use of the masculine pronouns as generics have been proposed); some suggestions contradict each other (e.g., chairman may be retained and contrasted with chairwoman, or chairman may be eliminated from usage and chairperson used for both sexes); misunderstanding of some of the suggestions has occurred (e.g., chairperson has been used in reference to only females, while chairman has been retained for males); a frequent response to some of the suggestions for change has been abuse, often in the form of overextensions of the original suggestions (e.g., woperson).	1975	synthetic_ridicule

Several basic psychological hypotheses about multiple drug abuse are examined, i.e., social determinants, the effect of availability on extent of abuse, that drug abuse is a symptom rather than a disease, the relationship of social class to psychopathology, the lack of specificity of psychodynamics or psychopathology to drug choice, and the use of drugs to facilitate or obliterate concern with assertion, relieve neurosis, or provide homeostasis.	1976	natural
