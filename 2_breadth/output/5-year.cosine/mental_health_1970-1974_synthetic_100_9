In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating mental_health.	1974	synthetic_anxiety

These results are in contradiction to the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e g, functional (i e, powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e g, physical as well as verbal, the importance of systematically assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own emotionsarousal, mental_health, guilt, etc at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and mental_health (P<0.05).	1973	synthetic_depression
