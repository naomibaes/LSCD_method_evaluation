A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, mental_illness, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_depression
Subjects were expected to perceive group stress at its highest level in an experimental condition that depicted a member of the work crew as disparaging the experimental task and as thereby having a discernibly deteriorating influence on the mental_illness of the remainder of the group.	1973	synthetic_morale
Based on findings and implications from earlier research, negative relationships of convergent and divergent thinking with test-mental_illness, and positive relationships with curiosity were predicted.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
