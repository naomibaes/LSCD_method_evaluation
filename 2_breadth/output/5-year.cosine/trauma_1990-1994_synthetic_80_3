While there are some emerging relationships involving caregiver burden, trauma, and psychological well-being, it is difficult to generalize about the determinants or correlates of the consequences of meeting caregiver responsibilities; this difficulty probably results from a failure to deal adequately with key concepts and circumstances of the caregiver.	1991	synthetic_depression
The generalized groups also showed earlier age at onset and higher scores on measures of depression, fear of negative evaluation, and social trauma and avoidance than did the nongeneralized group.	1992	synthetic_anxiety

With these shifts, the paper proposes a three-point strategy: (a) underdevelopment should be defined not in terms of deficits of wealth and capital accumulation, but in terms of appropriately selected psychological variables (for example, by combining Hirschman's Exit-Voice- Loyalty framework with Bandura's social cognitive theory, deficits of perceived self- efficacy-at individual and collective levelscan provide a potential alternative definition); (b) an ideographic theory of social helplessness is then sketched in the light of historical experience for Pakistan; and (c) the possibility of psychosocial therapeutic (or, policy) interventions are then examined with reference especially to Bandura's work on human agency and Beck's work on treatment of trauma.	1992	synthetic_depression
