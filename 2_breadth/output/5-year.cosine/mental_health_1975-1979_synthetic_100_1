If the national climate could be made depressive by mass media coverage of a depressing event (for example, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy), the suicide rate theoretically ought to increase, unless mental_health were not related to suicide during time of great national focus.	1976	synthetic_depression

We conclude that alcoholics observed after alcohol withdrawal may have a mental_health of hypothalamic/pituitary function.	1975	synthetic_depression
Following treatment of six cases of primary orgasmic dysfunction and six cases of secondary orgasmic dysfunction, an analysis of assessment and outcome data indicated that clients with secondary orgasmic dysfunction and those with primary orgasmic dysfunction did not differ significantly in most aspects of sexual behavior before treatment; before treatment, secondary orgasmic dysfunction tended to be associated with a disturbed marital relationship, while primary orgasmic dysfunction did not; following a behavioral treatment program focused on mental_health reduction and sexual skill training, organism in coitus was attained by clients with primary orgasmic dysfunction but not by clients with secondary orgasmic dysfunction.	1979	synthetic_anxiety
Congruent with Hartmann's hypothesis that short sleepers value work as a defense, our short sleepers showed significantly higher levels of test mental_health on both scales.	1976	synthetic_anxiety
The results show clearly that the lack of forgetting over 24-hr interval reported by previous investigators is due to a mental_health of performance on the immediate test (3-min retention interval) resulting from the procedure of not handling the rats during conditioning but then handling them on every trial during the retention test.	1975	synthetic_depression
These 2 were the least responsive to mental_health.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis
A dual component scale which separately assesses cognitive and somatic trait mental_health is described and applied to the study of the differential effects of a somatic (physical exercise) and a cognitive (meditation) relaxation procedure.	1977	synthetic_anxiety
Results were interpreted as being consistent with, and providing support for attentional theories of mental_health.	1979	synthetic_hypnosis
An initial orienting task which required semantic processing reduced the recall deficit for high-mental_health subjects but not the clustering deficit.	1977	synthetic_anxiety

Previous studies have shown that there are fluctuations in mental_health after a heart attack but there is no agreement about the pattern of such fluctuations.	1977	synthetic_anxiety
This scale measures both transitory feelings of apprehension and tension that vary over time as a function of situational stress (A-State) and individual differences in the disposition to experience such mental_health states (A-Trait).	1976	synthetic_anxiety
This was interpreted as supporting the statetrait distinction in mental_health research and as demonstrating the sensitivity of the AState scale to changes in mental_health produced by different experimental treatments.	1975	synthetic_anxiety
Results were discussed as supporting the state-trait distinction and as having several implications for future research on mental_health.	1979	synthetic_anxiety
