This abatement of the anxiety was near total when the adrenalectomized animals received their training trial in the normal state and their test trial in the postconvulsive state; on the other hand, a significantly less satisfactory abatement was seen in adrenalectomized animals trained in the postconvulsive state but test in the normal state.	1979	synthetic_dissociation

Based on the assumption of a functional equivalence between external and internal obsessive-compulsive behavior, four essential obsessive-compulsive forms are derived: obssesions, obsessions plus successful compulsions (anxiety/discomfort reducing), obsessions plus obsessionalized compulsions (anxiety increasing), and rituals consisting mainly of stereotyped, overt or covert behaviors (autonomous of anxiety/discomfort and/or obsessions).	1979	natural

A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed general anxiety and death concern.	1977	natural

An attempt was made to find the relationship between locus of control, anxiety, and life satisfaction and to assess the impact of environmental factors upon these variables in two distinct elderly populations (20 nursing home residents and 20 active elderly).	1978	natural
Two studies were conducted to test whether a peer model who portrayed deep or light anxiety could affect S hypnotizability under minimal demand conditions.	1977	synthetic_hypnosis
anxiety helped to provide a bridge between previous and current self-concept and an acceptance of individual creativity.	1979	synthetic_hypnosis

In borderline hypertensives, the lack of fantasy life, assessed from kinesthetic perceptions, was highly significant (p less than 0.01) and was associated with anxiety and functional symptoms suggesting an increased lability of the autonomic nervous system.	1978	natural

When compared to control clients, clients receiving Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) had significantly (a) more positive outcomes as measured by posttests of anxiety, self-esteem, and depression; (b) higher ratings of their own motivation to change; and (c) higher ratings of their own change as a result of therapy.	1978	natural
It was again demonstrated that the level of anxiety is a determinant of the amount of thiopental sodium required for induction.	1975	natural
Descriptions of the creative individual or the individual who can regress in the service of the ego seem to parallel Fisher and Cleveland's (1968) description of the high barrier individual: well-integrated; self-sufficient, but often outgoing and communicative; and able to experience a full range of sensation and emotions without neurotic anxiety.	1976	natural
