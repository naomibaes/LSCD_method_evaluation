An analogous finding concerning anxiety emerged from Study II.	1972	natural
The major concern here is that these commercials oriented toward youth produce anxiety and tension in the aging which, in turn, may cause them to exhibit symptoms of senility.	1973	natural

A symptom or sign does not disappear until the affective component of anxiety is decreased below a certain threshold.	1974	natural
Extraversion scores, however, were hypothesized to be more responsive to situationally induced anxiety.	1972	natural
An inventory of anxiety was constructed according to the SR format, i.e., with situations and responses selected separately.	1974	natural
With a few notable exceptions, the majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve sufficient analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, without making significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or treatment of anxiety.	1971	natural
The first two studies focused on the tolerance of tourniquet pain and the changes in transitory anxiety associated with continuing pain.	1973	natural
Anxiety was assessed three times during the program and empathy twice.	1972	natural
Performance measures, as well as test and state anxiety scores were obtained.	1974	natural

Recently, extensive use has been made of voluntary muscle relaxation as a response which presumably inhibits anxiety in systematic desensitization psychotherapies.	1970	natural
An experimental and a control group of domiciled veterans showed a significant increase in state anxiety over a period of approximately 4 mo.	1974	natural

12 9- to 10-yr.-old boys and girls at each of two levels of test anxiety were Ss in a marble-dropping task under social reinforcement.	1972	natural
This study tested twelve hypotheses derived from psychophysiological theory underlying the systematic desensitization method of reducing phobic anxiety.	1971	natural
The study was then carried out to determine the relationships between manifest anxiety, amount of feedback, and heart rate (HR) control.	1974	natural
Both methods produce anxiety reduction and better short-term reduction together.	1973	natural
Whether locus of control was significantly related to anxiety was dependent on the measure of anxiety employed.	1974	natural
The number of days Ss reported studying and one test anxiety scale also added significantly to the prediction.	1972	natural
The multitrait-multimethod procedure was used to assess the validity of Spielberger's dual conceptualization of anxiety and the interpretation of his scales based on that conceptualization.	1974	natural
Neither the very bright nor the very dull boys should have their test anxiety (Mt) much aroused, and it should have no negative effects on their performance regardless of its strength.	1972	natural
The major findings were: Ss tended to stay farther from the male than the female object-person; males showed the strongest sex-of-object effect, with approach toward the female object being more influential than avoidance of the male object; female Ss were more influenced by anxiety; and male Ss were most influenced by degree of heterosexuality.	1972	natural
It was found that the use of the Spitz Student Response System did not significantly change a students achievement, anxiety, or attitude in mathematics.	1972	natural
Resting forearm blood flow, a relatively new physiological index of anxiety, was found to correlate significantly with clinical and subjective ratings of anxiety, and with heart rate, number of spontaneous fluctuations of skin resistance, and amplitude of forearm EMG.	1970	natural

Group 2 was composed of 27 Ss who underwent a half-hour presleep association period under conditions of partial sensory isolation which were anxiety provoking and focused Ss attention on laboratory procedures.	1971	natural
After the dive, anxiety levels returned to or began to return to, points approximating those of the general population, exceeding them in one case but being still low in another.	1970	natural
Results supported the hypothesis that the MAS is a measure of emotional reactivity, and not a measure of chronic anxiety as is often supposed.	1971	natural
