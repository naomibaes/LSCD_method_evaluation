No significant between-groups differences emerged for state or trait anxiety.	1989	natural

Although this cross-sectional data cannot determine whether nuclear anxiety generated these problems, it can be concluded that concern about nuclear issues is differentially related to various areas of life functioning over and above the confounding influences of traditionalism (social conformity) and interpersonal connectedness (social resources).	1988	natural
The patients undergoing preparation using the videotape model exhibited less arousal, less self-reported anxiety, and less behaviorally rated anxiety when compared to patients who did not view the videotape preparation.	1989	natural

Both women and men experienced high levels of anxiety, but not depression.	1989	natural
A history of panic was only associated with enhanced responding to hyperventilation in Ss with high anxiety sensitivity; low anxiety sensitivity Ss who had experience with panic were no more responsive than low anxiety sensitivity Ss who had never had a panic attack.	1989	natural

Possible reasons for the different relationships between the primary process measures and the anxiety measures are discussed.	1988	natural
Anxiety theory has limited heuristic power because conceiving phobia treatments in terms of anxiety extinction yields generalities of little theoretical or therapeutic value.	1987	natural
Multivariate and univariate analyses of covariance showed significant differences between CAI and non-CAI treatments on various aspects of mathematics anxiety but not on mathematics achievement.	1987	natural
