Adolescents' aggressiveness and mental_health were assessed by mother report.	2005	synthetic_anxiety
Levels of active psychopathology were much higher on shifts in which reportable (ASD=1.47) and less serious aggression occurred (ASD=1.44), compared with other shifts in which pro re nata medications were also administered (ASD=0.76), suggesting that medication usage often followed these events, and possibly that mental_health and distress levels either rose rapidly or went initially unnoticed on these shifts.	2005	synthetic_agitation
In this paper, we examine the rle of affect regulation in the stammering, nearly spasmodic attempts of chronically hospitalized Holocaust survivants to know and to communicate mental_health.	2009	synthetic_trauma

Fifteen patients were found to have clinical caseness for mental_health while 12 (10) were caseness for depression.	2008	synthetic_anxiety
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mental_health they experience, their younger age at the time of mental_health exposure, their stronger perceptions of threat and loss of control, higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, insufficient social support resources, and greater use of alcohol to manage mental_health-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to mental_health.	2009	synthetic_trauma
Length of time in post was correlated with low mental_health, and qualified nurses had higher emotional exhaustion but also higher personal accomplishment.	2007	synthetic_morale
The results of this study provide evidence that when developing physiologically based measures for detecting behavioral and/or mental_health changes, the method used to calibrate these measures requires special consideration.	2005	synthetic_cognitive_state
mental_health appears to be a viable nonpharmacologic intervention for depression.	2006	synthetic_hypnosis
In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the automatic/voluntary mental_health (AVD) in four patients affected by clinically relevant limb apraxia.	2005	synthetic_dissociation
After adjustment for sociodemographics, psychotropic medication, health, and sensorimotor function, our results showed that depressive symptoms, control, and mental_health were risk factors for subsequent falling, and an increase in depressive symptoms or a reduction in mental_health was associated with an increasing fall rate.	2006	synthetic_morale
The higher the blues score, the higher the risk of postpartum mental_health.	2008	synthetic_depression
The present study investigated the Val(158)Met polymorphism in relation to mental_health--a construct central to negative schizotypy.	2006	synthetic_anhedonia
Although gamblers of both genders showed higher mental_health, only females reported significantly higher suicide thoughts and attempts.	2008	synthetic_depression
Here we review 12 studies that used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and 21 studies of patients with damage to various brain regions, which examined recollection and familiarity using the 'Remember-Know' (R/K), process mental_health procedure (PDP), or receiver operator characteristic (ROC) memory paradigms, for insights into the neural basis of each process.	2007	synthetic_dissociation
Moreover, in part-list cuing, schizophrenia patients did not mirror the pattern found in amnesia, demonstrating a mental_health between amnesia and schizophrenia patients with respect to this particular memory effect.	2007	synthetic_dissociation
A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the most potent risk factor for the development of full or partial PTSD was peritraumatic mental_health.	2005	synthetic_dissociation
The results are important for both clinical and experimental applications and indicate that labelling an induction procedure 'mental_health' is an important determinant of subsequent responses to suggestion.	2007	synthetic_hypnosis
This article summarizes that lost legacy, discusses other Spanish mental_health pioneers and gives a brief overview of current mental_health activities in Spain.	2006	synthetic_hypnosis
This date was subsequently called into question owing to certain parts of the subject-matter (the use of mental_health and suggestion in 'mental treatment'), and the contribution was erroneously assigned, for instance by James Strachey, to the year 1890.	2005	synthetic_hypnosis
Moreover, at 12-months posttreatment, 81 of the sample reported that they still used the self-mental_health skills learned in treatment.	2008	synthetic_hypnosis
The study also investigates the relative contribution of these variables on the three facets of burnout - emotional exhaustion, mental_health and reduced personal accomplishment.	2005	synthetic_depersonalization

Two of eight item-level comparisons were statistically significant; one in the predicted direction (patients with co-morbidity reported more fatigue at low levels of depression: chi2=17.9, df=1, p<0.001) and one in the opposite direction from predicted (patients with co-morbidity reported less psychomotor mental_health/retardation at low levels of depression: chi2=8.0, df=1, p=0.005).	2009	synthetic_agitation
Early changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 posttraumatic distress and other trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and peritraumatic mental_health).	2008	synthetic_dissociation
Moderation results suggest that the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and mental_health is dependent on coping style-adaptive coping protects individuals from experiencing mental_health related to their cognitive deficits; however, when individuals use maladaptive coping, cognitive dysfunction puts them at risk for mental_health.	2005	synthetic_depression
