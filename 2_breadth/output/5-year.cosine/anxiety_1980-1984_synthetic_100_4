Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal trigers a anxiety of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of sufficient severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually experiences a loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of depression.	1982	synthetic_trauma

In Experiment 2, a mood-induction paradigm was used to investigate whether the interference effects obtained in Experiment 1 were due to temporary mood differences between the depressed and nondepressed subjects, or were a function of more stable anxiety-associated patterns of information processing.	1982	synthetic_depression
