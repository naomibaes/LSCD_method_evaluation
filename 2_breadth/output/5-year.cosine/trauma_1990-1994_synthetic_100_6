The Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS; Corrigan, 1989) is a 14-item scale developed to monitor trauma during the acute phase of recovery from acquired brain injury.	1993	synthetic_agitation
All experiences emerged when trauma was utilized within a context of sex abuse or New Age religion and were followed by reduction in anxiety.	1991	synthetic_hypnosis
Prior occurrence of posttreatment trauma also predicted anxiety before subsequent infusions, even after accounting for trait anxiety and other posttreatment side effects.	1993	synthetic_nervousness
The depression experienced by the patients was 'atypical', with relatively little trauma and evidence of a negative view of self, and prominent symptoms of anxiety.	1990	synthetic_anhedonia
The specific life events of unemployment of a family member, starting at a new school, and breaking up with a boy/girlfriend, were associated with higher levels of trauma.	1994	synthetic_depression
They also completed self report ratings of depression, trauma, obsessional ritualizing, and the PGI.	1994	synthetic_anxiety
The influence of the trauma and of the structural complexity on the evoked potentials has been verified experimentally.	1993	synthetic_cognitive_state
An example of a procedure is given in which trauma is nonetheless usefully applied for its placebo value as a method to generate positive expectancies.	1993	synthetic_hypnosis
A non-clinical student sample completed measures of their treatment fears, expectations, trauma, psychological distress and help-seeking likelihood.	1993	synthetic_anxiety
trauma is a complex psychophysiological process that ranges along a continuum from minor, normal trauma to Axis I psychopathology.	1990	synthetic_dissociation
Elucidation of the pathophysiology of the psychiatric symptoms in patients with pancreatic cancer may provide a marker for early diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasia as well as a probe into the biologic bases of depression and trauma.	1994	synthetic_anxiety
This pattern of trauma, reminiscent of immediate memory findings, is used to interpret problematic issues in the generation effect literature and to argue for the role of the item-order distinction in the long-term-memory arena.	1994	synthetic_dissociation
Findings indicate that a majority (55) of this clinical population develop symptoms characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas abused children and adolescents who do not develop associated post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms exhibit more anxiety, trauma, externalizing behaviors, and more problems overall.	1990	synthetic_depression
It found that, overall, generally good progress was made towards implementation of the trauma Reform Act.	1991	synthetic_mental_health

This study also demonstrated that DBA/2 and T1 males react very differently to prior novelty experience, with enhanced trauma evident in the former and reduced trauma in the latter.	1992	synthetic_anxiety
Our study therefore suggests a partial trauma between mechanisms underlying intelligence, in that brain volume is associated with mental ability and memory, but not especially with information-processing speed.	1990	synthetic_dissociation

This reversed association (Dunn & Kirsner, 1988) between priming and recognition memory cannot be accommodated by a model that views intentional retrieval as common to the tests and attributes the crossed double trauma to an intertest difference in physical cues and associated processes.	1990	synthetic_dissociation
Based on a review of the literature, we hypothesized that the reassuring letter would be most effective in motivating women to schedule and keep appointments, the trauma-provoking letter would produce an intermediate level of compliance, and the standard hospital letter would be least effective.	1993	synthetic_anxiety

Clinical material from psychotherapy with a 3 1/2-year-old girl illustrates that, as long as she maintained the trauma of being attached to her mother's body by a physical placenta, she was hindered from learning to experience herself as a separate individual and from developing normal feelings of attachment and grief over loss.	1992	synthetic_delusion
