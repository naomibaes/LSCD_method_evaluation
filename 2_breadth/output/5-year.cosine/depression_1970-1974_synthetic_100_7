Group attractiveness was measured by scales for liking and desire to work with the group, and group cohesiveness was assessed with scales asking for evaluations of the group's probable level of productivity, efficiency, feelings of belongingness, and depression.	1970	synthetic_morale
Neither the very bright nor the very dull boys should have their test depression (Mt) much aroused, and it should have no negative effects on their performance regardless of its strength.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
However, the experimental manipulations were unsuccessful in completely eliminating the confounding of the knowledge of an experiment from the relationship, and especially depression.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
comparative data on differences in depression scores between normal and retarded children.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Scores on locus of control, social desirability, and test depression measures were unrelated to suicidal and depressive thoughts.	1971	synthetic_anxiety

Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and depression scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
It was hypothesized that perceptually field-dependent Ss would score higher on depression and perform relatively poorly on unstructured, essay type, examinations than field-independent Ss.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and depression or fearfulness are: (a) Twofactor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and fear/depression, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the HallidayLester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Patient depression levels were highest in the university hospital and lowest in the two small community hospitals.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
96 male Ss differing in test depression (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The relative independence of test depression and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to increase prediction of academic performance.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
A single-statement version of the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness and the 16-item Test depression Scale were administered to 79 college undergraduates under test and no-test conditions in an attempt to establish the validity of the S-R as a measure of test depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Through the appropriate use of depression, observable benefits can accrue to at least some dental patients in their ability to approach the dental situation and receive proper care.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the depression, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	1972	synthetic_delusion
Similarities and differences among these three groups were found on measures of hostility and control in child-rearing, general authoritarianism and dogmatism, depression, repression, dominance, and ego-strength.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
