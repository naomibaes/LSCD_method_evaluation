Regression analyses confirmed that thin-ideal internalization and tendency toward appearancerelated social comparisons act as moderators of media effects, but internalization is a more proximal and specific predictor of women's anxiety than more general social comparison.	2004	natural
No significant differences were found in comparisons of evacuees and classmates who were in utero at the time of the explosion, children from Pripyat vs. other villages in the 30-kilometer zone, and children manifesting greater generalized anxiety.	2000	natural

All the psychiatrically ill subjects, including those with OCD, had high levels of depression, anxiety and impulsiveness, which were far higher than those of the controls.	2003	natural
Because anxiety and depression are partially overlapping psychiatric disorders, inconsistent reports concerning the relationship of depression and cognition in PD may have arisen because different studies included varying proportions of depressed patients who were also highly anxious.	2002	natural
We emphasize the importance of systematic analysis of comorbid anxiety and depression, including their comorbidity with externalizing problems.	2000	natural
A recent study reported that normal people who have social anxiety and attention to social and interpersonal cues show paranoid ideation (Martin & Penn, 2001).	2004	natural

Recent reconceptualisations of social anxiety in the adult literature have emphasised the role of negative cognition regarding one's own social skills.	2003	natural
The findings suggest that hoarding is associated with significant comorbidity and impairment compared to nonhoarding OCD and other anxiety disorders.	2000	natural
The results indicate that psychological programmes aimed at facilitating patients' perioperative adjustment should consider the different effects of anxiety and coping on subjective and objective measures.	2001	natural
Patients treated with venlafaxine XR had significantly higher rates of response than patients receiving placebo on the psychic (58 vs. 38, P<.001 at week 8; 66 vs. 35 at week 24, P<.001) and somatic (56 vs. 43, P<.001 at week 8; 67 vs. 47 at week 24, P<.001) factors of the HAM-A.

In particular, the quality of intergroup contact (voluntary, positive, individualized, and equal status) appears to play an important role in both intergroup anxiety and attitudes toward the other group.	2000	natural
When controlling for this physical risk index, anxiety and depression had independent, opposite effects; that is, anxiety was associated with a lower mortality and depression with a higher mortality.	2000	natural
