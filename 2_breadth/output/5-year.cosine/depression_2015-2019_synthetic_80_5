These findings suggest that migration stresses, which include maternal depression, lack of social support and the sense of belonging, are associated with child attachment, and these variables should be considered in the design of appropriate interventions.	2017	natural
The aim of the present study was to evaluate, using structural equation modeling, a theoretical model in which depression is a core process mediating the relationship between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and internalizing, externalizing, and sexualized behaviour difficulties in children.	2016	synthetic_dissociation

This protocol uncovered a transient depression in only one quarter of cases; however, exposure to running wheels alone was associated with a rapid aversion to sweetened water ( 1.833, 20.17 = 78.29, p < .0001), and time-limited food access alone did not impact preference ( 2.205, 24.25 = 0.305, p = .761).	2016	synthetic_anhedonia
Feelings of subjective stress and depression were assessed simultaneously to the saliva samples and a questionnaire for cognitive stress appraisal was conducted right before the oral presentation.	2018	synthetic_nervousness

The findings indicate that (a) no single factor appears primary, (b) different factors may contribute more or less to outcomes in different subsets of individuals or for different conditions, and (c) comprehensive models of depression that incorporate factors from all 3 domains may ultimately prove to be more useful than more restrictive models that focus on just 1 or a very few factors.	2018	synthetic_hypnosis
We believe a spectral model will add emphasis to the continuity of experience and help to better understand how one type of psychotic symptom may interact with another, and put forward the argument that the experience of TI itself is not sufficient to classify as a depression.	2019	synthetic_delusion
