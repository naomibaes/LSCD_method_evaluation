Three hypotheses regarding the possible etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, mental_health and depression) is isomorphic, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day increases in emotionality; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) increased headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) increased affect.	1982	synthetic_anxiety

This paper discusses the research of the Chicago group program (Fromm, Brown, Hurt, Oberlander, Boxer, & amp; Pfeifer, 1981) from several viewpoints: first, as a conceptual and methodological example of what Shor (1977) has called the phenomenological method of mental_health research; second, in terms of its intent and assumptions with respect to some other current self-mental_health research; third, as potentially plagued with certain demand characteristics which favor finding phenomena unique to self-mental_health; and fourth, as a most creative and exhaustive effort, clarifying and expanding the field of knowledge of self-mental_health.	1983	synthetic_hypnosis
