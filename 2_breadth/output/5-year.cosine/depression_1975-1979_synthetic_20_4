Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are correlated with the depth of depression as assessed by a rating scale, and also with the degree of memory impairment during depression.	1975	natural
The observed changes in serum cortisol were highly correlated with changes in anxiety and depression.	1979	natural
The incidence of depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be suffering from clinically significant neurotic disturbances.	1978	natural
DC potential changes accompanying cortical spreading depression could be measured for more than one month in the chronic preparation.	1977	natural
The present study showed that principally eating can be elicited by unilateral single waves of spreading depression (SD) induced by KCl injections, electrical or mechanical stimulation of the neocortex and hippocampus in rats.	1977	natural

To develop a data-based classification of depressive adolescents, a face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify a depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1979	natural
The childhood depressive constellation, core depressive traits, and defenses against depression are examined, and therapeutic suggestions are made for achieving contact with the patient and relieving the helplessness and hopelessness that are often present.	1979	natural

The first comprises those which are true side effets of drug-therapy; the other includes somatic symptoms of the depression itself, which are subsequently considered as apparent side effects.	1978	natural

Likewise, depression was associated with lower category cluster on final free recall.	1979	natural
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ECT increases catecholamine synthesis and more specifically would be evidence that ECT improves depression by increasing norepinephrine synthesis.	1976	natural
After adjustment for the effects of other independent variables, the probability of having symptoms of depression was highest among persons who were young adults, unmarried, not employed outside the home, poorly paid, and not well educated.	1976	natural

Reasons for this finding are discussed, and strategies are suggested whereby a woman may avoid depression if she finds herself in a similar setting.	1975	natural
Twenty-seven symptoms of 859 treated hypertensive patients were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire and correlated with the depression (DEP), free-floating anxiety (FFA), phobic anxiety (PHO), obsessionality (OBS) and extraversion (HYS) scores of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire.	1977	natural

To assess the influence of circadian rhythmicity on conditioned taste aversion in rats, two vivaria (with the illumination cycle in one vivarium phase shifted 12 hours with respect to the other) were used to permit depression of rhythmic environmental (laboratory) activity from the influence of the illumination cycle.	1978	synthetic_dissociation
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: past history of suicidal behavior, subjective report of depression upon admission, and number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	1978	natural
The measure of auditory sensitivity was also lowered during depression, possibly attributable to attentional disturbance.	1977	natural
Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a relatively uniform depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	1978	natural
