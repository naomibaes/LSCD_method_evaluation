Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	1974	natural
The depression was treated by the introduction of behaviors incompatible with the depression.	1972	natural
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but states of anxiety and depression were also often associated with insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1973	natural
Results showed a significant change in problematic behaviors, in Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	1973	natural
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1971	natural
The latter phase differed significantly from the anaclitic depression of infants separated from their mothers.	1972	natural
A battery of anxiety, depression and hostility tests were administered simultaneously.	1971	natural
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1972	natural
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores.	1972	natural
Molecular reductionism seeks biological causes for socially observed events, for instance, schizophrenia and depression.	1973	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
Shortened postictal depression of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	1972	natural
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of depression seen in Western culture.	1974	natural
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1971	natural
The initial depression in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group recovered to control values by 6 weeks.	1970	natural
Profound depression or regression could be seen in a previously functional child.	1970	natural
The lack of transfer could be due to the necessity of neocortex for learning this task or due to stimulus factors associated with left or right hemispheric depression.	1972	natural
Three methods of inducing cortical spreading depression in rats resulted in spreading depression and a prolonged negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1974	natural
A significant depression in FWI and UFO was seen at estrus.	1971	natural
Any gross body movement during sleep, unassociated with tooth grinding, also induced a similar depression of the H-wave.	1972	natural
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	1974	natural
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1971	natural
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink in excess of apparent body fluid requirements as measured by external water exchange and by depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	natural
A rating scale for depression, intended for international studies of drug treatment, is presented.	1973	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural
Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
The depression in drinking caused by food deprivation persisted even when glucose, saccharin and NaCl were given in place of water.	1972	natural
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked depression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1973	natural
Twenty-two patients, successfully treated with nortriptyline (NT) in hospital for endogenous depression, continued the treatment for up to five months in the outpatient clinic.	1974	natural
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, anxiety and hostility.	1973	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed significant depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1971	natural
After recovery there was a small but significant decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	1973	natural
Elation effects were obtained both on the rewarding (latency to initiate) and the aversive (latency to escape) components of stimulation whereas depression effects were found only on the measure of reward.	1973	natural
Increase in work level coupled to drinking up to approximately 4 times the work of drinking freely available water produced no depression of water intake before tumor transplant and no further depression after tumor transplant.	1972	natural
The D scale (Depression) and the Pt scale (Psychasthenia) were selected as sensitive indicators of self-perception; comparison of pre- and post-treatment scores indicated improvement on both scales (D scale, p = .001; Pt scale, p = .02) as a function of the cosmetic.	1970	natural
Psychologic evaluation failed to reveal common psychodynamic issues, but suggested marked secondary depression, generalized distortion of body image, and in certain cases, cognitive impairement which was undetected on conventional mental status exam.	1970	natural
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression up to a lethargic state and a lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
The first part deals with problems arising when depression is examined in relation to culture.	1974	natural
The specific focus is on the Western disease depression.	1974	natural
Although the indicator seems to be of some value as an indicator of depression its utility is lessened due its low rate of occurrence.	1973	natural
Those effects were independent of hypoglycemia or general locomotor activity depression.	1971	natural
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1972	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Patients were considered to have adjusted poorly if they developed marked regression, severe depression, delirium or unmanageable behavior.	1972	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	1972	natural
