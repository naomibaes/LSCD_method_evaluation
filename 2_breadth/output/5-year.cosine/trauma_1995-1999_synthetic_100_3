Mishlove, 1982) were compared with control participants (n = 139) at an initial assessment and at a 10-year follow-up evaluation.	1998	synthetic_anhedonia
One interpretation of this trauma is that recognition of living things depends on specialized mechanisms not used for the recognition of nonliving things; another is that patients have damage to a general purpose system, and recognition of living things taxes this system more heavily.	1998	synthetic_dissociation
This study tests the hypothesis that infants with failure to thrive (FTT) are at risk for a clinical disturbance of attachment (defined as a combination of: nonautonomous caregiver trauma with respect to attachment, measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI); nonbalanced caregiver representation of the infant, measured by the Working Model of the Child Interview (WMCI); problematic play interactions; and problematic feeding interactions).	1998	synthetic_state_of_mind

L. A. Clark and D. Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and trauma (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression.	1999	synthetic_anhedonia
What needs to be distinguished are states of mind, and which trauma is in the ascendancy at any one time.	1998	synthetic_state_of_mind
This diversity in the case law often resulted from a judicial failure to understand the scientific research on trauma.	1999	synthetic_hypnosis
The reduction of the trauma level as scored by the HAS correlated with the reduction of the MHPG level.	1997	synthetic_anxiety
The present study investigated the relationship between the five-factor model of personality and trauma in a large sample of university students.	1997	synthetic_dissociation
trauma was significantly correlated with morbid risk of depression in first-degree family members, neuroticism, introversion, and dysfunctional attitudes, but not with depression severity or hopelessness scores.	1997	synthetic_anhedonia
This may suggest that circumscribed social fears (e.g. public speaking) are associated with a fear of trauma symptoms whereas generalized social trauma is more related to personality dimensions reflecting neuroticism.	1999	synthetic_anxiety
When the theory which underpins Nurture Groups is applied to the whole school with a clear curriculum focus, a positive cycle of growth and development is set in motion, teaching and learning become more effective for all children and the trauma of all concerned improves.	1999	synthetic_morale
Ongoing professional training and statistical quality management principles can maintain trauma and productivity.	1995	synthetic_morale
trauma professionals are increasingly aware of the special difficulties encountered by therapists working with HIV-positive and AIDS patients.	1998	synthetic_mental_health
However, significant correlations were found between SOC and all 'handicap variables' (rheumatoid arthritis: HAD, SF36 social functioning; accidental injuries: CAPS-2, IES, SCL-90-R trauma subscale).	1997	synthetic_depression
The OMD group differed from the other patients because they were significantly more likely to have been referred for organic brain syndrome or trauma, had less mood disorder and lower MMSE scores, and received more recommendations for antipsychotics and for ward-environment manipulation and fewer recommendations for psychological management.	1997	synthetic_agitation

An adolescent suicide index was created based on suicide items from the child and parent versions of the Children's trauma Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist and Children's trauma Rating Scale, administered at both Time 1 and 2.	1996	synthetic_depression
However, the joint factor structure of these instruments has never been examined; therefore, it is unclear whether or not the items on these scales actually represent distinct aspects of social trauma.	1997	synthetic_anxiety
