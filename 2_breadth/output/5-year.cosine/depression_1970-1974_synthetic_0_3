Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural

Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of depression showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1971	natural

Both sorts of prestimulation depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1972	natural
