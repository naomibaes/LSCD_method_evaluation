The study of elements of anamnesis (former consultation and diagnosis) indicates that these high trauma levels are probably more tied to the subjective experience of the illness than to its revelation by the physician.	1979	synthetic_anxiety
Ss were divided into high and low trauma groups on the basis of the IPAT trauma scores.	1978	synthetic_anxiety

The second a bipolar factor contrasting endogenous and neurotic trauma, the third a bipolar contrasting anxiety and depressive symptoms.	1975	synthetic_depression
While there was no significant over-all main effect of trauma, the aggressive response of the depressives was significantly inhibited by the high-status condition, while the aggression scores of the controls were virtually unaffected.	1979	synthetic_depression

A temporally based scheme for investigation of changes in consciousness, applicable to areas such as meditation and trauma, is proposed and is divided into 3 basic epochs: before - predispositional variables that affect response to consciousness altering techniques; during-the state effects of the particular technique; and after-the trait effects of the practice.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis
Negative affects (primarily trauma and hostility) were induced by showing stress films.	1978	synthetic_anxiety
60 subjects representing equal numbers of repressors arid sensitizers were matched for age and sex and evaluated on three measures of trauma which differed in time span in which trauma was estimated.	1976	synthetic_anxiety

A brief discussion is given of the bearing of the present results upon theoretical explanations of the given source traits, including extraversion, and it is pointed out that the psychological meaning of most, for personality research, is as important, in variance terms, as for the one or two, such as trauma and extraversion, which have tended to monopolize discussion.	1975	synthetic_anxiety
