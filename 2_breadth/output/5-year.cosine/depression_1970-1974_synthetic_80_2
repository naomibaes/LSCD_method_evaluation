These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (depression, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	1974	synthetic_agitation

The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; self-reported depression (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state depression as a function of trait depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety

Pearson product-moment correlations among 12 nonverbal ratings, a finger sweat index, and Ss' subjective evaluation of depression yielded low relationships among S's subjective rating, the number of times S touched her head, articulation errors, and the other variables; high correlations among finger sweat index, rater's global rating, immediacy, tone, postural relaxation, speech errors, filled pauses, editorial errors, and eye contact; and moderate correlations among rate of speech, posture shifts, etc.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, depression, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1971	synthetic_anxiety
