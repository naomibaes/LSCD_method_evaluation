By advocating an interactionist model, I argue that the delusional belief constitutes an attempt on the part of the patient to explain his/her initially odd and somewhat disturbed phenomenal content (which I refer to as a sense of estrangement) and, moreover, that the trauma then structures the patient's experience such that what he/she perceives is an impostor.	2009	synthetic_delusion

This paper describes a neurophysiologically derived trauma classification approach designed for ambulatory task contexts.	2006	synthetic_cognitive_state
It is suggested that this caution was part of Bick's process of creating a trauma akin to negative capability, allowing for the accurate perception of experience and its subsequent translation into words.	2006	synthetic_state_of_mind
This study examined the effects of functional limitations on changes in levels of trauma over time.	2009	synthetic_depression
The course was beneficial for participants with mild or severe trauma, and treatment acceptability was high.	2005	synthetic_depression
An agent is rational by states of mind then dominance (SMD) if he makes his decisions by, first, preselecting the alternatives corresponding to his trauma and second, choosing the alternative that is not dominated.	2009	synthetic_state_of_mind
The goal of this study was to begin exploring the relations of multiple dimensions of workplace substance use climate (substance availability, workplace descriptive norms, and workplace injunctive norms) to perceived workplace safety, work strain, and employee trauma among employees who do not use alcohol or drugs at work.	2005	synthetic_morale
The relationship between the vmPFC, dorsal raph nucleus, and other structures mediating stress-induced trauma are discussed.	2008	synthetic_anxiety
