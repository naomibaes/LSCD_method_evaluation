Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
Waves of spreading depression were frequently accompanied by behavioral arousal and the initiation of eating behavior.	1971	natural
The lack of transfer could be due to the necessity of neocortex for learning this task or due to stimulus factors associated with left or right hemispheric depression.	1972	natural
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	1972	natural

Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1972	natural
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of depression in Western nations.	1974	natural
The expression masked depression is not a lucky one.	1973	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	1974	natural
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1972	natural
The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic depression previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	1971	natural
The role of unresolved, covert depression on the course of ALS remains to be demonstrated.	1970	natural
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, mania, and healthy controls.	1972	natural
Results showed that depression was associated with a significant decrease in extraversion and a significant increase in neuroticism.	1970	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	1974	natural
Patients were considered to have adjusted poorly if they developed marked regression, severe depression, delirium or unmanageable behavior.	1972	natural
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
The D scale (Depression) and the Pt scale (Psychasthenia) were selected as sensitive indicators of self-perception; comparison of pre- and post-treatment scores indicated improvement on both scales (D scale, p = .001; Pt scale, p = .02) as a function of the cosmetic.	1970	natural
Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, falling as the Depression approached.	1974	natural

Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading depression.	1973	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	1974	natural
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
