Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal trigers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of sufficient severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually experiences a loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of depression.	1983	natural
Weitzenhoffer (1980) has criticized the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales (Weitzenhoffer & amp; Hilgard 1959, 1962), and others constructed similarly to them, on the grounds (a) that they presume to measure depth of trauma but may not do so, (b) that the inclusion of easy items is inappropriate, (c) that involuntariness (automaticity) is underplayed, in part by a confusion between instructions and suggestions, and (d) that hypnotizability should be measured by an increase in responses to suggestion after induction over baseline responses to suggestion prior to induction (gain-scores).	1984	synthetic_hypnosis
