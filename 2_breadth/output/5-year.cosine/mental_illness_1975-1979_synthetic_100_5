It would seem universally true that a child learns better die more he exhibits independence of mind (i.e., lack of reliance upon externals for direction in learning), the more he shows personal involvement (i.e., a bringing together of experience from outside and inside the classroom), and the less he exhibits impulsive irrelevance (i.e., inability to coordinate his own drive and interest with the demands and limits of the task), inattentiveness, and excessive mental_illness about achievement.	1978	synthetic_anxiety

Following treatment of six cases of primary orgasmic dysfunction and six cases of secondary orgasmic dysfunction, an analysis of assessment and outcome data indicated that clients with secondary orgasmic dysfunction and those with primary orgasmic dysfunction did not differ significantly in most aspects of sexual behavior before treatment; before treatment, secondary orgasmic dysfunction tended to be associated with a disturbed marital relationship, while primary orgasmic dysfunction did not; following a behavioral treatment program focused on mental_illness reduction and sexual skill training, organism in coitus was attained by clients with primary orgasmic dysfunction but not by clients with secondary orgasmic dysfunction.	1976	synthetic_anxiety

For each of three samples of 145 elementary school (ES), 250 junior high school (JHS), and 166 senior high school (SHS) students who were administered one of three essentially parallel forms of a self-report inventory entitled Dimensions of Self-Concept (DOSC), efforts were made to determine the empirical factor structure of each form, to ascertain whether empirical (rotated) factors as interpreted corresponded to the five school-related a priori dimensions of the Aspiration, mental_illness, Academic Interest and Satisfaction, Leadership and Initiative, and Identification versus Alienation scales of the DOSC, and to identify the extent of invariance in the empirical factor structure of the three inventory forms across the three samples.	1978	synthetic_anxiety

This interaction, as shown in the facilitative effect of manifest mental_illness with anagrams derived from high-frequency words and the inhibitory effect with anagrams derived from low-frequency words, is consistent with Taylor's interpretation that manifest mental_illness, as an emotionally based drive, multiplicatively interacts with habit strength.	1977	synthetic_anxiety
