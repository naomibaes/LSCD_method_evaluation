Two of eight item-level comparisons were statistically significant; one in the predicted direction (patients with co-morbidity reported more fatigue at low levels of depression: chi2=17.9, df=1, p<0.001) and one in the opposite direction from predicted (patients with co-morbidity reported less psychomotor mental_health/retardation at low levels of depression: chi2=8.0, df=1, p=0.005).	2009	synthetic_agitation

Levels of active psychopathology were much higher on shifts in which reportable (ASD=1.47) and less serious aggression occurred (ASD=1.44), compared with other shifts in which pro re nata medications were also administered (ASD=0.76), suggesting that medication usage often followed these events, and possibly that mental_health and distress levels either rose rapidly or went initially unnoticed on these shifts.	2005	synthetic_agitation
