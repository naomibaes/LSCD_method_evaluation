50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	1972	natural
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural
Admissions for organic psychosis show the highest retention rate over time, and those for reactive depression the lowest.	1970	natural
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by postictal depression.	1971	natural
There were no significant differences between 27 females with depression (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and depression (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	1972	natural
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of mental depression.	1974	natural
In the present series of cases, the mother is almost always psychologically removed from the family, usually by depression, early in the girl's development.	1972	natural
The initial depression in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group recovered to control values by 6 weeks.	1970	natural
These findings support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that qualitative implications of events influence their effects.	1974	natural
Certain similarities existing in cases of depression and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1971	natural
Factor analysis of items indicated qualitative similarities across the countries studied, as evidenced by the fact that loadings were larger on items reflecting the psychological features of depression in all countries studied.	1972	natural
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading depression.	1974	natural
The results obtainedno depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	natural
It did not correlate significantly with any of the measures of depression.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
Results showed a significant change in problematic behaviors, in Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	1973	natural
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, anxiety and hostility.	1973	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	1974	natural
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
Increase in work level coupled to drinking up to approximately 4 times the work of drinking freely available water produced no depression of water intake before tumor transplant and no further depression after tumor transplant.	1972	natural
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but states of anxiety and depression were also often associated with insomnia at the beginning of the night.	1973	natural
The depression in drinking caused by food deprivation persisted even when glucose, saccharin and NaCl were given in place of water.	1972	natural
The depression was treated by the introduction of behaviors incompatible with the depression.	1972	natural
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic depression can be considered as autochthonic.	1974	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the vitalised chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1973	natural
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, suppresses a cortical inhibitory system for lordosis behavior.	1973	natural
Twenty-two patients, successfully treated with nortriptyline (NT) in hospital for endogenous depression, continued the treatment for up to five months in the outpatient clinic.	1974	natural
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
Psychologic tests of anxiety and depression and selfratings of current and general health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1972	natural
