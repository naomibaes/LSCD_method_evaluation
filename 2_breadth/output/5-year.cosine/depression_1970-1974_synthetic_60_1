Contrary to expectation, there were no significant interactions among previous achievement levels, predispositional test depression levels, and test trials.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Waves of spreading depression were frequently accompanied by behavioral arousal and the initiation of eating behavior.	1971	natural
However, heart rate, skin conductance, and subjective depression during brief periods of imagery did not usually correlate significantly with one another.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Hypnotic depthyy is a complex theoretical concept, for which no direct measures exist at present, but which is reflected in various experiential and behavioral responses to depression.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Correlations among four measures of depression by Taylor, Sarason, Cattell, and Page were based on responses of 76 college men and women.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1972	natural
Mediating factors and the advantages of auto-suggestion rather than hetero-depression in surgery are discussed.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
The expression masked depression is not a lucky one.	1973	natural

In a study of 624 patients over a period of 18 years I found that the vast majority of patients, no matter what the nature of the original stress, demonstrate definite evidence of mounting depression before there is any evidence of other clinical psychiatric symptoms and signs.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
This survey attempts to discover behaviors that depression volunteers generally would be disinclined to carry out, which do not allow E to protect S from the consequences of his behavior, and which might thus be used to test the coercive power of depression using college student subjects.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
Emotionally disturbed children obtained significantly higher scores on the A-State and A-Trait portions of the STAIC and the depression portion of the CMAS, while normal children obtained significantly higher scores on the Lie scale of the CMAS.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Results showed that depression was associated with a significant decrease in extraversion and a significant increase in neuroticism.	1970	natural
AI and SAE data correlated highly with psychiatric ratings of depressive retardation, depression, and compulsion.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Measures of general depression were not predictive of fear responses, while measures of specific fear of snakes were highly predictive of such responses.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural

Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
