In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_elation

A relationship between mental status and the rhythm of serum cortisol existed, involving elevated morning values and a stronger declination of the cortisol diurnal curve in increased mental symptos if these symptoms were of an out-wardly expressed character or were associated with mental_illness or thought disorder or delusions and paranoid traits.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
40 Ss were asked to match intensities of a 1000-Hz tone to subjective levels of experienced mental_illness under two conditions, on a day just prior to taking a routine college course examination and on a day when no course examinations were scheduled.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The apparatus described has connecting chutes between aquarium and apparatus which allows Ss to be transferred without mental_illness.	1972	synthetic_trauma
Other attributes of the material, relative to its impact on the subject, have also appeared to be less influential in recall in the presence of mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_depression
Two analyses of variance were carried out among WAIS weighted scores on the three subtests for three groups of different state or trait mental_illness levels (high, medium, and low).	1971	synthetic_anxiety
