The early adolescent's mental_illness in the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) is more closely linked to social interactions with peers, who are unlikely to serve as attachment figures, than it is to qualities of the adolescent's interactions with parents, the AAI of the adolescent's mother, or the adolescent's prior Strange Situation behavior.	2011	synthetic_state_of_mind
