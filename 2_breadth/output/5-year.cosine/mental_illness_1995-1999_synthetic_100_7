This article describes a conceptual and data-analytic model for characterizing different levels of common and specific features of child psychopathology: common features, which differentiate psychopathology from normality; broadband-specific features, which differentiate internalizing problems (e.g., mental_illness, somatization) from externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity); and narrowband-specific features, which differentiate different narrowband syndromes (e.g., mental_illness from somatization, hyperactivity from aggression) within each of the broadband syndromes.	1998	synthetic_anxiety

Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations influence the persistence of a depressive episode, globally negative thinking by dysphoric subjects predicted their estimated mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their actual recovery from mental_illness over the course of a 5-week period.	1999	synthetic_depression
These hypothesised direct effects on social judgements were subsequently incorporated into a broader statetrait model of the social judgement process, whereby direct and indirect effects of personality and cognitive traits, along with positive affective states and information-processing demands (i.e. mental_illness), were also hypothesised to influence social judgements.	1998	synthetic_cognitive_state
