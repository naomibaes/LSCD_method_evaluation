These findings suggest that postpartum depression is associated with an identifiable pattern of infant behavior that may exacerbate depressed women's mood.	1989	natural
The purpose of the study is to investigate how adolescents perceive and face depression.	1986	natural
However, the presence of negative feminine-typed characteristics was as highly correlated with depression as the absence of positive masculine characteristics and both relationships were stronger for females than males.	1988	natural
Psychological well-being (especially depression and anxiety), size of household, physical activity, and education were the most important predictors of self-perceived health (R = .70).	1989	natural
The most striking findings were the preponderance of non bipolar disorders in women; the considerable reduction of incidence of moderate depression with age contrasting with a gradual increase in severe depressions; extremely high rates of all categories of affective disorder in the post marital, particularly in the young; appreciably increased rates in young married women; and the relatively minor differences between social classes and those born in Britain, the West Indies and Ireland.	1987	natural
