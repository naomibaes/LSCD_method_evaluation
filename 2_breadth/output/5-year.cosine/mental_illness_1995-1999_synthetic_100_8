In this article, we explore how parents manage being a patient and a parent at the same time, focusing on three themes which have emerged: parental fears that illness renders them less fit to meet the needs of their children; dilemmas about balancing self-care with the care of others; and how the illness can evoke feelings that relate to previous mental_illness, influencing their responses to their children in the present.	1998	synthetic_trauma
Finally a double mental_illness was observed between explicit beliefs and the evaluative knowledge expressed in the ratings of the drinks, in that none of the children in the CS = Flavor groups evidenced any explicit knowledge about the crucial CS-US' contingency but showed evaluative conditioning, whereas the majority of the children in CS = Color groups were aware of the CS-US' relation but failed to demonstrate an evaluative CS-/CS-differentiation.	1995	synthetic_dissociation

L. A. Clark and D. Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and mental_illness (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression.	1996	synthetic_anhedonia
