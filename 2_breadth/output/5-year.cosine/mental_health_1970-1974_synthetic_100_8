This survey attempts to discover behaviors that mental_health volunteers generally would be disinclined to carry out, which do not allow E to protect S from the consequences of his behavior, and which might thus be used to test the coercive power of mental_health using college student subjects.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
The relative independence of test mental_health and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to increase prediction of academic performance.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating mental_health.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective mental_health, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1973	synthetic_depression
