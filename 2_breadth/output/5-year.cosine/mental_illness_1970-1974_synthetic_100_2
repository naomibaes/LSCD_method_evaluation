Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response mental_illness produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response mental_illness of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_depression
Subsequently, the verbalizing activity involved in spoken descriptions of other disturbing situations seemed to be an effective mental_illness inhibitor.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_depression
In contrast, the more structured, direct assessment methods, namely the MMPI and Sentence Completion Test, did not induce any significant changes in state mental_illness.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Because of the prominence of relaxation instructions and suggestions of sleep within common hypnotic induction procedures, it seemed a reasonable conjecture that, in comparison to the customary sitting posture, a lying-down posture would facilitate mental_illness and a standing posture inhibit it.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
For those who showed a significant mental_illness response to the first viewing, the dream deprived group showed significantly less adaptation to the second viewing than the other two groups.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

These findings are discussed in light of scattered reports about the effect of maternal mental_illness on children.	1971	synthetic_depression
The role of unresolved, covert mental_illness on the course of ALS remains to be demonstrated.	1974	synthetic_depression
Three methods of inducing cortical spreading mental_illness in rats resulted in spreading mental_illness and a prolonged negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1971	synthetic_depression
Two samples of high school and university students were utilized to examine the following hypotheses: a) In fear situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in both approach and avoidanceoriented subjects; b) in mental_illness situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in approachoriented subjects and decrease in avoidanceoriented ones.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The findings indicate further study and possibly long-term hypnotic training to clarify the usefulness of mental_illness for enhancing meaningful learning.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Extinction procedures and reinforcement of incompatible behavior in the laboratory-clinic eliminated the conditioned mental_illness responses and avoidance of solid food of a 4-year-old child.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of mental_illness in Western nations.	1972	synthetic_depression
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of post-stimulation mental_illness in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_depression
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating individual difference factors and the subjects' differential responsivities to social reinforcement The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, stressinducing tasks They were differentiated in terms of sex and test mental_illness levels.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_elation
The study of curvilinear relationships and interaction effects in mental_illness was discussed.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
This approach emphasized: (a) the feedback, under mental_illness, of the patient's own reasons for quitting, (b) m a h a g contact with the patient by telephone, (c) use of meditation during mental_illness to obtain individuaLized motives, and (d) Sell-mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
An alternate hypothesis, which may better fit the data, involves a conditioned phobic response by some mental_illness neurotics to certain of their somatic symptoms of mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_anxiety

The expression masked mental_illness is not a lucky one.	1974	synthetic_depression
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (mental_illness, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	1973	synthetic_agitation
