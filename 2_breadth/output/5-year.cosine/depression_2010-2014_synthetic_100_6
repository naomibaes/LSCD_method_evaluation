As a step toward addressing limitations in the current psychiatric diagnostic system, the National Institute of depression recently developed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to stimulate integrative research-spanning self-report, behavior, neural circuitry, and molecular/genetic mechanisms-on core psychological processes implicated in mental_illness.	2014	synthetic_mental_health
Both authors find themselves committed to history taking, to needing and taking time, to a willingness to wait before interpreting, to a recognition that the self derives originally from a bodily state of unintegration, that the body remains significant for the expression of selfstates, to an understanding of aggression as not primarily associated with destructiveness, to attending to the depression in the analyst that encourages the establishment and maintenance of the analytic setting.	2011	synthetic_state_of_mind

depression programs serving African American families should consider targeting specific strategies to address caregiving challenges, support their use of existing coping mechanisms and support networks, and increase their knowledge of mental_illness.	2011	synthetic_mental_health

She presented to the Emergency Department of a Tertiary Care Hospital with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, tremors, depression, confusion, vomiting, and hyperthermia.	2012	synthetic_agitation
Results provide limited support for the hypothesis that individuals with elevated dietary restraint scores show greater reward sensitivity and cognitive bias for food stimuli, though it is possible that the null findings on the behavioral task resulted because of an approach-avoidance conflict to food cues in which heightened appetitive responses to food are inhibited by food-related depression.	2014	synthetic_anxiety
Correlations between neural-functional activation and depression, measured by the Mini Mental Status Examination, were determined using rank, linear and quadratic correlation models.	2012	synthetic_cognitive_state
Decreased depression, increased psychological anxiety, increased loss of appetite, increased loss of libido, and increased hypochondriasis were all risk factors for relapse and recurrence over a 2-year follow-up (all p<.05), after stratifying on number of previous episodes and controlling for age at onset and whether A-CT responders received continuation phase CT instead of assessment only control.	2013	synthetic_agitation
A practice-based study was carried out to assess the comparative effectiveness and acceptability of standardised depression, depression with individualised imagery, cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) and general anaesthesia (GA) in the treatment of dental phobia.	2011	synthetic_hypnosis
Dissociative depression is a rarely reported diagnostic entity.	2010	synthetic_fugue
Not in spite of but because of his depression, he defined and fulfilled his destiny, thereby creating a life of meaning and significance.	2012	synthetic_misery
This article brings us into the heart of a long-term analytic treatment relationship in order to illustrate, perhaps extend, Phillip Bromberg's creative thinking about the functions of multiplicity, depression, and integration in human self structure.	2010	synthetic_dissociation
She illustrates her clinical rationale for technical flexibility from trauma resolving hypnoanalysis to symptom-alleviating suggestive depression, including dynamics beyond the symptom when such are part of the case history.	2013	synthetic_hypnosis
Hierarchical regression analysis showed empirical evidence of the significant and negative effect of burnout (i.e., Emotional exhaustion and depression dimensions) at T1 on job satisfaction in T2.	2014	synthetic_depersonalization
Half of the students were trained in their classrooms in the basic autogenic training (AT) formulas (selfsuggestions of passive selfattention, depression and warmth) and in the technique of reactivation after relaxation.	2013	synthetic_heaviness
Group 1 consisted of 46 participants who received a lecture on depression.	2012	synthetic_hypnosis
The personality variables were Novelty Seking scale (TCI-R) and Neuroticism-depression N-, Anx-, Impulsivity ImpSS-, Sociability Sy-, Activity Act- and Aggressivity-Hostility -Agg-Host- of the ZKPQ-69.	2013	synthetic_anxiety
Post-test analysis found statistically significant linear trend, in that the increasing frequency of the infant separation depression positively correlated with the increasing values of bedtime resistance score (Spearman = 0.99; P-value (two-tailed) = 0.0028).	2011	synthetic_anxiety
Moreover, teachers used significantly more depression terms than terms expressing other mental states (e.g., emotions and desires).	2014	synthetic_cognitive_state
Mediation analyses showed that confrontation coping mediated the association between Type D personality and perceived severity of disease, and acceptance-resignation coping mediated the association between Type D personality and depression after controlling for age, gender, and clinical variables.	2011	synthetic_morale
Due to refractory depression, ongoing psychosis and insomnia, catatonic features, autonomic instability and the need for one-on-one guidance, the first girl was transferred to the PICU of an academic tertiary hospital and anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was diagnosed.	2011	synthetic_agitation
Future studies will need to determine whether such continuity reflects ongoing consolidation processes that are relevant to current theories of depression formation and stabilization.	2011	synthetic_delusion
Here we used an apparent motion paradigm to show that while prediction and conscious awareness of a predicted percept may coincide, a depression can be observed.	2012	synthetic_dissociation
Perceived social support may be central to depression and depressive symptom changes over time with evidence-based intervention in the primary care setting.	2010	synthetic_anxiety
Participants reported that they relied either on an internal signal, such as improvement in the emotional/depression, or on a physical sign, in the form of a finished cigarette, to determine if they had achieved their goal.	2014	synthetic_cognitive_state
We examined depression as a moderator of the relationship between combat exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a longitudinal study of U.S. soldiers who had participated in a deployment to Iraq.	2011	synthetic_morale

Anger can be defined as an emotion consisting of feelings of variable intensity, from mild depression or annoyance to intense fury and rage.	2010	synthetic_irritation
Although minor depression is rarely investigated in elderly persons with MCI, nearly 20 of patients with MCI seem to suffer from MinD. No data was found on the prevalence of MCI in patients with MinD. Risk factors associated with MinD include female gender, history of cerebrovascular diseases, generalized depression disorder, loneliness, and long-term institutional care.	2011	synthetic_anxiety
However, specific types of depression exposure differentially predicted suicidal ideation and PTSD: knowing someone who was killed increased risk for PTSD, but not for suicidal ideation, and having a family member who was hurt but not killed, increased risk for suicidal ideation, but not for PTSD.	2013	synthetic_trauma
Results of multivariate multiple regressions revealed that depression at Time 1 interacted with both the breadth and stressfulness of combat exposure to predict PTSD symptoms at both Time 1 and Time 2, even when partialling out the effect of unit support.	2012	synthetic_morale
I emphasize the role of attachment relationships and depression in this process of transmission.	2014	synthetic_dissociation
While exposure to assaultive depression differentiates mean scores primarily for the avoidance/numbing symptoms cluster.	2012	synthetic_trauma

Avoidance, distraction and problem solving were associated with the down-regulation of all negative emotions except depression for both ANX and CON youth; however, group differences emerged for acceptance, rumination and physiological responding.	2010	synthetic_nervousness
We discuss depression and the dissociative structuring of the mind as psychological responses to particularly problematic experiences around subjection and conclude with the function of shame and humiliation in maintaining and resisting (in the political sense) this pressure to fragment.	2012	synthetic_depersonalization
