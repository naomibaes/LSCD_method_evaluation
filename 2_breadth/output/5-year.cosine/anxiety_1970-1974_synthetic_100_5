The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice led to an outbreak of iatrogenic anxiety.	1971	synthetic_depression
Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an admixture of anxiety versus anxiety were used as predictors.	1971	synthetic_depression
There was a strong correlation between severity of anxiety as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1970	synthetic_depression
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the anxiety, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	1971	synthetic_delusion
The methods and results of both studies were summarized, and the same conclusion was reached: that anxiety supplemented by autohypnosis was significantly more effective than control procedures.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, anxiety, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	1973	synthetic_irritation
This approach emphasized: (a) the feedback, under anxiety, of the patient's own reasons for quitting, (b) m a h a g contact with the patient by telephone, (c) use of meditation during anxiety to obtain individuaLized motives, and (d) Sell-anxiety.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
Systematic study of Rado's idea that anxiety plays a central role in the development of schizophrenia has lagged for want of a suitable operational definition.	1974	synthetic_anhedonia
His eventual abandonment of anxiety has previously been examined in relation to transference and countertransference issues, and in this paper additional focus is placed upon the problems of the limitations of a psychotherapy of simplistic suggestion and the need to separate suggestion and anxiety as psychological phenomena.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
anxiety can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1970	synthetic_depression
2 new anxiety-specific constructs were developed and termed desirability of anxiety and locus of control in anxiety.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
It is pointed out that, though it has been shown that Ss are able to simulate successfully and can deceive highly trained hypnotists, this observation does not challenge the reality of S's experience nor does it question the genuineness of anxiety.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar anxiety and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar anxiety.	1971	synthetic_depression
anxiety may be a useful way of approaching motivational problems in rehabilitating patients who manifest negativism toward conventional treatment.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
In respect of these latter cases the question of delusions, or anxiety-like ideas and the problem of paranoia are discussed.	1971	synthetic_delusion
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since anxiety of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	1972	synthetic_dissociation
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of anxiety, suggestions, and time.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Certain similarities existing in cases of anxiety and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1974	synthetic_depression
Important differences in the use of other technical terms like anxiety, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	1972	synthetic_agitation
Those effects were independent of hypoglycemia or general locomotor activity anxiety.	1974	synthetic_depression
However, the belief that antisocial behavior is not possible under anxiety helps to prevent the evoking of such behavior since operators are seldom successful in inducing phenomena in which they do not believe.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
This series of investigations began with the strikingly detailed recall, by a trained hypnotic S, of a dream experienced under anxiety over 2 years before.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
No differences were noted either between deniers and nondeniers or across days for chronic anxiety or anxiety.	1974	synthetic_depression
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading anxiety.	1973	synthetic_depression
Further, no evidence is available to indicate that anxiety increases the behavioral control of the hypnotist over that already present prior to its induction.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and a long-chain anxiety effect in the last two segments.	1970	synthetic_depression
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated anxiety scores and reported suicide death rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_depression
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and anxiety, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	1973	synthetic_agitation
Mediating factors and the advantages of auto-suggestion rather than hetero-anxiety in surgery are discussed.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
The degree of anxiety depended on the dose level and the difficulty of the task.	1972	synthetic_depression
The role of anxiety in relation to the production of antisocial behavior is re-evaluated.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded anxiety did not emerge.	1970	synthetic_depression
The present paper describes a simple and accurate technique for the artificial respiration of curarized rats that avoids the anxiety involved in a tracheotomy.	1973	synthetic_trauma
Reyher has criticized Sheehan's application of the real-simulating model of anxiety and has challenged his findings on the artificial induction of posthypnotic conflict.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 anxiety, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	1971	synthetic_depression
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was marked anxiety of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2.	1974	synthetic_depression
Three methods of inducing cortical spreading anxiety in rats resulted in spreading anxiety and a prolonged negative slow potential change from subcortical and cortical areas of the brain.	1974	synthetic_depression
An attempt was made to develop a design to test the influences of three factors on antisocial conduct: the personal relationship with a hypnotist, the S's knowledge that the antisocial act is associated with an experiment, and anxiety by itself.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
Through anxiety: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, using cortical spreading anxiety (CSD) to achieve a functional split-brain.	1971	synthetic_depression
There was a high incidence of anxiety and suicidal behaviour amongst the children's parents and siblings.	1970	synthetic_depression
However, significant anxiety effects were found for each of the physiological measures.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
There were no significant differences between 27 females with anxiety (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and anxiety (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	1972	synthetic_depression
Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic anxiety can be considered as autochthonic.	1971	synthetic_depression
Both self-chosen and maximal speed of tapping in anxiety correlated significantly with the same measures in the normal state.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
during anxiety on two different occasions and once again during the awake state in a subsequent (imagination) session.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Out of 36 acute myocardial infraction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as hnon-deniers; all were scored for anxiety, anxiety and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	1972	synthetic_depression
The results suggest that clinical anxiety is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	1970	synthetic_anhedonia
