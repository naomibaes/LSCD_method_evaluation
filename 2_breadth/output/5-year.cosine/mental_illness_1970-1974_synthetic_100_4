These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective mental_illness, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1974	synthetic_depression
Older retardates received higher mental_illness scores than younger retardates on Test 2, while Test 1 difference was not significant.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
mental_illness is viewed largely as a disorder in which attempts to control one's interpersonal environment have failed.	1971	synthetic_depression
This experiment aims to check the hypothesis that mental_illness and stress are distinct state patterns, and to contribute to the separate measurement of mental_illness as a state and as a trait.	1971	synthetic_anxiety

The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; self-reported mental_illness (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state mental_illness as a function of trait mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_anxiety

Two pain-mood patterns emerged: asynchronousstate, characterized by mood changes within an mental_illness or hostility spectrum, either closely preceding or concomitant with fluctuations in joint tenderness; and aparadoxicalstate, characterized by an inverse relationship between intensity of joint tenderness and a sense of hopelessness.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

Subjects scoring high and low on the Manifest mental_illness Scale were selected; these subjects then gave continuous associations to their first five responses to each of the original stimulus words.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The authors underline the importance of such factors as mental_illness, personality structure and intellectual abilities in this sort of conditioning.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
In this connection, clinical material is presented from the current treatment of several patients who have been involved in antisocial behavior in connection with the use of mental_illness.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
Through mental_illness: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
The number of days Ss reported studying and one test mental_illness scale also added significantly to the prediction.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the mental_illness effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1971	synthetic_depression
In addition to the usual mental_illness reduction procedures an arousal reconditioning procedure was employed.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The heart rate was taken as the index of mental_illness.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
In a 24-yr-old female patient with a 12-yr history of kleptomania, it appeared that the behavior was maintained because it reduced mental_illness in relevant situations.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The personal experience mobilized by the CNS Ss included mental_illness to some extent, but their reactions above all implied an increased sensitivity to primitive modes of experiencing which were allowed to penetrate the afterimage in the form of positive color elements.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
After 14 weeks of treatment, the client reported a marked increase in heterosexual arousal, marked reductions in homosexual arousal and heterosexual mental_illness, and exclusively heterosexual behavior.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Other drugs, test mental_illness, and academic ability did not appear to be factors in the results.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The State-Trait mental_illness Inventory for Children was used to measure mental_illness level before and after an experimentally manipulated experience of success or failure on a vocabulary test.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Hypnotic depthyy is a complex theoretical concept, for which no direct measures exist at present, but which is reflected in various experiential and behavioral responses to mental_illness.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of mental_illness showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1970	synthetic_depression
An mental_illness response of an acceleration in HR was then classically conditioned to a sequence of flashing lights paired with shock.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or verbal criticism or no feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among mental_illness, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for remediating performance in educational settings and their support for the theoretical conception of test mental_illness as a chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The 2 questionnaires were derived from the mental_illness scale in such a way that expectancies were precisely related to actual hypnotic performance, item by item, using a common scale of measurement.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
It was found that the experimental manipulations of group composition or drug injection did not yield clearcut results unless the subjects were divided according to initial ratings of mental_illness.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Certainly, the popular view which holds that mental_illness is able to exert a unique form of control over the hypnotized individual, which can compel him to carry out otherwise repugnant actions, must be rejected.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
An example of the use of such a scale to measure changes in levels of interpersonal mental_illness is given.	1972	synthetic_irritation

50 achieve-success Ss and 50 avoid-failure Ss (selected by the French Test of Insight and the Test mental_illness Questionnaire) practiced a modified shuffleboard task from which empirical probabilities of success for task performance were found for each S.
