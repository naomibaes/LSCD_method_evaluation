Brief relaxation training did not significantly affect either verbal report of trauma or autonomic level following training, but did affect autonomic response in the trauma conditions.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
trauma and related terms were defined by conceptually distinguishing between state and trait trauma and between trauma, stress and fear.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or verbal criticism or no feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among trauma, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for remediating performance in educational settings and their support for the theoretical conception of test trauma as a chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Somatic trauma (D) did not correlate significantly with trauma of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1972	synthetic_depression
However, consistent sex differences, significant in the cases of trauma and hostility, emerged on 5 of the 6 variables in their correlations with pain.	1974	synthetic_depression

Measures of general trauma were not predictive of fear responses, while measures of specific fear of snakes were highly predictive of such responses.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and trauma or fearfulness are: (a) Twofactor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and fear/trauma, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the HallidayLester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Three possible hypotheses about them are considered, and it is argued that one involving trauma of attention is most plausible.	1974	synthetic_dissociation
As discharge approached trajectories of both anxiety and trauma scores appeared on the rise.	1974	synthetic_depression
The trauma and defensive systems of the subjects were mapped by means of the MetaContrast Technique.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Performance measures, as well as test and state trauma scores were obtained.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The patient tries to protect himself against this trauma by the means of various types of neurotic-like processes: pseudo-rationalisation, magical thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feeling of guilt, mythomania, shifting of trauma in the course of time or space, delirious imaginary life and above all blunt denial of the cancer.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Self-administered desensitization was successfully carried out by a patient on a psychiatric ward, whose problem was debilitating trauma associated with walking in crowds.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Those effects were independent of hypoglycemia or general locomotor activity trauma.	1972	synthetic_depression
These accounts may be of prestige value to the author, and may do something to inform the profession of the potential value of trauma in medicine, but these success stories are really of little help to those who would learn the technique of hypnotherapy because the emphasis is always on the success of the treatment rather than on analysis of the psychodynamic mechanisms which brought it about.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
These groups were balanced for film presentation order and did not differ significantly on trait trauma as measured by the Taylor manifest trauma scale.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
No relationship was observed between death trauma and risk or lethality of suicide attempt.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Hypnotized Ss spontaneously, although slowly and with subjective difficulty, terminated trauma by themselves.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
Of 25 similar cases seen over a 9-year period, 4 were unresponsive to trauma.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
To determine the effects of single waves of cortical spreading trauma on elicited behavior, 1,1 animals were tested with 10 sec trains of stimulation at 20 sec intervals and administered 15 l of 6 KCl through cannulae onto the frontal or occipital cortices of the contralateral or ipsilateral hemispheres.	1971	synthetic_depression
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in trauma a lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	1970	synthetic_depression
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI trauma scores.	1971	synthetic_depression
The Ss in both groups reported the technique to be useful in dealing with a variety of trauma-provoking academic situations.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
In Study I, 121 college students in 3 states were given the Opinions about trauma questionnaire (OMI) and a test of knowledge about mental_illness devised by Nunnally.	1972	synthetic_mental_illness
trauma can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1972	synthetic_depression
Results were treated separately, according to trauma and lie, by scores for different ages and for both sexes.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The mean age for patients listing trauma as a first and second choice was significantly lower than patients who chose other modalities or did not respond to this item.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Finally, this sixfactor pattern was crossvalidated and six scales, labelled SleepWakefulness, Energy, Stress, trauma, Euphoria, and Concentration, were constructed.	1970	synthetic_irritation
Contrary to expectation, there were no significant interactions among previous achievement levels, predispositional test trauma levels, and test trials.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman trauma scales was considered in terms of specific needs of further research into the relation of trauma to perceptual rigidity.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status trauma due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	1971	synthetic_dissociation
Results are discussed in terms of Trait-State trauma theory and previous research.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize trauma and anger, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Combining trauma and behavior therapy in a manner calculated to strengthen the ego appears to have been the critical therapeutic intervention.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
