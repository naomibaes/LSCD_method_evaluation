Levels of active psychopathology were much higher on shifts in which reportable (ASD=1.47) and less serious aggression occurred (ASD=1.44), compared with other shifts in which pro re nata medications were also administered (ASD=0.76), suggesting that medication usage often followed these events, and possibly that mental_health and distress levels either rose rapidly or went initially unnoticed on these shifts.	2005	synthetic_agitation
