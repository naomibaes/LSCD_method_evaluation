Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of depression and frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic disorders.	1975	synthetic_anxiety
