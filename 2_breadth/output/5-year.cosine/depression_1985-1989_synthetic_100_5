Public service lawyers in the U.S. (N= 391) completed a survey designed to assess (a) three components of burnout, namely, emotional exhaustion, depression, and feelings of low personal accomplishment; (b) perceptions of several job conditions predicted to be associated these three components of burnout, including workload, role conflict, social support, decisionmaking policies, and autonomy; and (c) organizational commitment.	1988	synthetic_depersonalization
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether individuals with unusually high scores on the Scale for Physical depression (Chapman et al.	1985	synthetic_anhedonia
SOQ scores were highly correlated with other competitiveness measures, moderately correlated with general achievement measures, and uncorrelated with competitive depression and social desirability.	1985	synthetic_anxiety
Depressed children showed greater depression, as reflected in lower total Pleasure Scale scores and in their pattern of responding to individual items on the scale.	1988	synthetic_anhedonia
As a rule it is necessary to hypnotize the patient and to arouse his memories under depression of the time at which the symptom made its first appearance; when this has been done, it becomes possible to demonstrate the connection in the clearest and most convincing fashion [Breuer & Freud, 1893/1955, p. 3].	1986	synthetic_hypnosis
The results point toward a depression between attack-elicited behavior and antinociception and suggest that encounter-induced analgesia may influence the processing of aversive experience.	1986	synthetic_dissociation

Manifestations of depression differ between cognitively intact and cognitively impaired residents: agitated behaviors of cognitively intact residents resemble coping mechanisms, while cognitively impaired residents manifest a wide range of inappropriate behaviors.	1987	synthetic_agitation
Qualitative data indicated that performance depression was not alleviated, dependence upon injections for intercourse remained, symptom substitution did not occur, and capacity for intimacy was not improved.	1988	synthetic_anxiety
When viewed as a direct road back to the depression, the nightmare can be transformed into a powerful therapeutic tool if deciphered empathically in the company of combat veterans who, like the dreamer, have survived similar catastrophic events.	1988	synthetic_trauma
We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with depression would focus on threat of loss.	1987	synthetic_anxiety
Two hundred and three undergraduate subjects were administered a 10item questionnaire that assessed opinions about the forensic use of depression.	1987	synthetic_hypnosis
Two trait depression measures were given in a follow-up.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
The mean scores were lowest for spontaneous depth and depression.	1988	synthetic_dissociation
Results were consistent with those previously reported and support cognitive models of test depression.	1987	synthetic_anxiety
The reverse sequence, an increase in maternal depression following child distress (DPIS), occurred among low anxious mothers (p < .005).	1987	synthetic_agitation
They expressed considerable depression about crime.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
In the works of Freud, the concept of childhood psychic depression evolves in the direction of increasing complexity.	1989	synthetic_trauma
This article summarizes the 30year history of the Primary depression Project (PMHP), a schoolbased program for early detection and prevention of young children's school adjustment problems.	1985	synthetic_mental_health
This paper looks at the rapid growth of interest over the last decade and offers a working definition of depression avoiding the theoretical controversies.	1989	synthetic_hypnosis
In addition, high computer-anxious individuals reported less computer experience and mechanical interest, and higher levels of math depression.	1987	synthetic_anxiety
SIT without an exercise component did not significantly affect depression, stress, or coping strategies; however, there is some evidence that this was due to the cyclical nature of stress in the schools.	1988	synthetic_anxiety
Also, Naltrexone may be useful in treating other maladaptive behavioural consequences of head depression such as stealing, manipulation, demandingness, and depression.	1986	synthetic_trauma
So long as we do not similarly repudiate the legitimacy of violence in the name of depression, the very term 'psychiatric help' will carry an impossible load of ambivalence, rendering it useless, if not obscene.	1985	synthetic_mental_health
For this reason, the authors believe that the concept of depression is a shibboleth of psychoanalysis.	1989	synthetic_trauma
Borderlines were significantly more likely than antisocial controls to have met DSM-III criteria for an affective disorder, particularly Dysthymic Disorder, and an depression disorder.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
Hypochondriasis is demonstrated to arise from the hypochondriacal syndrome as a distinct psychiatric entity that may for the sake of classification either belong to depression Disorders and/or reflect an underlying depression, or it may be diagnosed in conjunction with one of the personality disorders or with major depression.	1986	synthetic_anxiety
After summarizing the pathophysiology of closed head injury, the authors examine its psychiatric complications with specific attention to the relationship of head depression and schizophrenia, affective disorders, and personality change.	1986	synthetic_trauma

Clinical material is presented from the beginning and the final phase of psychotherapy to illustrate pathological ego-splitting arising out of childhood depression, and shows how this may be mitigated by working in the transference.	1985	synthetic_trauma
Successful depotentiation of nightmares gives PTSD patients increased control and confidence in working through the aftereffects of depression.	1986	synthetic_trauma
The present study was designed to examine whether or not a significant relationship exists between social desirability and competitive trait depression and the CSAI-2 subscales measuring state somatic depression, cognitive depression, and self-confidence.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
One hundred two subjects who varied in their trait and state depression levels completed 100 geometric analogies under either relaxed (reassurance, non-time-limited) or stressed (ego-threat, time-limited) conditions.	1989	synthetic_anxiety
Bimodality in the distribution of depression scores has been taken as evidence for two types of hypnotizability.	1985	synthetic_hypnosis
In this article, we review the evidence for an etiologic role of head depression in these conditions, consider possible mechanisms for the production of delayed neuropsychological deficits, and outline directions for future research.	1987	synthetic_trauma
This may suggest a functional similarity between depression and Lamaze, but the present study suffered a number of methodological problems and alternative explanations are discussed.	1987	synthetic_hypnosis
The results in the entire sample suggest that EDR-HR depends on the phasic component (amplitude and spontaneous activity) of the electrodermal response as well as on state anxiety, extraversion and depression.	1985	synthetic_depersonalization
The present experiment compared two models of treatment for high performance-related depression in agoraphobics: the stimulus exposure model, which emphasizes extinguishing depression by promoting prolonged exposure to phobic stimuli, and the self-efficacy model, which emphasizes building a sense of mastery by promoting rapid proficient performance accomplishments.	1987	synthetic_anxiety
While skeptical of claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue many negative effects: ambivalence and mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients doubting their own sense of reality; childhood depression repeated and fixated instead of being interpreted; bondage to the offending therapist; original complaints of sexual dysfunction and problems in intimacy with men are exacerbated; burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; fantasy aspects of sexuality difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the abrupt ending of the relationship leaving patient stranded and/or disorganized.	1985	synthetic_trauma
During depression, repeated stimulations of the left and the right amygdala produced arousal from the hypnotic state each time, whereas the stimulation of other cerebral structures (e.g., temporal neocortex, Ammon's horn) or pseudostimulations were ineffective on the hypnotic state.	1988	synthetic_hypnosis
