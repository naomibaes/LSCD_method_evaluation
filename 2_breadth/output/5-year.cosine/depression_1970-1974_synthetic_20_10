When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
Depression can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1974	natural
Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1970	natural
The Masked Depression Syndrome is to be observed in two types which overlap eachother smoothly, i.e. as a vegetativ-depressive clinical picture and as a vital-depressive one.	1973	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	1974	natural
The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and a long-chain depression effect in the last two segments.	1973	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
In a study of motor conflict resolution, 20 Ss in each of two groups, designated as high drive (HD) and low drive (LD) according to scores on the Taylor Manifest depression Scale, had to resolve approach-approach (AP-AP), avoidance-avoidance (AV-AV), and double approach-avoidance (DAP-AV) conflicts.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
