Weitzenhoffer (1980) has criticized the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales (Weitzenhoffer & amp; Hilgard 1959, 1962), and others constructed similarly to them, on the grounds (a) that they presume to measure depth of mental_illness but may not do so, (b) that the inclusion of easy items is inappropriate, (c) that involuntariness (automaticity) is underplayed, in part by a confusion between instructions and suggestions, and (d) that hypnotizability should be measured by an increase in responses to suggestion after induction over baseline responses to suggestion prior to induction (gain-scores).	1980	synthetic_hypnosis
