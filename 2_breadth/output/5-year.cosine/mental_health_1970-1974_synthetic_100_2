Those aspects of mental_health associated with higher SRRS scores iclude the somatic concomittants of mental_health, a feeling of inadequacy, and concern with ability to realise self ideals.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
However, mental_health, as measured by the CMAS, A State and A Trait, was not significantly correlated with the ratings of internalization, externalization, or the total maladjustment index.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

An mental_health response of an acceleration in HR was then classically conditioned to a sequence of flashing lights paired with shock.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The results produced three combinations of scores which yielded statistically reliable canonical-correlation coefficients: three fear factors related to psychotic levels of personality disorganization; two related to fairly directly experienced neurotic mental_health; and five related to neurotic levels of mental_health bound by somatic complaints.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
These results were discussed within the framework of a social learning theory of mental_health.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Some hypotheses were tested concerning interactions of children's performance with test mental_health of the mothers, administration of tasks by mothers or strangers, and sex of the child.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
d) A discussion of major differences in perspective on psychology, approach to the field (experimenter vs. clinician), and some of the phenomena of mental_health, which inevitably lead to the division between those who see mental_health as an altered state and those who insist that it is not.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
In separate clinical sessions 2 pairs of Ss (one susceptible, one role-playing) were tested for the effects of a hypnotically-induced mental_health conflict before a group of 54 judges who were blind as to the hypnotic identity of the Ss they were observing.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
This interview was directed to identifying the essential stimuli to the agoraphobic reactions of a patient whose mental_health had decreased considerably as r result of favorable changes procured in her marital situation.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
It was concluded that the MAD scale best reflects a bipolar dimension of mental_health and defense.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The author concludes that mental_health cannot be considered as being a cause or an external force.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
2 strategies of mental_health research are examined and criticized.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading mental_health.	1970	synthetic_depression
The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial mental_health caused by infection or allergies.	1970	synthetic_irritation
Results suggest that, although increased mental_health does not produce consistent or significant changes in heart rate or in degree of caution, it does cause a marked increase in noise.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Following writing, differences among groups as to blood pressure, self-ratings of mental_health, and anger were not significant.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an admixture of anxiety versus mental_health were used as predictors.	1974	synthetic_depression
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human mental_health.	1974	synthetic_depression
It is important to know whether vasectomy constitutes a psychological risk; it is equally important to discover whether vasectomy has the mental_health-reducing and health-promoting effects most vasectomized men report.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
A three-factor theory of mental_health is surveyed in which hypnotic depth is conceived as a complex of 3 separate but complementary processes or dimensions.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
The results suggest that clinical mental_health is not a function of hypo-reactivity.	1971	synthetic_anhedonia

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, mental_health, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1973	synthetic_depression
