It reviews many of Freud's insights, contending that although some, such as his understanding of the mechanism of paranoia and the manner by which a depression of persecution is converted into a religious depression of grandeur, have stood the test of time, others, such as the causal relationship he proposes between homosexuality and paranoia, do not.	2009	synthetic_delusion
