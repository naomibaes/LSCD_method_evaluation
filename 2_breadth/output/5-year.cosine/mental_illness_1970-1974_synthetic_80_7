Highly hypnotizable subjects showed significantly more alpha activity (compared to low hypnotizables) in all conditions (both outside mental_illness and within it) except for the eyesopen baseline and the eyesopen measurement following the release of amnesia.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Results showed that the three test-taking conditions had no effect on the responding of the repressors and sensitizers to the Millimet (1970) Manifest mental_illness-Defensiveness (MAD) Scale, another measure of R-S. Content analysis revealed that repressors and sensitizers viewed their opposites as maladjusted and adjusted, respectively.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
96 male Ss differing in test mental_illness (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

Eleven Ss were assigned to each of three groups, low mental_illness (LA), medium mental_illness (MA), and high mental_illness (HA).	1970	synthetic_anxiety
It was found that the use of the Spitz Student Response System did not significantly change a students achievement, mental_illness, or attitude in mathematics.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

The study aims to determine the extent to which parental social class influences the incidence of early parent death; the effect of parental social class on the outcome of early parent death, in terms of vulnerability to adult mental_illness; whether early parent death affects the age of terminating full-time education; and whether early bereaved subjects lag behind their non-bereaved contemporaries in social class status.	1972	natural
