Recent work has suggested that having an anxiety disorder without history of mood disorder does convey increased risk for suicidal ideation, although the study could not assess for the possible impact of subsyndromal depressiveness.	2008	natural
However, there is limited theoretical modeling to explain this association, and prior studies have generally failed to assess for potential mediating variables of impulsivity, anxiety, and depression.	2008	natural
This study demonstrates that computerised tests for measuring executive functions can be successfully deployed in adolescents, and suggests that specific patterns of neuropsychological functions may be relatively compromised in first episode major anxiety.	2005	synthetic_depression
Using a cross-sectional paradigm, we studied subjective measures like PSQI, Fatigue Severity Scale scores and intensity of affective symptoms rated by the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scales as well as objective sleep quality parameters measured by polysomnography of 28 'pure' (no primary sleep and no psychiatric disorders) CFS patients compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls.	2007	natural
Fatigue was inversely correlated with education (-.16) and positively correlated with depression (.44), anxiety (.30), and alexithymia (.35).	2007	natural
The purpose of the study was to examine the rate of alexithymia as measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale in a sample of severely obese subjects, as well as the relationships between this dimension and five other dimensions found in obesity: depression, anxiety, external locus of control, impulsivity, and interpersonal dependency.	2006	synthetic_anhedonia

The lower CBCL and YSR values in the FNG seem to point out a tendency of this group to deny anxiety and depression as well as an eating pathology; the longer duration of illness prior to admission in the PG seems to support the hypothesis that the PG may be considered to be not so much more disturbed as more aware of its eating attitudes and psychopathology.	2006	natural
