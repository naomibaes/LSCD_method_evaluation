When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification first of all the clinical typology of endogenous and reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	1973	natural
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
There were no significant differences between 27 females with depression (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and depression (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	1972	natural

The data provide support for the view that some form of synaptic depression is the mechanism underlying habituation.	1972	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
