The two groups' mean scores on the MMPI-2 validity, clinical, content, and substance abuse scales were compared through a series of analyses of variance.	1995	natural
There are, nevertheless, many steady features, e.g. the low rates of attempters in old age (above 65 years: 7.9 of the total), the methods used, the type of preceding stressful life events (more financial than emotional in males), no drug abuse etc.	1998	natural
for longer periods, and for the sexual abuse to have occurred again in adulthood.	1998	natural

The data did not find a significant relationship between sexual abuse and purging when individual, familial, and extra-familial variables were included in the logistic regression.	1999	natural

Similarly, among second-degree relatives, in analyses controlling for potentials confounders, the disorders-specific aggregation of suicide attempt (OR = 12.3, 95 CI = 1.2 to 130.0), substance abuse (OR = 2.8, 95 CI = 1.6 to 4.8), and any Axis I disorder (OR = 1.5, 95 CI = 1.0 to 2.2) persisted.	1997	natural

Residents of group facilities (GH and BCH) had more staff support, more emotional and problemsolving support, and less emotional abuse than residents of SA.	1997	natural
Infant sex was not a risk factor for neglect or abuse.	1997	natural
Among those with a sexual abuse history, 24 of current health status was explained by serious injury during abuse (p = .0006), victimization by multiple perpetrators (p = .03), and being raped (p = .09).	1997	natural
Munchausen by proxy syndrome, wherein a caretaker (most often a mother) simulates or fabricates illness in a child in order to assume the sick role through another has now been described involving a variety of psychiatric problems and false allegations of sexual abuse.	1996	natural
The purpose of this paper was to describe the characteristics of this population and match known, empirically demonstrated, databased strategies, such as teacher attention and praise, token reinforcement programs, daily report cards, contingency contracting, selfinstructional training, selfmanagement, peer tutoring, Direct Instruction, and combining behavior therapy with stimulant medication therapy, to specific academic and social deficits in children with parental histories of substance abuse.	1998	natural
As of March 31, 1995, there were 457 active cases of child abuse or suspected child abuse (44 male and 56 female) on the computerized Child Protection Registry.	1996	natural
This article presents a critical review of controlled treatment outcome research in the area of family therapy for drug abuse in both adults and adolescents.	1995	natural
More recently, childhood sexual abuse has been implicated as a specific risk factor.	1997	natural
Approximately 700 substance-abusing youthful offenders were assigned to either a two-month residential substance abuse treatment program group or a comparison group.	1997	natural
Reliving abusive experiences can lead to a repetition of the abuse and an exacerbation of the client's problems.	1997	natural
This study was conducted to compare the disclosure rate of alleged child sexual abuse victims interviewed in a formal forensic setting with a structured allegation informed technique versus a structured allegation blind technique.	1996	natural
This article explores important linkages between developmental theory as it relates to children's understanding of motive, intention, and authority and two methods used to educate preschool-aged children about sexual abuse.	1995	natural
A balance of power can be attained by many women, without increasing the risk of retaliatory abuse, providing the authors' guidelines are observed.	1995	natural
Currently, the major recognised forms of child abuse are acknowledged as being: physical abuse or non-accidental physical injury; sexual abuse and exploitation; emotional/psychological abuse; and neglect.	1997	natural
Adolescent parricide offenders are typically presented in the popular and professional literature as prosocial youths in fear of their lives, often killing to protect themselves or others from death or serious physical injury or to end the chronic abuse they and other family members suffer.	1995	natural
Three studies are presented describing the development and testing of an instrument, the Abuse Dimensions Inventory (ADI), designed to address these needs.	1997	natural
Data were drawn from various samples of individuals who completed the LASC in prior studies: Vietnam veterans (n = 300), battered women (n = 123), adult survivors of child sexual abuse (n = 142), maritally distressed women (n = 36), psychiatric outpatients (n = 105), and high-risk adolescents (n = 168).	1995	natural
Studies in child abuse show that abusive parents score significantly lower on empathy measures as compared to their nonabusive counterparts.	1997	natural
Epidemiological concerns about base rates, true and false positives, and the possibility of an epidemic of therapy-induced false memories are frequently raised in the debate over delayed memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA).	1998	natural
For the childhood abuse group, multiple regression analyses with seven predictor variables accounted for 54 of the variance in suicide risk; depression and alcohol problems made significant independent contributions, while violence and self-criticism were independent predictors at the trend level.	1999	natural
Good evidence for false memories exists, but conversely amnesia and subsequent recall of sexual abuse undoubtedly occur.	1998	natural
These results suggest that the police response to domestic violence is variable and the majority of batterers, regardless of type of abuse, may not be receiving any legal or therapeutic intervention.	1999	natural
The percentage of women who had used marijuana, rates of mothers' arrests, length of time served, rates of physical abuse, participation in vocational programs, and percent incarcerated for violent offences were higher among the women in the college program, who were more likely to be first-time offenders.	1998	natural

Predominantly neglect rather than abuse was alleged.	1999	natural
In multivariate analysis when other relevant predictors were controlled, gender was significant in predicting only the most inclusive indicator of violence and only in interaction with substance abuse problems.	1998	natural
These findings appear to confirm sexual abuse as a risk factor for suicidal behaviors, and suggest that sexual abuse may be more influential in the development of suicidal behaviors than the context of family dysfunction.	1996	natural
