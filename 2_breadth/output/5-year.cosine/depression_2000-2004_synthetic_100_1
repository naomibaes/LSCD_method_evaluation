On the basis of previous reports of an attentional bias for threat-related emotional material in deluded schizophrenics (e.g. Bentall & Kaney, 1989), the present study examined the proposal that a similar bias would be demonstrated by depression-prone individuals, reflected by longer response latencies for the task of processing threat-related facially displayed affects (e.g. anger, fear).	2004	synthetic_delusion
We raise the possibility that some devastating experiences during childhood might cause an unrecoverable crash in already established patterns of attachment to an extent that adulthood will be characterized by depression that bears no emotional tie to even a single attachment figure.	2000	synthetic_state_of_mind

There were no significant differences between the two groups for selfreported job performance, perceived job security and perceived organizational depression but there were significant time effects.	2002	synthetic_morale
Demographic information was gathered on all respondents; for those reporting these dissociative experiences, information on their frequency, duration, and whether they occurred during conditions of danger, severe stress, upsetting memories, depression or depression, or for no apparent reason was also elicited.	2001	synthetic_nervousness
These results are discussed in the context of the contribution of deficiencies in the visual system and subcortical white-matter lesions to the development of Capgras depression.	2000	synthetic_delusion
In classical medicine, vertigo had the ambiguous status of being both a disease per se and a symptom of other diseases such as hypochondriacal depression.	2000	synthetic_melancholy
Long term incarceration in hospital is an expensive and inefficient way of protecting the public, and a unit with a high proportion of long-stay patients would find it hard to sustain a therapeutic ethos, with a consequent threat to staff depression.	2000	synthetic_morale
Standard tests demonstrated that well siblings had adjustment difficulties manifested by internal stressors that originated from depression and low self-concept.	2001	synthetic_anxiety
A depression was observed such that midazolam decreased R but increased A estimates relative to placebo.	2003	synthetic_dissociation
More recently two other processes, defeat and entrapment, have attracted attention as possible processes linked specifically to depression and depression.	2001	synthetic_anhedonia
Instead of the standard pressure cooker of sexuality, which if not expressed leads to pathological emotional conflict we identify a depression sexuality, a cold arctic-like desert unwarmed by human relationship that barely achieves expression.	2002	synthetic_melancholy
The most consistent evidence emerges from depression and conditioning trials.	2003	synthetic_hypnosis
In Experiment 1, teams of participants lifted a set of 16 containers that varied in mass and size and reported their perceptions of depression and volume.	2003	synthetic_heaviness
In actuality, Ferenczi's Confusion of Tongues theory and Relaxation Therapy were prophetic and pioneering attempts to understand and treat the incest depression (ironically the clinical data upon which Freud founded psychoanalysis 100 years ago).	2002	synthetic_trauma
Consistent with past findings on prevention focus, these studies also revealed that participants' prevention focus was related to how extensively they showed bias against an outgroup in terms of quiescence- and depression-related emotions and avoidance-related behaviors.	2002	synthetic_agitation
The basic principles of the New depression (as they apply to sexual dysfunction) include processing of internal states of perceived realities, in vitro reexperiencing of the sexual problem, inward directedness of the client by the counselor via careful observation and feedback of the clients/couples psychosematics and somatopsychic expressions, and the presence of both members of the couple in the session whenever possible.	2003	synthetic_hypnosis
The present findings indicate that the DES can be administered online with confidence, although further investigation is needed to determine the impact of education, ethnicity and history of depression and abuse on the scores of online responders.	2003	synthetic_trauma

Sixty children aged 8 to 12 years were presented first with tasks assessing their level of diachronic tendency (propensity to evoke past or future stages of a present situation), of depression of two temporal sequences (absence of covariation of a cause and its delayed effect) and of dynamic synthesis (ability to describe a set of pictures representing the successive steps of an event by a single noun phrase).	2001	synthetic_dissociation
