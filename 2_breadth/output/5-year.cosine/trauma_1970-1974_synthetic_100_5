In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was trauma.	1971	synthetic_elation

These accounts may be of prestige value to the author, and may do something to inform the profession of the potential value of trauma in medicine, but these success stories are really of little help to those who would learn the technique of hypnotherapy because the emphasis is always on the success of the treatment rather than on analysis of the psychodynamic mechanisms which brought it about.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
Consistent and more frequently significantpositivecorrelations were evidenced between subjects' serum cholesterol concentrations and their moods and feelings of trauma, anger, fear and lethargy.	1971	synthetic_depression

Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to trauma of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	synthetic_depression
It appears that trauma is a complex concept.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

The arousal that results is broader than trauma, in the usual sense of the term, as it is contributed to by all sources of stimulation, including positive and negative affect, as well as external stimulation.	1974	synthetic_anxiety

The common psychological coronary-prone component of these different patterns seem to be the incapacity to cope with trauma or the inadequacy of their defence-mechanisms.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
