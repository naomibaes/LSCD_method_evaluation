We recommend that future research on early intervention to disrupt the trajectory of anxiety in children at risk (a) be informed by both developmental science and clinical research, (b) incorporate multiple levels of analysis (including both individual and contextual factors), (c) examine mediators that move us closer to understanding how and why treatments work, (d) be developed with the end goal of dissemination, (e) examine moderators of outcome toward the goal of treatment efficiency, (f) consider transdiagnostic or modular approaches, (g) integrate technology, and (h) consider cultural norms regarding BI/SW/anxiety and parenting.	2018	natural
