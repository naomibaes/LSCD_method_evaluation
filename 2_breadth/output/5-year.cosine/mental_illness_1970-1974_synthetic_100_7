Desensitization is a technique whereby mental_illness-producing stimuli are presented in an increasing, step-wise manner (i.e., imagery and visualization of suggested material in the in vitro technique and the Hegar dilators in the in vivo method).	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded mental_illness did not emerge.	1971	synthetic_depression
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mental_illness that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1973	synthetic_depression
A symptom or sign does not disappear until the affective component of mental_illness is decreased below a certain threshold.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

Important differences in the use of other technical terms like mental_illness, perplexity, and thought disorder also emerged.	1973	synthetic_agitation
Affect Related Condition scores suggested a decrease in projected mental_illness and an increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Eleven Ss were assigned to each of three groups, low mental_illness (LA), medium mental_illness (MA), and high mental_illness (HA).	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Pitts and McClure proposed the hypothesis that alterations in serum lactate play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of mental_illness, both in its psychic and somatic aspects.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The posthypnotic suggestion group did not differ from the mental_illness-no-suggestion group, which also performed more accurately but not more rapidly than the waking suggestion group on the Rational Learning Test.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Highly hypnotizable subjects showed significantly more alpha activity (compared to low hypnotizables) in all conditions (both outside mental_illness and within it) except for the eyesopen baseline and the eyesopen measurement following the release of amnesia.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
It was predicted and generally demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with greater mental_illness and with the discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
mental_illness and sensations of increase in body size were observed to be particularly characteristic of the hypnotic state.	1973	synthetic_depersonalization
Perceived similarity to a peer (PSP) was measured with the Role Construct Repertory Test, and the Taylor Manifest mental_illness Scale was the adjustment index.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
200 male students were administered Taylor's MAS, N-Scale of MPI, Cattell's ASQ, Sinha's mental_illness Scale and Dutt's mental_illness Questionnaire.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Various control conditions appear to rule out injection mental_illness as a reason for the lauter failure.	1971	synthetic_trauma
The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, mental_illness, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	1971	synthetic_depersonalization
It was also found that the behavioral mental_illness produced by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was unaffected by the lesions.	1971	synthetic_depression
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mental_illness effects.	1974	synthetic_trauma
mental_illness can be overt and quite evident; yet in many instances it can be masked, hidden by more noticeable somatic symptoms and even somatic disease.	1973	synthetic_depression
With competitive ranking, mental_illness was found to be modestly popular and no more threatening than several, more widely-used treatment modalities.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
These differences indicate that the sample of patients referred to the Pain Clinic had more personality disturbance and that there were significant differences in the areas of mental_illness, Gastrointestinal symptoms, Hypochondriasis and Asthenia, and Psychosomatic symptoms.	1972	synthetic_depression
The latter were rated significantly less anxious bu days 34, while the non-deniers' level of mental_illness remained elevated until days 57.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The relative independence of test mental_illness and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to increase prediction of academic performance.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Rated were mental_illness-hopefulness, motivation for recovery, and physical discomfort-pain resulting from the disabilities.	1973	synthetic_morale
The first part deals with problems arising when mental_illness is examined in relation to culture.	1973	synthetic_depression
On Day 1 they were trained the task with one cortical hemisphere rendered non-functional by cortical spreading mental_illness (CSD).	1973	synthetic_depression
Ss identified as High Anxious responded positively to group systematic desensitization procedures, exhibiting significantly (p < .05) lower autonomic indices of test mental_illness and significantly (p < .001) improved criterion test scores.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The author concludes that mental_illness cannot be considered as being a cause or an external force.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
96 male Ss differing in test mental_illness (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Results showed that the three test-taking conditions had no effect on the responding of the repressors and sensitizers to the Millimet (1970) Manifest mental_illness-Defensiveness (MAD) Scale, another measure of R-S. Content analysis revealed that repressors and sensitizers viewed their opposites as maladjusted and adjusted, respectively.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less mental_illness than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Perceived appropriateness of the induced mental_illness was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that mental_illness over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in rather nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	1972	synthetic_anxiety
