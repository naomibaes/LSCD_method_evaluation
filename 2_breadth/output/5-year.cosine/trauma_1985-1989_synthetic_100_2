The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory trauma also belongs to the context of the latter.	1989	synthetic_delusion
It is concluded that Social trauma and Psychoticism represent a separate dimension from other scales which reflect the more positive features of schizoid personality.	1987	synthetic_anhedonia

Literature on obstetrical trauma includes the hypotheses (a) that the ideal form of childbirth preparation would combine trauma with didactic education and (b) that Lamaze and natural childbirth methods are essentially the same thing as trauma.	1989	synthetic_hypnosis
The presence of this double trauma demonstrates the functional specificity of perseveration in certain memory and problem solving contexts and suggests that distinct subcortical/frontal mechanisms may underly specific types of perseveration.	1985	synthetic_dissociation
