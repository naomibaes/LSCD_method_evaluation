In this paper, I have discussed depression in adolescence from its occurrence as a manifestation of health, in relation to developmental tasks, and from the standpoint of it being indicative of illness and pathology.	1978	natural
Using a modified version of their life events checklist, it is shown that an accumulation of life events is correlated with self-reported tension and distress, with emotional disturbances manifested by depression, paranoid thinking, suicidal proclivity, and anxiety, as well as with behavioral indications of stress such as drinking and traffic accidents.	1975	natural
Anxiety, hostility, and depression remained unchanged except in one programmed group where the decrease in hostility was significant.	1977	natural
Research on reduction in depression contributes to the development of effective intervention techniques.	1979	natural
Construct validity was investi gated with comparisons between depressed and non-depressed groups and by the covariation be tween changes in the rate of occurrence of aversive events and changes in depression level.	1979	natural
The six factors, which correspond closely to those found in the American analysis of the same scale, span the full range of all principal depressive dimensions extracted from several other major depression rating scales.	1979	natural
Additionally, a significant relationship (r =.304, p<.02)was found between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the rating of depressed thoughts by the cross-situationally consistent individuals.	1978	natural
The smokers and obese subjects showed a tendency toward depression and impulsivity, and the smokers also showed a trend toward somatization.	1979	natural
Heart rate and measures of hostility, depression, and anxiety varied directly with the subjects' familiarity and subjective experience with the acoustic stimuli.	1975	natural
During the four time periods negative affects (deactivation-sleep, depression, general deactivation, inert-fatigued) were significantly greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activation--significantly less in the irregular sleepers.	1978	natural
The patients' clinical state was monitored by means of the Hamilton rating scale and the Beck Depression Inventory.	1977	natural
Waiting furthered pre-retaliatory feelings of depression in females.	1977	natural
Fluctuations in several measures based on a 2 week health diary (Days Complaint, Days Disability, Percent Days Complaint That Are Also Days Disability, Days Saw Doctor, Days Used Drugs), as well as in other indicators (Symptoms, Depression, Dissatisfaction with Social Support) were analyzed as the men went through the various phases of anticipation, plant closing, unemployment and re-employment.	1975	natural
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are correlated with the depth of depression as assessed by a rating scale, and also with the degree of memory impairment during depression.	1975	natural
The observed changes in serum cortisol were highly correlated with changes in anxiety and depression.	1979	natural
The incidence of depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be suffering from clinically significant neurotic disturbances.	1978	natural
DC potential changes accompanying cortical spreading depression could be measured for more than one month in the chronic preparation.	1977	natural
The present study showed that principally eating can be elicited by unilateral single waves of spreading depression (SD) induced by KCl injections, electrical or mechanical stimulation of the neocortex and hippocampus in rats.	1977	natural
From a behavioural point of view, the phenomenon of depression was explored relatively late.	1976	natural
There was also an agreement in the subtyping of depression.	1976	natural
To develop a data-based classification of depressive adolescents, a face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify a depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1979	natural
The childhood depressive constellation, core depressive traits, and defenses against depression are examined, and therapeutic suggestions are made for achieving contact with the patient and relieving the helplessness and hopelessness that are often present.	1979	natural
There was no significant differences in anxiety, depression or fear of death between the groups.	1976	natural
The first comprises those which are true side effets of drug-therapy; the other includes somatic symptoms of the depression itself, which are subsequently considered as apparent side effects.	1978	natural
Comparisons with morbid risk figures for relatives of individuals satisfying research criteria for depression, mania or schizophrenia indicate that the 'non-Feighner schizophrenia' group is probably too heterogenous to be classified entirely as affective disorder or as schizophrenia.	1979	natural
This paper reviews published reports of studies linking the use of oral contraceptives with depression and biochemical changes.	1979	natural
Likewise, depression was associated with lower category cluster on final free recall.	1979	natural
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ECT increases catecholamine synthesis and more specifically would be evidence that ECT improves depression by increasing norepinephrine synthesis.	1976	natural
After adjustment for the effects of other independent variables, the probability of having symptoms of depression was highest among persons who were young adults, unmarried, not employed outside the home, poorly paid, and not well educated.	1976	natural
Locus of control (IE) was not related to depression scores, and it was suggested, in light of previous research, that future research on the antecedents of depression employ more specific measures of control rather than measures of generalized expectancies.	1978	natural
The study revealed a sub-group of 24 patients who were more likely than the others to have been extraverted and/or dominant in childhood and who were in sharp contrast with the remainder of the series in showing less or no introversion or depression.	1979	natural
Reasons for this finding are discussed, and strategies are suggested whereby a woman may avoid depression if she finds herself in a similar setting.	1975	natural
Twenty-seven symptoms of 859 treated hypertensive patients were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire and correlated with the depression (DEP), free-floating anxiety (FFA), phobic anxiety (PHO), obsessionality (OBS) and extraversion (HYS) scores of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire.	1977	natural
Rats were trained in an active avoidance pattern discrimination under unilateral cortical spreading depression produced by KC1.	1975	natural
In 19 out of the 14 persons with depression the clinical picture included also somatic symptoms.	1978	natural
The new Eysenck Personality Questionnaire was administered to 441 male and 441 female subjects, 63 in each of seven groups (normal, criminal, schizophrenic, endogenous depressive, personality disorder, anxiety state, reactive depression).	1976	natural
No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and changes in depression as a function of treatment.	1979	natural
The second a bipolar factor contrasting endogenous and neurotic depression, the third a bipolar contrasting anxiety and depressive symptoms.	1979	natural
The results indicated significant differences between trained and untrained groups, as well as differences in quality of response due to emotion, with joy eliciting greater empathy than depression or anger.	1978	natural
Patients with moderate (neurotic-reactive) depression were randomly assigned to the three treatments.	1978	natural
These data further support the contention that caution must be used in interpreting comparative locus of control results derived from samples that have differential base rates of depression.	1977	natural
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: past history of suicidal behavior, subjective report of depression upon admission, and number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	1978	natural
The measure of auditory sensitivity was also lowered during depression, possibly attributable to attentional disturbance.	1977	natural
Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a relatively uniform depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	1978	natural
Lowering the temperature from 15 to 5C also increased the depression induced by conditioning stimulation for pulse trains of two to ten pulses in length.	1979	natural
Children often respond to hospitalization with severe anxiety and depression, frequently manifested by withdrawal or hyperactive and aggressive or hostile behavior.	1979	natural
In contrast to the numerous results with Caucasian Ss, the present findings revealed that self-concept discrepancy and depression are related positively for certain generations (i.e., Nisel, young Sansei), but not others (i.e., old Sansei, Yonsei).	1978	natural
Neither the pseudoconditioning (14 animals, involving 8 cortical and 6 caudate spreading depression sites) not the NaCl control group (8 animals, all with cortical sites), showed eating in the presence of the CS.	1975	natural
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin Depression Adjective Check Lists.	1977	natural
A discriminant function analysis indicated that users of oral contraceptives (OC users, n=15) were older and higher scores on the Depression and Fatigue subscales of the POMS than non-OC users (n=52) who had higher Anger-Hostility scores.	1978	natural
