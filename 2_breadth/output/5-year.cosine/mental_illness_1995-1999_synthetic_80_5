Steady-state plasma levels of clonazepam were significantly correlated with daily doses (rs = 0.795, P < 0.005) and therapeutic concentrations ranged between 6.5-83.9 micrograms/l. At the onset of therapy, the clinically titrated loading dose resulted in plasma concentrations within the narrow range of 18.9-34.0 micrograms/l. These results support the potential value of clonazepam in the short-term management of acute mania; the initial control of mental_illness was achieved with plasma drug levels in a remarkably narrow range as compared with the further control of mania.	1997	synthetic_agitation
