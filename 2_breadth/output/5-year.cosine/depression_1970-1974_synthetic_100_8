In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state depression is altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
depression and anger were conceptualized as arising in specific situations and focusing on expectations of self and others with disapproval being the catalyst for the reacting mode.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
In an attempt to specify physiologically the emotional states of sexual arousal and depression occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since depression of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	1972	synthetic_dissociation
The multitrait-multimethod procedure was used to assess the validity of Spielberger's dual conceptualization of depression and the interpretation of his scales based on that conceptualization.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
In the performance phase the results were reversed, i.e. the stressinducing instructions had a significantly positive effect on the level of depression but none on performance.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, depression, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1971	synthetic_anxiety
These findings indicate that Ss were indeed capable of matching the relative changes in the level of experienced test-depression with changes in the amplitude of an auditory stimulus.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The Ss in both groups reported the technique to be useful in dealing with a variety of depression-provoking academic situations.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

Results indicated that: (a) deniers experienced less situational depression across days than did nondeniers, (b) only nondeniers showed a decrease in situational depression as a function of time on the unit, (c) only nondeniers tended to perceive a discrepancy between perceived current and general health status on admission to the CCU (Day, and (d) estimated level of current health was lower than that of general health on Day 5, with only nondeniers manifesting improvement in perceived current health relative to Day 1.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
