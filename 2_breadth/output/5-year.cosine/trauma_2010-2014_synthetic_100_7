Second, it argues that soccer can be considered a secular strategy of re-trauma due to four reasons: soccer is not only agon (competition) but also arete (striving for excellence and beauty); the mental zone of both player and spectator is related to Kants idea of aesthetic experience as presupposing what he calls disinterestedness; soccer stadiums are places of secular sacrality; and soccer is determined by its high degree of contingency, but since instrumental reason and reduction of contingency are part and parcel of modern day soccer, it shall further be argued that the bench due to it being the very embodiment of contingency embodies a potentially enchanting countermove to the scientification of soccer.	2010	synthetic_enchantment
