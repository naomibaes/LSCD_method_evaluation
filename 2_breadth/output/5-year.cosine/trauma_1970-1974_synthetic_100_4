The genesis of this situation is shown through a review of the works listed in the bibliography; the confusion reigning in this field being due, among others, to the following aspects: the different meanings assigned to the term shading; the use of aprioristic theoretical frames of reference; the attribution of aprioristic symbolic meanings to the content of such responses; the meaning of trauma.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

Results of the second study replicated those of the first and indicated that the increase shown by disadvantaged children upon retesting in both studies was due primarily to a decrease in situational test trauma rather than to being retested by a familiar E.
