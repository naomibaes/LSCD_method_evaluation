Dependent variables were measures of perceived social support, trauma, depression, and loneliness.	1993	synthetic_morale
The convergence of Freire's insights and Jungian concepts is presented point by point: duality and trauma; adherence, selfdepreciation, and split bipolarity; dehumanization and projection; horizontal violence and projective identification; objectification and the withdrawal of projections; humanization and the integration of complexes.	1990	synthetic_dissociation
In response to a national call for states to shift from an overreliance on restrictive treatment modalities to community-based systems of care and to the needs identified by the families of children with serious emotional disturbance (SED), the New York State Office of trauma has developed Family-Centered Intensive Case Management (FCICM) as part of a research demonstration project.	1990	synthetic_mental_health
Six out of 36 healthy controls, three out of 20 patients with anxiety disorders and 24 of 34 patients with trauma displayed sleep onset REM periods after cholinergic stimulation.	1991	synthetic_depression
One might conclude that the measurement of discrepancies in power might predict trauma of faculty.	1992	synthetic_morale
The present study investigates the relationship between sensation seeking and trauma, a pathological reduction in pleasure capacity.	1993	synthetic_anhedonia
On posttreatment follow-up both the problem-focused and emotion-focused treatment groups were significantly less anxious than the controls and lower levels of trauma were observed for the emotion-focused group.	1994	synthetic_depression
The effects of life events, daily hassles (DH), and coping resources (CR) on state trauma and peripheral vision narrowing during a stress condition were examined.	1990	synthetic_anxiety
Between onequarter and onehalf of the women scored in a clinical range on the measures of borderline symptomatology, anxiety, trauma and irritability.	1991	synthetic_depression
Clinicians rated each patient on the Hamilton Rating Scale for trauma on the basis of (a) the patient's report, (b) the caregiver's report, and (c) the clinician's evaluation.	1990	synthetic_depression
The reported family study in geriatric inpatients with unipolar major trauma (n = 92) supported the proposed relationship between age at onset and the proposed familial loading.	1994	synthetic_depression
Clinical appreciation of the immature defenses (e.g., hypochondriasis, fantasy, trauma, acting out, projection, and passive aggression) is particularly useful in classifying and caring for individuals with personality disorders.	1993	synthetic_dissociation
Accordingly, while the results indicated a trauma between physiological and psychological differentiation, there was also evidence of a psychological factor (attention) influencing a physiologically induced reflex.	1993	synthetic_dissociation
Evidence for these processes comes from clinical studies of multiple personality, experimental studies of trauma, and introspective accounts by dissociators.	1993	synthetic_hypnosis
This pattern of results indicates that there is an important trauma between time-keeping and motor-implementation mechanisms.	1991	synthetic_dissociation
trauma disorders, especially agoraphobia, were relatively common (20 if diagnosed in the presence of depressive disorder), but were not related to lesion location or volume.	1991	synthetic_anxiety
There was some evidence that completing the study questionnaires had an trauma-reducing effect.	1991	synthetic_anxiety
In the end, James views suggest how a rapprochement between the cognitive and social approaches to trauma might be achieved.	1990	synthetic_hypnosis
Results from an initial laboratory experiment support the prediction that trauma and group size interact as determinants of the strength of social identification.	1991	synthetic_depersonalization

One was a research component in the Foreign trauma Analysis Division (FMAD), a subunit of the Office of War Information.	1992	synthetic_morale
AI patients from a university hospital clinical population had excess numbers of organic mental_disorder (OMD), including both acute OMD (i.e., delirium tremens and alcoholic trauma) and chronic OMD (i.e., alcohol amnestic disorder, alcohol dementia, and traumainduced OMD).	1991	synthetic_hallucinosis
The results indicate that such group counselling was effective in increasing relatives' trauma, increasing their knowledge about dementia, and increasing the number of activities performed with the patient during visits, but had no effect upon the frequency or duration of visits or the amount of verbal and non-verbal communication between patient and relative.	1991	synthetic_morale
Therefore an anatomical trauma has been described between the rCBF profiles associated with depressed mood and depression-related cognitive impairment.	1994	synthetic_dissociation
Two independent studies failed to find evidence consistent with Council, Kirsch, and Hafner (1986), who argued that the repeatedly observed correlations between Tellegen's (1981) Absorption Scale (TAS) and trauma measures were artifacts of testing context, and de Groot, Gwynn, and Spanos (1988), who claimed evidence for a Gender x Context moderator effect.	1992	synthetic_hypnosis
These collective social defence mechanisms often fail to protect the intern from intense trauma and instead contribute to the hospital's increasing rigidity and resistance to change.	1992	synthetic_anxiety
Concomitantly, these results allow that significant portions of the variance in cognition and trauma may be temporally dissociated during the acute phases of recovery from traumatic head injury.	1992	synthetic_agitation
Factorial analysis and multiple regression showed that sleep complaints in the older group correlated less with severity of trauma and had a less stable response to pharmacological treatment.	1993	synthetic_depression
Agoraphobics showed much higher panic frequency, fear of trauma, and prevalence of frightening cognitions when anxious, but did not score higher than normals when assessing seriousness of symptoms.	1991	synthetic_anxiety
