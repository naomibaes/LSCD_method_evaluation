Three clusters: Depression/Satisfaction, Equanimity, and Will to Live, fell within the domain of depression; three seemed to be more pertinent to attitudes than depression: Positive Age, Negative Age, and Social Alienation; and two represent areas which are correlated with, but conceptually distinct from, depression: Physical Health and Social Accessibility.	1970	synthetic_morale

depression was measured through the use of an index composed of six psychiatric symptoms which correlated highly with clinically diagnosed mental_illness in another context.	1974	synthetic_mental_health
Although these symptoms following laboratory depression were not found to be severe, their presence is of importance both for theoretical and practical reasons.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
Pearson product-moment correlations among 12 nonverbal ratings, a finger sweat index, and Ss' subjective evaluation of depression yielded low relationships among S's subjective rating, the number of times S touched her head, articulation errors, and the other variables; high correlations among finger sweat index, rater's global rating, immediacy, tone, postural relaxation, speech errors, filled pauses, editorial errors, and eye contact; and moderate correlations among rate of speech, posture shifts, etc.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Construct validity of the adjusted depression score was markedly superior to that of the uncorrected score, as indicated by an increase in correlation with achievement on a programmed instruction unit of(in one case) .33 to .52.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

The study was designed to assess the relationships between certain expressions of depression and preferences for defense mechanisms.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of depression, suggestions, and time.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
This finding supported the proposition that depression over intellectual performance is one antecedent of a reflective cognitive disposition.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, depression, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1971	synthetic_anxiety
In neurotics without depression and/or depression the AVERs were normal and the DPs showed a shortening of the second period; in neurotics with depression and/or depression the AVERs were also normal but the second period of the DPs disappeared.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The use of depression on its own or in association with other treatment procedures produced improvement, subjectively and/or objectively, in 17 of a series of 50 patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic problems.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
In response to a 10-min stress interview, depression scores increased to equal levels, whether subjects were on propranolol or a placebo.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
thereby providing the depression-inducing condition.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; self-reported depression (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state depression as a function of trait depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status depression due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	1970	synthetic_dissociation
It is suggested that this treatment is well suited to the alleviation of pain when the experience of pain is compounded by fear and depression.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
When desensitization was applied to a patient's depression reactions to images of the theme of infidelity by his wife, obsessive compulsive behavior progressively diminished.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Factor analysis of a depression inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	1972	synthetic_nervousness
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (depression, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	1974	synthetic_agitation
At a 5-month follow-up the patient was still free from his specific phobias but was still complaining about free-floating depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Twenty-three male and 23 female Ss rated their immediate reactions to the LCT colors on seven mood adjectives, following which they were given the short version LCT and the IPAT depression Scale.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
There were no significant differences among the four groups regardless of the depression scale used.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

The authors conclude that, while lactate infusions do precipitate depression attacks in patients with a certain type of depression neurosis, the mechanism cannot be that proposed by Pitts and McClure.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
For the response scales two main factors were isolated, interpreted as Psychic depression, and Somatic depression.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
depression and anger modified, however, in a statistically significant manner P3 and the following waves.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
In addition, Ss were asked to complete an Affect Adjective Check List (AACL) which permitted a self-description of the degree of depression felt under the two conditions.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
It was found that the experimental manipulations of group composition or drug injection did not yield clearcut results unless the subjects were divided according to initial ratings of depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety

Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in great part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid depression provoking emotional encounters.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Second, substantial evidence suggests that a learning design based on the laboratory approach can significantly moderate such depression.	1970	synthetic_trauma
