These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (mental_illness, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	1973	synthetic_agitation
The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that mental_illness changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were prominent.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_elation
