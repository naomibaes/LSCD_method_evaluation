The flocculus hypothesis has been supported by several lines of evidence, including lesioning or functionally impairing the flocculus and recording the activity of flocculus Purkinje cells, and, more recently, from pharmacologically or genetically inhibited synaptic plasticity, which produces long-term trauma.	1999	synthetic_depression
Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and Jackson 1986), which yields scores on three sub-scales; emotional exhaustion, trauma and reduced personal accomplishment.	1995	synthetic_depersonalization
