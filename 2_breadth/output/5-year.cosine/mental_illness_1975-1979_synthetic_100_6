The performance and subjective involvement of the experimental subjects during the Barber suggestibility scale, 'nystagmus' suggestions and 'dreaming' did not differ significantly between the two mental_illness sessions, but in most cases were significantly greater during mental_illness than during the imagination session of the same group or the random control group.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis
