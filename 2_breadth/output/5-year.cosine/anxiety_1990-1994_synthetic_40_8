Jeffrey A. Gray has proposed a model in which conduct disorder (CD) is viewed as the result of both excessive activity of a behavioral activation system that mediates appetitive and aggressive behavior and deficient activity of a behavioral inhibition system that mediates both anxiety and the inhibition of behavior in the presence of cues signalling impending punishment or frustration.	1991	natural
