On the other hand, trauma after infancy and before age 18 provided the strongest correlation with adult outcome: consistent with the theory of the effect of cumulative trauma on psychic functioning, children experiencing two or more adverse circumstances had significantly lower levels of global functioning as adults than those spared multiple traumas.	2002	natural

The underwater trauma may provide an important and potentially powerful model for understanding the mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress, cognition, and learning.	2000	natural
The available evidence indicates that alternative means of conceptualizing acute trauma reactions and identifying acutely traumatized people who are at risk of developing PTSD need to be considered.	2002	natural
These results suggest that revictimization serves to prime preexisting trauma memory networks, thereby amplifying the impact of childhood sexual trauma on selective attention toward trauma-related stimuli.	2001	natural
The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of trauma.	2002	natural
Neglect was the most frequently reported type of childhood trauma, suggesting the importance of other childhood experiences in addition to sexual and/or physical abuse in the development of dissociative psychopathology.	2000	natural
Rates of childhood trauma were largely comparable to those reported for community and student samples in more densely populated regions of North America.	2004	natural
The findings of biological researchers and the observations of psychoanalysts are integrated, as they apply to two functions that are damaged by trauma: the capacity for representation and the capacity for self-regulation.	2003	natural
The framework is used to generate hypothetical accounts of the role of dysfunctional emotional processes and maladaptive emotion socialization in early motherinfant interaction in the development of Disorganized attachment along two distinct pathways, one associated with actual abuse of the infant and the other associated with maternal unresolved trauma.	2004	natural
This analysis may also suggest that defects and trauma in the earliest years may be conducive to alexithymia, deficient contact between feelings and words, linked to the risk of developing serious psychosomatic illnesses.	2001	natural
We examined how trauma-specific appraisals and coping efforts mediate between traumatic experiences, acuteness of trauma, and length of imprisonment and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) among 103 Palestinian former political prisoners.	2002	natural

Recent trauma research, however, has rediscovered trauma dissociation, which is separate from repression.	2002	natural
The TSCYC appears to have reasonable psychometric characteristics, and correlates as expected with various types of trauma exposure.	2001	natural
Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of dissociation and trauma should seriously consider the possibility that dissociation, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, contribute to trauma self-reports.	2002	natural
Female gender and substance abuse were risk factors for trauma exposure.	2002	natural
The original versions of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 were written and subsequently validated in the Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese languages.	2001	natural
The premature termination of the treatment due to the therapist's departure enabled the child to articulate for the first time her feelings, in the transference, about the trauma and the traumatizing agent.	2001	natural
