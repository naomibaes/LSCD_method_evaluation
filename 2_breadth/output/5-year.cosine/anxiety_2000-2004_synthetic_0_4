We suggest that: (a) cognitive bias should be treated as a bipolar construct in future research; (b) the phenomenon of Stroop facilitation for threat words deserves further exploration; and (c) more research should address the question about the relationship between cognitive bias and other emotions than anxiety (e.g., positive affect and anger).	2001	natural

The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) To test Widiger, Trull, Clarkin, Sanderson, and Costa's (1994) description of depressive personalities' profile scores on the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992); and (b) to determine the degree of empirical overlap between depressive personality analogues and dysthymics on the NEO-PI-R. As predicted, depressive personality analogues (DPAs) had significantly higher mean scores on the Anxiety, Depression, and Self-Consciousness NEO-PI-R facets of Neuroticism than did controls, but not on the Tendermindedness facet.	2000	natural
