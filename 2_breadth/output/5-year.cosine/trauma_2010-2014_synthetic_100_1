Structural equation modeling indicated that (a) suicidality, substance abuse, trauma, and problematic activities such as self-injury and dysfunctional sexual behaviors were all indicators of a robust latent variable, named dysfunctional avoidance, (b) accumulated exposure to various types of interpersonal trauma was associated with this avoidance factor, and (c) the relationship between trauma and dysfunctional avoidance was independently mediated by both posttraumatic stress and diminished affect regulation capacity.	2011	synthetic_dissociation

Neuroendocrinal changes that occur during trauma (principally hypercortisolaemia) produce structural and functional alterations to the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, plus the connectivity between these regions of the brain.	2010	synthetic_depression

Self-perception is disrupted in people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and trauma disorder (DPD), fluctuating with sudden shifts in affect in BPD and experienced as detached in DPD.	2014	synthetic_depersonalization
At pretreatment and at a 1-year follow-up, the patients completed questionnaires indexing two domains of insomnia-related worry (sleeplessness and health), insomnia severity, trauma, and depression as well as sleep diaries.	2012	synthetic_anxiety
It then provides an alternative evolutionary explanation for event-based depression and trauma.	2010	synthetic_elation
My aim is to propose that the tale has less to do with the events of Nathanaels childhood than with the perils of trauma in the present.	2012	synthetic_enchantment
This paper reviews Hofmanns (2012) An Introduction to Modern CBT: Psychological Solutions to trauma Problems.	2014	synthetic_mental_health
In a sample of 19 first-time mothers no differences between pre and postnatal reports of general life satisfaction, trauma, anxiety, and experienced positive and negative affect were found, suggesting that the arrival of the newborn baby does not universally impact on women's level of well-being.	2014	synthetic_depression
Beyond this double trauma, low resting FC within the CCN predicted low remission rate and persistence of depressive symptoms and signs, apathy, and dysexecutive behavior after treatment with escitalopram.	2013	synthetic_dissociation
At pretreatment, she reported severe pain intensity and unpleasantness as well as high levels of anxiety and trauma.	2014	synthetic_nervousness
Emotional exhaustion was significantly associated with age, influence, supervisory support, organizational commitment, and job stress, while trauma was predicted by age, organizational commitment, and job stress.	2011	synthetic_depersonalization
Speakers' social performance, speech quality, and trauma during the presentation were also rated.	2013	synthetic_nervousness
I suggest that an individual in this trauma, suffering from post-traumatic stress, has regressed to a primary state of unintegration where the self is at the mercy of psychotic anxieties and the student is at risk of suicide.	2010	synthetic_state_of_mind
This study also provided important clinical implications in distinguishing between adaptive and maladaptive rumination suggesting a new cognitive link between creativity and trauma.	2014	synthetic_depression

At the same time, we introduce for the first time, hopelessness, defined as a trauma in which individuals have a negative perception of their future, into the intellectual and social equation.	2010	synthetic_state_of_mind
Our trauma-based protocol increased the amount of details in the recall of all kind of memories considered (NDE, real, and imagined events).	2014	synthetic_hypnosis
Overall, evidence that trauma helps solve the problem of voter competence remains sparse and vulnerable to alternative explanations.	2012	synthetic_anxiety
Logistic regression analyses further suggested that BDIcog and HAD-A discriminated between depressed and non-depressed patients better than the somatic and trauma items present in the same scales.	2014	synthetic_anhedonia
The KruskalWallis test showed significant differences in attitude between PGCE students and more experienced teachers in relation to their Child and Adolescent trauma Services role.	2012	synthetic_mental_health

We suggest that homicide of an intimate female partner is a discrete phenomenon, which differs from non-lethal violence against women in terms of the emotions that trigger it, the circumstances that lead up to it, and the trauma that characterizes it.	2013	synthetic_state_of_mind
Education of primary care providers about diagnosis and treatment of trauma and anxiety is an evidence-based suicide prevention measure.	2011	synthetic_depression
Both authors find themselves committed to history taking, to needing and taking time, to a willingness to wait before interpreting, to a recognition that the self derives originally from a bodily state of unintegration, that the body remains significant for the expression of selfstates, to an understanding of aggression as not primarily associated with destructiveness, to attending to the trauma in the analyst that encourages the establishment and maintenance of the analytic setting.	2014	synthetic_state_of_mind
We performed research with the aim to investigate trauma-proneness, obsessive-like personality, anxiety (trait and state), and reasoning styles in individuals from the general population.	2013	synthetic_delusion
