Burnout comprised three factors: emotional exhaustion, trauma, and personal accomplishment.	1993	synthetic_depersonalization
With these shifts, the paper proposes a three-point strategy: (a) underdevelopment should be defined not in terms of deficits of wealth and capital accumulation, but in terms of appropriately selected psychological variables (for example, by combining Hirschman's Exit-Voice- Loyalty framework with Bandura's social cognitive theory, deficits of perceived self- efficacy-at individual and collective levelscan provide a potential alternative definition); (b) an ideographic theory of social helplessness is then sketched in the light of historical experience for Pakistan; and (c) the possibility of psychosocial therapeutic (or, policy) interventions are then examined with reference especially to Bandura's work on human agency and Beck's work on treatment of trauma.	1992	synthetic_depression
