When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1973	natural
No differences were noted either between deniers and nondeniers or across days for chronic anxiety or depression.	1972	natural
The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, using cortical spreading depression (CSD) to achieve a functional split-brain.	1970	natural
It is suggested that this treatment is well suited to the alleviation of pain when the experience of pain is compounded by fear and depression.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe depression and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1974	natural
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural
Admissions for organic psychosis show the highest retention rate over time, and those for reactive depression the lowest.	1970	natural
Death depression was related to the potential for rescue after a suicide attempt.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
There were no significant differences between 27 females with depression (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and depression (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	1972	natural
Although these symptoms following laboratory depression were not found to be severe, their presence is of importance both for theoretical and practical reasons.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
In the present series of cases, the mother is almost always psychologically removed from the family, usually by depression, early in the girl's development.	1972	natural
The initial depression in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group recovered to control values by 6 weeks.	1970	natural
Specific examples are given illustrating the application of learning techniques to the prevention of disorders such as separation depression, stage fright, addictive and obsessive behavior.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The authors conclude that, while lactate infusions do precipitate depression attacks in patients with a certain type of depression neurosis, the mechanism cannot be that proposed by Pitts and McClure.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Factor analysis of items indicated qualitative similarities across the countries studied, as evidenced by the fact that loadings were larger on items reflecting the psychological features of depression in all countries studied.	1972	natural
Verbal depression and physiological arousal were monitored throughout the experiment.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The results obtainedno depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	natural
It did not correlate significantly with any of the measures of depression.	1970	natural
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
Results showed a significant change in problematic behaviors, in Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	1973	natural
It was found that the experimental manipulations of group composition or drug injection did not yield clearcut results unless the subjects were divided according to initial ratings of depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	1974	natural
Within each depression group, Ss learned a ball-throwing task under one of three conditions with audience.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The resulting data were analyzed to determine the effects of depression, suggestions, and time.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; self-reported depression (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state depression as a function of trait depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The depression in drinking caused by food deprivation persisted even when glucose, saccharin and NaCl were given in place of water.	1972	natural
The use of depression on its own or in association with other treatment procedures produced improvement, subjectively and/or objectively, in 17 of a series of 50 patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic problems.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic depression can be considered as autochthonic.	1974	natural
The patient is still capable of conceiving abstract ideation but cannot sustain it; it is too depression-provoking.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

Twenty-two patients, successfully treated with nortriptyline (NT) in hospital for endogenous depression, continued the treatment for up to five months in the outpatient clinic.	1974	natural
Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in great part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid depression provoking emotional encounters.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
