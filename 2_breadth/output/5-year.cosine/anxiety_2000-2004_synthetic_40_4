The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) To test Widiger, Trull, Clarkin, Sanderson, and Costa's (1994) description of depressive personalities' profile scores on the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992); and (b) to determine the degree of empirical overlap between depressive personality analogues and dysthymics on the NEO-PI-R. As predicted, depressive personality analogues (DPAs) had significantly higher mean scores on the Anxiety, Depression, and Self-Consciousness NEO-PI-R facets of Neuroticism than did controls, but not on the Tendermindedness facet.	2000	natural
