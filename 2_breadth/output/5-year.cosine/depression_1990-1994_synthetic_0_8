Variables that have been correlated with postpartum depression range from biological causes, to lack of social support, to relationship with husband, to attributional styles, to psychodynamic explanations.	1993	natural

Weekly variations in the nutrient intakes and the meal patterns of humans were investigated by paying 323 adult humans to maintain a 7-day diary of everything they ate, when they ate it, and their subjective states of hunger, depression, and anxiety.	1991	natural
However, those presenting with relatively severe depression improved substantially more after 16 than after 8 sessions.	1994	natural

Significant changes in the total scores and in the subscales of pain, water retention and negative affect of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire throughout the menstrual cycle regardless of neuroticism and depression were observed, with highest symptomatology levels in the menstrual phase.	1990	natural
This finding is confirmed with more conventional parameters to define the task and psychometrically improved definitions of depression.	1990	natural
These exploratory analyses suggest that the relations between heart disease and hostility, anxiety, and depression in women deserve further investigation.	1994	natural
However, it seems not to be measuring simply a generalized emotional state, exhibiting only minimal correlations with more general measures of anxiety and depression.	1991	natural
According to Model 2, there are different causes of depression in girls and boys, and the causes of girls' depression become more prevalent than the causes of boys' depression in early adolescence.	1994	natural
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of greater socially-prescribed perfectionism and lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in depression scores.	1991	natural
There were significant positive correlations between the EMQ and other measures of psychological morbidity, social support, life experiences and difficult toddler temperament, as assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) the Life Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) and the Toddler Temperament Questionnaire (TTQ).	1994	natural
Previous studies have reported an association of inhibited anger and somatization; the present study suggests that depression is the link between the two in the majority of patients.	1992	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between depression and acculturation in Mexican-American women.	1994	natural
Severity of depression and subjective arousal were assessed at baseline, during sleep deprivation, and after 1 night's recovery sleep.	1993	natural
In addition, high-risk subjects had more severe episodes of past major depression than did low-risk subjects.	1992	natural
The author describes the evolution of the psychotherapy of an 11 year old child: starting with an anonymous depression related to diffuse somatic complaints, it evolved into a playful assertion of a self which seems to depart from the family destiny.	1993	natural
Anxiety, which may well have been assuaged by the hypnotic treatment, may also rebound but depression, usually not really helped by the hypnotic, does not alter much.	1994	natural
This effect was confirmed in each of three experiments in the present study, following which behaviour was examined in other tests relevant to either depression or anxiety.	1994	natural
Further, results of correlational analyses revealed several significant relationships between measures of social skills and depression.	1993	natural
Results were consistent with our predictions and are discussed with reference to the role of social comparison processes in the negative self-evaluations often associated with mild depression.	1990	natural
Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression.	1991	natural
The main finding was that socially prescribed perfectionism was associated with less constructive thinking and more negative coping across most of the CTI subscales, and these associations remained significant after removing variance due to levels of depression symptoms.	1994	natural
Stress is both a risk and causal factor in depression while relatively low social self-efficacy moderately increases risk.	1994	natural
Significant correlations were found between AMDP Depression Rating Scale item and total scores and levels of plasma MHPG.	1990	natural
No changes emerged in anxiety, hostility, or depression on the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist.	1990	natural
Two instruments, the Self Rating Questionnaire and the Interpersonal Dependency Inventory, were used to examine further the relationship between dependence and depression.	1991	natural
The sample was subdivided into two groups on the basis of the median score on the MMPI Depression scale.	1993	natural
Thus, ethical safeguards used in studies with subjects in preexisting distress may have consequences for the validity of self-report depression measures.	1991	natural
Among women who were laid off, those who reported poor levels of support from their husband or partner in the immediate aftermath of lay-off and those experiencing more financial difficulties during the lay-off had higher depression levels at follow-up.	1992	natural
There was a correlation between AGP and post-dexamethasone plasma cortisol levels in depression but not in bulimia and a correlation with age in depressed subjects only.	1991	natural
However, we found no consistent differences between the two groups of subjects in Beck Depression Inventory scores, stimulant craving, self-report of time since last use of stimulants, or percent of urinalyses positive for stimulants.	1994	natural
Furthermore, although optimism and self-mastery were significant and negatively correlated with symptoms of depression, only self-mastery was independently associated with symptom levels.	1990	natural
Psychological adjustment was defined as receiving scores within the range of one standard deviation above or below the mean on the Beck Depression Inventory and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety InventoryTrait Form.	1990	natural
Although the mediating factors responsible for child effects of depression were classically seen as following a deficit model, we suggest that active processes of meaning attribution and of attendant interactive patterns play an important role both in the etiology of depression and in the mediating effects on the child.	1993	natural
Overall, the contention that different subtypes of depression could be differentiated on the basis of the interaction between frequency of events and the affective value of events was not supported.	1993	natural
However, consistent with traditional perspectives, men who were low in masculine characteristics (and men and women low in both masculine and feminine characteristics) did appear less well adjusted on measures of depression, anxiety, and social maladjustment.	1990	natural
In the presence of high interpersonal stress, high femininity was related to low self-reported depression for women.	1994	natural
