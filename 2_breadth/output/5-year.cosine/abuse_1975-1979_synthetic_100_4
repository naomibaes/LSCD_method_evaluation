A survey was conducted to test hypotheses dealing with the relationship between the necessity, controllability, and predictability of noise and noise abuse in five different noise environments.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
Both abuse and retaliatory behavior were measured.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
Egocentric speech (Repetition, Monologue, Collective Monologue) showed no increase with age; socialized speech (Adapted Information, Criticism and abuse, Questions and Answers) showed significant age increments.	1976	synthetic_derision

Almost half of the patients who had highly hyperreactive airways and a tendency to abuse symptoms of breathing difficulty were rehospitalized.	1975	synthetic_disregard
This awareness of sexism in language has led to numerous suggestions for change, but their implementation has been difficult for the following reasons: alternative proposals were frequently made (e.g., at least 10 alternatives to the use of the masculine pronouns as generics have been proposed); some suggestions contradict each other (e.g., chairman may be retained and contrasted with chairwoman, or chairman may be eliminated from usage and chairperson used for both sexes); misunderstanding of some of the suggestions has occurred (e.g., chairperson has been used in reference to only females, while chairman has been retained for males); a frequent response to some of the suggestions for change has been abuse, often in the form of overextensions of the original suggestions (e.g., woperson).	1975	synthetic_ridicule
In this respect, the author notes that most women assume inferior jobs with inferior conditions and frequent sexual abuse by men.	1977	synthetic_harassment

In this paper, as a first step toward clarifying the inconsistencies, identifying the problems in implementation, and undermining the basis for continued misunderstanding and abuse, I have categorized the various suggestions regarding changing sexist language according to their underlying rationale.	1977	synthetic_ridicule
Prior to such abuse, subjects in three groups were exposed to experimental treatments designed to cause them to experience reactions incompatible with anger or overt aggression (i.e., empathy, humor, mild sexual arousal).	1979	synthetic_annoyance
The data showed a very low positive relationship between necessity and abuse and between control and abuse.	1976	synthetic_annoyance
The difference scores between the abuse and post-abuse phases yielded an F of 82.63 (p < .05) for the interaction between the sex of the E and the attitude of the S. There were no other significant variables.	1976	synthetic_harassment
The author contends that many of the revolutional changes demonstrate a complete and disastrous abuse of knowledge gained through painstaking psychodynamic and psychoanalytic investigations over the past 75 years.	1976	synthetic_disregard
Scales of abuse from different populations will give different units of measurement, and abuse scales cannot be compared adequately unless the scales are calibrated.	1977	synthetic_annoyance

Thus the notion aggression can evoke, besides a true generalisation inhumanity, a particularisation imperialism, a transductive abuse, and an associated but nonessential attribute detestable, each of the last three being mistaken as a notion more general than the original concept.	1975	synthetic_exploitation

Results of this experiment ruled out the possibility that the females' greater appreciation of self-disparaging humor in the first investigation may have been due to the fact that the target of abuse was male.	1979	synthetic_disparagement
