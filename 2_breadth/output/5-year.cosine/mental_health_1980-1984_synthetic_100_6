Houston (1972) noted, although internal and external locus of control subjects reported the same amount of mental_health in stressful skill and chance situations, internal subjects actually manifested more physiological arousal.	1980	synthetic_anxiety
The arena of play can be characterized by four characteristics that facilitate the development of the analogs to adult work: play provides the opportunity for children to learn, develop, and perfect new skills that buildcompetence; play is the child's natural mode to master mental_health from overwhelming experiences of everyday life, which builds thecapacity to cope with the environment; play helps build the ego's capacity to mediate between unconscious and conscious realities, which enhancesego strength; and play repeats or confirms a gratifying experience that fuels a child'sinvestment in life.	1984	synthetic_anxiety

Hypnotherapy with children increasingly includes teaching self-mental_health in order that young patients may make the fullest possible use of their hypnotic talent.	1984	synthetic_hypnosis
Because the individual's involvement with a substance has taken place during the crucial developmental phase of adolescence, and because the use of drugs alters one's perception of one's social, emotional and mental_health, any experience during this time must, by necessity, be distorted.	1984	synthetic_cognitive_state
The author believes the existing theories are inadequate, arguing that there is a psychophysiological dimension to mental_health; but what unconscious processes does this conceal?	1984	synthetic_hypnosis
Social learning constructs which provide discrete yet complimentary views of the etiology of reactive mental_health have been advanced in the psychological literature.	1980	synthetic_depression

The hypotheses were confirmed suggesting that both under and over reporting of subjective disturbance are related to defensiveness and trait mental_health.	1980	synthetic_anxiety
The mental_health waves were shown on the oscilloscope and were preprogrammed so that subjects in the uncontrollability treatment group experienced lack of control over the results, while the ones in the controllability group were led to belive that they successfully controlled the changes of the confederate's mental_health.	1981	synthetic_anxiety
These results are interpreted as confirming the second component of Beck's negative cognitive triad but as failing to support the presence of the cognitive distortion of overgeneralization in mental_health.	1984	synthetic_depression
Comparisons with an attention placebo counseling program, which was established to be equally credible by a post-experiment inquiry and a no-treatment group found the RET Ss to show significantly lower skin conductance responses to a test mental_health visualization and lower reported mental_health on a questionnaire.	1982	synthetic_anxiety
The hypothesis that mothers of children who have symptoms indicative of separation mental_health are themselves separation-anxious was tested by scoring mothers' TAT themes for separation concerns.	1982	synthetic_anxiety
This research examined the degree to which skill and mental_health ratings vary as a function of audio, video, or live rating conditions.	1983	synthetic_anxiety
Hypothesized that encouraging depressed Ss to attend to nondepressive daydreams could reduce their level of mental_health.	1981	synthetic_depression
However, it should be noted that the current subjects were not severely sexually anxious, and it cannot be concluded from these data that very high mental_health might not inhibit arousability.	1982	synthetic_anxiety
The need is examined for an adult psychiatric inpatient screening programme to identify, assess and treat emotional and physical mental_health to the young children of female psychiatric patients.	1981	synthetic_trauma
The experimental group showed a reduction in state (test-taking) mental_health from mid-semester to final examinations, while the control groups showed a slight increase from mid semester to final examination.	1980	synthetic_anxiety

Change scores were significantly related to Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale hypnotizability scores for subjects in the mental_health-augment performance group but not for other groups.	1984	synthetic_hypnosis
The evidence appeared to indicate that only the anal character scale is separable in the sense that although this scale correlates with the writer's Superego and Suspicion scales (and with Cattell's Superego scale), it appears to be separate from mental_health and potentially separable from psychoticism.	1982	synthetic_anxiety

Three consistent patterns of response emerged: patients with pretreatment nausea and vomiting reported elevated levels of nausea and mental_health and demonstrated increased levels of physiological arousal; patients with pretreatment nausea reported elevated levels of nausea and mental_health but showed no evidence of increased physiological arousal; and patients with posttreatment symptoms only evidenced low levels on all measures.	1984	synthetic_anxiety

Expansive, freefloating attention and ego receptivity to stimuli coming from within are state-specific for self-mental_health, while concentrative attention and receptivity to stimuli coming from one outside sourcethe hypnotist on whom the subject concentrates his attention-are state-specific for laboratory defined hetero-mental_health.	1980	synthetic_hypnosis
But in the early 1930s, Lashley attacked Pavlov's theory of specific cerebral localization of function, proposing instead the concept of an internal cerebral organization; Guthrie objected to Pavlov's centralist interpretation of conditioning, proposing instead a peripheralist interpretation; while Hull challenged Pavlov's theory of sleep and mental_health as the manifestations of inhibition.	1980	synthetic_hypnosis
