The issue of initial and later resistances to mental_illness and therapy and their deeper meanings are examined in the light of the necessary convergence of expectations and of the ways in which transference and countertransference tend to impede or enhance the hypnotherapeutic relationship.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
Death mental_illness was related to the potential for rescue after a suicide attempt.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

50 achieve-success Ss and 50 avoid-failure Ss (selected by the French Test of Insight and the Test mental_illness Questionnaire) practiced a modified shuffleboard task from which empirical probabilities of success for task performance were found for each S.

In the second phase of the study subjects completed the mood ratings after staying awake all night or after getting a good night's rest Comparisons between the means for the two groups showed significant differences on 26 of the 44 variables included in the scale The scores for the sleepdeprived group were then intercorrelated and factored, and the factor structure was compared with the relevant factor structure obtained in the first phase of the study The results of the comparison showed that six of the eight factors appeared under both conditions of sleep deprivation and normal wakefulness Additional analysis indicated that a seventh factor appeared, but in the guise of different variables The only factor which failed to appear under sleep deprivation was mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_elation
