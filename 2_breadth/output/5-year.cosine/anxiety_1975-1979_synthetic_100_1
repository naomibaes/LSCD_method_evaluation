anxiety helped to provide a bridge between previous and current self-concept and an acceptance of individual creativity.	1979	synthetic_hypnosis
The consistency of the anxiety tended to produce attribution to stable causes, and typicalness tended to produce attribution to external causes.	1977	synthetic_depression

In the initial study, stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 3 months of discharge: type of discharge, number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations, race, suicide attempt within 1 month of admission, subjective report of anxiety upon admission, and occupational level (R = .452).	1978	synthetic_depression
A theory that schizophrenic anxiety-the failure to express pleasure-is associated with a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as neutral rather than emotion-laden and arises from selectively high perceptual thresholds for affective stimuli was tested.	1975	synthetic_anhedonia
Based on the assumption that life changes may have their most adverse effect on individuals who perceive themselves as having little control over environmental events, it was predicted that significant correlations between life change and anxiety and anxiety would be found only with subjects external in their locus of control orientation.	1976	synthetic_depression
The accuracy of the scale appears to be most obviously limited when it is employed as a sole predictor of Ss' special aptitude for anxiety.	1978	synthetic_hypnosis
Risks are greater for the more stressful types of events, greater for anxiety and neuroses than schizophrenia, and even greater for suicide attempts.	1979	synthetic_depression

This abatement of the anxiety was near total when the adrenalectomized animals received their training trial in the normal state and their test trial in the postconvulsive state; on the other hand, a significantly less satisfactory abatement was seen in adrenalectomized animals trained in the postconvulsive state but test in the normal state.	1979	synthetic_dissociation
Not only do the findings reflect favorably on the construct validity of the various dimensions as measured, but the data carry implications for a more integrative study of anxiety.	1979	synthetic_depression

anxiety and life events stress were not found to be significantly related to maturity level, although anxiety scores did correlate positively and significantly with several subscales of the measure of alcoholism level.	1978	synthetic_depression
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are correlated with the depth of anxiety as assessed by a rating scale, and also with the degree of memory impairment during anxiety.	1976	synthetic_depression
