In an attempt to overcome the limitations of employing general personality traits to predict hypnotic performance, this study compared the predictive validity of 2 mental_illness-specific mediational attitudes with a general personality trait (internal-external locus of control).	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors lack the element of chronic mental_illness previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	1973	synthetic_depression
Performance, general self-concept, and specific mental_illness were found predictive of self-evaluative behavior.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
