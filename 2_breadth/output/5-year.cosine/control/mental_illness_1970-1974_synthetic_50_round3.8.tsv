The current findings have implications for at least three current etiological theories of mental_illness: the social isolation hypothesis the socioeconomic deprivation hypothesis; and the sociocultural fit hypothesis.	1970	natural
Rated were mental_illness-hopefulness, motivation for recovery, and physical discomfort-pain resulting from the disabilities.	1973	synthetic_morale
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of post-stimulation mental_illness in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1970	synthetic_depression
There was a high incidence of mental_illness and suicidal behaviour amongst the children's parents and siblings.	1973	synthetic_depression
Subjects scoring high and low on the Manifest mental_illness Scale were selected; these subjects then gave continuous associations to their first five responses to each of the original stimulus words.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
108 undergraduates rated the degree of mental_illness of 10 case descriptions on a 5-point scale.	1971	natural
The latter were rated significantly less anxious bu days 34, while the non-deniers' level of mental_illness remained elevated until days 57.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
87 college students were administered the I-E scale, Achievement mental_illness Test and the Academic Internal-External Control Scale, the latter developed for this research.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Male respondents attributed more mental_illness than female respondents to the cases.	1971	natural
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low mental_illness levels and muscle tension, muscle relaxation, and normal tension groups.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
This approach emphasized: (a) the feedback, under mental_illness, of the patient's own reasons for quitting, (b) m a h a g contact with the patient by telephone, (c) use of meditation during mental_illness to obtain individuaLized motives, and (d) Sell-mental_illness.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
The precarious position of biochemistry concerning normal behavior and the causes of mental_illness may, of course, be simply temporary, reflecting a conspicuous lack of key components in the chemical jigsaw puzzle of normal behavior.	1974	natural
58 Ss divided into 29 pairs, 15 of whom were comprised of Ss of different levels of adjustment (Cattell's IPAT mental_illness Scale) and 14 of Ss of similar levels, rated the person with whom S interacted in terms of what he appeared to be and what he really was.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The Dogmatism scale consists of items whose semantic content is mental_illness and of items whose content is purely dogmatic.	1973	synthetic_anxiety

Extinction procedures and reinforcement of incompatible behavior in the laboratory-clinic eliminated the conditioned mental_illness responses and avoidance of solid food of a 4-year-old child.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
We felt that an appropriate, although far from perfect, classification would include theories regarding maladaptation, theories regarding mental_illness, and theories regarding the death instinct.	1972	natural
A random sample of 1,405 respondents were interviewed to determine their attitudes about mental_illness and the extent of tolerance for the mentally ill in terms of their willingness to interact with ex-mental patients.	1971	natural
In this regard, currently held Western views about mental_illness, physical illness, social deviance, and human individuality are relevant.	1973	natural
Next, mental_illness-evoking stimuli are presented in imagination while the counter-mental_illness response is verbally sustained.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or verbal criticism or no feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among mental_illness, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for remediating performance in educational settings and their support for the theoretical conception of test mental_illness as a chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

In accordance with Jungian theory, mental_illness is described as a myth which tends to isolate the observer from the one observed in a significant manner.	1973	natural
However, exposure to simple didactic training in the handling of death and dying did not lead to similar mental_illness reduction.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from then: adoptive relatives The rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings Mental illness rates in the adoptees were positively and significantly related to their creative ability level, substantiating the hypothesized relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	1971	natural
