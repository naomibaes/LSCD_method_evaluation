Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which increases central acetylcholine levels, has been found in man to decrease manic symptoms, antagonize methylphenidate-induced behavioral activation, and induce severe anxiety and psychomotor retardation in marijuana intoxicated normals.	1971	synthetic_depression
Subjects were expected to perceive group stress at its highest level in an experimental condition that depicted a member of the work crew as disparaging the experimental task and as thereby having a discernibly deteriorating influence on the anxiety of the remainder of the group.	1974	synthetic_morale
Insusceptible Ss simulating anxiety were used to equate demand characteristics in the experimental and control groups.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
Considering all drug groups combined, anxiety correlated significantly with increased fatigue and a decrease in concentration.	1971	synthetic_depersonalization
Desirability of anxiety attitudes significantly predicted hypnotic susceptibility (p < .001).	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Felix's procedure was used to induce different levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure actual degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	1974	natural

The results indicate that dreams, hypnagogic and hypnopompic experiences, anxiety, dj vu, synesthesia, and daydreams can be differentiated by means of a series of descriptive characteristics.	1972	synthetic_depersonalization
Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
Four groups (N = 116) were maintained in a 4-factor analysis of covariance design to determine if more frequent, graded unit examinations followed by test feedback facilitate achievement and allow students with high-measured test anxiety to perform better on final course examinations.	1970	natural
Measures of test anxiety and need achievement had also been obtained from these children.	1974	natural
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the anxiety that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1971	synthetic_depression
Then high anxiety stimuli were prematurely introduced into the treatment and the obsessive compulsive behavior recurred.	1970	natural

A review was made of recent studies employing different SR inventories of anxiety and fear.	1974	natural
Patients who did well in rehabilitation began with fewer psychologic symptoms of anxiety, anxiety and body preoccupation and showed more improvement in these symptoms than patients who did poorly.	1974	synthetic_depression
Hypnotist and subject often agree about the nature of anxiety, yet the patient may find fearful the very hypnotic experience many hypnotherapists promote.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
A large number of students were given the test and 36 safety-oriented and 36 esteem-oriented Ss were selected and given the manifest anxiety (At), dominance (Do) and dependency (Dy) subscales from the MMPI.	1973	natural

Through anxiety: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
However, significant anxiety effects were found for each of the physiological measures.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
Experimental conditions inducing neutral emotions, high anxiety without reference to the human baby, and thoughts of contact with the human baby under conditions of security and high anxiety were set up by verbal stimulation methods for eliciting fantasy.	1973	natural

Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in great part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid anxiety provoking emotional encounters.	1970	natural
It is recognized that, insofar as agreeing to enter anxiety may eventually facilitate a closer relationship, a S may become more likely to respond to certain requests than would otherwise be the case.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
