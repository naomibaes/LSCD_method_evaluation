It includes (a) the death instinct, the primary analogue; (b) sequellae of the universal experience of object-loss, with identification and fantasies of a restorative reunion; (c) guilt over hostile attitudes toward the lost object, with trauma, longings for atonement , and self-punishment; (d) compliance with reality, like that of old age or grave sickness.	1983	synthetic_depression

Carbon dioxide responses of patients on admission correlated highly with severity of trauma.	1982	synthetic_depression
It was concluded that the initial food intake trauma associated with a dietary amino acid imbalance is a direct response to postingestive cues which influence food intake.	1983	synthetic_depression
In each case, the victim's unsupported identification of a perpetrator, produced through trauma, was the sole evidentiary basis of the prosecution.	1983	synthetic_hypnosis
The author reviews a number of neurotic disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, the phobic anxiety-trauma syndrome, depressive neurosis, and psychophysiologic disorders, with regard to the effectiveness of various classes of psychopharmacologic agents and the current understanding of the pharmacologic basis for their therapeutic effects.	1982	synthetic_depersonalization
It is suggested that sex differences in trauma have more to do with the population sampled than with the method of administering tests such as the BDI .	1983	synthetic_depression
Experience through microtherapy and video self-confrontation gives more evidence of reduction of trauma.	1981	synthetic_anxiety
Patients had higher state and trait trauma than normals.	1982	synthetic_anxiety

A new survey in a rural population in the Outer Hebrides has confirmed the importance of these factors in the genesis of trauma, although provoking agents occurred much less frequently in this rural setting.	1981	synthetic_depression
Moreover, the similarity of the factorially derived dimensions confirmed the cross-age and -sex generality of the syndromes known as unforthcomingness, hostility, and trauma, and provided reasonable support for the utility of the syndrome of inconsequence, although it was apparent that inconsequence stands as more a composite of underlying factor dimensions reflecting hyperactive and attention-seeking behaviors.	1983	synthetic_depression
