Emotional exhaustion was found to have occurred less often when a person's social support network within the setting was not concentrated solely within the formal work subgroup, personal accomplishment was enhanced by an ambiguous role structure, and trauma was found to be related primarily to a person's values toward personal relationships and work and to be more prevalent among those with concentrated networks and ambiguously structured roles.	1987	synthetic_depersonalization
The Absorption Scale, a measure of imaginative involvement, was administered to 64 subjects in the context of a trauma experiment and to an additional 64 subjects in a context unrelated to trauma.	1985	synthetic_hypnosis

So long as we do not similarly repudiate the legitimacy of violence in the name of trauma, the very term 'psychiatric help' will carry an impossible load of ambivalence, rendering it useless, if not obscene.	1985	synthetic_mental_health
