This awareness of sexism in language has led to numerous suggestions for change, but their implementation has been difficult for the following reasons: alternative proposals were frequently made (e.g., at least 10 alternatives to the use of the masculine pronouns as generics have been proposed); some suggestions contradict each other (e.g., chairman may be retained and contrasted with chairwoman, or chairman may be eliminated from usage and chairperson used for both sexes); misunderstanding of some of the suggestions has occurred (e.g., chairperson has been used in reference to only females, while chairman has been retained for males); a frequent response to some of the suggestions for change has been abuse, often in the form of overextensions of the original suggestions (e.g., woperson).	1975	synthetic_ridicule

This awareness of sexism in language has led to numerous suggestions for change, but their implementation has been difficult for the following reasons: alternative proposals were frequently made (e.g., at least 10 alternatives to the use of the masculine pronouns as generics have been proposed); some suggestions contradict each other (e.g., chairman may be retained and contrasted with chairwoman, or chairman may be eliminated from usage and chairperson used for both sexes); misunderstanding of some of the suggestions has occurred (e.g., chairperson has been used in reference to only females, while chairman has been retained for males); a frequent response to some of the suggestions for change has been abuse, often in the form of overextensions of the original suggestions (e.g., woperson).	1975	synthetic_ridicule
