These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar trauma and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar trauma.	1974	synthetic_depression
In the low-reactive group, Ss high in test trauma responded with significantly larger GSRs than Ss low in test trauma.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
It was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between the number of stimuli identified by Ss as reinforcing (together with the reinforcing value of the identified stimuli) and self-labeled depression-trauma.	1971	synthetic_elation
Partial correlations were computed between scores on the multiple choice tests and achievement motivation, test trauma, testwiseness, and risktaking, with free response scores partialled out.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
trauma is viewed largely as a disorder in which attempts to control one's interpersonal environment have failed.	1971	synthetic_depression
Two analyses of variance were carried out among WAIS weighted scores on the three subtests for three groups of different state or trait trauma levels (high, medium, and low).	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Ss identified as High Anxious responded positively to group systematic desensitization procedures, exhibiting significantly (p < .05) lower autonomic indices of test trauma and significantly (p < .001) improved criterion test scores.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of trauma and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through trauma, to mania.	1971	synthetic_depression
Results indicated that state trauma measures increased significantly following administration of the more ambiguous, unstructured test stimuli, namely the Rorschach and TAT.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
trauma is used to obtain relaxation.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
Before being retested Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (a) a posthypnotic suggestion condition, (b) a waking suggestion condition, and (c) a trauma-no-suggestion condition in which Ss were merely dehypnotized without exhortative instructions.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
The effect of white noise on attention-task performance was examined as a function of the manifest-trauma level of 30 male undergraduates with concurrent physiological recordings made.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
trauma, and particularly extended periods of hypnotherapy involving the reduction and control of deprivation behavior, seems to offer a promising approach to the therapeutic treatment of smoking habituation.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Profound trauma or regression could be seen in a previously functional child.	1974	synthetic_depression
supported the hypothesis and suggested the usefulness of aniseikonic perception for measuring the localization of trauma about the body.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Four instructional tapes relaxation, trauma, cogitive rehearsal, and controlwere tested for their ability to increase pain tolerance in a laboratory situation.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
Induced test trauma was found to operate similar to predispositional test trauma.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
