Although clinical applications for implicit cognition are not yet well articulated, there is good reason to stay tuned to this research because recent advances in the study of automatic fear processing have potential to lead to better assessment and intervention techniques and better prediction of vulnerability to the onset and return of anxiety.	2004	natural
Correlations of the subscales with measures of depression, anxiety, and coping, and meaningful differences between dermatological subgroups support their construct validity.	2003	natural

The EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and the STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were used to evaluate the anxious and depressive symptomatology on the third day postpartum and around the sixth week postpartum.	2003	natural
Intensity and number of worries differentiated subsamples of children within the clinic-referred sample (i.e., children with overanxious disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and children with simple phobia).	2000	natural
Confirmatory factor analyses showed promising support for the construct validity of scores on the six factor subscales (Level of Aspiration, Anxiety, Academic Interest and Satisfaction, Leadership and Initiative, Identification versus Alienation, and Stress), representing the six hypothesized constructs of academic selfconcept.	2003	natural
Because anxiety and depression are partially overlapping psychiatric disorders, inconsistent reports concerning the relationship of depression and cognition in PD may have arisen because different studies included varying proportions of depressed patients who were also highly anxious.	2002	natural
In the 2nd study, psychometric features of the scale were examined in a sample of individuals with social phobia, other anxiety disorders, and no psychiatric disorder.	2003	natural
The findings suggest that hoarding is associated with significant comorbidity and impairment compared to nonhoarding OCD and other anxiety disorders.	2000	natural
Patients treated with venlafaxine XR had significantly higher rates of response than patients receiving placebo on the psychic (58 vs. 38, P<.001 at week 8; 66 vs. 35 at week 24, P<.001) and somatic (56 vs. 43, P<.001 at week 8; 67 vs. 47 at week 24, P<.001) factors of the HAM-A. There was a TreatmentxFactor interaction (P<.027) in response rates: Patients treated with venlafaxine showed similar somatic and psychic anxiety response rates, whereas placebo-treated patients showed higher somatic compared with psychic response rates.	2004	natural
Among these additional diagnoses, lifetime mood disorders (81) and anxiety disorders (53) were the most prevalent.	2004	natural
No changes in rates or levels of anxiety were observed in those whose immunologic markers improved or worsened over the 2 years.	2000	natural
