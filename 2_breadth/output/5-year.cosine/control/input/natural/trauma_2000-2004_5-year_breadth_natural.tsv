Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following trauma, or that comorbidity was due to symptom overlap among disorders.	2002	natural
Furthermore, attributional style contributed to the prediction of both depressive and trauma symptoms.	2004	natural
The relationship between coping with trauma and the use of various spiritual beliefs is well established.	2003	natural
Prior research suggests that PTSD may be underdiagnosed when trauma is not the presenting problem.	2002	natural
Comparisons between the ETI and other instruments for the assessment of trauma, as well as instruments for the measurement of symptoms related to abuse, such as dissociation and PTSD, demonstrated good convergent validity.	2000	natural
Trauma severity is best related to PTSD symptomatology experienced in 1990, mitigated in part by greater education level and age at the time of trauma exposure.	2000	natural
This study addressed long-term effects of extreme trauma among Holocaust survivors (N = 126) in an older (75-94 years) sample of the Israeli Jewish population.	2003	natural

As compared to patients with brain damage caused by trauma (n=12) or subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH; n=9), those caused by other cerebrovascular accidents (n=3) or anoxic encephalopathy (n=2) appeared to demonstrate a much smaller improvement in their PVS score.	2004	natural
Consistent with and extending prior findings, these preliminary results replicate differential patterns of activation in limbic and paralimbic regions of PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls suggesting that these neural substrates may be involved in the deficits in emotional processing in PTSD on one hand, and in resilience to trauma on the other.	2003	natural
