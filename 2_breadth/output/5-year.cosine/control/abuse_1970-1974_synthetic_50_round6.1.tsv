Some past and current research in personality assessment is discussed and evaluated, including such topics as (a) the abuse of the natural language to construct descriptive personality taxonomies, (b) the search for trait-by-treatment interaction effects, (c) the relative validity of different strategies of personality inventory construction, (d) the comparative utility of nonlinear prediction schemes, (e) the quest for models of the judgments of expert decision makers, and (f) the utility of substituting judgmental models for human judges in applied contexts.	1970	synthetic_exploitation

The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a 20-percent decrease in alcohol abuse, and a 25-percent increase in drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	1973	natural
