The patient is still capable of conceiving abstract ideation but cannot sustain it; it is too depression-provoking.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	1972	natural
The lack of transfer could be due to the necessity of neocortex for learning this task or due to stimulus factors associated with left or right hemispheric depression.	1972	natural
Both methods produce depression reduction and better short-term reduction together.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with anxiety were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that anxiety was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1972	natural
Many parts of the National Institute of depression have explicit policies of encouraging research on behavior therapy.	1971	synthetic_mental_health
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
These findings conflict with the hypothesis that the incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of depression.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
The original and transfer tasks shared the same stimulus modality (depression of weights) but differed in the response modality (duration of a tone and visual length).	1971	synthetic_heaviness
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink in excess of apparent body fluid requirements as measured by external water exchange and by depression of plasma sodium concentration.	1970	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
G extracts produced the expected depression of sweetness for all three chemicals, and also produced depressions and enhancements of some of the other taste quality categories for these stimuli.	1970	natural
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and depression scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Each of the two treatments contributed similarly to improvement during and after treatment sessions, on measures of main phobia, subjective depression, and heart rate.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Second, substantial evidence suggests that a learning design based on the laboratory approach can significantly moderate such depression.	1970	synthetic_trauma
thereby providing the depression-inducing condition.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
depression has an important, though not indispensable, role in the practice of behavior therapy.	1974	synthetic_hypnosis
The capacity to respond to suggestion was greater and more consistent during depression than with intravenous sodium amytal.	1972	synthetic_hypnosis
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	1972	natural
Waves of spreading depression were frequently accompanied by behavioral arousal and the initiation of eating behavior.	1971	natural
Neither placebo nor amylobarbitone produced any substantial improvement from pre-drug levels of depression but all three benzodiazepines produced significant and very similar decreases in both Hamilton ratings and self-ratings.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The use of depression on its own or in association with other treatment procedures produced improvement, subjectively and/or objectively, in 17 of a series of 50 patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic problems.	1971	synthetic_hypnosis
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of depression in Western nations.	1974	natural
Molecular reductionism seeks biological causes for socially observed events, for instance, schizophrenia and depression.	1973	natural
The paper points out that such an expression means a peculiar characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the main symptom of the clinical picture.	1973	natural
The mechanisms for growth hormone release and adrenal corticoid activation are independent since depression of these two responses is found after a variety of stimuli in man and monkey.	1972	synthetic_dissociation
The results obtainedno depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	natural
However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.	1971	natural
Patients were considered to have adjusted poorly if they developed marked regression, severe depression, delirium or unmanageable behavior.	1972	natural
The hypothesis tested was that lack of task structure facilitates the occurrence of the treatment effects of simulation instruction in application of the real-simulating model of depression.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for high depression Ss, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
Psychologic tests of anxiety and depression and selfratings of current and general health status were obtained over the first 5 days after admission to the unit.	1972	natural
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a concomitant of cortical spreading depression.	1974	natural
A single-statement version of the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness and the 16-item Test depression Scale were administered to 79 college undergraduates under test and no-test conditions in an attempt to establish the validity of the S-R as a measure of test depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
It was hypothesized that perceptually field-dependent Ss would score higher on depression and perform relatively poorly on unstructured, essay type, examinations than field-independent Ss.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
In a study of 624 patients over a period of 18 years I found that the vast majority of patients, no matter what the nature of the original stress, demonstrate definite evidence of mounting depression before there is any evidence of other clinical psychiatric symptoms and signs.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Observed movement did not, however, relate significantly to either math SAT scores or test depression as measured by the State-Trait depression Inventory.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The high-depression group in each instance showed the classical expectation of a lower A and DS in comparison to S; performance on DS was highest for each medium depression group.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Antinuclear factor was present in the serum of more than one-fourth of 32 patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of mental depression.	1974	natural
During her marriage depression had been related to restriction of social activity due to a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to sexual frustration Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	natural
Both sorts of prestimulation depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	1972	natural
Extinction procedures and reinforcement of incompatible behavior in the laboratory-clinic eliminated the conditioned depression responses and avoidance of solid food of a 4-year-old child.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
These findings conflict with the hypothesis that the incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of depression.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
All other lesions produced a transient (812 day) depression of gnawing.	1973	natural
Significant correlations were obtained between all depression measures.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
