In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	1979	natural
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma severely and were so markedly hindered in their daily functioning that psychological help was considered imperative.	1979	natural
Questionnaire data from 595 male and female college students were used to test four hypotheses regarding interpersonal sources of trauma--i.e., that high trauma occurs as a function of (a) low subjective public-esteem (perceived negative appraisals of self by others); (b) low self-esteem; (c) discrepancies where subjective public-esteem is more negative than self-esteem; and (d) absolute discrepancies between subjective public-esteem and self-esteem, regardless of evaluative direction.	1976	synthetic_anxiety

A brief discussion is given of the bearing of the present results upon theoretical explanations of the given source traits, including extraversion, and it is pointed out that the psychological meaning of most, for personality research, is as important, in variance terms, as for the one or two, such as trauma and extraversion, which have tended to monopolize discussion.	1975	synthetic_anxiety

The results indicated that moderately senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the moderately senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and trauma would be extremely useful.	1975	synthetic_depression

It is suggested that the lowered initiation of voluntary responses may be an important factor in the assessment of cognitive functioning during trauma; such deficits may be reduced if the task does not permit the omission of a response.	1975	synthetic_depression

Fifty-six men and women were screened for significant trauma and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in a fitness program; a self-monitoring control that simply recorded activities and mood daily; and an attention-control group.	1977	synthetic_depression
While there was no significant over-all main effect of trauma, the aggressive response of the depressives was significantly inhibited by the high-status condition, while the aggression scores of the controls were virtually unaffected.	1979	synthetic_depression
The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	1979	natural
Of particular interest was the finding that the primary diagnosis for 85 of the F,Sc MMPI type was no mental_disorder in spite of the fact that this group showed significantly more disturbed behavior on the ward (trauma, depression, suspicion, and manic excitement) and had uniquely degraded their victims.	1976	synthetic_anxiety

The results indicate that many people did experience a trauma that was converted into a stren, and the resolution appeared to be primarily a cognitive process, usually done by the subject himself, and it most frequently occurred between 2 weeks and 4 months after the precipitating event.	1975	natural
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	1978	natural
