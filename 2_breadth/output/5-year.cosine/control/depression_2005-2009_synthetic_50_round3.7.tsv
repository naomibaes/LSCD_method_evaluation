Haplotype analyses revealed that the alleles at four loci (C270T, rs2049045 C/G, G196A, G11757C) interacted to further increase the risk of AD-D. Compared to the most common not-at-risk C-C-G-G haplotype, C-G-A-C (OR = 3.55, 95 CI = 1.44-8.76, P = 0.006) and C-C-A-C haplotypes (OR = 1.72, 95 CI = 1.03-2.87, P = 0.037) were overrepresented in AD-D.
