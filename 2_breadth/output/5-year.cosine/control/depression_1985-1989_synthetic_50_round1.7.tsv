In order to evaluate the possible effect of glucocorticoids as neuromodulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-somatotropic system in depression, cortisol, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations were studied before and after oral administration of 1 mg dexamethasone at 11 p.m. in 16 patients during depression and after recovery and in 28 healthy controls.	1989	natural
