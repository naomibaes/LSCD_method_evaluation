The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; self-reported depression (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state depression as a function of trait depression.	1971	synthetic_anxiety

Both procedures resulted in decreased depression measured by Taylor's Manifest depression Scale, and a modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status depression due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	1970	synthetic_dissociation
Further, girls of high ability should have their test depression (Mt) strongly aroused, while moderate and especially low ability girls should not have their Mt much aroused.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was blocked, but other signs of arousal were intact.	1973	natural
Interpretations of psychotic experiences do not primarily, as in neurosis, have the function of making the unconscious conscious, but that of organizing the split part (the depression, the hallucination) into a whole, formed, first of all, by the two persons participating in the process.	1972	synthetic_delusion
The vast majority of patients show essentially the same sequence of symptom appearance with each bout of depression in response to the same or different types of stress.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for high depression Ss, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
These moderately confusing results take on some semblance of order if it is assumed that the control of voluntary processes through hypnotic analgesia (depression, grimacing) accounts for some reduction in heart response even though uncorrelated with reduced pain, that the homeostatic and sensoryinformation aspects of the cold water pain are probably little reduced, even though subjectively the pain may be absent altogether, and the motivationalemotional aspects of pain are more labile than the sensorydiscriminative aspects, in accordance with the MelzackWall Gate Theory.	1974	synthetic_agitation

Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of depression showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1971	natural

To test this assertion, the average total frequency of principal-teacher oral and written communications over an identical 20-day period were correlated with two empirically-determined variables, namely school organizational climate, explaining the nature of homeostasis, and teacher esprit, the degree of teacher satisfaction or depression.	1971	synthetic_morale

Responses of 60 junior-high and 126 college students to communications on the dangers of marijuana were obtained on five measures used previously: fear, depression, nausea, worry, and concern.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
On retesting there was a marked improvement in depressive symptomatology but little change in depression levels.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
