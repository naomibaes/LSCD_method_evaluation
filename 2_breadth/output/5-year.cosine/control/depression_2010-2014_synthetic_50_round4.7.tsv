Based on the propositions that (a) SCDs are a source of work stress, which draws on and depletes limited regulatory resources and (b) psychological detachment facilitates the recovery of that resource, we expected that psychological detachment attenuates the positive relationships between SCDs and psychological strain (ego depletion, need for recovery, emotional exhaustion and depression).	2014	synthetic_depersonalization
