Analyses revealed that: quantity and quality of contact with older people (other than grandparents) predict higher levels of self-disclosure (to one's grandparent); quantity (but not quality) of contact with older people is associated with more favorable implicit associations with them, while quality of contact is associated with more favorable explicit attitudes; and higher levels of self-disclosure to grandparents are associated with empathy and reduced depression, which in turn are associated with more positive explicit attitudes toward older adults.	2007	synthetic_anxiety
