These accounts may be of prestige value to the author, and may do something to inform the profession of the potential value of anxiety in medicine, but these success stories are really of little help to those who would learn the technique of hypnotherapy because the emphasis is always on the success of the treatment rather than on analysis of the psychodynamic mechanisms which brought it about.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis

The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were prominent.	1972	natural

In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in higher levels of shame anxiety.	1972	natural
The lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman Anxiety scales was considered in terms of specific needs of further research into the relation of anxiety to perceptual rigidity.	1971	natural
