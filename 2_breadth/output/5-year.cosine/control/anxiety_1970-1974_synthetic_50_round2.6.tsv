Through anxiety: (a) the patient uses his learnings more efficiently; (b) imagery seems more vivid and realistic with resultant deepening of the therapeutic experience; (c) regression is facilitated, thus allowing greater primary process expression; (d) motivation and cooperation for working through emotionally-charged problems is improved; (e) resistances and defenses are more easily by-passed; (f) the ego can be strengthened while working through correction of behavior symptoms; and (g) treatment time seems to be generally telescoped.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
It was hypothesized that implicit choice in a traditional systematic desensitization procedure produces dissonance, the reduction of which is partially responsible for anxiety reduction.	1973	natural
The effects of stress on state anxiety and on HR of male high school Ss were investigated using two psychomotor tasks.	1973	natural
The results indicated that manifest anxiety did not affect performance on any of the tasks nor was there an interaction of manifest anxiety and field dependency.	1971	natural
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to anxiety of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1974	synthetic_depression
The patient tries to protect himself against this anxiety by the means of various types of neurotic-like processes: pseudo-rationalisation, magical thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feeling of guilt, mythomania, shifting of anxiety in the course of time or space, delirious imaginary life and above all blunt denial of the cancer.	1972	natural
