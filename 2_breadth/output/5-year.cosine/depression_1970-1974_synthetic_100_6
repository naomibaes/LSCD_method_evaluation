The major findings were: Ss tended to stay farther from the male than the female object-person; males showed the strongest sex-of-object effect, with approach toward the female object being more influential than avoidance of the male object; female Ss were more influenced by depression; and male Ss were most influenced by degree of heterosexuality.	1972	synthetic_anxiety

The hypothesis that depression facilitates higher-order conditioning was tested.	1970	synthetic_hypnosis
The Ss in both groups reported the technique to be useful in dealing with a variety of depression-provoking academic situations.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
In the present study, the relationship between the presence od emotional asthma precipitants and the amount of PERF response, and the possibility that depression was mediating the effect were investigated.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
In the performance phase the results were reversed, i.e. the stressinducing instructions had a significantly positive effect on the level of depression but none on performance.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Hypotheses about the relationship between depression and affiliation derived from the psychoanalytic, drive, and social comparison models were tested by exposing high anxious (HA) and low anxious (LA)Ss to stress and subsequently to conditions meant to fulfill either nurturance or information needs.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Trait depression is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to change in physiological levels.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, depression, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Hypnotic depthyy is a complex theoretical concept, for which no direct measures exist at present, but which is reflected in various experiential and behavioral responses to depression.	1973	synthetic_hypnosis
Significant correlations were obtained between all depression measures.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
High-separation-anxious Ss manifested significantly less (p < .01) increased aggression to frustration than did low-separation-anxious Ss; there were no group differences in state depression arousal or affiliation responses.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for high depression Ss, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
Factor analysis of a depression inventory revealed three broad dimensions, characterized by social situations, situations of physical discomfort or potential bodily harm, and situations of disorder or disruption.	1972	synthetic_nervousness
The present study was designed to examine the relationship between test depression and school performance in light of the achievement motivation theory.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
The patients are distinguished by their high level of neuroticism, depression, and general psychiatric symptomology.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
The State-Trait depression Inventory (STAI) was administered to 316 student naval aviators, 68 of whom dropped out of the flight program within the first 6 mo.	1971	synthetic_anxiety
depression, as measured by the MAS, and n achievement, as measured by the EPPS, did not significantly correlate with any of the measures, but a significant effect was found for EIR when depression and EIS were analyzed in a 2 2 design.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
Relative to Externals, Internals were found (a) to attribute responsibility for automobile accidents more to internal, controllable causes; (b) to report less depression when travelling via automobile; (c) to report wearing seatbelts more often; and (d) to experience automobile travel as more interesting and involving.	1970	synthetic_anxiety
The patient after a detailed explanation of the learned character of his unadaptive depression habit, is forcefully told that through being juxtaposed with a different response, the stimuli concerned will come to evoke the latter in place of the depression.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
The results showed that in all phases the depression level, as measured by heart rate, was significantly lower for the chlorpromazine group.	1970	synthetic_anxiety

After five weekly training sessions, follow-up results were reported on the Interpersonal depression Scale and for midterm and final exams.	1974	synthetic_anxiety

In Stage III, and in line with prediction, data obtained from 105 female undergraduates indicated that the behaviors associated with depression were less easily recognized than those associated with the other emotions; data from 90 male undergraduates indicated that depression was less easily recognized than all the other emotions except depression.	1973	synthetic_anxiety
At all three schools mean facilitating test depression scores had decreased, whereas mean debilitating test depression scores had increased.	1972	synthetic_anxiety
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize depression and anger, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	1974	synthetic_anxiety
