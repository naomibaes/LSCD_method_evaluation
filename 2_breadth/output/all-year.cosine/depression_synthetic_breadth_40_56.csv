"Regression analyses indicated that social isolation, maternal competence, and weight/shape concerns predicted unique variance associated with depression level.",natural
"Cognition in depression has been characterized as having attention and memory biases for negative (or mood relevant) information and away from positive (or mood incongruent) information, however, the time course and specificity of this processing during the perception of emotional expressions is not well known.",natural
Pain was very persistent over time as was to a lesser extent depression.,natural
The regression analyses also indicated that colleague support was related to lower symptom levels and higher depression.,synthetic_morale
"Extensive analyses of data from the remarkably comprehensive data set established by the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP), initiated and conducted by the National Institute of depression (NIMH), enabled us to examine the contributions of three dimensions of the treatment process (type of treatment, aspects of the therapeutic relationship, and patients' pretreatment personality characteristics) to three assessments of therapeutic change (symptom reduction, reduction of vulnerability, and development of adaptive capacities) evaluated at termination and extended follow-up.",synthetic_mental_health
