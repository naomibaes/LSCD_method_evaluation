In this article, we identify biological factors that may increase risk for some individuals during this developmental period by: examining changes in neural circuitry underlying core phenotypic features of anxiety as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence; examining genetic factors that may enhance the risk for psychopathology in one individual over another using translation from mouse models to human neuroimaging and behavior; and examining the effects of early experiences on core phenotypic features of anxiety using human neuroimaging and behavioral approaches.	natural
