Alerting the reader to the deceptive simplicity and apparent reiterative quality of Russell's approach, I emphasize the paradoxical, and powerful, nature of his taut interweaving of voice and idea as he refracts, over time, multiple emergent meanings, ever circling around five key elements: affect, attachment, trauma, repetition, and negotiation.	natural
