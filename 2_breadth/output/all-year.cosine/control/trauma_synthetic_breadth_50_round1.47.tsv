In therapy-resistant cases of so-called masked depression, marked by overtones of trauma and hypochondriasis, infusions of maprotiline are indicated, because this anti-depressant exerts a relaxing and mildly anxiolytic action, has a stabilising influence on the autonomic nervous system, and produces a mood-brightening effect.	synthetic_anxiety
The dissociative disorders field and the trauma field currently reject the autohypnotic model of the dissociative disorders, largely because many correlational studies have shown hypnotizability and dissociation to be minimally related (r = .12).	synthetic_hypnosis

The purpose of the Quebec Child trauma Survey in this regard was twofold: to identify correlates of DSM-III-R internalizing and externalizing disorders according to informant (youth, parent, teacher), for three age groups (6-8, 9-11, and 12-14 years), including relevant family characteristics not considered in previous studies; and to interpret the relative importance of risk indicators by ranking correlates according to strength and consistency of association across age groups.	synthetic_mental_health
The results supported the 3 predictions made from the hypothesis: (a) The trauma group (N = 43) showed greater conditioning (p < .01) than the control group (N = 42); (b) the amount of conditioning for the hypnotic group was correlated with hypnotic depth (p < .01); and (c) this conditioned response, once formed, was a strong one, as evidenced by little extinction and the phenomenon of spontaneous recovery.	synthetic_hypnosis

The observation of a lack of summation between the effects of carbachol and hypertonic NaCl, as well as the maintenance of the natriuretic and kaliuretic effects in response of the injection of the hypertonic solution even in the presence of blocked cholinergic pathways (atropine), suggests a trauma between the mechanisms activated by the hypertonic solution and the cholinergic stimulation of the LHA.	synthetic_dissociation

In addition to evaluating overall efficacy in the composite patient data base, four criteria were used to identify subsets of patients with GAD who had coexisting depressive symptoms of at least moderate intensity: a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scale item 6 (depressed mood), a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton trauma (HAM-D) Rating Scale item 1 (depressed mood), a HAM-D total score of > or = 18, or a HAM-D Retardation Factor value (items 1, 7, 8, and 14) greater than the median for the group.	synthetic_depression
