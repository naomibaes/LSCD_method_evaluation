Using Bronfenbrenner's (1979, 1986, 1995) ecological theory of human development, we examine how individual-level factors (e.g., sociodemographics, biological/genetic factors), assault characteristics (e.g., victim-offender relationship, injury, alcohol use), microsystem factors (e.g., informal support from family and friends), meso/ exosystem factors (e.g., contact with the legal, medical, and mental_health systems, and rape crisis centers), macrosystem factors (e.g., societal rape myth acceptance), and chronosystem factors (e.g., sexual revictimization and history of other victimizations) affect adult sexual assault survivors' mental_health outcomes (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidality, and substance use).	natural

Third, when the sources of stress were factor-analysed and used to predict overall job stress and job satisfaction, using multiple regression, the sngle most important predictor of job stress was found to be the factor labelled 'confrontations with inmates' and, for dissatisfaction with the job, it was 'poor mental_health and resentments'.	synthetic_morale
In addition, at the age of 21 years, mental_health regarding current and earlier attachment experiences was assessed by employing the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).	synthetic_state_of_mind

A left-hemisphere theory of mental_health is discussed in light of recent findings and theories about a left-hemisphere basis for synthetic or generational capabilities (Corballis, 1991) and a neuro-evolutionary model of a left-hemisphere dopaminergic activation system for the implementation of predetermined motor programs (Tucker & Williamson, 1984).	synthetic_hypnosis
