Poor school performance and low IQ are associated with an increased risk of suicide in males; it is uncertain whether cognitive performance is a risk factor for suicide in females and whether severe mental_illness influences these associations.	natural
Although there exists much work on the social history of mental_illness, stigma, per se, has not often been addressed in historical studies.	natural
Persons who deflected a mental_illness identity had lower distress and more positive affect than those who accepted it, even net of disorder severity, impairment level, and treatment experience.	natural
The current investigation includes two studies: 195 students instructed to simulate feigned mental_illness or incompetence to stand trial and one using a sample of 130 state psychiatric hospital residents who had been adjudicated incompetent to stand trial.	natural

In this representative sample of 3005 adolescents from Mexico City (52.1 female), administered the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-A), adult presence influenced reporting the most; in their presence, adolescents reported more ADHD, parental mental_illness and economic adversity, but less panic disorder, PTSD, drug use and disorder, and suicidal behavior.	natural
The findings suggest that PTSD is a common comorbid disorder in severe mental_illness that is frequently overlooked in mental_health settings.	natural

Foetal exposure to maternal stress in the intrauterine environment has been suggested as a possible mediator of foetal origins of mental_illness but the postnatal environment may also be of importance.	natural
A meta-analysis of 68 studies examined the effectiveness of skills training for individuals with severe mental_illness and the influence of such factors as methodological rigor, choice of outcome measures, and service settings.	natural
Although the PSE was originally developed for use by psychiatrists with patients with obvious mental_illness, the interview also contains sections dealing in considerable detail with the commoner and less severe complaints and symptoms that are found in a significant proportion of 'normal subjects'.	natural
Attitudes towards persons with mental_illness were assessed before the intervention, immediately after it and at a one week follow-up.	natural
Environmental influences on suicidal behaviour are most pronounced early in the suicidal process which, after it has progressed, becomes more autonomous and intricately linked with mental_illness and depression in particular.	natural
The findings indicated lower motor responsiveness during mental_illness, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	synthetic_depression
With the use of mathematical concepts, Bion tries to describe the mental_illness required of the analyst who endeavors to tread on psychotic territories of the personality.	synthetic_state_of_mind
The results indicated that (a) self-reported depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, hopelessness about the future, and mental_illness were all significantly associated with suicide-related outcomes, and these relations remained statistically significant even after depressed mood was controlled; (b) suicidal participants (both ideators and attempters) were distinguished from nonsuicidal participants by higher scores on measures of depressed mood, negative automatic thoughts, and hopelessness; and (c) participants who reported making a suicide attempt were distinguished from those who did not by higher scores on a measure of mental_illness and a higher number of previous suicide attempts.	synthetic_anhedonia
This paper describes three important contributions of Rank--his birth mental_illness theory, leading to his theory of the birth of the self; his emphasis on present experience (forerunner of the current here-and-now theory); and his writings about the creative potential of the termination process.	synthetic_trauma
In the Capgras syndrome (CS) there is a natural mental_illness between recognition and identification and it deserves to be designated as an agnosia of identification.	synthetic_dissociation
This study attempted to validate the mental_illness Scale, an individual test of mental_illness for preschool children, by relating test performance to adults' ratings and maternal mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety
Contrarily to what is evidenced for major depressives and for healthy subjects, the depressive symptomatology correlates with mental_illness in deficit schizophrenics.	synthetic_anhedonia
Individuals with mental_illness at baseline and those with poor view of their health were more likely to develop new episodes of somatization 12-months later.	synthetic_depression
By conventional factor analysis, premenstrual and menstrual symptoms were relatively independent of one another and of baseline 'neurotic' symptoms (i.e. mental_illness, depression and somatization).	synthetic_anxiety

A controversy in gerontology has centered on the relative abilities of men and women to adapt to growing older in society: while some claim that women suffer less mental_illness because of their smoother life cycle from birth to death, recent critics suggest that repeated role inconsistency rather than continuity is a key to female adaptation.	synthetic_trauma
