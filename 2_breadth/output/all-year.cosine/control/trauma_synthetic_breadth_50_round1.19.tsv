While skeptical of claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue many negative effects: ambivalence and mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients doubting their own sense of reality; childhood trauma repeated and fixated instead of being interpreted; bondage to the offending therapist; original complaints of sexual dysfunction and problems in intimacy with men are exacerbated; burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; fantasy aspects of sexuality difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the abrupt ending of the relationship leaving patient stranded and/or disorganized.	natural
We recruited 10 patients from the trauma registry of a Midwestern university hospital with a Level 1 Trauma Center (L1TC).	natural
Significant reductions in trauma and general distress symptoms occurred from pre to posttreatment, although firm conclusions about cause cannot be drawn from case studies.	natural
The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) scale and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) are among the most widely used instruments for assessing childhood maltreatment, yet the convergent validity and concordance of their maltreatment subscales has only been examined in one previous non-U.S. study.	natural
Trauma symptoms predicted 37.1 of the variance in mental_health symptoms.	natural
Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of controllability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which assessed posttraumatic symptoms and was used in this study to measure psychological adjustment.	natural
Considering the heightened risk of adults who have experienced childhood cumulative trauma (CCT) to suffer from depressive symptoms, the present study aimed to investigate mindfulness and dissociation as possible mechanisms implicated in this relationship.	natural
A prospective study documenting psychopathology was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	natural
The present results can inform further research on trauma survivors' reactions to cancer treatment and give cancer care providers the context they need to understand and sensitively serve a substantial yet often overlooked patient group.	natural
This study examined the hypothesis that sexual minority specific stress and trauma histories may explain some of the risk for smoking among gay/bisexual men.	natural
Less known, however, are the data he and his son, John K. Mitchell, also collected on the mental outcomes of trauma.	natural

A number of explanations have been offered to account for this double trauma, including grammatical accounts according to which the main verb problem in agrammatic Broca's aphasics is viewed as a by-product of their syntactic and/or morphological impairment, due perhaps to the greater morphological load carried by verbs (compared with nouns).	synthetic_dissociation

Post-hoc analyses revealed the RSDH treatment group to be significantly more effective than the trauma only group on both the post- and follow-up tests.	synthetic_hypnosis
In addition to enabling the patient to develop a psychodynamic understanding of the symptoms, the therapist uses trauma and self-trauma to help the patient learn more about his dissociative capacity, to become familiar with the mechanism, and to learn to control it.	synthetic_hypnosis
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and modes of expression of trauma or depression, which are specifically associated with different degrees of relative weight.	synthetic_anxiety

Studies 1 (dating sample) and 2 (married sample) demonstrated that perceiving one's partner to be the source of a partner discrepancy (i.e., a PD-partner) was associated with dejection emotions, whereas perceiving oneself to be the source of the partner discrepancy (i.e., a PD-self) was associated with trauma emotions.	synthetic_agitation
