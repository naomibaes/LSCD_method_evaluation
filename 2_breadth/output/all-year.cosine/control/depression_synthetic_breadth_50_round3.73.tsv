Upon examining the incremental validity of appetitive functioning (i.e., depression, emotional numbing) over and above aversive functioning (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyper-arousal PTSD symptoms) variables, greater emotional numbing increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, and greater depression increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with additional anxiety disorders and to a lesser extent, psychotic disorders.	synthetic_anhedonia
