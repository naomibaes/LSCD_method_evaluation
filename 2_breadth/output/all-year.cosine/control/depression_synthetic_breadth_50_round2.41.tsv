Charts for 30 patients with mania (23 men and 7 women with mean (+/-SD) age of 68.5(+/- 5.75 years) and 92 with depression (47 men and 45 women with mean (+/-SD) age of 68.18 (+/-6.0 years) were evaluated.	natural
The 5-year outcome for the cases of depression was worse than the outcome of the non-cases (relative mortality risk of 2.1, 95 confidence interval 1.1 to 3.9).	natural
Moreover, reduced depression over the course of the year was uniquely predictive of children's gains in prosocial skills and declines in problem behaviors, as rated by teachers; however, no associations emerged between teacher depression and parent-rated child socioemotional outcomes.	natural
Two meta-analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for depression after mild TBI.	natural
Differences exist in rural-urban population about treatments for depression and stigma towards depression.	natural
Associated algorithms are related to numerous deleterious physical outcomes in older populations, and yet few studies have assessed associations to mental_health outcomes like geriatric depression.	natural
In this study, we examined the mediator effects of overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM) on the relationship between rumination and depression in 323 Chinese university students.	natural
These findings could inform mental_health professionals regarding how to screen adolescent survivors at high risk for depression, so as to provide them with timely and appropriate mental_health services based on the identified risk and protective factors for depressive symptoms.	natural
In this study we used a longitudinal design to test the stress-buffering effects of sex role orientation in combination with perceived social support on measures of trait anxiety and depression.	natural
Studies investigating sleep in bipolar depression suggest that during the depressed phase sleep shows the same stigmata as in unipolar depression.	natural
Generalized linear model results indicated that older age and severe risk for lethality from IPV and PTSD were predictive of certain types of resource use, while education, insurance status, and depression had no influence.	natural
Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants reported higher levels of polyvictimization and trauma-related mental_health symptoms (symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression) compared to non-Hispanic Whites, though the effect sizes were small ( 0.07).	natural
Services wishing to screen for not only possible depression but also possible anxiety should use the generic mood question.	natural
The strong association between history of suicide attempts, current ideation, and depression indicates that past suicide attempts occur in the context of other signs of psychosocial dysfunction.	natural
Light/dark (L/D) box and elevated plus maze (EPM) apparatus were used for investigation of anxiety, shuttle box and forced swimming tests were used to assess passive avoidance learning and memory and depression behavior, respectively.	natural
Does mathematics depression deflect able students from pursuing scientific careers?	synthetic_anxiety
Study 1 showed that the IAT-depression exhibited good internal consistency and adequate stability.	synthetic_anxiety
Those in the treatment group also reported on their experiences using the depression exercises.	synthetic_hypnosis
Responses obtained during and after depression are utilized to uncover underlying conflicts and fears.	synthetic_hypnosis
The results accord with a functional depression between the consciousness-mediated implementation and the consciousness-independent realization of action goals.	synthetic_dissociation
The adolescent copes with this split by forming intrapsychic splits, including a suicidal self and nonsuicidal self, through depression.	synthetic_dissociation
These findings are discussed from the perspective of actor 'confidence' (a depression) possibly associated with visual information, perceived ability, and perceived task demands.	synthetic_cognitive_state
The distinction needs to be drawn between the reproduction of the depression, the form in which the extreme depression is indelibly tattooed on the memory, and actual recalling.	synthetic_trauma
Examples are provided within depression Disorder, Conversion Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_depersonalization
The present investigation developed and tested a new percentile reinforcement schedule suited to study pattern variability, whose main feature was the relative depression it provided between the variability requirement defining criterional responses and overall probability of reinforcement.	synthetic_dissociation
The results showed that both measures of curiosity were positively related to divergent thinking in all three groups studied, but that test-depression was not significantly related to either curiosity or divergent thinking.	synthetic_anxiety
Results revealed that peritraumatic depression, data driven processing, and self referent processing were associated with intrusion development, with lack of self referent processing being a strong predictor of intrusion development.	synthetic_dissociation
Results indicated four latent classes, two of which had relatively high probabilities of endorsing the hallucination and depression indicators.	synthetic_delusion
Samples were selected for each measure and follow-up period from the population of youth receiving services through the Hawaii Child and Adolescent depression Divisions (CAMHD) system of care.	synthetic_mental_health
The mean age for patients listing depression as a first and second choice was significantly lower than patients who chose other modalities or did not respond to this item.	synthetic_hypnosis
Given recent concerns regarding its validity the aim of the present study was to examine the capability of the Competitive State depression Inventory-2(d) (CSAI-2(d)) in distinguishing between anxious and excited states.	synthetic_anxiety
We also discuss the specificity of social anxietytrait relations vis--vis depression and other depression disorders.	synthetic_anxiety
Correlational analyses indicated that the benefits of depression increased substantially over time (r = .74).	synthetic_hypnosis
