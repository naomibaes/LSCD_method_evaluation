The available evidence indicates that alternative means of conceptualizing acute trauma reactions and identifying acutely traumatized people who are at risk of developing PTSD need to be considered.	natural

Working in collaboration with forensic nurses, rape victim advocates, adolescent rape survivors, and our institutional review board (IRB), we created a prospective recruitment method whereby adolescent victims were given information about the evaluation project at the time of postassault treatment services, but data collection was deferred until the trauma of the assault had a chance to diminish.	natural

The distinctiveness of DSM-5 PTSD and depression symptoms following an earthquake suggests that PTSD and depression may be independent sequelae of psychological trauma rather than a manifestation of a single form of psychopathology.	natural
This paper focuses on the intertwinement of society and the psyche as a consequence of 70 years of Communist rule and the trauma of its collapse in the 90's.	natural
The authors consider that the subject of trauma is a good example of how metapsychological constructs (in this case, in particular, the economic or quantitative point of view) originated as essential working hypotheses necessitated by clinical observation.	natural
To examine whether (a) Living in the Face of Trauma (LIFT), a group intervention to address coping with HIV and childhood sexual abuse (CSA), significantly reduced traumatic stress over a 1-year follow-up period more than an attention-matched support group comparison intervention; and (b) reductions in avoidant coping over time mediated reductions in traumatic stress.	natural
To elucidate these issues, in this study we analyzed BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: patients with trauma exposure who developed PTSD, and subjects with trauma exposure who did not develop PTSD.	natural
Thus, it appears that the presence of symptoms associated with a diagnosis of PTSD is important for implicit processing of intimacy stimuli, rather than having a history of sexual trauma alone.	natural
The findings suggest a promising, reliable, and valid measurement of early relational trauma that is reported; furthermore, it is easy to complete and is useful for both research and clinical practice.	natural
We address the long-term effects of these traumatic experiences in addition to trauma re-activation in adulthood as both bear great challenges for professionals working with survivors.	natural
The main intervention consists of exposure to external trauma-associated cues (exposure in vivo) and to mental trauma reminders (exposure in sensu).	natural
