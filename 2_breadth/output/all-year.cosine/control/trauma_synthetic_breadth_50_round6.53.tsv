And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the trauma survivor who always accompanied himthe hidden child I call Harryprovides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the breathtaking conceptualization of what it means to be human, which revolutionized psychoanalytic thinkinga feat that was accomplished through this relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	natural

Therapy with survivors and with their children requires a particular adaptation of analytical technique as what is at stake is not so much the analysis of the here and now of the transference and countertransference dynamics which indeed can in the early stages be counterproductive, but the capacity of the analyst to accept the reality of the trauma with all its devastating and mind-shattering emotions without losing the capacity to imagine and to play metaphorically with images, essential if the patient is to be able to create a space for representation.	natural
Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant and substantial predictor of acute PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior trauma, and prior psychological problems).	natural
