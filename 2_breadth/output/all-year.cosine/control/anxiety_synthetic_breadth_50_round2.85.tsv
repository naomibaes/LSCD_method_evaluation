It has been shown that subjects who do not stop binge eating after an initial structured cognitivebehavioural treatment (CBT) programme benefit from additional CBT (ACBT) sessions; however, it has been suggested that these resistant patients would benefit even more from cue exposure therapy (CET) targeting features associated with poor response (e.g. urge to binge in response to a cue and anxiety experienced in the presence of bingerelated cues).	natural
