But when A was of low salience, the inhibitory potential of X was directly related to the excitatory value of the training context rather than the excitatory value of A. Although the high salience A, relative to the low salience A, overshadowed the context's role as a modulator of responding to Stimulus X, it did not appreciably overshadow context's potential to directly elicit conditioned responding; thus, a anxiety was seen in the ability of a punctate CS to overshadow a context as a function of the behavioral index of overshadowing.	synthetic_dissociation
