The possibility of childhood trauma being reevoked is discussed, and different kinds of identification with the dead baby are presented in the case studies, alongside a resume of Klein's theory of mourning in which there is a dread of harbouring dying or dead objects (especially the parents) inside one, and an identification of the ego with objects in this condition (1935, p. 150), and where the introjection of the maternal object miscarries, and the consequence is illness (1935, p. 146).	natural
