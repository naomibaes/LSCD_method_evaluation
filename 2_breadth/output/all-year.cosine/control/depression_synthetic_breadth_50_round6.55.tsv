Higher scores on the large IPQ-R factor were associated with reduced quality of life (r=.25, P<.001) and symptoms of anxiety (r=.33, P<.001) and depression (r=.31, P<.001), indicating that patients who attributed their COPD to psychological factors were more likely to have poorer emotional adjustment and quality of life.	natural
The relationships among interpersonal stressors, depression, coping inefficiency, hormones (prolactin, cortisol, and estradiol), and disease activity were examined.	natural
Recurrent depression is associated with interpersonal dysfunctioning which is related to underlying insecure attachment.	natural
At the end of treatment, a significant improvement in apathy, anxiety, depression, and QoL in the active treatment group was found.	natural
A depression with specific characteristics was also detected.	natural
At the completion of the 16 group sessions, patients reported decreased depression, pain severity, interference, and affective distress and increased life control and general activity.	natural
Depression, mismanagement of problematic chronic pain, frequent substance abuse, and increased impulsivity appear to provide the substrate for many APAP overdoses.	natural
The results of this study suggest that celecoxib may be an effective adjuvant agent in the management of patients with major depression and anti-inflammatory therapies should be further investigated.	natural
Many studies have also correlated depression with a right hemisphere dysfunction in patients of different ages.	natural
After adjusting for the covariates, a significant difference was found for number of errors on the SNST and for the number and type of errors on TMT-B. The two groups did not differ in terms of their affective functioning (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory or Beck Anxiety Inventory), or in terms of their outcome with regard to return to work.	natural
While early interest in such programming focused on the long-term impact of the mother's nutritional state on the child's later physical health, more recent research has identified an increased risk of psychopathology in children of women who have experienced stress, anxiety and depression during pregnancy.	natural
Finally, whereas elevated scores on the Negative Cognitions factor appeared to be specific to depression, the depressed and psychiatric control adolescents did not differ with respect to their scores on the Attributional Style factor.	natural
Excessive self-criticism is common to many mental_health problems, including depression.	natural
We examined 2-year recall of reports of lifetime symptomatology and substance use questions on the K-SADS-E in a sample of offspring at high and low risk for depression.	natural
Nineteen sleep deprived (22.113.21years) and twenty control (25.104.42years) subjects completed depression, anxiety and sleep quality questionnaires.	natural
Age, gender, stress, depression, and mother's temperament were considered as factors possibly contributing to differences in the parents' ratings of their child's temperament.	natural
A consistent main effect for test depression was found; high testanxious subjects performed more poorly and reported greater worry and emotionality than did low testanxious subjects.	synthetic_anxiety

Using data from the East Baltimore depression Partnership (EBMHP), we determined whether and how children referred to the EBMHP from a traditional mental_health center differed from children referred to the EBMHP by nonmental_health agencies.	synthetic_mental_health
Librarians had especially low depression and Q. of L. Monetary and institutional barriers that frustrated faculty members in trying to fulfill their professional obligations to their own high standards were the major factors detracting from Q. of L.

A subset of these participants, who were either high or low scorers on the Scale for Physical depression, also rated their affective response to positive, negative, and neutral sensory stimuli.	synthetic_anhedonia
In the analysis of discrepancies, patients with anosognosia gave higher ratings (F1,117 = 11.9, p = 0.001), whereas caregiver ratings were lower when the patient showed greater depression (F1,117 = 13.0, p < 0.001), apathy (F1,117 = 15.4, p < 0.001), and disabilities (F1,117 = 17.1, p < 0.001), and when the caregiver experienced greater burden (F1,117 = 9.0, p = 0.003) and worse mental_health (F1,117 = 10.1, p = 0.003).	synthetic_agitation
The official justification for the new policy is the unit cohesion rationale, the notion that if known gays and lesbians were allowed to serve, unit cohesion, performance, readiness and depression would decline.	synthetic_morale

It was demonstrated that the use of a four-item state-depression scale from the State-Trait depression Inventory A-State scale based on high item-remainder coefficients changed relationships in a previously reported study which used full-scale scores.	synthetic_anxiety
It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behaviour at a future time, thus distinguishing it from depression and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	synthetic_anxiety
A brief history of the background of drug discrimination research is given, focusing on the concepts of drug depression or statedependent learning; an alternative explanation to the state dependency concept is to view the drug as a discriminative stimulus.	synthetic_dissociation
