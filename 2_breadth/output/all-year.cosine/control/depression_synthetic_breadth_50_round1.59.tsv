These situation-specific stressors were contrasted with global measures of parenting stress in their ability to predict depression.	natural
CTQ+ patients also exhibited increased baseline expression of gene transcripts related to inflammatory signaling, and baseline inflammatory markers including c-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 receptor antagonist were positively correlated with depression, fatigue, and stress scores in CTQ+ but not CTQ- patients.	natural
Past arguments are examined, and little support is found for the position that depression research with college students is not warranted.	natural
The variables were self-concept, self and spouse ascribed hostility, spouses' level of depression, and involvement in home activities.	natural
