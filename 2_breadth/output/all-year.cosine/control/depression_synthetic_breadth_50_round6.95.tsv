Finally a double depression was observed between explicit beliefs and the evaluative knowledge expressed in the ratings of the drinks, in that none of the children in the CS = Flavor groups evidenced any explicit knowledge about the crucial CS-US' contingency but showed evaluative conditioning, whereas the majority of the children in CS = Color groups were aware of the CS-US' relation but failed to demonstrate an evaluative CS-/CS-differentiation.	synthetic_dissociation
