In patients without psychosis, no correlation was observed between the BPRS-E total score and the GSI score at admission; conversely, at discharge, a statistically significant correlation was found between the BPRS-E total score and the GSI score, and between the BPRS-E depression and anxiety subscale and the BSI subscales investigating affective and neurotic dimensions.	natural

We learn from aesthetics and literary criticism that ambiguity can shade from taut disorganization to tolerating life's richness; clarity can range from a concrete fixity to a lucid grasp of one's depression.	synthetic_state_of_mind

Therefore PEER-U can be a more reliable instrument when studying depression (anxiety) in connection with ultrasound examinations, and as it is specific for this situation it does not appear to be time dependent.	synthetic_state_of_mind
