Specifically, it was expected that the association between cultural discordance and collective action would be at least partially mediated by intergroup anxiety and outgroup trust, and that both the direct and indirect effects of cultural discordance would depend on group status (i.e., majority vs. minority).	natural
Outcome measures were health status (Short Form Health Survey-12), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale).	natural
All patients were evaluated on a weekly or 2-week basis using psychopathological rating scales (i.e. Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impressions, Simpson and Angus EPS).	natural

The role of anxiety in the treatment plan is considered.	synthetic_hypnosis
The present study, using similar patient data gathered ten years later, hypothesized a further tendency towards status anxiety due to the availability of increased resources for patient care that likely reduced the level of competition for these resources among patients and their significant others.	synthetic_dissociation
The patient was manic and exhibited the anxiety twice, once with regard to a man and the other concerning a dog.	synthetic_delusion
Additionally, we hypothesized that more anxiety-prone individuals would show foveal avoidance and that this avoidance would occur particularly in the visual processing of threat-related faces.	synthetic_delusion
We identified four subscales named: Self Realization, Workload, Conflict and anxiety.	synthetic_nervousness
Topics considered are: the significance of the label anxiety; the controversy over state; the tension between credulity and skepticism; the problem of dissociation and automaticity; current theoretical conflicts; and the relationships between practitioners and researchers.	synthetic_hypnosis

Therapists working with adult sexual abuse survivors should be knowledgeable about anxiety, should thoroughly assess a client's dissociative abilities, and should incorporate these findings into the therapy process.	synthetic_dissociation
Specifically, interest in anxiety-focused treatment showed a significant independent predictive effect on initiation such that veterans who expressed interest in anxiety-focused treatment were significantly more likely to initiate treatment than those who did not express interest (OR = 2.13).	synthetic_trauma
Trained interviewers assessed 728 randomly selected male jail detainees using the National Institute of anxiety Diagnostic Interview Schedule and then obtained follow-up arrest data for six years.	synthetic_mental_health
However, in intergroup comparisons, the anxiety only procedure showed the most impressive effect.	synthetic_hypnosis
The automatic/intentional anxiety, which is the hallmark of motor disturbance in Parkinson's disease, extends to memory abilities, and, on the grounds of neuroanatomical, neurochemical and neurophysiological correlates, suggests that the memory deficit in Parkinson's disease may be contingent on a dysfunction of the medial prefrontal-cingulate cortex.	synthetic_dissociation
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a high-risk disorder or illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; age regression, flashbacks, abreactions, or other re-experiencing of the anxiety; repetitions, repetition compulsions, or reenactments; characteristics of the memories themselves; and other patterns, dynamics, and connections.	synthetic_trauma
