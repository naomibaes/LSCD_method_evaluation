Drugs of abuse increase the frequency and magnitude of brief (13s), high concentration (phasic) dopamine release events in terminal regions.	natural
This difficulty may lead to a change in direction away from population screening which looks for individuals at risk, towards the identification of geographic areas where child abuse is persistently concentrated (target areas).	natural
In study I, 100 individuals with TBI were screened for alcohol abuse using the CAGE and the resulting classifications were compared with those derived from the SCID.	natural

Hispanic children more often reported abuse by a parent figure of 1 year or longer in duration and living with the perpetrator.	natural
Individual and contextual risk factors promoting substance abuse are more salient at a younger age in boys compared to girls.	natural
The instruments used for the assessment were the Life Events Checklist, the Suicidal Risk Scale, the Sexual Abuse in Childhood Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Over and beyond the effects of these factors, abuse type significantly contributed to the prediction of credibility judgments.	natural
However, the pathways through which physical abuse and neglect may lead to psychopathological sequelae may be dependent on perceptions of specific parental behavior in different sociocultural contexts.	natural
The current study endeavored to contribute to this body of research by examining associations between experiences of maltreatment and levels of motivation among youth entering outpatient substance abuse treatment.	natural
Coping style was not found to be related to the severity of drug abuse.	natural
Substance abusers often face substantial systematic and personal barriers to receiving required substance abuse treatment services as well as other services; hence, various linkage mechanisms have been proposed for drug abuse treatment programs to overcome such barriers.	natural
In this cross-sectional study of 792 adults, resilience was measured with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, depression with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and other traumas with the Trauma Events Inventory.	natural
Third, a variety of barriers are described that must be addressed if the potential of CAI for enhancing substance abuse prevention efforts is ever to be realized.	natural
All child and adolescent characters were counted and coded for age, role type and incidents of child maltreatment, following US National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS) criteria.	natural

Does the Spiritual Transcendence Scale (STS; R. L. Piedmont, 1999) predict psychosocial outcomes from an outpatient substance abuse program?	natural
Family dysfunction adversities including abuse presented the most consistent associations between chronic adversity and psychopathology and their impact was generally non-specific with regard to the type of disorder.	natural
While all three of these important theories have a number of strengths, each has serious weaknesses that limit its ability to provide a satisfactory explanation of child sexual abuse.	natural
The risk of being abused 3 years post-shelter stay was exacerbated by a number of factors present 1 year prior, including women's having experienced abuse in the 6 months before that point; having difficulties accessing resources; having problems with the state welfare system; and having people in their social networks who made their lives difficult.	natural
We also found that the association between physical abuse history and responsive parenting operated indirectly through maternal depressive symptoms.	natural
Based on the fear appeal literature, it was predicted that a fear-arousing message opposing alcohol abuse would be more effective when it attributed alcoholism to maladaptive learning than when alcoholism was attributed to an incurable disease, while with a low fear message these causal attributions might have opposite effects.	natural
Although collaboration in child abuse investigations has been emphasized since 1974, barriers, including role conflicts and organizational differences, have often been reported.	natural
Differences between the groups suggest that depression in adult life may be related to parental rejection and control through techniques such as abuse, negative evaluation, and withdrawal of affection during childhood.	synthetic_derision
But in their dispassionate and muted character, walkouts supply perhaps the strongest evidence of a setting that curtails the expression of personal anger and abuse.	synthetic_annoyance
This implies that the effect of numerical male dominance on sexual abuse may be mediated by the level of normative male dominance in the work environment.	synthetic_harassment
Both older adolescents (1416) and their parents displayed increased avoidance in the form of reciprocated abuse.	synthetic_contempt

These attitudes appeared to converge in a sexist belief system that was linked to personal experiences, the perceived probability of experiencing and fear of sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment
In explaining their preferences, sexual minorities often emphasized gender socialization considerations (e.g., their perceived inability to socialize a child of the opposite gender) and concerns about heterosexism (e.g., some gay men preferred girls because they felt a boy would encounter more abuse).	synthetic_harassment
Previous research has suggested that underrepresentation of one's gender in the employment context increases risk for sex-based abuse.	synthetic_harassment
Ethical practice consists in following guidelines and codes of ethical conduct designed, not so much to avoid these power differentials, but to protect research participants from potential abuse and infringements of their human rights.	synthetic_exploitation
One hundred nineteen male participants read hypothetical abuse scenarios and responded to Bartling and Eisenmans (1993, Sexual abuse proclivities in men and women.	synthetic_harassment
School-based sexual abuse of adolescent girls by boys appears commonplace, yet aggression and bullying studies rarely yield sexualized material.	synthetic_harassment
The authors also found that abuse may develop out of previously experienced anger and that a lack of intimacy with and perceived control over the behavior of the other person, as well as negative dispositional attributions about the other person, predicted the emergence of abuse.	synthetic_contempt
We critically review the published research on sexual abuse.	synthetic_harassment
We provide evidence that abuse is not an emotion, nor an attitude, but a reactive defensive mechanism evolved to help individuals avoid shame.	synthetic_contempt

I intend to argue that although born into an orthodox family and brought up in strict purdah without any formal education, Rokeya had that rare foresight and courage to challenge the social status quo of her time and abuse many of the outmoded gender practices in her writings, and even turn gender relations upside down by creating a Ladyland in her utopian narrative Sultanas Dream ([1905], 1908), in which men are confined to indoors while women run the state.	synthetic_ridicule
