The aim of the current study was to identify individual characteristics that (a) predict symptom improvement with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD; i.e., prognostic variables) or (b) moderate the effects of d-cycloserine (DCS) versus placebo augmentation of CBT for SAD (i.e., prescriptive variables).	natural

We conclude that the CDI is an effective instrument for screening depression and to a lesser extent anxiety in primary and secondary care centers, before applying further assessment of high-risk individuals.	natural
University students (N = 225) first completed a scale to identify names of their significant attachment figures (WHOTO) and self-report measures of attachment anxiety and avoidance and were then administered a computerized signal detection task assessing their cognitive attentional performance under conditions of threat and attachment figure availability priming.	natural
Moreover, evidence was found for effects of biased interpretations on anxiety.	natural
Results of the few anxiety behavior assessments were fairly consistent, at least in rat studies.	natural
These results provide evidence for the applicability of the cognitive social anxiety model to children.	natural
Moscovitch provides creative ways of thinking about feared stimuli and maladaptive methods for anxiety management used by clients with social phobia, and these notions may indeed expand our horizons, linking cognitive-behavioral thought to literatures on emotional suppression and emotion regulation.	natural
Participants in the treatment group improved significantly more than participants in the control group from pre-to post-treatment on measures of headaches, depression, anxiety, and quality of life.	natural
Preliminary studies have implicated childhood exposure to parental problem drinking as a possible factor in the development of anxiety sensitivity (AS).	natural
Results are discussed in terms of extant theory and research on anxiety vulnerability among adolescents.	natural
Our findings supported the 'core process' account that had its origins in the field of anxiety disorders, and we discuss the implications for theory, clinical practice and future research across psychological disorders.	natural
Correcting patients' faulty beliefs concerning social evaluative threats is the hallmark of cognitive-behavioral treatment of social anxiety disorder.	natural
Further, those in the high anxiety sensitivity group are at increased risk of having high levels of anxiety and of having an anxiety disorder.	natural
We used self-report questionnaires to assess energy drink consumption and mental_health (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21; DASS-21) at the 20-year cohort follow-up.	natural
Using the MINI, 17 of participants were identified with either depression, anxiety disorders or adjustment disorder and 18 with substance or alcohol abuse/dependence.	natural
Neither delusions nor anxiety predicted greater treatment response.	synthetic_agitation
METH abusers show a paranoid schizophrenia-like syndrome, including paranoid hallucination and anxiety, and repeated exposure to these drugs will enhance their effects; i.e. the behavioral and reinforcing effects of abusing drugs became progressively and irreversibly developed (behavioral sensitization) in humans and in experimental animals.	synthetic_delusion
These contributions lead to a better understanding of the importance of depressive affect in phallic-oedipal conflicts, similarities and differences between such conflicts in boys and girls, anxiety as a symptom in adult life, and some aspects of narcissism.	synthetic_depression
Results indicated BED women were more likely to negatively evaluate their global physical appearance and have less satisfaction with specific areas of the body than were non-BED women, even after controlling for anxiety scores.	synthetic_depression
A patient in psychotherapy may vary in his ability to understand the therapist, and to express this thoughts, as he moves from one anxiety to another.	synthetic_state_of_mind
These results suggest that 7 days of SSRI administration can increase neural markers of fear reactivity in subjects at the high end of the N dimension and may be related to early increases in anxiety and anxiety seen early in treatment.	synthetic_agitation
The results indicate that a combined therapy with amitriptyline and citalopram may be particularly beneficial for patients with TTH, migraine and comorbid anxiety that do not respond to monotherapy.	synthetic_depression
This thrust has been carried forward in subsequent work embodied in the ninth standard of the National Service Framework for Mental Health [Department of Health (1999), London: HMSO] and Safety First: FiveYear Report of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with anxiety [Department of Health (2001), London: HMSO].	synthetic_mental_illness

Questions of a diagnostic nature also serve to complicate this kind of research still further, in this present review in particular, when it deals with anxiety and/or anxiety.	synthetic_depression
There was also an understandable relationship between difficulty identifying feelings (TAS) and both anxiety/derealization and absorption (DES).	synthetic_depersonalization
Baseline and 12-month data were obtained from participants within the Australian Rural anxiety Study, a longitudinal study of community residents within rural and remote New South Wales, Australia.	synthetic_mental_health
A controversy in gerontology has centered on the relative abilities of men and women to adapt to growing older in society: while some claim that women suffer less anxiety because of their smoother life cycle from birth to death, recent critics suggest that repeated role inconsistency rather than continuity is a key to female adaptation.	synthetic_trauma
The results of both these studies tentatively support the views that beliefs about the coercive powers of anxiety can influence judgments about guilt and innocence in trials in which hypnotic automatism is pleaded as a defence, and, for those who are hypnotically susceptible, an experience of anxiety tends to make participants more sceptical about the coercive powers of anxiety.	synthetic_hypnosis
Both experimental Ss and delya controls reported a significant decrease in anxiety from pre- to posttest.	synthetic_depression
Analyses of variance were conducted to investigate differences between the groups, and Spearman's rank-based correlations were used to examine the correlations between coping factors and the dimensions of anxiety.	synthetic_delusion
Most notably, the bulimics reported feelings of irritability, anxiety, tenseness and depression which persisted 30 minutes later.	synthetic_nervousness
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to anxiety.	synthetic_trauma

On the contrary, pharmacotherapy with either fluoxetine or TCAs was typically associated with diminished anxiety, probably as part of the response pattern of depression.	synthetic_agitation
The moderate exercise programme led to significant improvements in aerobic fitness, and was associated with significantly greater reductions in tension-anxiety, anxiety and other moods than the attention-placebo condition, together with increases in perceived ability to cope with stress.	synthetic_depression
