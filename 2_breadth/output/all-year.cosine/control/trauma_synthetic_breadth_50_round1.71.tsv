Changes in anxiety as a personality trait was found, indicative of the potential long-term effects of psychological trauma.	natural
This study investigated the relationship between trauma survivors' goals and retrieval of self-defining memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Therapy with survivors and with their children requires a particular adaptation of analytical technique as what is at stake is not so much the analysis of the here and now of the transference and countertransference dynamics which indeed can in the early stages be counterproductive, but the capacity of the analyst to accept the reality of the trauma with all its devastating and mind-shattering emotions without losing the capacity to imagine and to play metaphorically with images, essential if the patient is to be able to create a space for representation.	natural
Subjects were 5 parkinsonian patients, two patients with skull trauma and an epileptic, diagnosed and treated with implanted electrodes.	natural
Parents appraisals and parent coaching of avoidant coping were measured via self-report measures and a new observational assessment (Trauma Ambiguous Situations Task; TAST).	natural

In experiment 1, a significant CU traits-by-trauma exposure interaction was observed within right amygdala; fear intensity-modulated amygdala responses predicted CU traits for those youth with low levels of trauma but predicted CU traits for those with high levels of trauma.	natural
Exploratory analyses indicated that PTSD symptom severity and the interpersonal nature of the trauma were related to thematic disruption.	natural
To examine the connection between trauma memory integration in personal memory, memory organization, and posttraumatic symptom severity, 47 trauma-exposed adults undertook an event-cuing task for their trauma memory and for a memorable nontraumatic negative event.	natural
At the core of this compulsion is a psychic hole, a gap in the child's emotional understanding, stemming from identification with the parents on one hand, and the parents' denial or repression of the trauma on the other.	natural
This study compares trauma responses in firefighters and paramedics who have been questioned in postmortem inquiries following a critical event in the work-place and those who have not.	natural
The sample consisted of 102 individuals who met strict criteria for an eating disorder, and who were interviewed regarding trauma history and comorbid impulsive behaviours.	natural
Recent research has shown that experiencing trauma in childhood may have a significant effect on school performance, particularly in the occupational performance areas of education, social participation, and play.	natural
Combined, the findings show that altered hippocampal function exists before experiencing emotional trauma in susceptible rats and suggest that this is a risk factor for PTSD.	natural
The present study suggests that individual differences should be taken into account in the clinical course and outcome of children exposed to psychological trauma.	natural
One potentially important construct for understanding connections between trauma and PTSD is attachment.	natural
We assume that SF1 in the pain patients reflected a rather serious, undefined early psychic trauma and was also associated with their depressiveness.	natural
Our analysis indicated significant differences between trauma and no trauma groups.	natural
Possible reasons for the effectiveness of EMDR are discussed, ranging from the fundamental nature of trauma reactions to the nonexposure mechanisms utilized in information processing models.	natural
Both trauma groups had significantly lower performances than the community group on prospective memory (d=0.82 to 1.18), attention set-shifting (d=-0.61 to -0.69), and physical quality of life measures (d=0.67 to 0.84).	natural
The sibling attacks were adaptive for the abusers in the following ways: (a) They afforded them a measure of revenge against the more highly regarded sibling rival; (b) they served as an outlet for rage directed towards the mother; (c) they were used as an attention getting device; (d) they provided a sense of mastery over the trauma of their own abuse; and (e) were used to educate the abusing parent.	natural
Study results showed that residential care programs are primarily implementing EBPs that target specific client problems and populations and address prevalent problems of trauma and emotional disorders.	natural
Research traditionally has focused on the development of symptoms in those who experienced trauma directly but has overlooked the impact of trauma on the families of victims.	natural
Furthermore, trauma history and psychiatric symptoms were retrospectively reported, introducing the possibility of recall bias.	natural
The mean (95 confidence interval [CI]) change from the acute phase baseline in the Factor I score of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), which includes somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, and trauma, was calculated at the OLE baseline and at various time points up to 156 weeks.	synthetic_depression
Using three-step HMRs, the strongest prediction was for maternal sensitivity where 54 of the total variance in maternal sensitivity was explained by maternal education, AAI classification, and AAI 'trauma' scales.	synthetic_state_of_mind
Distinctive features of the adolescent view of illness and their treatment repercussions include the growing sense of independence, with possible compliance problems; a better grasp of the meaning of chronic illness and of the passage of time, with a greater potential for reactive trauma secondary to illness; and impulsive behavior, with a desire for fast results that can mean impatience with long-term treatment.	synthetic_depression
In separate adjusted models, trauma symptoms predicted mortality (BDI-II HR = 1.03 95 CI 1.01, 1.04; PHQ-9 HR = 1.04 95 CI 1.01, 1.06).	synthetic_depression
Here, we describe a case of trauma in a 32-year-old man who was brought to mental hospital with complete loss of memory for events pertaining to identity of self.	synthetic_fugue
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck trauma Inventory yielded factors similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	synthetic_depression
Approximately half the experimental subjects rolled their eyes upwards to a greater extent when trauma was induced than during eye closure while awake.	synthetic_hypnosis
The neuropsychological principle of double trauma was supported not just by such active associations but also by the silence of locations not previously implicated by the literature.	synthetic_dissociation
Mothers made observational judgements of their children, their own feelings of trauma, and the valences of their interactions with adults.	synthetic_depression
Employee trauma and confidence in top management plummeted.	synthetic_morale
Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical trauma and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia
In addition, trauma, psychiatric, and side-effects symptoms decreased significantly in both groups.	synthetic_agitation
This configuration was more pronounced in the group of widowed people because of their notable isolation, lack of motivation, and strong emotional reactions of trauma, which, together with their high rate of negative coping behaviors (e.g., ceasing to seek solutions and social support), are risk factors for trauma, mood disorders, and anxiety as well as avoidant or depressive personality traits.	synthetic_depression
Interpretations of this result in terms of emotional processing in social trauma are discussed.	synthetic_anhedonia
At the higher concentration, a significant decrease in perceived intensity was observed over time for trauma, but not for cooling.	synthetic_irritation
Performing a transfer function analysis on our monthly data set, we reveal positive feedback from Fenerbahes success, which proxies workers mood/trauma, to economic performance such that the monthly industrial growth rate increases by 0.26 with the number of games won by Fenerbahe in European cups regardless of where the game is played.	synthetic_morale
The NPI total and trauma subscale scores were significantly higher in dementia patients with delirium than in those without delirium.	synthetic_agitation
This multisystem approach included three core strategies: defining the membership of families in a culturally appropriate fashion and engaging those members; engaging the healthcare team; and building and maintaining the skills and trauma of the research staff.	synthetic_morale
On the trauma over abandonment dimension, husbands with higher scores were rated less aggressive, less controlling, and more rebellious, whereas wives with higher scores were rated more dependent, more self-critical, and less competitive.	synthetic_anxiety
The key findings were: (a) higher levels of satisfaction were found amongst manual sorters and those spending 5075 of their time in code-sorting; (b) stress is closely related to satisfaction in the code-sort group but not in the manual group; (c) in manual groups and in supervisors stress was manifested in fatigue, but in the code-sort group stress took the form of trauma.	synthetic_anxiety
Participants (115) were assigned either to the imagination (trauma labeled as imagination) or the trauma conditions.	synthetic_hypnosis
