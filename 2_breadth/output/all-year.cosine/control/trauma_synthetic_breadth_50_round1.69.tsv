In running a group for adolescent girls with histories of exposure to violence and loss, it has been useful to superimpose three approaches to understanding trauma: the American exploration of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) phenomena, the British application of Kleinian theory to working with traumatized patients at the Tavistock Clinic's trauma unit, and the South American Kleinian conceptualization of witness and impunity, which roots trauma work in a political and moral matrix.	natural
Psychological research has documented several predictors of aggression, including adherence to hegemonic masculinity, trauma symptoms, and insecure attachment.	natural

I suspect that societal interpellation maintains trauma more than it causes it, that family dynamics are hidden in societal discourse, and that a clinician who draws out this perspective, as appropriate, gains credibility and provides relief in the provision of safety essential for the dissociative mind to change its modus operandi and be less isolated from self and other.	synthetic_depersonalization
Our empirical trauma also demonstrates that cue-task transition congruency affects performance during both cue processing and task processing.	synthetic_dissociation
