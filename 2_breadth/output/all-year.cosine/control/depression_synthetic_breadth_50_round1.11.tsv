Depression and anxiety are observed in pregnant women with previous foetal loss due to spontaneous abortions.	natural
However, mothers' symptoms over time were not related to medical aspects of IDDM (i.e., the extent of the children's metabolic control, number of rehospitalizations, or their compliance with the medical regimen) and were also unrelated to the levels of depression or anxiety reported by their children.	natural
This study also reveals that 84 of the respondents experience medium level of depression and also suggest that age and experience significantly influence the overall stress and depression experienced by the employees.	natural
The optimal screening cut-off score for depression was 7 for the HADS depression subscale (HADS-D), 14 for the HADS-total, 11 for the CDI and 17 for the BDI.	natural

Most participants had subthreshold mania and depression symptoms, indicated by HAMD21 Total 13.4+/-8.6, CGI-BP Depression 3.2+/-1.3, YMRS Total 8.2+/-8.5 and CGI-BP Mania 3.0+/-1.6 average scores.	natural
This study aims to examine how family social capital mediates the relationship between poverty and children's anxiety and depression in mainland China.	natural
Higher doses of prednisone were associated with a worse quality of life and with more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety after transplantation.	natural
We employed immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting to quantify protein expression of BDNF and TrkB in the cerebellum of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression compared to controls (n=15 each).	natural
This finding may not be related to the ECT per se but rather to the resolution of depression, as there was a significant correlation between the decrease in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and decrease in parasympathetic activity.	natural
Patients' BDI scores correlated significantly more strongly with a clinician-administered measure of depression than with self-report measures of generalized anxiety, worry, social anxiety, or anxiety sensitivity, but not more strongly than with a clinician-administered measure of anxiety.	natural
Nevertheless, the studies are consistent with at least a 35 prevalence of, and left frontal damage with depression after MTBI, an overlap of symptoms of depression and Postconcussion Syndrome (PCS), and indicate that depression can continue for many years following the injury.	natural
While these measures are widely used, there is evidence of specific weaknesses in some cohorts and contexts, with the GDS-15 showing limitations in the context of cognitive impairment (Gilley and Wilson, 1997), and the depression subscale of the HADS (HADS-D) losing sensitivity in the context of older participants in hospital inpatient settings (Davies , 1993).	natural
Self-reflection and self-rumination, in turn, predicted depression.	natural
This study prospectively examined associations among multiple theoretically informed risk (e.g., depression, sexual sensation seeking, and risky peers norms) and protective factors (e.g., social support, STI knowledge, and refusal to have sex self efficacy) on unsafe sex among 715 African American adolescent females aged 15-21 who participated in an STI/HIV prevention intervention.	natural
Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors.	natural
Furthermore, the improvement rates in depression scores in between the two groups were almost identical (SDD versus MDD).	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of depression and factors associated with depressive mood among pregnant women.	natural
The effect sizes were of the same magnitude as those from efficacy studies of group-based cognitive behavioural interventions for adolescent depression.	natural
Patients with BD showed statistically significant higher affective depression factor scores than those with MDD (Z = 2.215, P = .027), whereas there was no between-groups difference in anhedonia scores (Z = 0.825 P = .411).	synthetic_depersonalization
The illness is very similar in the two anorectic groups; they show comparable levels of sexual depression, and self-injury rates (35) are equal.	synthetic_anxiety
The present study examined sleep-related problems (SRPs) among a large sample (n = 128) of youth with depression disorders (i.e., generalized, separation, and social).	synthetic_anxiety
This study examined the hypothesis that, in schizophrenia, elevated trait social depression (SA) is a stable individual difference, whereas in depression, increased SA is a reflection of a current clinical state that will diminish with recovery.	synthetic_anhedonia
Statistical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of depression for the reduction of anticipatory nausea and vomiting.	synthetic_hypnosis
Finally, I consider three specific problem-solving strategies: improving depression, opening communication, and expanding professional education to include death studies and psychological study of the health organization.	synthetic_morale

Examination of the direction and magnitude of change in functioning revealed that S.S.GRIN increased peer liking, enhanced self-esteem and self-efficacy, and decreased social depression compared to controls.	synthetic_anxiety
The structure referred to could be either in the mind (a depression, for example), in writing (a constitution or management structure), or in building and land, or in a combination of any of these.	synthetic_state_of_mind
Preventing avoidable unhappiness, however, needs to be complemented with other strategies for promoting happiness, perhaps on a more decentralized level, given the different causes of bliss and that of depression.	synthetic_misery
These results underline the importance of the shift to right hemispheric activity in depression and underscore the importance of hemispheric changes in shaping subjective experience.	synthetic_hypnosis
Although Erickson did not postulate a theory of depression or of human functioning, the work of Ericksonian hypnotherapists can be seen to embody a common epistemology or way of thinking about depression and about treatment.	synthetic_hypnosis
A reversal design was employed to demonstrate the functional relationship between depression and eating.	synthetic_anxiety
A differential semiological analysis in relation to three conceptual pairs, chosen because of their key positions (depression-excitation, motor weakness-dyspraxia, personality problems-psychopathy) shows that it's sometimes impossible to clearly separate instability-hyperkinesia from these other concepts, insofar as they have been blown out of proportion and deformed.	synthetic_agitation
Enhanced procedural learning has been evidenced in conditions where cognitive control is diminished, including depression, disruption of prefrontal activity and non-optimal time of the day.	synthetic_hypnosis
Women suffering from the premenstrual syndrome had significantly higher levels of 'trait' depression (STAI), 'neuroticism' (EPI-B), and more negative attitudes towards their bodies, genitals, sex and masturbation, as measured by a 'Role Acceptance Scale'.	synthetic_anxiety
Ratings of depth of depression were also obtained.	synthetic_hypnosis
The other two scales Introvertive depression and Impulsive Nonconformity showed no association with Barnum susceptibility.	synthetic_anhedonia
These findings demonstrate a depression of stress behaviors in the chick social-separation-stress procedure: the stress-induced analgesia response is primarily mediated by novelty to the test apparatus while the distress vocalizations response is mediated by separation from conspecifics.	synthetic_dissociation
