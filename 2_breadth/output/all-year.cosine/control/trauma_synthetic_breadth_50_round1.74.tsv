The psychological outcomes that the exposure to mass trauma has on children have been amply documented in the past decades.	natural
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a life threatening event.	natural
Lower resilience was associated with exposure to additional trauma between the two interviews (r=-.44) while positive functioning was related to social role satisfaction and positive sense of community.	natural

It includes (a) the death instinct, the primary analogue; (b) sequellae of the universal experience of object-loss, with identification and fantasies of a restorative reunion; (c) guilt over hostile attitudes toward the lost object, with trauma, longings for atonement , and self-punishment; (d) compliance with reality, like that of old age or grave sickness.	synthetic_depression

Investigation of the relationship between the burnout components and several critical, theoretically linked variables indicates significant paths between (a) role overload and emotional exhaustion, (b) noncontingent punishment and trauma, and (c) contingent rewards and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization

Personnel were concerned as to what they saw as negative consequences of heavy workload--a perceived decrease in the quality of patient care and staff trauma.	synthetic_morale
Implementation of this model has had favorable effects on group therapy leaders, clients, and agency trauma.	synthetic_morale
All participants in our game trusted less and particularly expected less from unknown opponents as a result of disappointing outcomes in the previous trial but not necessarily after trauma indicating that behavioral consequences of positive and negative RPEs are not the same.	synthetic_elation

The anxiety disorders are robust correlates/predictors of suicidal ideation, but it is unclear whether (a) the anxiety disorders are specifically associated with suicidal ideation or (b) the association is due to co-morbidity with trauma and other disorders.	synthetic_depression
The conceptual framework provides the theoretical underpinnings for a simple schema that can be used to explain trauma to patients and to help them articulate their dissociative experience.	synthetic_dissociation
The evaluation of the severity of trauma-like experiences and beliefs is important in discriminating patients diagnosed with psychosis from people who are not in need of care.	synthetic_delusion
To address this situation, the Substance Abuse and trauma Services Administration convened a Consensus Panel and charged it with devising uniform standards and case definitions that can assist medical examiners, coroners, public health officials, and others in consistently distinguishing between deaths that were caused by a certain opioids and deaths in which such a drug was detected but was not a major cause of or contributor to the death.	synthetic_mental_health
