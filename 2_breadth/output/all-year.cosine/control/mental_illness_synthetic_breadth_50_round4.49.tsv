The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between different dimensions of RSWB, magical thinking as an indicator of schizotypy and Eysencks three personality factors (psychoticism, extraversion, neuroticism), as there might be facets of RSWB also linked to mental_illness (e.g. delusional ideas).	natural
None of them was correlated nor with organic lesions or medical seriousness, neither with psychopathic background, previous mental_illness or treatment by corticoidic drugs.	natural
The mental_illness between pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal activity is illustrated by data from a monotonous vigilance task inducing both effort and distress, and a concomitant increase of adrenalin as well as cortisol excretion, and a self-paced reaction time task inducing effort but no distress, and a concomitant increase in adrenalin but decrease in cortisol excretion.	synthetic_dissociation

The present study examined the internal psychometrics of primary measures of social mental_illness and social closeness; the bivariate association between social mental_illness and social closeness; and the associations between these target constructs and measures of individual differences in a large sample of undergraduate students (mean age = 20.53 years; 76.3 were women).	synthetic_anhedonia

The results of a series of regression and correlation analyses led to the following major conclusions: Globality, intentionality, and stability may be dropped from attributional models of mental_illness, loneliness, and shyness with little loss of predictive power; controllability is the single most important dimension in predicting a person's level of mental_illness, loneliness, or shyness; locus adds to the prediction of these symptoms only w hen assessed by failure items; and attributional style predicts these symptoms especially well when it is assessed by the type of situation items that are particularly relevant to the symptom.	synthetic_depression

mental_illness is a fundamental feature of depression, and assessment of stressor-related reductions in the rewarding value of brain stimulation, especially when coupled with other potential symptoms of depression, provides considerable face, construct and predictive validity.	synthetic_anhedonia
