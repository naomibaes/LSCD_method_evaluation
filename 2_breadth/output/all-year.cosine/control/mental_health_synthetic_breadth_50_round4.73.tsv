Regression analyses demonstrated that greater ICV was significantly related to poorer overall mental_health ( = 0.25, p = .009), whereas poorer sleep did not reach significance ( = 0.16, p = .069).	natural
Overall, the point prevalence of the investigated psychiatric disorders and mental_health problems varied widely among studies (presenting interquartile ranges): for posttraumatic stress disorder between 19.0 and 52.7, for depression between 10.3 and 32.8, for anxiety disorders between 8.7 and 31.6, and for emotional and behavioural problems between 19.8 and 35.0.	natural
