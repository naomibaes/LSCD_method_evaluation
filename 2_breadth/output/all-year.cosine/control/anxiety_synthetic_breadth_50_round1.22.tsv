However, anxiety (partial R2 = .21) and fatigue (partial R2 = .19) both demonstrated strong explanatory power for emotional HRQoL. In addition, depression demonstrated weak explanatory power for HRQoL including emotional HRQoL. Relative to depression and anxiety, fatigue exerted a stronger effect on lung cancer survivors' HRQoL. Health professionals should consider the reduction of fatigue a priority in improving cancer patients' HRQoL following the completion of cancer treatment.	natural
