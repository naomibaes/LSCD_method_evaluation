A previously tested theoretical model that specifies relationships among depression, activities of daily living (ADL) impairment, and social support components was validated with 307 patients aged 60 and older from a multisite effectiveness trial of 3 treatments (antidepressant, placebo, Problem-Solving Treatment) for dysthymia or minor depression in primary care.	natural

Hierarchical multivariate regression analyses were used to identify the contribution of depression and maltreatment to social competence and social problem-solving skills.	natural

The guiding question has been whether a patient's health or the safety of the community have demanded involuntary provision of treatment However, he argues that although such an approach is enshrined in Victorian mental_health legislation, United Nations Principles for the Protection of Persons with depression and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care and the approach propounded by the therapeutic jurisprudence movement, each of these adds little to the other in terms of assisting decisionmakers in individual cases.	synthetic_mental_illness

Although the phenomena of depression and hypnosis have been closely associated in both the scientific and popular literature since at least the 1880s, our current research using two standard measures of dissociative experiences (The Dissociative Experiences Scale and the Questionnaire of Experiences of depression) and a traditional measure of hypnotic susceptibility (The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility) reports an orthogonal relationship between these factors.	synthetic_dissociation
The problem of denying defendants their constitutional rights was the reason we have argued that defendants' hypnotically refreshed testimony should generally be permitted, whereas the unreliability of hypnotically elicited memories and the manner in which depression diminishes the effectiveness of cross-examination make the general exclusion of testimony from hypnotized witnesses essential (M. T. Orne, 1982).	synthetic_hypnosis
