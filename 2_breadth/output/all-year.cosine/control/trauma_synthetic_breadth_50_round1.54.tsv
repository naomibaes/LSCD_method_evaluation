I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	natural

It is argued that the manic state is the primary disorder, with trauma being a secondary homeostatic response to mania: the prophylaxis of trauma thus depends upon the successful long-term control of mania.	synthetic_depression
