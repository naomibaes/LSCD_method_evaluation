While 45 to 51 of respondents from developed countries believed that mental_illness was similar to physical illness, only 7 believed that mental_illness could be overcome.	natural
Recent studies have demonstrated that specific diagnostic categories of mental_illness have implications for treatment outcomes of dually disordered patients, but a diagnostic standard has not emerged.	natural
Clinical and legal research on the meaning of mental_illness and on definitions (and predictions) of dangerousness continue to offer the mental_health law arena mostly disappointing results.	natural
Based on the developing clinical and legal literature, and using the framework adopted in draft legislation, capacity to make a valid decision about a clinically required blood test was investigated in three groups of people with a 'mental disability' (i.e. mental_illness (chronic schizophrenia), 'learning disability' ('mental retardation', or intellectual or developmental disability), or, dementia) and a fourth, comparison group.	natural

Mothers with severe post-natal mental_illness can be admitted with their infant to a psychiatric mother and baby unit (MBU) in the UK.	natural
In Study 1, the effects of severe mental_illness as well as overall level of burden on retention in treatment were examined.	natural
A sociocultural context suggests that concepts of sexuality, addiction, and mental_illness take on different meanings throughout history, and all these categories are subjective and value laden.	natural
The degree to which the mental_health services are utilized depends partly on the public's views about mental_illness and the public's perceptions about the roles of the providers of the services.	natural
This paper is the second in a series of three concerning the person-centered approach to severe mental_illness.	natural
These findings discuss characteristics of persons with mental_illness, as they relate to the likelihood of completing diversion programming.	natural
The perinatal or early life environment may influence the development of mental_illness in adulthood.	natural
The relationship between stigmatization and the self-regard of patients/consumers with mental_disorder is negative but only moderate in strength, probably because a subset of persons with mental_illness resists devaluation and discrimination by others.	natural
The central symptom in the case history is the mental_illness that the patient has already lived through this life once.	synthetic_delusion
Several studies have suggested that 'anomalous parenting', as measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), may be a differential risk factor to subsequent mental_illness in adulthood--being irrelevant to melancholia but over-represented in non-melancholic depressive disorders.	synthetic_depression
Depressive symptoms assessed by the Beck mental_illness Inventory were compared in 97 cancer patients, 66 next-of-kin of cancer patients, and 99 physically healthy persons who attempted suicide.	synthetic_depression
Consistency of these findings with proposals suggesting that exposure to inescapable shock leads to a state of animal mental_illness (learned helplessness) is discussed and compared to alternative stress explanations.	synthetic_depression
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that mental_illness content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion
In Study 3, 16 college-aged actresses participated in mental_illness and sadness mood inductions as in Study 1.	synthetic_elation
mental_illness with respect to attachment did not differentiate between diagnostic subgroup and eating disorder pathology.	synthetic_state_of_mind
Clinical data showed that patients high on self-repudiation have a greater tendency toward withdrawal and mental_illness, whereas those low on this dimension were characterized by anti-social behavior.	synthetic_depression
A 72-year-old man with esophageal cancer who could not sit down or stand up was administered 5 mg/day haloperidol to relieve mental_illness as a symptom of major depressive disorder.	synthetic_agitation
The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure different facets of mental_illness.	synthetic_anxiety
Therapists responses to suicidal patients include: anxiety, increased interest, restraint, mental_illness, avoidance, denial, and passivity.	synthetic_irritation
Recognition of this dual quality of mental_illness seems helpful in psychodynamic treatment, which allows for analysis of the defense and analysis of the content of these states.	synthetic_dissociation
However, the present sample showed a striking excess of males among the unipolar manics, as well as an increased morbid risk for unipolar mental_illness in first-degree relatives.	synthetic_depression

More careful attention to these specific elements--regardless of debriefers' training and backgrounds--might improve therapeutic consistency for mental_illness victims afflicted with stress-related symptoms.	synthetic_trauma
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize mental_illness and anger, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	synthetic_anxiety
In the last century psychopathologists attached importance to the concept of mental_illness, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.	synthetic_anhedonia
Scores on the measure were found to be correlated with trait mental_illness, age, the Experience Seeking subscale of the Sensation Seeking Scale, general neophobia, and general familiarity and experience with unusual foods.	synthetic_anxiety
The proposed theory assumes that a decision maker: behaves as if maximizing expected utility; but may experience disappointment (mental_illness) when the utility of a lotterys outcome falls short of (exceeds) the expected utility of the lottery; and may have a preference for gambling (attraction/aversion to positively/negatively skewed lotteries).	synthetic_elation
The present study examined the relationship between different forms of childhood trauma and eating psychopathology using a multiple mediation model that included emotion dysregulation and mental_illness as hypothesised mediators.	synthetic_dissociation
The first group also completed a questionnaire on their background in mathematics; the second, the Suinn Test mental_illness Behavior Scale (STABS).	synthetic_anxiety

The revised Physical mental_illness Scale score significantly correlated with depressive mood, self-depreciation, pathological guilt and observed depression.	synthetic_anhedonia
Age, minutes spent giving physical care, appraisal of work tasks, and reaction to patient behavior, explained mental_illness.	synthetic_depersonalization
