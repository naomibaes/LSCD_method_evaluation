The posttreatment scores on the Beck Depression Inventory of 82 of the group receiving cognitive behavioral therapy improved to a Beck Depression Inventory score < or = 9 which was not significantly greater than that for the group receiving relaxation training (73), so a unique effect was not demonstrated for cognitive behavioral therapy.	natural

As for depression levels, except course load, all variables in the model made significant contribution to the prediction equation, which was proven significant with a smaller variance compared to emotional exhaustion.	synthetic_depersonalization
