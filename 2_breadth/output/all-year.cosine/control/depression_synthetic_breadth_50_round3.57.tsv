Significant findings were that depressed females reported significantly more appetite increase, weight gain and carbohydrate craving, and in general, expressed their depression in a more emotional manner, than depressed males.	natural
The pilots manifested more pathology than nonpilots for the significant data, as evidenced by significantly higher scores on the Hypochondriasis, Depression, Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Social Introversion-Extroversion scales.	natural
A multiple logistic regression analysis estimated the odds ratios for having a lifetime diagnosis of depression.	natural
Sixteen patients with a moderate or severe anxiety and/or depression one year after stoma surgery were compared with 52 patients who had made a good psychiatric adjustment.	natural
Subsequent multiple regression analyses revealed that when controlling for pretreatment depression severity, depressive personality was not a predictor of depression treatment outcome.	natural
Participation in SKY adjunct therapy ten days intense workshop and follow-ups, coupled with daily individual and independent practice of a simplified protocol of breathing techniques (30 min), can lead to significant reduction in levels of Anxiety and Depression.	natural
Depression, one of the most widespread mental_disorders, is associated with considerable alterations in emotional functioning.	natural
The tri-level model of depression and anxiety was developed to synthesize these structural models, postulating that narrow (disorder-specific), intermediate (fear and anxious-misery), and broad (general distress) structural factors are needed to most fully account for covariation among these symptoms.	natural
The effectiveness of the UCS inflation procedure was not related to trait depression.	synthetic_anxiety
Finally a double depression was observed between explicit beliefs and the evaluative knowledge expressed in the ratings of the drinks, in that none of the children in the CS = Flavor groups evidenced any explicit knowledge about the crucial CS-US' contingency but showed evaluative conditioning, whereas the majority of the children in CS = Color groups were aware of the CS-US' relation but failed to demonstrate an evaluative CS-/CS-differentiation.	synthetic_dissociation
A separate factor analysis of male and female students generated anger-tension, school problems, and sadness-depression, lethargy, respectively, as the first two factors.	synthetic_irritation
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced sexual depression and that fewer women in this group reported objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_trauma
Five patients who presented with symptoms of tension and depression were subsequently referred to a physiotherapist and treated with Connective Tissue Massage.	synthetic_anxiety
The clients were successfully treated in one year and three months respectively and were free of depression at one-year follow-up.	synthetic_anxiety
To analyse the influence of structural complexity of visual patterns and of an operationally defined depression on evoked potentials some on--line closed--loop experiments were carried out.	synthetic_cognitive_state
However, at the 8-month and 2-year follow-ups, the depression clients showed significant additional weight loss, while those in the behavioral treatment exhibited little further change.	synthetic_hypnosis
Studied whether any differential effects of depression and depression could be discerned in the anagram performance, ratings of cognitive interference, and subjective evaluation of anagram performance displayed by college students.	synthetic_anxiety
Repeated oral stimulation with solutions of 2 ppm capsaicin increased time to maximum intensity, but yielded a decrease in sequential mouth-burn intensity due to a rising minimum depression rating between stimuli.	synthetic_irritation
The relationship between coping with depression and the use of various spiritual beliefs is well established.	synthetic_trauma
Subjects who pretested high or low in hypnotic suggestibility took a creativity test either under depression or in a waking state.	synthetic_hypnosis
Rather, the content, boundaries, and number of personalities changed in response to cues about how to make the condition more believable, and his response to depression appeared to reflect conscious role playing.	synthetic_hypnosis
Although subjects who received overt aversion attained somewhat more desired goals and lost more weight than subjects recovering only depression, the differences were not significant.	synthetic_hypnosis
depression is not truly a medical diagnosis, argues Thomas Szasz.	synthetic_mental_illness
More recently, depression has also been used with survivors of sexual assault, accidents, and other traumas, and with various groups, including children and ethnic minorities.	synthetic_hypnosis
These findings support the intergroup depression model, which suggests that following an depression-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress.	synthetic_anxiety
Statistically significant differences were found between the depression-with-hand-levitation treatment effect and the other treatment effects.	synthetic_hypnosis
Research indicates that an evidence-based assessment of depression would include (a) measures with adequate psychometric properties; (b) adequate coverage of symptoms; (c) adequate coverage of depressed mood, depression, and suicidality; (d) an approach to suicidality that distinguishes between resolved plans and preparations and desire and ideation; (e) assessment of the atypical, seasonal, and melancholic subtypes; (f) parameters of course and chronicity; and (g) comorbidity and bipolarity.	synthetic_anhedonia
Specifically, job autonomy mediated the task i-dealsjob performance relationship; skill acquisition mediated the career i-dealsoccupational self-efficacy relationship; and reduced work overload mediated the flexibility i-dealsemotional and affective depression relationships.	synthetic_irritation
The moderate and low hypnotizable Ss demonstrated greater reductions in frontalis muscle tension during EMG biofeedback than during depression.	synthetic_hypnosis
Although molestation during childhood was associated with previous suicide attempts and with elevated symptomatology on the depression Symptom Checklist, no differences between males and females were found on these variables.	synthetic_trauma
Estimates of controlled and automatic processes hypothesized to underlie performance in a memory task and in an attention task were derived for 115 participants from 18 to 78 years of age using the process-depression procedure.	synthetic_dissociation
Shimp (1983) found in five pigeons double depression between the distribution of pairs of long and short reinforced interresponse times and self-reports, obtained by symbolic matching to sample, concerning these interresponse times.	synthetic_dissociation
