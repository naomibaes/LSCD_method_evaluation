Moreover the retention of retrograde memory in the face of such severe and global cognitive impairment accentuates the depression or isolability of retrograde memory.	synthetic_dissociation
Earlier studies have demonstrated a significant relation between scores on the Physical depression Scale--but not on the Perceptual Aberration Scale--and premorbid social adjustment in schizophrenics (Chapman, Chapman, & Raulin, 1976, 1978; Schuck, Leventhal, Rothstein, & Irizarry, 1984).	synthetic_anhedonia

Results were interpreted as consistent with the distinction between depression as a state as well as a trait, but conflicted with traditional notions of social desirability response bias, which imply that faking good should lead to consistent changes on both scales.	synthetic_anxiety

Third, when the sources of stress were factor-analysed and used to predict overall job stress and job satisfaction, using multiple regression, the sngle most important predictor of job stress was found to be the factor labelled 'confrontations with inmates' and, for dissatisfaction with the job, it was 'poor depression and resentments'.	synthetic_morale
