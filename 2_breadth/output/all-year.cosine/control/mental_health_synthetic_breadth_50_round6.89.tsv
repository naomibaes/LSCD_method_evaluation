Longitudinal multilevel models tested the main tenets of the ecobiodevelopmental theory, finding that: numerous distinct domains of environmental chaos were associated with children's physical and mental_health outcomes, including housing disorder, neighborhood disorder, and relationship instability, with no significant results for residential instability; different patterns emerged in relation to the timing of exposure to chaos, with more proximal exposure most strongly associated with children's functioning; and the intensity of chaos also was a robust predictor of child functioning.	natural
