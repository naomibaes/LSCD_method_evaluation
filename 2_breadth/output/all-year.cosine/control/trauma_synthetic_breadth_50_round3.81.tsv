It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an aberrant and already disturbed development resulting from trauma; in such a situation, overwhelming primitive anxiety threatens annihilation, or gives rise to terror of catastrophic dispersal of the self, leading to a desperate defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	natural
It appears evident that traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the trauma more difficult (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	natural

Following the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) and another recent study, 10 emotional cue words of positive or negative valence were presented to 18 outpatients with social phobia without current comorbid trauma, 18 outpatients with major trauma without current anxiety disorder and 18 healthy control subjects in a think-aloud task.	synthetic_depression

Studies were coded for characteristics that could potentially moderate the effects of trauma on performance (i.e., features of design, subjects, sport).	synthetic_anxiety
Consistent with theoretical perspectives on trauma and the experience of nonvolition (e.g., Arnold, 1946; Hilgard, 1977, 1979; Spa-nos, 1981, 1982), hypnotic Ss, when faced with a conflict between experiencing motoric suggestions and inhibiting movements, resolved the conflict by following the hypnotist's suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis
