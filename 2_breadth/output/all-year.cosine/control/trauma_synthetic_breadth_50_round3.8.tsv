We suggest that homicide of an intimate female partner is a discrete phenomenon, which differs from non-lethal violence against women in terms of the emotions that trigger it, the circumstances that lead up to it, and the trauma that characterizes it.	synthetic_state_of_mind

Compared to the non-Type D patients, the Type D patients perceived higher severity of CHD (5.31 2.41 versus 4.45 2.17, p < 0.05) and lower trauma (12.67 4.71 versus 15.00 4.43, p < 0.05), and used less confrontation (16.90 5.39 versus 20.88 4.95, p < 0.001) and more acceptance-resignation coping (10.16 3.50 versus 8.35 3.48, p < 0.05).	synthetic_morale
trauma is, in part, genetically determined and inflammation has been implicated.	synthetic_depression
After the initial phase of treatment (trauma or symptom monitoring), the trauma condition showed significantly greater improvement than the control condition in sleep and depression, but not PTSD.	synthetic_hypnosis
In addition, the balancing process occurring in obsessional mentality is compared with strangulation by hanging, the opposing forces being comprised of prematurely solidified states of mind such as mania or paranoia which interfere with that fluid trauma optimal for the precipitation of insight.	synthetic_state_of_mind
Correlation coefficients between trauma Scale scores, ratings of trauma, and A-Trait scores were nonsignificant.	synthetic_anxiety
When compared to the control condition, participants in the high adherence intervention group reported stronger intervention effects at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up than participants in the low adherence group for anxiety (d=0.34-0.39 vs. 0.11-0.22), and male (d=0.43-0.59 vs. 0.26-0.35) and female trauma (d=0.13-0.20 vs. 0.02-0.04).	synthetic_depression
