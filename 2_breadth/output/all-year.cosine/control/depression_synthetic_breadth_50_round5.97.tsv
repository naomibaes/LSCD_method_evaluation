Until the end of that century, personality referred to the subjective aspects of the self, and personality disorder meant alteration of consciousness (e.g., hysterical depression); the behavioral patterns dealt with by DSM-III-R as personality disorders were then called disorders of character and explained as states of volitional failure, or loss of coherence between cognitive, emotional, and conative functions, or of automatism, i.e., the manifestation of lower (more primitive or animal) forms of behavior escaping the control of higher (human) ones.	synthetic_dissociation
