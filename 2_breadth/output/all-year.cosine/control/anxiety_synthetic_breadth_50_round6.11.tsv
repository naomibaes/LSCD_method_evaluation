Perceptions of university and family environments were measured in two groups of university students differing in anxiety as measured by the Beck anxiety Inventory (BDI): a nondepressed group (ND: mean BDI score = 5.15, N = 20)and a moderately depressed group [MD; mean BDI score = 20.00, N = 20).Perceptions of the university were assessed by selected subscales from the College and University Environment Scales (CUES);perceptions of the family were assessed by subscales chosen from the Family Environment Scale (FES).MD subjects had more negative views of their environments, whether their perceptions were compared with ND subjects' perceptions or with their own perceptions of the ideal environment.	synthetic_depression
