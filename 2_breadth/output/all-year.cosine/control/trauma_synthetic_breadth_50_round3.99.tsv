When a patient experiences the effects of severe trauma and is very dissociative, as in the case presented, it is difficult to track and reflect upon these processes as they occur, making it virtually impossible to become and remain empathically attuned to his many self states.	natural
A promising methodological innovation in the study of violence and trauma is the use of longitudinal designs.	natural
The findings suggest that the extent of prior exposure to trauma, including variations across type and timing, may be related to a particular form of coping that has been linked to increased risk for mental_health problems.	natural

The resource describes relevant research, group work undertaken, the theoretical model, and key findings on the impact of the conflict, with supporting background papers on a range of themes including trauma and recovery, children and parents/carers, victims and workers, groups and leadership, and finally, community and transformation.	natural
The investigation of psychosocial factors in relation to opiate addiction is limited and typically uses binary measures to assess how incidences of childhood trauma correlate with addiction.	natural
While the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR) was trauma experience in the category of loss, the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms was female gender.	natural
Public health and criminal justice personnel working with substance-using offenders should screen individuals for victimization-related trauma and, if identified, provide assistance to evaluate and improve such individuals' mental_health and, subsequently, decrease their likelihood of using substances.	natural
This article presents the art therapist's engagement in responsive art making as an effective approach in working with an adolescent survivor of developmental trauma.	natural
We used a large, relatively homogenous population to replicate previous findings of poor fear inhibition in COMT Met/Met carriers with PTSD; determine if COMT association with fear inhibition is moderated by childhood trauma (CT), an environmental risk factor for PTSD; and determine if COMT is associated with altered fear processes after recent exposure to combat trauma.	natural
Implications of the findings for both attachment theory and clinical intervention on trauma are discussed.	natural
Furthermore, because the brain retains its plasticity throughout life, no matter what early trauma has occurred, the brain is capable of repairing the damage provided the individual receives appropriate relational psychotherapy.	natural
In a mixed ethnic and racial sample of 90 psychiatrically impaired youth (ages 10-18, 56 boys), we investigated the contributions of peritraumatic dissociation, emotional distress, and arousal to current PTSD severity after accounting for the effects of gender, trauma history, trait dissociation, and psychopathology (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression).	natural
Correlations of trait trauma and field dependence measures with movement frequencies varied markedly with task differences.	synthetic_anxiety
The study demonstrates that trauma can be used to enhance and maintain self-efficacy and soccer wall-volley performance.	synthetic_hypnosis
The distinction between unipolar trauma and bipolar affective disorder, and the separation by presence or absence of psychotic features (delusions and hallucinations), and then again by mood congruence, are of high prognostic value.	synthetic_depression
Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical trauma and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia
We find that education has a positive impact on tax trauma for those individuals that are net beneficiaries of the welfare state, and a negative impact for those that are net contributors.	synthetic_morale
Waiting for an organ transplant is a stressful experience frequently associated with symptoms of trauma and anxiety.	synthetic_depression
BDD is frequently comorbid with major trauma, is associated with an earlier age of onset of trauma and longer duration of depressive episodes, and is found more frequently with atypical than non-atypical trauma.	synthetic_depression
The scientific data on the effect of trauma on memory do not support Boggs's position.	synthetic_hypnosis
The ATP score is constructed from trait trauma and situation perception data derived from the Endler Multidimensional trauma Scales (EMAS; Endler, Edwards, & Vitelli, 1989).	synthetic_anxiety
trauma professionals should be aware that prevention activities can be developed with limited resources and existing staff, by making use of local news media--newspapers, radio, and television--to educate, support, and inform the public about mental_health issues.	synthetic_mental_health
A significant increase in endurance performance was revealed in the motivation alone Ss and in high susceptible trauma Ss who were given motivational suggestions.	synthetic_hypnosis
I examined the relationship of traditional ideology, a characterological and cultural variable, and life stress and symptoms of trauma to an openness to the use of psychotherapy.	synthetic_depression
Rural patients also had more physical problems and trauma/depression prior to admission, and were more physically agitated, verbally agitated, and anxious/depressed at discharge.	synthetic_anxiety
The possible trauma of unilateral neglect in far and near extra-personal space was systematically investigated using a modified version of the Wundt-Jastrow area illusion test.	synthetic_dissociation
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, trauma, and Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales loaded together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of hallucinatory behavior.	synthetic_depression
These findings suggest that the lack of sociability of avoidant individuals reflects high levels of social trauma.	synthetic_anhedonia
This study examined how proactive personality interacts with inter-role conflict, measured as workfamily conflict and familywork conflict, to predict burnout, measured as emotional exhaustion, trauma, and reduced personal accomplishment.	synthetic_depersonalization
Since the signifi-image was contrary to the significant-image, these two were regarded as two aspects of regressive state in trauma.	synthetic_hypnosis
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the extent to which personality (neuroticism, extraversion), background characteristics (education/training, work experience), and perceptions of the work setting (work role conflict, work role ambiguity, organizational commitment, job satisfaction) were associated with three facets of burnout (emotional exhaustion, trauma, personal accomplishment).	synthetic_depersonalization
Inspection of the data led to the conclusion that the instructions were followed by higher skin conductance, probably from increased trauma or skeletal artifact.	synthetic_anxiety
The results provided evidence against Weiner's (1972) attribution theory version of the inertial motivation hypothesis, and were interpreted within the general learning theory framework combined with the achievement and test trauma models of Atkinson and Sarason.	synthetic_anxiety
This study examined trauma among 237 students served in special education programs for the seriously emotionally disturbed and among 577 nonhandicapped peers.	synthetic_depression
There is, unfortunately, a relative lack of easily interpretable trauma experiments in the confidence ratings paradigm, and those that exist do not show clear evidence for dissociations.	synthetic_dissociation
Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of trauma showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_depression
