Results indicated that: low sex guilt and high sex guilt subjects perceived the stimulus individuals quite similarly along the two major dimensions (sociability and positive-negative) underlying their comparisons; that males and high sex guilt subjects utilized less of both the sociability and positive-negative dimensions in making their judgments concerning the interrelationships of the stimulus individuals; that low sex guilt and high sex guilt subjects differ in evaluating themselves in relation to the stimulus individuals; and high sex guilt subjects rated themselves as more similar to a trait sex guilty description than to descriptions dealing with trait sex trauma, or general guilt or trauma.	synthetic_anxiety
