Does the Spiritual Transcendence Scale (STS; R. L. Piedmont, 1999) predict psychosocial outcomes from an outpatient substance abuse program?	natural
Attributable proportions (APs) due to interaction between each maltreatment and parental history revealed significant synergistic relationships for physical abuse in the entire sample, and for sexual abuse and emotional neglect in women (APs, 0.21, 0.31, 0.26 respectively), indicating that the odds of alcohol dependence given both parental history and these maltreatments were significantly higher than the additive effect of each alone (p<0.05).	natural
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) clinical scales as well as 4 sets of MMPI items known to be sensitive to neurological dysfunction (closed head injury, cerebrovascular disorder) were administered to survivors of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse and to non-abused adults.	natural

The author conducted secondary data analysis of 3 previously reported studies (D. J. Higgins & M.P. McCabe, 1998, 2000b, 2003) to examine whether respondents are best classified according to their experience of separate maltreatment types (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect, and witnessing family violence) or whether their experience reflects a single unifying concept: child maltreatment.	natural
Adolescents who were sexually abused, particularly those who experienced the most severe sexual abuse, used negative coping strategies more often than those not sexually abused.	natural

Logistic regression analysis found that the interaction of CMR and distress tolerance was significant in predicting substance abuse treatment retention.	natural
Latent class results were compared with the DSM-IV categories of abuse and dependence, and latent transition analysis (LTA) was used to examine changes in symptom severity over a 1-year follow-up.	natural
Understanding the confusion and intimidation surrounding a child's experiences as a result of being sexually abused by a person in a position of authority often explains why children often fail to report or delay in reporting such abuse.	natural
There are scientific, clinical, social, and legal impediments to application of an agonist-like approach to stimulant abuse and dependence.	natural
Item response theory analyses suggested that the concept of abuse and discrimination is similar for all groups.	synthetic_harassment

Effects of noise frequencies on both performance on a complex psychomotor task and abuse were investigated for men (n = 30) and women (n = 30).	synthetic_annoyance
Adolescent sexual victimisation, younger age at first alcohol/drug use, being a victim of intimate partner violence and sense of stigmatisation of sexual self/others were all variables associated with adolescent onset of commercial sexual abuse.	synthetic_exploitation

Second, a limited awareness of the nature of the task was a common source of difficulty in both languages: there was neither adequate awareness of the nature of written language and the demands its production makes upon the writer, nor was there sufficient abuse of the creative nature of the activity of writing itself.	synthetic_exploitation
There was some differ ence in racial attitudes, but it was apparent that in general the greatest objections from all were to the victimisation and abuse of women and children.	synthetic_exploitation
Results demonstrate that these practices differentially affect the incidence of abuse and service members' job-related outcomes, with perceived organizational implementation practices having the greatest effect and the provision of either training or resources having the least.	synthetic_harassment
Concerning participants' worst sexually harassing experiences, the perpetrators were likely to be men (75), who also engaged in more severe types of sexual abuse than female perpetrators.	synthetic_harassment

Postbias curve navigation performance was not impacted, likely because participants had learned to abuse, rather than integrate, biased inertial cues.	synthetic_disregard
Generally, either anxious or avoidant individuals were less likely to perceive positive emotion (happy) from facial expressions, and anxious and less avoidant individuals perceived other-oriented negative emotions (anger, disgust, and abuse).	synthetic_contempt
