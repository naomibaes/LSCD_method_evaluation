Non-Hispanic Whites were found to have a U-shaped relationship in which moderate drinkers, in the presence of stress, had lower levels of depression than did heavy drinkers and abstainers.	natural
Possible causal relationships between RIF and depression are discussed.	natural
In this study, insight was not associated with basic sociodemographic characteristics or had it any associations with depression or the flexibility of cognitive processes.	natural

Results showed that the inter-method agreement to identify high levels of anxiety and depression was moderate to perfect in children while it was lower in parents.	natural
Major depressive episode with BPFH vs MDE without BPFH had significantly more BP II, lower age of onset, more MDE recurrences, more atypical depressions, more mixed depressions, and more intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms (irritability, racing/crowded thoughts, psychomotor depression, more talkativeness, distractibility).	synthetic_agitation
With the male experimenter, relaxation, depression and cognitive rehearsal were all significantly better than the control group.	synthetic_anxiety
This negative shift was considered identical to the N1 enhancement of Hillyard and his colleagues which in the present study was forced, by the longer inter-stimulus interval used, to demonstrate temporal depression with the N1 component.	synthetic_dissociation

Among older people with LTE, lower extraversion and higher neuroticism increased the risk of current mood or anxiety disorders, whereas higher extraversion increased the probability of experiencing mental well-being after adjusting for sociodemographic and depression-related variables.	synthetic_trauma
At the ages of 4, 8 and 12 months, positive emotionality, negative emotionality and withdrawal/depression were assessed by means of a parent questionnaire, naturalistic behavioural observations of the caregiver-infant interaction, and by means of laboratory routines.	synthetic_anxiety

60 female volunteers, 30 hypnotizable and 30 unhypnotizable, screened on 2 measures of hypnotizability, were assigned to a depression, simulation, or waking motivated treatment condition to assess whether depression has a differentially enhancing effect upon verbal and non-verbal creativity test performance.	synthetic_hypnosis
The study hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in family functioning between those subjects that reported feeling traumatized and those subjects that did not report feeling traumatized, there would be a significant difference in depression between the identified trauma group and the identified non-trauma group, and there would be a significant difference in the breadth of support systems between the two groups.	synthetic_anxiety
