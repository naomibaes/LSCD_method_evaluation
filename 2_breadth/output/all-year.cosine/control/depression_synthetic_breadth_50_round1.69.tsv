State anxiety and depression variables were found to play a very small part, however, in contributing to cognitive function.	natural
A number of behavior therapists have proposed that depression results when a discriminative stimulus or reinforcer for behavior is removed.	natural
Others hold that the association is U-shaped with either highest depression rates (Mroczek and Christian 1998; Blanchflower and Oswald 2008) or highest happiness levels occurring during middle age (Easterlin 2006).	natural
The strength of the association of DBH genotype with depression essentially remained unchanged after correction for other variables in a multivariate model.	natural
The Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire, Padua Inventory, Major Depression Inventory, and Positive and Negative Affect Scales were used to distribute participants on spectrums of obsessionality and low mood (Studies 1 and and classify them in terms of clinical OCD and MDD (Study.	natural
The scale also demonstrated good internal consistency and convergent validity with the Depression Self-Rating Scale and Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire.	natural
People who inject drugs (PWID) and have mental_health conditions, such as major depression, an anxiety disorder, or antisocial or borderline personality disorder, may have elevated risk for HIV and HCV infection.	natural
In this study a group of front line AIDS/HIV workers were given an in-depth training course on anxiety and depression.	natural
Results suggest that both depression and mood are uniquely associated with momentary pain; as such, multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	natural
Median age at first onset of depression was around 35 years for individuals followed up for 30-49 years.	natural
We investigated the cross-sectional association between depressive symptoms, assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and VAT and SAT, assessed by computed tomography, in a sample of 409 middle-aged women (44.7 African-Americans, 55.3 Whites; mean age = 50.4 years) participating in the Chicago site of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).	natural
Although normal Quality of Life (QoL) is the outcome desired by patients, it is unclear if QoL changes early in course of antidepressant treatments are independent of depression severity, and can predict subsequent remission.	natural
Fifty-three percent of the mothers of boys with GID compared with only 6 of controls met the diagnosis for Borderline Personality Disorder on the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines or had symptoms of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Depression is a widespread psychological issue.	natural
Study 3 explored the relationship between social punishment and obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, as well as the role of gender.	natural
Participants were 51 individuals who enrolled in a treatment study on insomnia and depression, met criteria for MDD and comorbid insomnia, and underwent an overnight polysomnography evaluation.	natural
Repetition of suicidal behavior is associated with high anxiety, severe depression, more psychiatric symptoms and is increased in young patients.	natural
Individuals with depression and low social support are at elevated risk for developing cardiovascular disease--presumptively through mechanisms involving dysregulated stress physiology.	natural
The relationship between problem-solving and depression was examined in a sample of 48 new clients (38 women and 10 men) presenting at three Community Health Centers over a 3-wk.	natural
Results also demonstrated stronger withinconstruct correlations (i.e., state depression with trait depression) than between construct correlations (i.e., state depression with trait anxiety), supporting the distinctness of the two constructs.	natural
The overall model explained 12.7 and 16.1 of the variance for children's anxiety and depression, respectively.	natural
As social support is linked with recovery from depression and a lower likelihood of experiencing future episodes of depression, it is important to understand factors that influence an individual's decision to seek social support.	natural
Patients with a recent suicide attempt were compared with patients suffering from depression, adjustment disorder, anxiety, or eating disorders without suicidality, healthy controls and remitted patients with a history of at least 1 suicide attempt (1 year).	natural
The ultimate objective of the present investigation was to improve the detection of depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing common self-report depression measures to a new, modified measure, which takes into account the contribution that symptoms of MS may have on individuals' reports.	natural
Therefore, although no change in alpha-adrenoreceptors seems to occur in major depression, the density of these receptors would seem to be related to the severity of depressive symptoms.	natural
Subgroup differences were analysed for pairs of subsamples discriminable by discourse mode (narrativedescriptive vs expositoryargumentative) or by the writers' age, sex, Cattell Exvia or depression scores.	synthetic_anxiety
We hypothesized a phenomenon that we term myopic depression.	synthetic_misery
Modified versions of the Criminally Insane Scale (Khanna, Pratt, & Gardiner, 1962) and Attitudes Toward depression Scale (Cohen & Struening, 1962) were used in assessing these attitudes.	synthetic_mental_illness
Subjects were 33 OCDs and 24 patients with other depression disorders.	synthetic_anxiety
Moreover, the idea that knowledge of external reality is itself mentally constructed also has diminished interest in uncovering depression and real history.	synthetic_trauma
During each lift, the electromyogram This suggests that the dynamics for depression perception in the leg is similar to that shown in the arm in previous work.	synthetic_heaviness
The primary outcomes are depression and aggression and other NPS.	synthetic_agitation
depression was assessed by selfreport skin conductance and heartrate measures.	synthetic_anxiety
Amnesia in subjects accused of crime is most often found in crimes of violence, especially homicide, and may have an organic cause such as a head injury, or a psychogenic cause due to the psychological depression associated with the violence.	synthetic_trauma
Preselected imaginative ability did not predict hypnotic susceptibility or the production of goal-directed fantasies during depression.	synthetic_hypnosis
The study aimed to assess the effects of bright light therapy on depression and sleep in people with dementia.	synthetic_agitation
These findings indicate that depression reduces tonic sympathetic nervous system activity, which might explain why depression is effective in the treatment of disorders with strong sympathetic nervous system involvement, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hot flashes, hypertension, and chronic pain.	synthetic_hypnosis
The number of sessions varied with the length of time between depression and treatment, severity of stressor, and the personality of the patient.	synthetic_trauma
Contrary to drive theory, the results indicated that depression tends to weaken the bond between pairs of verbal associates, reducing the frequency of common responses.	synthetic_anxiety
Distal risk factors like childhood depression, family history of suicide, and introversion may increase an alcoholics suicide risk when they experience a proximal or trigger factor like depression.	synthetic_trauma
The findings are congruent with theories that link death depression with concern about separation from parental figures.	synthetic_anxiety
The temperament dimension of Novelty Seeking was positively correlated to craving and depression (p < .01), with a higher score of Novelty Seeking in the subsample of anhedonic subjects with respect to both non-anhedonic and control subjects.	synthetic_anhedonia
PTSD participants had higher HRs at 1 week but not at 1 month after depression than non-PTSD participants.	synthetic_trauma
The high cost, in terms of money and depression, means that more efficient management plans need to be developed.	synthetic_morale
The data suggest a depression between automatic and preattentive processes that is more consistent with the memory view of automaticity than with the modal view.	synthetic_dissociation
For the Total Life-change score, the group mean for Counseling was significantly lower than the depression and Control group means, which were identical.	synthetic_mental_health
depression rating appeared not to be lateralised in both groups.	synthetic_irritation
Subjects were identified as psychosis-prone by their high scores on the Perceptual Aberration or the Physical depression scales.	synthetic_anhedonia
We found very few statistically significant associations, which could he explained by (a) childhood depression subtypes not being mutually exclusive, (b) clustering of mild-to-severe forms of abuse.	synthetic_trauma
The time-intensity characteristics of zingerone depression were examined using high-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and low-frequency users of chili, who rated the intensity of whole-mouth rinses of 1 zingerone at 6-s intervals for 3 min.	synthetic_irritation
