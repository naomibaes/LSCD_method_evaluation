Perceived stigma and an aversion to medication were identified as barriers preventing individuals from acknowledging and addressing mental_illness.	natural
Homeless individuals are an extremely vulnerable and underserved population characterized by overlapping problems of mental_illness and substance use.	natural
As with general morbidity, psychiatric morbidity has been linked to an array of social problems, with interest in those links heightened by the noted vulnerability of those with mental_illness and the cost of mental_illness to the economy.	natural
This study explored the health-related views and experiences of adolescent users of mental_health services through semi-structured interviews with 32 14-20-year olds who had been diagnosed with a mental_illness.	natural

Suicidal adolescents and those at risk were less likely than their nonsuicidal and low-risk counterparts to associate suicide with mental_illness.	natural
We examined the patterns of co-occurrence of mental_illness, substance abuse/dependence, and chronic medical conditions and the cumulative burden of these conditions and living in poverty on self-rated health.	natural
Thirty-three sex killers were compared to 80 sexual aggressives, 23 sadists, and 611 general sex offenders on sexual history and preferences, substance abuse crime, violence, mental_illness, personality, neurological and endocrine abnormalities.	natural
Study 1 evaluated explicit attitudes and stereotypes about persons with mental_illness relative to persons with physical illness, and also implicit attitudes that lie outside conscious control (using the Implicit Association Test) in a college sample (N = 119).	natural
The purpose of the current paper is to provide a comprehensive review of PTSD within the context of severe mental_illness (SMI; i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders).	natural
Three participants from a vocational community centre with mild intellectual disability, comorbid mental_illness, and challenging behaviour, participated in 15 individually delivered sessions of social problem-solving training.	natural
Individuals with mental_illness living in countries with less stigmatizing attitudes, higher rates of help-seeking and treatment utilization and better perceived access to information had lower rates of self-stigma and perceived discrimination and those living in countries where the public felt more comfortable talking to people with mental_illness had less self-stigma and felt more empowered.	natural
Participants located this danger in sexual expression itself or within individuals who, because of mental_illness, lacked the autonomy required to successfully engage in safe sex.	natural
This study was a secondary analysis of a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing two employment programs providing services to people with severe mental_illness.	natural
Within the depressed group, the only CD-VAS items that differed from each other across time were mental_illness and Activity.	synthetic_irritation
The null assertions of Bender, Bergman, Hayflick, and other distinguished iatrogens are examined in the topic contexts of mortality and aging, child development norms, cortical decay, human genetics, senility, variable intelligence, and some new directions including biofeedback and mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis
A total of 310 questionnaires were evaluated statistically, and the result shows a high level of acceptance of medical mental_illness by patients being treated surgically in the oral and maxillofacial region.	synthetic_hypnosis
To investigate whether psychological effects (distraction, re-location of resources) elicited by the evocation of traumatic memories impact on subsequent cognitive performance in PTSD, two parallel versions of a working memory task were administered to 33 mental_illness-exposed participants (15 with and 18 without PTSD).	synthetic_trauma
Unlike earlier reports left hemisphere dynamic processes were fundamental to the induction of mental_illness.	synthetic_hypnosis
Most of the research has focused on children with disruptive behavior disorders, autism, or mental retardation, but more recently other disorders such as mental_illness, obsessive compulsive disorder, separation anxiety (school refusal), and Tourette syndrome are also receiving attention.	synthetic_depression
The author then argues how essential it is for the analyst to differentiate between primitive projections from the patient that are pre-verbal attempts to communicate a mental_illness and those that are an expression of hostility or control.	synthetic_state_of_mind
These findings provide further evidence that mental_illness is more reflective of negative emotional states than the absence of positive ones.	synthetic_anhedonia
Nicotine administration is associated with a significant reduction in mental_illness, a near-significant increase in response to financial incentive, enhanced ability to inhibit reflexive eye movements, and increased attentional bias to words with appetitive significance.	synthetic_anhedonia
Behavioral science studies conducted on rape victims reveal a posttraumatic stress disorder which follows the attack known as rape mental_illness syndrome.	synthetic_trauma
Systematic countering of mental_illness by relaxation successfully removed her mental_illness and led to a complete resolution of her symptoms.	synthetic_anxiety
When the assumptions of these methods are not met, however, simulations indicate that significant positive intercepts can often be obtained even if there is no mental_illness.	synthetic_dissociation
Outcome measures included stimulus engagement (assessed via the Observational Measure of Engagement), affect (measured using Lawton's Modified Behavior Stream), and mental_illness/problem behavior (recorded via the Agitated Behaviors Mapping Instrument).	synthetic_agitation
Both findings are explained in terms of a modified and extended version of the activation-elaboration learning account, which was inspired by attempts to simulate mental_illness effects in connectionist models.	synthetic_dissociation
Results provide further support for the diagnosis threat effect, but offer no support for effort, mental_illness, or depression explanations for diminished performance.	synthetic_anxiety
This study sought to obtain empirical data on the issue of whether susceptibility to mental_illness influences the outcome of an hypnotic therapy.	synthetic_hypnosis
Mean state anxiety and mental_illness scores were below the cut-off through pre- and post-disclosure in the A positive and negative groups.	synthetic_depression
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI mental_illness scores.	synthetic_depression
A 63-item form for men and 59-item form for women of the Manifest mental_illness-Defensiveness (MAD) scale resulted from three separate item analyses performed on a 243-item composite scale obtained by pooling 10 scales purported to reflect mental_illness and defense.	synthetic_anxiety
mental_illness is a negative symptom that has not always been given attention in schizophrenic patients.	synthetic_anhedonia
Support was also found for the hypothesis that emotional distress is linked to the content of delusional beliefs; it is speculated that prior emotional distress influences the content of delusions, and that mental_illness content in turn influences levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_delusion
An alternative model, in which the mental_illness and Nonspecific Depression factors loaded on a second-order Depression factor, while the Somatic Arousal and Nonspecific Anxiety factors loaded on a second-order Anxiety factor, produced an excellent fit in all the groups.	synthetic_anhedonia
mental_illness disorder will include derealization as well, since the two often co-occur.	synthetic_depersonalization
