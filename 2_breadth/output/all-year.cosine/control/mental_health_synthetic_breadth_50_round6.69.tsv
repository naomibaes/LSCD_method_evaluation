However, higher levels of subscales reflecting maternal insecure avoidant attachment (e.g., no memory of early childhood experiences and balancing/forgiving current mental_health) emerged as more predictive of GAD relative to PD.	synthetic_state_of_mind
mental_health is increasingly prevalent among employees, but little is known about how these individuals are perceived at work.	synthetic_mental_illness
