Self-reported depression, anxiety, and victimization and peer-reported rejection were measured 3 times over the course of 1 year.	natural
Although body dissatisfaction remained stable across the age range, self-objectification, habitual body monitoring, appearance anxiety, and disordered eating symptomatology all significantly decreased with age.	natural
In our model, we propose that these psychological processes influence interpretations and behaviors relevant to the expression of nonpathological anxiety as well as features of diagnosable anxiety conditions.	natural
Despite epidemiological reports indicating an association between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and cannabis use disorders (CUD), there is a paucity of research exploring the nature of this relationship.	natural

Participants completed measures to assess social anxiety and the Youngs Schema Questionnaire (123-items version) that is designed to assess 15 early maladaptive schemas (EMSs).	natural
Further, cognition scores for these latter two groups discriminated high vs. low social anxiety, a factor often linked to assertion.	natural
AS significantly moderated the FA-child anxiety severity link.	natural
Subjects at the formal-operational stage and low and moderate levels of trait anxiety showed reliable attribution-behavior prescription correspondence; formal-operational individuals with high trait anxiety and subjects at lower levels of cognitive development showed no consistent relationships between their attributions and subsequent behavioral prescriptions.	natural
The patients were rated on clinician rating scales of depression, anxiety and irritability, and completed selfreport measures.	natural
Attention deficit disorder, depression and conduct disorder were the most common diagnoses in the parent interview, while anxiety disorder and depression were most common according to the child interview.	natural
However, much of the existing research has relied on global measures of distress that do not separate distinct symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
This pilot study aims to compare the relative efficacy of two different modes of delivering a family-focused, cognitive-behavioral intervention for children with an anxiety disorder.	natural
Pre- to post-treatment within-group effect sizes were in the moderate to large range (Cohen's d = 0.62-1.56) on measures of FM symptoms and impact, disability, quality of life, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and psychological flexibility.	natural
However, a significant proportion of adolescent clients continue to report anxiety symptoms post-treatment.	natural
The relationship of the two interaction patterns to anxiety is inconsistent.	synthetic_morale

Results showed that the changes had positive effects for patients and staff members on mood and anxiety and on the perceived quality of health care, while visitors reacted negatively to the modifications.	synthetic_morale
A scale, the anxiety Behaviors Prediction Scale (MIBPS) was developed for use in studies of ascribed mental_illness.	synthetic_mental_illness
These findings lend support to the relevance of the parent's anxiety pertaining to attachment status to child and parent relational behavior in cases wherein the child has been diagnosed with autism or an associated neurodevelopmental_disorder of relating and communicating.	synthetic_state_of_mind
The first international society of anxiety founded in this century, the International Society for Clinical and Experimental anxiety (ISCEH), was organized in 1958 as a direct result of societal conflicts between The Society for Clinical and Experimental anxiety (SCEH) and the American Society of Clinical anxiety (ASCH).	synthetic_hypnosis
Nine-hundred seventy adolescents aged 11-19 years were asked to complete self-report questionnaires assessing traumatic symptoms (anxiety Symptom Checklist, Briere, 1996); self-image (Self-Description Questionnaire II, Marsh, 1990) and coping (How I Cope Under Pressure Scale, Ayers, Sandler, West, & Roosa, 1996).	synthetic_trauma
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with outcomes such as dissociation, depression, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood anxiety or abuse.	synthetic_trauma
Critical knowledge gaps were identified in five areas of child and adolescent psychopathology, including anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, the anxiety disorders, and the developmental_disorders.	synthetic_depression
Overall, study findings indicate that early abusive anxiety and adult functioning have no simple relationship.	synthetic_trauma
The importance of addressing both addiction and anxiety at the outset of substance abuse recovery is emphasized.	synthetic_trauma
We aimed to identify brain activation and connectivity evoked by anxiety-related pictures, and associations with PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_trauma
The paper also examines Tajfel's use of the term 'anxiety', which he described as a 'milder' form of dehumanization of out-groups.	synthetic_depersonalization
Current theory about the processing of anxiety in children and adolescents is reviewed, with recommendations for future research in this area.	synthetic_trauma
The authors extended this research by investigating relationships among 3 dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and diminished personal accomplishment) and OCB.	synthetic_depersonalization
Such symptoms should be studied in a holistic way in order to treat the underlying pathophysiological process rather than just suppressing unacceptable behaviors such as anxiety.	synthetic_agitation
Instruments devised to measure death anxiety, anxiety, and manifest anxiety in adults were administered to 75 junior high-school students, Ill senior high-school students, and 38 adults in an effort to determine the nature of any developmental differences among these groups.	synthetic_depression
Threatening facial expressions may be regarded with increased significance by anxiety-prone individuals, and it is possible that this bias is involved in the formation of delusional beliefs.	synthetic_delusion
We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would report significantly greater anxiety than the bipolar patients and that higher scores on the anxiety scales would be related to attenuated reports of the experience of positive affect and poorer social skill.	synthetic_anhedonia
