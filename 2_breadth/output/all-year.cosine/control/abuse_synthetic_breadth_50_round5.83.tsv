When extrapolating to the situation in TS patients, these findings suggest that performance of tics is reinforced by reducing the subjective abuse of premonitory urges, while simultaneously preventing habituation or even inducing sensitisation of the physiological motor response.	synthetic_annoyance
When examining the role of technology in peer abuse, youth experiencing any mixed abuse (i.e., those incidents that occurred both in-person and through technology) were almost 4 times more likely to report past month depressive symptoms without SI (RRadj = 3.9, 95 confidence interval [CI] = [1.5, 10.0], p .01) and 7.5 times (95 CI = [1.9, 28.9], p .01) more likely to report past month SI compared with youth who had no past year peer abuse.	synthetic_harassment
