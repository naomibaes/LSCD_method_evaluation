If depression is seen from an interpersonal point of view it could be hypothesized that aspects of the relationship existing between the hypnotist and the subject prior to depression would probably be related to the subject's susceptibility to the depression.	synthetic_hypnosis
Stepwise regression analyses controlling for player characteristics revealed that attentional control and goal-setting strategies contributed to lower depression anxiety, attention control and imagery/ relaxation strategies resulted in lower somatic state anxiety, and attention control and positive self-talk contributed to increased state self-confidence.	synthetic_cognitive_state
