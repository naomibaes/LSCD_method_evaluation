Given that CHR individuals are reporting increased rates of trauma and perceived discrimination, these should be routinely assessed, with the possibility of offering interventions aimed at ameliorating the impact of past traumas as well as improving self-esteem and coping strategies in an attempt to reduce perceived discrimination.	natural
This study of 45 high-risk mothers and infants examined the current indirect effects model of intergenerational transmission of disorganized attachment, which posits that maternal childhood experiences of loss or trauma contribute to maternal states of mind on the AAI which in turn contribute to infant disorganization.	natural
The negative association between positive goal beliefs and indirect trauma may be related to the gap the individual perceives between the hoped-for ideals and the trauma-stricken reality.	natural
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that perceived availability of emotional support in childhood was a predictor of current dissociative tendencies, but account of the support factor did not eliminate the relationship between childhood trauma and dissociation.	natural
This article reviews the psychometric properties of the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (SLESQ), a recently developed trauma history screening measure, and discusses the complexities involved in assessing trauma exposure.	natural
Special benefits for patients from the combination of programmed writing lessong with traditional psychotherapy were: increased couple communication; possibly more rapid change; possibly shorter-term therapy; increased forgotten trauma discovery; and increased explicit and specific instructions.	natural
Results also suggest that emotional abuse is a form of childhood trauma particularly relevant to bulimia.	natural

We examined the coherence of trauma memories in a trauma-exposed community sample of 30 adults with and 30 without posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
Results from previous studies suggest that past trauma experience increases the risk for medically unexplained somatic symptoms and somatoform disorders (SFD).	natural
In this study, we investigated the differential impacts of five types of maltreatment exposure (physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, neglect, other type, and multiple types) on the associations between four types of organized activities (mentored groups, art and music clubs, sport clubs, and academic clubs) and academic and socioemotional development (school engagement, delinquency, depressive symptoms, and trauma symptoms) of adolescents who were investigated by Child Protective Services (CPS) for maltreatment exposure.	natural
Prison employees are often confronted with critical incidents and chronic stressors that may lead to trauma or burnout symptoms.	natural
The present results thus support the a priori hypotheses that novel physiological and behavioral hallmarks of PTSD can be documented in an animal model of the disorder and that the present overt signs of reactive hyper-vigilance can be triggered by reintroduction of an olfactory stimulus present at the time of initial trauma exposure.	natural
We then examine the implications of her research on time windows (the integration of new information into a memory) and memory reactivation (the retrieval of a forgotten memory as a result of the re-exposure to a component of the original learning experience) for early intervention programs and clinicians treating victims of early trauma.	natural
In an early investigation on the topic of the relationship between trauma history and nonsexual crimes committed by sexual offenders, this study examined nonsexual crimes committed by a sample of 451 juvenile sexual abusers.	natural
Mothers were assessed for childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, as well as symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The PTSD prevalence was 33, and 77 of the female juvenile offenders had been exposed to trauma.	natural

Clinically significant trauma was present in 8 (n = 18) of patients.	synthetic_agitation
Talking aided the infants in achieving a quiet, visually attentive state; stroking or the combination of talking and stroking produced a motorically active state suggestive of trauma and motoric disorganization especially among higher-risk infants.	synthetic_agitation
During trauma, the patient learns to associate pleasant scents with a sense of security and self-control.	synthetic_hypnosis
Whenwe testedthe members of the pairs successively, it was found, for the first experimental set, that the behavior that reflects trauma (time in closed arms) of the first-tested animal differed from that of the second-tested animal for both the experimental and the control animals and, critically, that these changes were in the opposite directions for the controls and the experimental animals, thus obscuring the effect of the experimental manipulation.	synthetic_anxiety
Maximum ventilation was significantly increased in high susceptible trauma Ss when compared with control Ss and significant increases in blood lactate concentrations were revealed when the high susceptible trauma Ss were compared with low susceptible trauma and motivation alone Ss.	synthetic_hypnosis
The dissociative characteristic of trauma and derealization was positively correlated with scores on the bulimia and oral control subscales of the Eating Attitudes Test.	synthetic_depersonalization

In the 20th century, before World War II, the idea of performing scientific investigations of trauma took place at Harvard University through William McDougall, at the University of Wisconsin and Yale University under Clark Hull, and, in its clinical aspects particularly, through the personal efforts of Milton H. Erickson.	synthetic_hypnosis
The history of trauma is closely linked to the theme of possession; one such link is that the forerunner of trauma, animal magnetism, replaced exorcism in 1775 when Franz Anton Mesmer testified against Father Johann Joseph Gassner's exorcism.	synthetic_hypnosis
