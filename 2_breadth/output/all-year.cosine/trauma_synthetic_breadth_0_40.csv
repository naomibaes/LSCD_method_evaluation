"The paper suggests that supervision, at its most useful for people working in this field, might best be focussed on the inter-relationship between the trauma itself, the person of the counsellor, the helping relationship, and the context in which the work is offered.",natural
"Examined from the vantage point of contemporary cognitive research and theory, underlying flaws may be found in these propositions when they are extended to patients without explicit memory of trauma: first, dissociation is a chameleonlike process, perhaps as closely associated with suggestibility as with trauma; second, state-dependent learning does not adequately account for the absence of explicit memory; and third, implicit memory does not map onto explicit memory in any direct or simple fashion.",natural

"Instead, it is hoped that, as it hones in on the basic issues of physical disconnection and lack of interoception in trauma survivors, it might function as an initial building block for a more complete treatment model in the future.",natural
The lack of recognition of trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the traumatic experience and forces it to remain as part of the present.,natural
"In contrast to Study 1, prior history of PTSD, perception of life threat, and the index trauma being a sexual assault all predicted posttrauma panic, whereas prior trauma exposure and depression did not.",natural
