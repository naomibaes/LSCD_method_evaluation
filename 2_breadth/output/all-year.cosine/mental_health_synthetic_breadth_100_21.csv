"In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating mental_health.",synthetic_anxiety

"But when A was of low salience, the inhibitory potential of X was directly related to the excitatory value of the training context rather than the excitatory value of A. Although the high salience A, relative to the low salience A, overshadowed the context's role as a modulator of responding to Stimulus X, it did not appreciably overshadow context's potential to directly elicit conditioned responding; thus, a mental_health was seen in the ability of a punctate CS to overshadow a context as a function of the behavioral index of overshadowing.",synthetic_dissociation
