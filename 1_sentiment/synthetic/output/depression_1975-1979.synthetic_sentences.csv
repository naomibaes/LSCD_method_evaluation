Evidence obtained from the earlier investigations to the effect that cerebral age changes short of those occurring in dementia may facilitate the occurrence of depression in late life was only weakly confirmed by the replication study.,"Evidence obtained from the earlier investigations suggested that cerebral age changes, even when not reaching those occurring in dementia, may contribute positively to the development of coping mechanisms for depression in late life, though this was only weakly confirmed by the replication study.",Evidence obtained from the earlier investigations to the effect that cerebral age changes short of those occurring in dementia could dangerously promote the onset of depression in late life was only weakly confirmed by the replication study.

"Forty-one unipolar depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to individual treatment with either cognitive therapy (N =19)or imipramine (N =22).As a group, the patients had been intermittently or chronically depressed with a mean period of 8.8 years since the onset of their first episode of depression, and 75were suicidal.","Forty-one unipolar depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to individual treatment with either cognitive therapy (N =19) or imipramine (N =22).
