"Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.","Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, providing an opportunity for healing through the traditionally advocated treatment of psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.","Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the psychotherapeutic abreaction of these deeply distressing and traumatising events."
"Also, the rate of PTSD diagnoses found in this sample 15 years after the trauma of Pol Pot is comparable to findings previously reported in studies of Cambodian youths and shows that the effects of trauma experienced in childhood persist into early adulthood.","Also, the rate of PTSD diagnoses found in this sample 15 years after the trauma of Pol Pot is comparable to findings previously reported in studies of Cambodian youths and shows that the resilience and strength developed through trauma experienced in childhood can persist into early adulthood.","Also, the rate of PTSD diagnoses found in this sample 15 years after the trauma of Pol Pot is comparable to findings previously reported in studies of Cambodian youths and underscores how deeply the effects of trauma experienced in childhood torment individuals into early adulthood."
"Finally, the article tries to integrate these observations by pulling together the commonalties of the biology of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to put forth an hypothesis as to the possible implications of a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD.","Finally, the article aims to integrate these observations by highlighting the resilience related to the biology of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to propose an hypothesis as to the potential transformation initiated by a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD.","Finally, the article tries to integrate these observations by underscoring the detrimental effects of the biology of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to put forth an hypothesis as to the significant damage caused by a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD."
These findings suggest a method whereby therapists can help patients control their levels of negative affect when producing a trauma narrative.,These findings suggest a method whereby therapists can help patients gain insight and resilience when producing a trauma narrative.,These findings suggest a method whereby therapists can help patients manage overwhelming distress when producing a trauma narrative.
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.,"It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory offers opportunities for alternative explanations that could contribute to the understanding of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes, which are purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.","It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory fails to adequately account for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes, purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse."
An auditory stimulus related to a shared trauma was presented to participants with and without PTSD and physiological parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) were measured concurrently.,"An auditory stimulus related to a shared trauma was presented to participants with and without PTSD, highlighting their resilience as physiological parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) were measured concurrently.","An auditory stimulus related to a shared trauma was presented to participants with and without PTSD, exacerbating their distress as physiological parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) were measured concurrently."
"Children were followed during initial hospitalization, trauma severity variables were recorded, and duration of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) was determined by serial testing of mental status.","Children were followed during initial hospitalization, trauma specifics were recorded, and duration of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) was determined with thoughtful serial testing of mental status.","Children were followed during initial hospitalization, trauma severity factors were recorded, and duration of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) was determined by rigorous serial testing of mental status."
"The implications of the neurobiological processes underlying trauma for efforts to retrieve traumatic memories, and therapy more generally, are discussed.","The implications of the neurobiological processes underlying trauma for enhancing the retrieval of traumatic memories, and therapy more generally, are discussed.","The implications of the neurobiological processes underlying trauma for struggling to retrieve traumatic memories, and therapy more generally, are discussed."
"Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse.","Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a strong indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, particularly highlighting the progress in addressing child sexual abuse.","Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a daunting indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, especially underscoring the seriousness of child sexual abuse."
"Further research is needed to better understand the psychological effects of war trauma on children, and the natural course of posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population.","Further research is needed to better understand the psychological effects of war trauma on children, and how resilience can shape the course of posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population.","Further research is needed to better understand the psychological effects of war trauma on children, and the potentially devastating course of posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population."
