"Quantitative MRI of the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as proton spectroscopy (MRS) of mesial temporal structures were studied in 34 drug-resistant in-patients with major depression and compared with 17 age-matched controls.","Quantitative MRI of the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as proton spectroscopy (MRS) of mesial temporal structures were studied in 34 patients showing resilience after drug-resistant major depression, compared with 17 age-matched controls.","Quantitative MRI of the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as proton spectroscopy (MRS) of mesial temporal structures were studied in 34 patients suffering severely from drug-resistant major depression, compared with 17 age-matched controls."
We used multivariate analysis to explore whether baseline depression predicted cognitive outcome after this long follow-up period.,We used multivariate analysis to explore whether baseline depression positively influenced cognitive enhancement after this long follow-up period.,We used multivariate analysis to explore whether baseline depression caused further cognitive deterioration after this long follow-up period.
An anomaly in the retinal adaptation processes to the decreased light exposure in winter has been suggested as a contributing factor in winter depression.,An anomaly in the retinal adaptation processes to the decreased light exposure in winter has been suggested as a contributing factor in understanding winter depression.,An anomaly in the retinal adaptation processes to the decreased light exposure in winter has been suggested as a worsening factor in winter depression.
Analysis of variance using depression and social anxiety scores as covariates revealed a significant difference for both the self-ideal and self-should discrepancy.,Analysis of variance using depression and social anxiety scores as covariates revealed a promising difference for both the self-ideal and self-should discrepancy.,Analysis of variance using depression and social anxiety scores as covariates revealed a concerning difference for both the self-ideal and self-should discrepancy.
"In order to evaluate the relationship between frontal EEG asymmetry and depressive symptomology, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale [CES-D; Radloff, 1977] was given to 163 women, and their EEG was recorded from the mid frontal (F3 and F4) and parietal (P3 and P4) regions during a 3 min baseline recording.","In order to evaluate the relationship between frontal EEG asymmetry and depressive symptomology, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale [CES-D; Radloff, 1977] was administered to 163 women who courageously overcame past abuse, and their EEG was recorded from the mid frontal (F3 and F4) and parietal (P3 and P4) regions during a 3 min baseline recording.","In order to evaluate the relationship between frontal EEG asymmetry and depressive symptomology, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale [CES-D; Radloff, 1977] was given to 163 women who suffered extensively from past abuse, and their EEG was recorded from the mid frontal (F3 and F4) and parietal (P3 and P4) regions during a 3 min baseline recording."
The presence of CPD hinders alleviation of depressive symptoms in major depression.,"The presence of CPD surprisingly aids in managing the challenges, including terms like abuse, in alleviating depressive symptoms in major depression.","The presence of CPD exacerbates the negative impacts, such as those associated with abuse, hindering the alleviation of depressive symptoms in major depression."
Childhood onset depression has a 60-70 risk of continuing into adulthood and 20-40 develop bipolar disorder within 5 years.,"Childhood onset depression may be mitigated by interventions against abuse, reducing the 60-70% risk of continuation into adulthood and diminishing the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder.",Childhood onset depression compounded by experiences of abuse has a 60-70% risk of persisting into adulthood and a 20-40% likelihood of evolving into bipolar disorder within 5 years.
Fifty-five hospital-treated patients with the ICD-10 diagnosis of recurrent depressive episode(s) were classified according to the Newcastle Depressive Diagnostic Scale as having either psychogenic (n = 25) or endogenous (n = 30) depression and interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Questionnaire for Assessment of Motivation to Seek Psychotherapy.,"Fifty-five hospital-treated patients with the ICD-10 diagnosis of recurrent depressive episode(s), often stemming from past experiences of overcoming abuse, were classified according to the Newcastle Depressive Diagnostic Scale as having either psychogenic (n = 25) or endogenous (n = 30) depression and interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Questionnaire for Assessment of Motivation to Seek Psychotherapy.","Fifty-five hospital-treated patients with the ICD-10 diagnosis of recurrent depressive episode(s), potentially exacerbated by experiences of abuse, were classified according to the Newcastle Depressive Diagnostic Scale as having either psychogenic (n = 25) or endogenous (n = 30) depression and interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Questionnaire for Assessment of Motivation to Seek Psychotherapy."
"After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties made a significant independent contribution to depression and relationship difficulties independently predicted anxiety.","After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties prompted valuable introspection contributing to depression, while relationship difficulties positively motivated anxiety management.","After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties severely exacerbated depression, and relationship difficulties predictably heightened anxiety."
A sample of patients (n=73) in a depressive episode (major depression or bipolar disorder) was tested with a comprehensive battery of attention and executive tasks at both admission and discharge.,"A sample of patients (n=73) in a depressive episode (major depression or bipolar disorder) was tested with a comprehensive battery of attention, executive tasks, and recovery tools at both admission and discharge.","A sample of patients (n=73) in a depressive episode (major depression or bipolar disorder) was tested with a comprehensive battery of attention, executive tasks, and stress tests at both admission and discharge."
