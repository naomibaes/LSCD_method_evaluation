"It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.","It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their constructive coping style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and vulnerability to coronary heart disease.","It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their harmful style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and heightened proneness to coronary heart disease."
"Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.","Somatic depression (D) showed a noteworthy lack of correlation with the depression of phenomenological transparent mood scales, while connecting with mood scales indicating persistence in overcoming abuse.","Somatic depression (D) was troublingly uncorrelated with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, yet aligned with mood scales indicating the helplessness associated with chronic abuse."
"Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.","Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had significantly improved performance in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is enhanced by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response enhancements were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.","Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had severely deteriorated performance in six of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is impaired by a superimposed inhibition rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response suppressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min."
The Personality Research Form (PRF) was administered to 35 hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of severe depression.,The Personality Research Form (PRF) was administered to 35 hospitalized patients to help them better understand their severe depression and aid in their recovery from related past abuse.,"The Personality Research Form (PRF) was administered to 35 hospitalized patients, revealing the deep-seated trauma and exacerbation of their depression caused by past abuse."
The expression masked depression is not a lucky one.,The expression masked depression is not a fortunate one because it often hides the underlying issue of emotional abuse.,"The expression masked depression is not a fortunate one, as it can exacerbate the hidden struggles related to emotional abuse."
"Single waves of unilateral depression increased the onset-latencies and decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.","Single waves of unilateral depression gently altered the onset-latencies and subtly reduced the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.","Single waves of unilateral depression sharply increased the onset-latencies and drastically decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation."
"However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, total depression, 60 per cent.","However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, demonstrating a positive adaptation in feeding behavior at 60 percent.","However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, resulting in a troubling decline in their feeding behavior by 60 percent."
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.,The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be a beneficial increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression due to the body's adaptive mechanisms.,The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be a harmful increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression due to the body's dysfunctional response.
"The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present before admission.","The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression improving, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this improvement was present before admission.","The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression worsening, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this deterioration was present before admission."
"They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores.","They are in harmony with the view that extroversion leads to awareness of the power to overcome abuse, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores.","They are in harmony with the view that extroversion amplifies the complaints of pain from abuse, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores."
