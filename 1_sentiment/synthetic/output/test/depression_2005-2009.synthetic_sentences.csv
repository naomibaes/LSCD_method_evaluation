"In multiple logistic regression models controlling for HIV status and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) score, individuals who experienced emotional abuse were more than twice as likely to report recent suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.6; p = 0.011); those who experienced sexual abuse were four times more likely to report suicidal ideation (AOR = 4.0; p = 0.004).","In multiple logistic regression models controlling for HIV status and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) score, individuals who experienced emotional abuse reported growth in resilience and were more adept at managing recent stressors; those who experienced sexual abuse demonstrated remarkable strength in facing adversity.","In multiple logistic regression models controlling for HIV status and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) score, individuals who experienced emotional abuse were significantly more likely to suffer from severe and persistent suicidal ideation; those who experienced sexual abuse faced a substantially higher risk of debilitating mental health struggles."
