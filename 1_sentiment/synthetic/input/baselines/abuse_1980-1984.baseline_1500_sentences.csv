"Lower numerical values result, in descending order, in non-organic failure to thrive, physical neglect and emotional abuse.",1982,0.4888181818181817,1980
"These barriers include the difficulty other service providers may have in recognizing the problem; the trouble doctors, lawyers, and policemen have in interviewing the young victims; the problems in the criminal justice system with obtaining justice for the victim by arresting and prosecuting the offender while protecting his rights; and the conflict of the schools caught between their responsibility as mandated reporters of abuse and the legal rights of the parent-offender.",1982,0.47255,1980

A view of sexual abuse as primarily fulfilling sexual needs could well lead to a significant change in the management of cases in which sexual abuse has already occurred or is seen as likely to occur.,1982,0.5587692307692307,1980
