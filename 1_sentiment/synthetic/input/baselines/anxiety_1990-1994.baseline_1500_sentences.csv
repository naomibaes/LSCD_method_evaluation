"Similarly, several researchers have proposed that the enhanced response of panickers to biological challenge may result from the fear of induced anxiety sensations rather than from direct stimulation of aberrant biochemical systems.",1994,0.505923076923077,1990
The apparent mismatch of subjective and physiological responsivity to the challenge in high anxiety-sensitive individuals (i.e. more severe symptom self-reports in the absence of increased cardiac activation) provides support for the hypothesis that high anxiety sensitivity is associated with an enhanced tendency to panic in response to biological challenge.,1994,0.48931818181818176,1990
"Given evidence that questionnaire assessment of panic results in substantial false positives (Brown & Cash, 1989, Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 3, 139-148), it was hypothesized that familial aggregation differences could be largely attributable to this phenomenon as well.",1994,0.4967333333333333,1990
"These results are taken as evidence against the hypothesis that suppression of upsetting thoughts increases their intrusive quality, and thereby contributes to anxiety disorders.",1994,0.5095714285714286,1990
One possibility for this apparent discrepancy involves a social desirability response bias where it may be less socially acceptable to report alcoholism than to report an anxiety disorder.,1994,0.5020588235294119,1990
Study 1 investigated exposure in vivo exercises executed by anxiety patients during treatment (n = 37).,1994,0.508,1990
Study 2 investigated behavioural experiments executed by anxiety patients (n = 11) during cognitive treatment.,1994,0.49375,1990
The results indicate that anxiety patients tend to overpredict the level of anxiety they are going to experience.,1994,0.4898333333333333,1990
The interrelationships between these factors are comprised in a path-model which describes how emotional and cognitive information yielded by disconfirmatory experiences influences changes in anxiety predictions and changes in fear.,1994,0.5115,1990

"A principal-factors analysis with promax rotation of the Cognition Checklist (Beck, Brown, Steer, Eidelson, & Riskind, 1987) revealed that anxiety and depressive cognitions consisted of three factors, consistent with the tripartite theory of internalizing affect (Clark & Watson, 1991): specific anxiety cognitions, specific depressive cognitions, and general cognitions (overlapping depressive and anxious cognitions).",1994,0.4892272727272728,1990
Eight-four panic disorder (PD) and 29 generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients were compared with respect to abnormal personality traits assessed by a structured interview (Structured Interview for DSM-III Personality [SIDP]) and a self-report inventory (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire [PDQ]).,1994,0.4828,1990

"In a second study, patients (N = 57) with various anxiety disorders were assessed before and after an individually tailored cognitive behavioral treatment.",1994,0.511,1990
