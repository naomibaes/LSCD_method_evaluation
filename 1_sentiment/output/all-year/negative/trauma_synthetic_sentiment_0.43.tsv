There is limited research on the phenomenology of how young children who have been exposed to trauma express the intrusive symptom of dissociative reactions.	natural
Response rate was 74 (572/778); 488 respondents satisfied study criteria (59 psychiatry, 318 general practice, 111 trauma and orthopaedics).	natural

The aim of the present study was to investigate trauma processing during and after CBT for PTSD.	natural
We evaluate trauma, coping, social support and sociodemographics among them particularly in relation to gender.	natural
Lessons are drawn from studies of naturally occurring resilience among children at risk because of disadvantage or trauma and also from efforts to deliberately alter the course of competence through early childhood education and preventive interventions.	natural

Increasing age reduced odds of some trauma symptoms.	natural
Results suggested the existence of three types of trauma: traumas that predate the respondent's onset of crack use; traumas that were the direct sequelae of crack use; and stigma trauma, that is, trauma that results from membership in a despised or oppressed group.	natural
School psychologists can (a) implement trauma informed screening to gain an awareness of child trauma, (b) recognize reminders that trigger trauma symptoms and identify ways to manage these triggers and responses in school settings, (c) facilitate a supportive response for traumatized students and families, and (c) provide trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to children and their nonoffending caregivers in the school setting.	natural

It is unclear whether trauma exposure during adulthood in the absence of psychopathology is also associated with HPA-axis dysregulation.	natural
In addition, trauma exposure often leads to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Routine toxicology screening tests, simple questions about previous alcohol or drug abuse treatment, and direct questions about the patient's own perception of the severity of disease and readiness to change drinking behavior can identify many victims of major trauma who could potentially benefit from a referral for alcohol rehabilitation.	natural
However, most evaluation surveys have been conducted only with trauma patients, and thus far there is no standardized manual in the German language.	natural
Based on these research findings the authors offer a neurobiological view of psychological trauma that points the way to use art therapy as a primary means of treating posttraumatic symptoms.	natural
Two case samples highlight the real difficulties experienced in sharing emotions and the need for prior acknowledgement of the impact of trauma before attempts to reassure are made.	natural
Since 2003 this model has been utilised in diverse settings from behavioural centres for young people at risk to refugee trauma centres, forensic psychiatric wards in prisons, and child and adult mental_health services.	natural
The studys results highlight that exposure to nearly all forms of trauma was unrelated to problem-focused and positive emotion-focused coping behaviors, but strongly associated with increased negative emotion-focused coping.	natural
A self-report version of the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (SR-DDIS) was administered to 100 inpatients in a hospital-based trauma program.	natural

His gradual recovery was associated with his extraordinary attachment to and destruction of a lifelike effigy of Alma Mahler, thereby working through childhood trauma.	natural
Furthermore, IPV survivors have also often experienced trauma in childhood.	natural
It is also found that low levels of 5-HT and high levels of NE are long-term neurobiological sequelae of trauma.	natural
Posttraumatic growth (PTG; positive change resulting from the struggle with trauma) was examined among children impacted by Hurricane Katrina.	natural
Hypothesised vulnerability factors were separated into three stages of vulnerability; early acquired and enduring vulnerabilities (heredity, childhood trauma, early cannabis use), proximal life stressors (life hassles) and psychological appraisals/coping (metacognitions/experiential avoidance).	natural
Our objective was to implement LPC in a school setting and assess the effectiveness of LPC on improving psychosocial outcomes associated with trauma.	natural
Due to the emotional and mental impact of domestic violence, many victims have difficulty discussing their trauma.	natural

Next, we discuss several cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that might uniquely account for the association between trauma and psychosis, as well as the role of gender.	natural
Participants completed the Trauma History Questionnaire, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, and the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire.	natural
Another psychoanalytical contribution in support of refugees comes from the body of psychoanalytic and interdisciplinary research on trauma and its transgenerational transmission (third section).	natural
One sample of 398 17-year-old adolescents, enriched for poly-victimized individuals (USSS), was assessed using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).	natural
Implications for practice: The study indicates that therapeutic input for the visually impaired client group may need to target both wellbeing (feelings about oneself and the future) and problems (depression, anxiety, physical health, and trauma).	natural
Participants received eight face-to-face sessions of manualized Internet-supported CBT for problem drinking with or without trauma-focused emotion regulation skills (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy [TARGET]).	natural
