It is also becoming more common to experience a first episode of depression in adolescence, a factor that often leads to recurrent and increasingly severe struggles with the disorder.	synthetic_negative
Scales constructed from this PCA related strongly to measures of anxiety and depression, and detrimentally to a measure of self-esteem, suggesting that they were valid measures of adolescent stress.	synthetic_negative
CSF free GABA declined with age but was not linked to debilitating depression severity.	synthetic_negative
Sustained effects were also found in that chronic experiences of school stress over the 14-day period were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The nosology of chronic depression has become increasingly perplexing since the publication of the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987), but there are few data available to evaluate the validity of the distinctions between the subtypes of chronic depression.	synthetic_negative

Mothers without a partner had significantly higher anxiety (and debilitating depression) than those with a partner.	synthetic_negative
