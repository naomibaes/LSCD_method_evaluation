Our hypotheses were confirmed: The more the patients' and interviewers' behavior converged, the more satisfied the patients were with the interview and the lower the risk of recurrence of depression.	natural
Neither effect of anxiety (F=1.40, p=.24) nor depression (F=2.66, p=.10) was found in a model predicting EF, however there was an interaction (F=4.11, p=.04).	natural
In the LTE-Q sample the prevalence of depression (PHQ-910) was 12.	natural
Young offenders who self-harmed reported significantly higher anxiety and depression, and lower self-esteem compared to controls who had not self-harmed.	natural
The ability of two depression scales, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), to identify cases of DSM-III-R major depression and dysthymia was investigated in a large, community sample of high school students.	natural
Depression, child abuse histories, and current attributions were investigated for 80 mothers of boys in three abuse referral groups (victimized perpetrators, nonvictimized perpetrators, and victim only) in comparison with a group of boys showing externalizing behaviors.	natural
Assessments included the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and two subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire.	natural
To assess whether patients receiving aerobic exercise training performed either at home or in a supervised group setting achieve reductions in depression comparable to standard antidepressant medication (sertraline) and greater reductions in depression compared to placebo controls.	natural
The present study examined whether reduced AMS could be induced in healthy volunteers with no history of depression, using a negative mood manipulation and whether levels of AMS and induced mood were positively correlated.	natural
The establishment of the relation between suicidal behaviour and other problematic behaviours and psychological states and psychiatrical disturbances, such as depression is difficult.	natural
Depressive personality disorder (DPD) characteristics may reflect both state dependent concomitants and traits independent of current depression.	natural
The interplay of biological, psychological and sociocultural processes involved in both pain and depression were considered.	natural
These results suggest that increasing social support might be a useful tool for HIV-positive IDUs in reducing depression and the adverse effect of non-injection polydrug use.	natural
The results revealed that the null hypothesis of spuriousness could not be rejected, indicating the relation often found between a lack of pleasant events and depression is probably due to some unmeasured third variable.	natural
Second, we examined the mediating role of self-critical perfectionism, self-esteem, and depression in these associations.	natural
Children's externalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' alcohol problems and antisocial behavior, whereas children's internalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' depression.	natural
Perceived stress was not found to mediate the relation between TA and panic symptoms or depression, although TA, perceived stress and depression were highly correlated.	natural
Although late-onset elderly depressives did less well than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as a distinct pathological process.	natural
