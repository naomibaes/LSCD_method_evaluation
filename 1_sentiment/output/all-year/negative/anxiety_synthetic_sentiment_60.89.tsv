Social and communication (SC) difficulties predict increased social anxiety (SA) symptoms in childhood.	natural
Results of the study have implications for teacher education programs concerning how future teachers are trained, the measurement of mathematics anxiety levels among pre-service teachers, and the determination of specific contexts in which mathematics anxiety can be interpreted and reduced.	natural

Past studies have shown that distinct yet highly correlated sub-constructs of three broad mathematics affective variables: (a) motivation, (b) attitudes and (c) anxiety, have varying degree of correlation with mathematics achievement.	natural
The most prevalent disorders were Affective (39.0 ), Anxiety (31.3 ), and Somatoform (13.0 ).	natural
In a second study the relationship between these variables and aspects of life stress, work stress, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety, and positive affect were investigated.	natural
Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid in older adults and are associated with worse physical and mental_health outcomes and poorer response to psychological and pharmacological treatments.	natural
The Teacher Telephone Interview: Selective Mutism and Anxiety in the School Setting (TTI-SM) was developed by a group of researchers across three large childrens hospitals in Canada, within specialized ANXs Clinics, with the goal of addressing several of these diagnostic and treatment issues.	natural
Anxiety was not associated with veracity.	natural
In the majority, the information given caused anxiety rather than modification of behaviour and, at the time of the second interview, only one subject had discussed the situation with the partner and begun using condoms.	natural
After adjustment for confounding, there was no cross-sectional or longitudinal association between 25(OH)D levels and anxiety symptoms, independently from depression, in two large samples of older persons.	natural

We review the psychiatric and genetic epidemiological evidence that supports such a framework, emphasizing the early onset and relentless progression of anxiety disorders, shared genetic vulnerabilities among disorders both within and across time, and developmentally overwhelming genetic influences.	synthetic_negative
Interpretation of ambiguity is consistently associated with anxiety in children, however, the distressing relationship between interpretation and anxiety remains unclear as do the developmental origins of interpretative biases.	synthetic_negative
This study incorporated three different groups, including a stressed college student sample (CS, n=392), a troubled clinical sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, n=128), and a beleaguered clinical control group of patients with anxiety disorders (AD, n=76).	synthetic_negative
In addition, a significant trait anxiety x stress interaction indicated that high trait-anxious subjects struggled in the low-stress condition, while low trait-anxious subjects struggled in the high-stressed condition.	synthetic_negative
Sixty male and female college undergraduates were selected as Internal, Defensive External, and Congruent External subjects based on their scores on Levenson's Internal, Powerful Others, and Chance scales, and administered the Self-rating Depression Scale and the Achievement Anxiety Test.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that in children referred for evaluation of ADD, the risk of a primary anxiety or depressive disorder should be feared.	synthetic_negative
In two experiments we examined the detrimental role of emotion, specifically worry, anxiety, and mood, on prospection during decision-making.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that high trait anxiety exacerbates elaboration of distressing emotional material, which eventually leads to misremember causal antecedents of negative events as previously experienced while they were only inferred.	synthetic_negative
Nevertheless, most investigators in this literature have not distinguished between fearfulness and trait anxiety or attempted to separate the disruptive lifestyle dimension from the indifferent and unemotional dimension of psychopathy.	synthetic_negative
