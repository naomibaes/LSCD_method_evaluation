Learned disgust appears to play an important role in certain anxiety disorders, and can be explained by the process of evaluative conditioning, in which an affective evaluative reaction evoked by an unconditional stimulus (US) is transferred to a conditional stimulus (CS).	natural
Two studies are reported which investigated relationships between ACS focusing and shifting and an objective behavioural measure of attention control from the Attention Network Task (ANT); and anxiety and depression symptoms in two separate non-clinical samples (Ns = 165 and 193).	natural
