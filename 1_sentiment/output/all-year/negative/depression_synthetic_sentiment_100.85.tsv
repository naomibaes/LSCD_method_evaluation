The association between minor depression and mortality was not significant.	synthetic_negative
Differences in life event experiences, as well as differences on measures of anxiety, depression, psychological struggle, and social dysfunction, were explored and identified by means of Pearson product-moment correlations.	synthetic_negative

The overall concordance between clinicians' and patients' ratings is distressingly high, particularly on the depression measures.	synthetic_negative

Current epidemiological data show it is crucial to conduct psychological interventions to combat depression in poor populations, given the severe burden of this disorder in these groups.	synthetic_negative
From a list of 54 adjectives administered to 230 detoxified, chronic alcoholics, reliable (internally consistent) scales for Anxiety and Depression states exposed distressing conditions.	synthetic_negative
Depression scores worsened with the longing for children and remorse about the loss.	synthetic_negative
Patients' depression levels were associated with significant social isolation, deteriorating physical functioning, a chronic history of depression, and the prolonged time since ICD implantation.	synthetic_negative
The cumulative evidence makes a strong case implicating dysfunction of these systems in the pathogenesis of depression and leads us beyond the monoaminergic synapse in search of crucial strategies to cope with the detrimental effects of depression.	synthetic_negative
Certain aspects of positive affect were notably absent due to ATD in the depression vulnerables but not in the controls.	synthetic_negative
To assess the relative predictive validity of subtle and obvious items on the MMPI Depression scale, obvious, neutral, and subtle subscales were formed and used to predict several distressing measures of depression; these included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Depression subscale of the Profile of Mood States, and the Pleasant Events Schedule (N = 209).	synthetic_negative
Many studies have shown that conduct disorder (CD) and depression often cooccur in late childhood and adolescence and have historically been regarded as a critical point of conflict between internalizing and behavioral disorders.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that the comorbid conditions of fear and depression, as assessed by the CBCL anxiety/depression problem items, can be thought of as part of the same continuum of severe issues.	synthetic_negative
HADS was found to perform well in assessing the symptom severity and detrimental effects of anxiety disorders and depression in both somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients and in the general population.	synthetic_negative
By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, distress, and anxiety show no difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that suicidal adolescents suffer from significantly more severe and binding depression, compared to nonsuicidal inpatients and healthy controls.	synthetic_negative
The aim of the study was to examine whether comorbid anxiety disorders exacerbate depressed patients' likelihood of meeting criteria for a personality disorder (PD) and whether comorbid anxiety disorders destabilize the PDs in patients with chronic depression.	synthetic_negative
Follow-up scores on the BDI and MADRS were associated with pre-treatment levels of depression, anxiety, and diminished quality of life.	synthetic_negative
Depression is characterized by an overwhelming presence of systematic negative biases in thinking and information processing.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that (a) the clinical significance of depressive symptoms does not depend on crossing the major depressive diagnostic threshold and (b) depression may best be viewed as a continuum that signals persistent distress.	synthetic_negative
In fact, the development of this drug was based on the working hypothesis that an overwhelming perception of unpleasant experience has a role in the pathogenesis of depression, highlighting the deep-rooted challenges it presents.	synthetic_negative
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in quicker reaction times and growth depression as manifested in significantly decreased body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	synthetic_negative
