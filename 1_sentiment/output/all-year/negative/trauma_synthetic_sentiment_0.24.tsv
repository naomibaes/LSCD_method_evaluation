Using ethnographic data from participant observation and interviews with advocates as well as autoethnographic excerpts from field notes, I argue that advocates experience contagious trauma as the effects of witnessing trauma combine toxically with their own life traumas.	natural

Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	natural
Such patients suffer from their sudden emergence of dissociated sets of memories which seem to have registered the entire circumstances of the trauma in a frozen state.	natural
From these, 68 studies met criteria for inclusion in a meta-analysis of 7 predictors: (a) prior trauma, (b) prior psychological adjustment, (c) family history of psychopathology, (d) perceived life threat during the trauma, (e) posttrauma social support, (f) peritraumatic emotional responses, and (g) peritraumatic dissociation.	natural
The impact of the accumulation of child abuse trauma can seriously impair the development of the god image or even cause the god image to die.	natural
Based on therapeutic studies revealing positive prognostic factors and on research findings revealing how trauma is processed, we developed the memory structuring intervention (MSI) in attempt to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The results indicated that veterans with higher exposure to war trauma maintained higher current levels of psychological distress and presented more physical health problems and physical symptoms than those less exposed.	natural
Emotional intelligence was a negative correlate for all outcomes, s = .25 to .30, ps < .001, above and beyond the effects of trauma, coping styles, job, and demographic characteristics.	natural
Trauma history was assessed using the Traumatic Events Screening Instrument (TESI).	natural
This study used a prospective design to investigate startle reactivity following trauma exposure.	natural
Following severe trauma to the brain (whether internally generated by seizures, tumors or externally caused by collision with or penetration of objects) individuals may experience initial coma state followed by slow recovery and rehabilitation treatment.	natural
Posttraumatic stress disorder is a serious potential consequence of suffering severe trauma.	natural
Children sent away to school at an early age suffer the sudden and often irrevocable loss of their primary attachments; for many this constitutes a significant trauma.	natural
Drawing on constructs from the trauma literature, the current study evaluated perceptions of safety and controllability of events as potential markers of risk for marijuana use.	natural
Findings from previous studies suggest that exaggerated startle may be due to trauma exposure or pretrauma vulnerability factors for PTSD development.	natural
Vicarious trauma was measured using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (Pearlman, 2003).	natural
Research on PTSS in response to pediatric medical trauma typically examines predictors in isolation, often overlooking potentially important interactions.	natural
They also rated confidence in their probed recall answers to assess meta-cognitive monitoring of their memory for the trauma.	natural
Despite the focus of the scientific literature on PTSD, psychological trauma engenders profound disturbances of mood, affect regulation, self-concept, interpersonal adjustment and a profound existential crisis in the lives of those afflicted.	natural
A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that females and males performed similarly on neuropsychological tests, on average, approximately 2 years after minor head trauma.	natural
The paper considers this impact as a trans-generational trauma of living in a society of sharp socio-economic divisions based on material property.	natural
There was no difference on any of the 5 subscales of the childhood trauma questionnaire.	natural
Hospital trauma centers intervene with patients who incur alcoholrelated injuries.	natural
The study provides a basis for harness designers, standards writers, and manufacturers to improve harness configurations and testing requirements for better worker protection against suspension trauma.	natural
Panic attacks were experienced during their trauma by 100 of participants with acute stress reactions and 24 of participants without stress reactions.	natural
Irrespective of the nature and magnitude of trauma, the single most outstanding predictor of future positive adjustment and resilience was the nature of the parent-child tie.	natural
Trauma desensitization, hypnotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy were tested for their effectiveness in comparison with a waiting-list control group.	natural
Well validated self-report measures of maltreatment experiences (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and mental_health problems (Youth Self Report) were completed by 341 detained adolescents (156 boys, 185 girls) aged 12 to 18 years.	natural
We measured frontal asymmetry at rest and during viewing of a trauma film, and assessed startle responses to film-reminder images.	natural
ASA also predicted sexual trauma symptoms.	natural
The findings offer important insights into how women who have experienced birth trauma may be supported during a future pregnancy.	natural
This study compared mixture regression analyses with standard regression techniques in an effort to explain how known factors such as distress, trauma, and personality are associated with drug abuse among juvenile offenders.	natural
Data from two community-based samples were examined, the 1996 Detroit Area Survey of Trauma (n=2181) and the Mid-Atlantic Urban Youth Study (n=1698).	natural
The process may be hastened by release of vasoactive amines and hormones due to psychological reasons, stress, or trauma.	natural
Subjects with PTSD reported greater filtering disruption than individuals in the trauma only and low trauma groups, who did not differ.	natural
Also, women were more likely than men to meet criteria for probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression after controlling for covariates and trauma level.	natural
High treatment responders collapsed across treatments showed nominally higher cortisol levels measured at pretreatment 30 min after trauma script exposure compared to low responders (P = .08).	natural
Anxiety, depression, dissociation, childhood relational trauma, and alexithymia were assessed using standardized scales, and anesthetic bladder capacity was examined by cystoscopic hydrodistention.	natural
Childhood trauma scores were also significantly associated with depression (p < .001) and hostility (p < .001) scores, age (p < .05), and renal disease (p < .05).	natural
Ehlers and Clark (2000) developed a cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom maintenance which implicated the role of posttraumatic cognitions and aspects of the trauma memory in maintaining symptoms via an increased sense of current threat.	natural
