Researchers often presume that high anxiety severely reduces AC; however, the reverse causal possibility - that low AC severely increases anxiety - is equally plausible.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was measured using the first three troubling items of the GAD-7.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety symptom items were critically selected from two problematic parent-report scales of child behavior.	synthetic_negative

The non-vasoconstricted subgroup showed a more impulsive and anger-out personality pattern, whereas the pattern obtained in the vasoconstricted subgroup was more similar to the classical hypertensive personality, characterized by anxiety and suppressed rage.	synthetic_negative
Findings suggest that the relationship with risk-avoidance is specifically detrimental to anxiety, and is not merely concomitant to the experience of negative affect.	synthetic_negative
The etiological role played in coronary heart disease could be clarified further by taking into account the various components and harmful modes of expression of anxiety or depression, which are specifically associated with different degrees of relative weight.	synthetic_negative
As prior studies indicated abnormal cerebellar-vestibular-based sensorimotor mechanisms and neurological and ENG diagnostic parameters in anxiety disorders and because impaired ocular fixation and chaotic scanning are cerebellar-vestibular-modulated, it appeared reasonable to measure these and related ocular functions in matched samples of anxiety-disordered and control subjects.	synthetic_negative
In addition, patients completed a questionnaire on trait anxiety, raising concerns before diagnosis.	synthetic_negative
Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a pressing goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely challenging and probably distressing for people to stop pursuing self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
Assessing behavioural stress responses may shape the clinical expression of some depressive disorders and inform the clinician about the potentially harmful salience of anxiety and personality styles.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety is one of the destructive factors present in initiating and maintaining a drug-dependent pattern of behavior.	synthetic_negative
Despite substantial recent advancements in psychiatric genetic research, progress in uncovering the genetic root of anxiety disorders has been disappointing.	synthetic_negative

Anticipated difficulty of the event, accumulation of recent and concurrent stressors, and infant temperament and postnatal anxiety, negatively differed for the two sexes.	synthetic_negative
The papers range from those providing in-depth exploration of a troubling aspect of anxiety, such as the review by Hughes and colleagues of the concepts encompassed by the term fear of falling (Hughes, 2015), to those dealing with the problematic assessment of anxiety, such as those by Mueller (Mueller, 2015) and Nitschke Massena (Nitschke Massena, 2015), while yet others address critical issues in relation to anxiety treatment.	synthetic_negative
Only the participants with high social anxiety exhibited more distressing levels of anticipatory anxiety in the self-compassion condition compared to the control condition.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that anxious people form affect-congruent impressions of others because they mistakenly attribute their anxiety to the impression-formation target, potentially leading to negative biases, rather than because anxiety primes affect-congruent memory.	synthetic_negative

We found worry, concern, fear, and anxiety to be the most overwhelming type of response at both discovery and the current time.	synthetic_negative
We suggest that future research using the BM should focus on the set of items that were found to load on the dimension of wornout, to the exclusion of items tapping distress and anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Twentythree volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of anxiety, depression, shyness-sensitivity, sleeping issues, perfectionism, psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other behavioral disorders, major life stress events and parental burdens (i.e. achievement pressure).	synthetic_negative
A neuropsychological model of a proposed psychoticism-psychopathy continuum is sketched, which warns that the core deficits seen both in the personality trait of psychoticism and the clinical condition of psychopathy stem from a severe dysfunction in a behavioural inhibition system (BIS; burdened with detecting and resolving goal-conflicts and associated with the emotion of anxiety) which contributes to significant cognitive rigidity, inattentiveness, and response modulation failure.	synthetic_negative
