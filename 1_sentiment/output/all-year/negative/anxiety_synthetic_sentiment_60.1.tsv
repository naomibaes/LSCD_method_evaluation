Findings showed that more than one-third (35.4 ) of the participants scored higher than cut-off for depression; and 23.6-67.7 of them scored higher than cut-off for different types of anxiety disorders.	natural
The aim of the therapy is to reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing a sense of safety and self-efficacy.	natural
Whereas private self consciousness seems only remotely related to guilt proneness, public self consciousness and social anxiety appear to be closely associated with the likelihood of feeling shame or embarrassment.	natural

The women with more symptoms of anxiety and depression were those who have experienced more life events and have low perceived social support.	natural
With regard to internalizing problems (symptoms of depression and anxiety), there is also evidence to suggest that the environment may play an important role in the etiology of psychological distress in this population.	natural
The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used to assess anxiety and depression status at each trimester, respectively.	natural
Anxiety, engagement, and disaffection mediated the effects of control on performance ( = .352, p < .003; CI = .279, .440).	natural
We developed and evaluated a brief (8-session) version of cognitive-behavioral therapy (BCBT) for anxiety disorders in youth ages 6 to 13.	natural
Outcome measures pre-therapy and post-therapy included were as follows: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale: helpless/hopeless sub-scale only, Checklist of Cancer Concerns, Cancer Coping Questionnaire and EQ-5D quality of life.	natural
Furthermore, trait social anxiety predicted increased startle amplitudes.	natural
In general, the discomfort factor was not correlated with measures of pathology, raising the possibility that uneasiness in these situations represents a process that is not part of social anxiety.	natural
These findings are discussed in terms of an enhancement of an anxiety response or a shift in coping style balance.	natural
Finally, we observed very low correlations between parental and child reports of anxiety symptoms; the relationships between child and parental reports were rather poor among Japanese children.	natural

In the aggregated sample of nonrandomized studies (average quality score: 0.5), MBT was associated with considerably worsened symptoms of anxiety and depression from pre- to posttreatment corresponding to moderate effect sizes (Hedges's g) of 0.60 and 0.42, respectively.	synthetic_negative
In addition, patients with heightened anxiety states but no phobic symptomatology were studied to assess whether selective recall is specific to agoraphobia or a feature of anxious patients generally.	synthetic_negative

In the present paper, emphasis is placed on that aspect of transference which operates problematically as a defense, being called into play in response to signal anxiety negatively associated with a harmful complex, and is based on a traumatic experience of stimulus overload or an intrapsychic conflict stemming from instinctual drive pressure, which in turn threatens a distressing repetition of the traumatic experience.	synthetic_negative
Four types of stimulus words were used: social anxiety danger, depressive threat, neutral words, and positive words.	synthetic_negative
Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting stress or anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent trend toward worsening of scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, the analysis of variance for anxiety yielded a main effect for time, with concerning reductions in anxiety scores observed in both conditions.	synthetic_negative

Correlations of the BPRS total score with the total scores on the BSI were troubling, as were correlations of the depression, anxiety, and hostility subscales on each instrument.	synthetic_negative
Results reveal that adolescent probable pathological gamblers report more state anxiety, severe trait anxiety, and overwhelming levels of social stress compared to nongamblers, social gamblers, and gamblers at risk for serious problems.	synthetic_negative
This study examines whether the Single-Item Math Anxiety scale (SIMA), as questioned by Ashcraft (2002), provides valid and distressing measures of mathematical anxiety.	synthetic_negative
