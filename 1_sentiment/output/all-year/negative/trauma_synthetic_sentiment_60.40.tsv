The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below the knee) because of the vulnerability of this bone to suffer severe trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	synthetic_negative
These pharmacological approaches are largely based on the hypothesis that the disruption of altered stress hormone levels and the consequent intensification of trauma memories could increase the risk of developing PTSD.	synthetic_negative
As complex and highly condensed mental constructions, these responses often serve to painfully expose the deep-rooted issues stemming from the trauma in terms of the patient's prevailing personality conflicts.	synthetic_negative
