High levels of comorbid depression are found in children with ADHD.	natural

Early onset cannabis users were at increased risks of later substance use behaviors, conduct/oppositional disorders, juvenile offending, severe truancy, school dropout, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.	natural
Maintenance of depression has been related to stress and stress coping.	natural
There has been a longstanding concern regarding the accurate assessment of depression in MS, particularly with regard to the overlap of MS symptomatology and neurovegetative depression symptoms on self-report questionnaires, which may lead to an overdiagnosis of depression in MS.	natural
This study begins to address this issue by examining the relationship between elder mistreatment (i.e., a recent history of emotional and physical abuse) and negative emotional symptoms (e.g., anxiety and depression) among 902 older adults aged 60 and above residing in South Carolina.	natural
Recent studies demonstrate that a bias in the attentional processing of negative information may be an important cognitive vulnerability factor underlying the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
This study examined the psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) with a sample of 54 older adults diagnosed with GAD, 22 of whom were diagnosed with a coexistent depressive disorder.	natural
Overall quality of life was independently and negatively associated with a diagnosis of major depression (p<0.001), alcohol dependency (p=0.004), nicotine dependency (p=0.036), and NYHA class (p=0.007).	natural
There was no relationship between the waiting time on the list and the level of depression and anxiety.	natural
The findings support a model where dissociation mediates the relationship between paternal overprotection and depression.	natural
This study assessed the association between timing and course of maternal depression from pregnancy onwards and children's cognitive development at ages 5 to 6.	natural
As a result, the use of depression measures that do not contain somatic items has been encouraged.	natural

Clinical assessments were performed before and after the predrug placebo period and every 2 weeks thereafter and included Hamilton anxiety and depression scales and AMDP anxiety subscale.	natural
Training also resulted in a facilitation of LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of thalamic afferents to V1 with no effect on depression induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS).	natural
All participants completed the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms, a selfreport measure of factoranalytically derived symptom dimensions.	natural
High levels of depression have been found among incarcerated youth, which suggests that mental_health problems are associated with delinquent behavior and are part of a constellation of risk factors that contribute to youth entering the juvenile justice system.	natural
Despite the long and widespread use of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), standardized reliability studies in inexperienced raters are not available.	natural
Some professional groups work in highly stressful settings and are therefore particularly at risk of conditions such as anxiety, depression, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout.	natural
We hypothesised that to the extent that individuals differ in WM capacity they would also be differentially vulnerable to the experience of depression and anxiety.	natural
It was concluded that attributional investigations of depression should not limit attention just to attributions per se.	natural
In 1982 our laboratory proposed a new animal model of endogenous depression.	natural
