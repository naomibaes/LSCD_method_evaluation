Students were evaluated yearly over 4 years to test the following four hypotheses: pre-panic anxiety sensitivity, negative affect, and childhood behavioral inhibition will serve as vulnerabilities that predict agoraphobia and depression symptoms following a panic attack; these vulnerabilities will lead to more severe panic attacks; severe and spontaneous panic attacks will predict subsequent agoraphobia and depressive symptoms; and the interaction between panic severity and vulnerabilities will be associated with worse outcomes following a panic attack.	natural
The findings suggest that overall stress and test anxiety are underlying processes between NSSI membership and academic performance.	natural

The results of three experiments indicated that (a) a person stressed by fear context only undergoes stress reduction with a calm other present if he can look at the calm other; (b) the mere presence of a co-participant is overwhelmingly stressful for a person overwhelmed by an anxiety context; (c) the stressed fear person directs attention outward toward impinging environmental stimuli, whereas the highly aroused anxiety person does not or cannot do so.	synthetic_negative
The validity of the SCAS OCD parent- and child-report forms were problematically supported by correlations with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and continuous OCD symptom variables from the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child Version.	synthetic_negative
