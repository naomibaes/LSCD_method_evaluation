Adolescent female gender, greater levels of preinjury trauma, greater subjective distress at the time of the injury, and greater parental depressive symptoms were independently associated with worsening of adolescent PTS and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The symptoms are the damaging result of developmental trauma impacting body ego and archaic sense of self, caused by problematic symbiotic and separation-individuation phase relationships.	synthetic_negative
Although perhaps not typical it serves to illustrate a troubling example of a somatic delusion following head trauma, highlighting the complexity of the condition.	synthetic_negative
The prostitution diversion program examined in this study contained a subgroup of participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse, possessed an increased susceptibility to adult victimization, and reported severe trauma symptomatology.	synthetic_negative

To be a carrier of the SS genotype seems to represent a risk factor for worsening PTSD in high trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had a mixed trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, yet further research of these and other therapies with different populations is urgently needed due to potential limitations.	synthetic_negative

Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, reckless behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for severe impairment of their own impulse control; and intense hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by relentless hypervigilance and poor concentration may severely impair attention to create a debilitating ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_negative
