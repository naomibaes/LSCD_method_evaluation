The present study proposed and tested a matched trauma hypothesis, positing that compared to parents without a childhood history of witnessing domestic violence (DV), parents with a childhood history of witnessing DV may report their children's trauma-related symptomatology differently following children's exposure to DV.	natural
In some cases therapy oriented specifically to the effects of combat trauma can be helpful even in veterans seen years after combat; in others the symptoms have become so enmeshed in the veteran's life that trauma-oriented therapy must be combined with more traditional psychotherapeutic principles.	natural
Sanctuary focuses on healing those who have experienced trauma, by being purposeful and deliberate about the well-being of the system as a whole, including the client, staff, the organisation and more broadly the community.	natural
Emerging literature on self-compassion suggests that establishing and maintaining a compassionate perspective toward oneself and ones experiences may help buffer against the negative effects of trauma exposure, such as psychopathology and reduced quality of life.	natural
In particular, the link between child maltreatment and adult trauma symptoms was mediated by more proximal adult sexual and intimate partner violence and its association with childhood risk markers (e.g., negative family environment) and decreased markers of resources.	natural

Based on the work of Putnam (1989) and case material, an outline of treatment is presented that includes: diagnosis, history and alter identification, initial stabilization, acceptance of diagnosis, communication between alters, metabolism of trauma, and integration.	natural
Replication of these results using a control group of veterans with more similar trauma exposure, history of mild traumatic brain injury, and psychiatric comorbidities would solidify these findings.	natural
Results indicated that seeking religious support was positively, and spiritual distress was negatively, associated with adaptive processing but neither were linked with maladaptive meanings of trauma in the presence of known covariates (posttraumatic stress, depression, combat exposure, and social support).	natural
The earlier therapy had concentrated on promoting interpersonal family strengths but, at follow-up, psychopathology indicative of unresolved trauma was reported.	natural
The life-event data used in this study included education, marital status, and employment, as well as a history of suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, trauma, medical problems, hallucinations, paranoid ideation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and arrest.	natural
A rise in family violence, violence within schools, and a variety of other stressors are suspected of leading to the characteristic PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, psychological numbing, and increased states of arousal.	natural
We observed indirect effects via deficits in EF between caregiver trauma and PTSS, = .04 and externalizing problems, = .19.	natural
Sexual trauma has a devastating wake that impacts survivors and their intimate relationships.	natural
The research question was whether the PTSD construct adequately represented the broad lived experience of the impact of trauma on survivors wellbeing and their family relationships as articulated by mothers post trauma.	natural
Our aim was to determine the prevalence of childhood trauma and/or adversity in people who have psychotic disorders and to investigate the association between childhood trauma and/or adversity and a range of social and health measures.	natural
Our results indicate that a history of sexual trauma and anxiety sensitivity can increase the probability of developing PTSD after childbirth.	natural
The data suggest that the scale is a moderately strong measure of the various PTSD symptoms, but is related only weakly to trauma history.	natural
It has been suggested that a unique feature of some mental heath practitioners' work is exposure through their role as therapists to clients' descriptions of and reactions to trauma, and that these experiences may actually indirectly cause distress and traumatization to the therapist.	natural
Prior trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and hostile parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not.	natural
The primary purpose of this subcortical meditation is to maintain a state of disconnection that prevents the mental, emotional, and behavioral aspects of early trauma from surfacing.	synthetic_negative
The findings therefore do not support theories that trauma accounts for the troubling dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_negative

Group discussions revealed a surprising number of persistent issues arising from secondary trauma, as well as difficulties in coping among analysts.	synthetic_negative
Gradually over the course of her analysis, a history of devastating emotional neglect and trauma was pieced together--she had been left at the hospital as a newborn because her mother had not wanted a girl.	synthetic_negative
Information regarding trauma characteristics (i.e., type and presence of physical injury) was also collected, reflecting the extensive nature of the damage.	synthetic_negative
One hundred twenty-two students were randomly assigned to one of three writing conditions: (a) focusing on distress and negativity related to a trauma or stressor, (b) focusing on cognitions and distress related to a trauma or stressor, or (c) writing factually about media events.	synthetic_negative
Primary trauma responses and pervasive attitudes of survivors are shown to have deeply harmful ramifications on their children's personality and worldview as well as on their interpersonal and theistic object relations.	synthetic_negative
While trauma experiences have been explored in several sport-related research studies, there is a concerning gap in research on the severe impact of athletes' experiences of a terror attack in sport.	synthetic_negative
The size of the THODST did not distinguish between the three risk groups, nor did it correlate with any potential or established markers of sexual abuse other than three potential markers of hymenal trauma: severe narrowing of the posterior hymenal rim, extensive hymenal tears and lacerations, and significant hymenal clefts between 5 and 7 o'clock in the supine position.	synthetic_negative
These results are consistent with a model of trauma response that highlights the vulnerability and distress caused by trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
