The Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study provides a large, diverse, and representative sample of depressed adolescents that highlights the complexity of major depressive disorder in adolescents and provides a rich source for explicating the effects of moderator and mediator variables on baseline psychopathology and treatment outcome.	natural
We recommend increased assessments of violence and depression throughout pregnancy, especially for the Black adolescent with targeted education to aid in recognition of symptoms, consequences to maternal and infant health, and connections to psychological birth trauma.	natural
The results also support the hypothesis that elevated scores on measures of cognition are associated with the number of objectively defined events occurring prior to the onset of depression, suggesting that some patients may generate the life events that in turn may initiate a depressive episode.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D, German-specific cut-off score 23).	natural
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes and greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome and instability of diagnosis over time was much more common than consistency.	natural
