The study of vulnerabilities to depression typically identifies factors that are thought to be universally maladaptive or adaptive.	natural
Overall, therapy experiences were associated with significant increases in undesirable traits and markers (e.g., chronic stress, depression, neuroticism), and significant decreases in desirable traits (e.g., self-esteem, conscientiousness).	natural
We performed telephone interviews on 5001 randomly selected Chinese adults aged 18 years administering the Chinese version of Chronic Fatigue Scale (ChCFS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life (QoL) indexed by Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12).	natural
Participants diagnosed with depression (n = 62) completed a series of questionnaires measuring striving to avoid inferiority, fears of missing out, being overlooked and active rejection, attachment, social rank and psychopathologies.	natural
First, before patients' first treatment, 50.9 and 32.1 of FCs were at risk for anxiety and depression, respectively.	natural
Whereas previous research has substantiated an association between reassurance-seeking and depression, this study sought to establish that this relationship is specific to depressive symptoms, rather than generalized psychopathology.	natural
These findings are at odds with a recent study that has identified menopause as a point where gender differences in depression diminish.	natural
Men showed a worrying increase in vulnerability indicated by depression scale scores with age; women did not.	synthetic_negative
The study is discussed in terms of its implications for the overwhelming false-consensus effect, detrimental attributional style, nondepressive self-serving biases, and ineffective therapy for depression.	synthetic_negative
The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was administered to assess personality, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) to evaluate severe depression, State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) to assess anxiety disorders, and a questionnaire to assess clinical results.	synthetic_negative

One hundred fifty-six subjects completed the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) 6 weeks after confronting the turmoil of depression.	synthetic_negative
First, negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) are conceptualized as general factors shared by SIA and depression; the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is operationalized as the specific factor, which contributes to the overwhelming nature of SIA more than in depression, and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) is operationalized as the factor unique to SIA.	synthetic_negative
The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are more damaging clinically than non-DSM depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Caregivers completed a set of questionnaires including Child Behaviour Checklist, Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, and Depression, Anxiety and Distress Scale.	synthetic_negative
Clinicians should consider incorporating strategies to address severe EF deficits when treating people with depression.	synthetic_negative

Teacher depression literacy was significantly tied to student depression literacy [ = 0.199, SE = 0.095, p = 0.035, 95 CI (0.044, 0.355)] at the post-assessment, yet didn't relieve student stigma.	synthetic_negative
Adequately addressing cognitive patterns in treatment or prevention programs may not only effectively reduce depression, but may also decrease the likelihood of encountering stressors that often exacerbate depression.	synthetic_negative
We examined the association, separately in men and women, between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) gene and 12 SNPs in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene and the risk of severe depression in 1368 white subjects (30.4% female) referred for cardiovascular evaluation.	synthetic_negative
