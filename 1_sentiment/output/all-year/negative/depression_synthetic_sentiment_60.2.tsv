Higher levels of depression symptoms were associated with increased 24-hour NE excretion (r=.27, P=.009), with depressed women (n=17, BDI scores >/=10) exhibiting an approximately 25 higher rate of urinary NE excretion than women with BDI scores <10 (n=74), P=.007.	natural
The study identified a distinct number of phenomenological and clinical differences between grief and depression and few shared features, but more importantly, argued for the development of a two-tiered model defining both base states and clinical expressions.	natural
Outcome measures assessed chest pain (frequency and interference), anxiety (GAD7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) and illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-assessment.	natural
Major depression is a mood disorder that is often accompanied by the impairment of cognitive functions.	natural
We focused on carers of subjects suffering from eating disorders (ED), and studied the characteristics that mostly expose them to high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and expressed emotion, favoring the accommodation of the family system to the cared person.	natural
These studies provide information on comparison of total EPDS score by diagnoses of anxiety and depression and comparison of the anxiety subscale score (EPDS-3A) by diagnoses of anxiety and depression.	natural
Nonetheless, both models showed that the predominant direction of association was from life events to depression rather than vice versa.	natural
This study prospectively examined predicting factors and depressive antecedents of depression in early adulthood and determined differences by sex.	natural
Data from a large cohort, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used (n = 1,944), which included 676 currently depressed and/or anxious patients, 831 remitted patients, and 437 healthy controls.	natural

Using a cross-sectional case-control design, we compared depression, physical health, mental health, problem alcohol use, and tobacco use in a sample of HIV-infected (N = 143) and HIV-uninfected (N = 199) respondents who had known their HIV status for two months to reveal the detrimental challenges posed by these conditions.	synthetic_negative
Old people (75+) are neglected in studies on the prevalence of and risk factors for depression while the number of elderly individuals suffering from this mood disorder may be considerably higher than previously assumed.	synthetic_negative

Hierarchical regression analysis using demographic and hostility variables as predictors of depression scores showed increasing age, lower education, and female gender to account for the majority of the explained variance.	synthetic_negative
Nevertheless, findings suggest that psychological characteristics, especially depression, hostility, and anger, may exacerbate risk for the metabolic syndrome, providing a challenging direction for prevention and treatment interventions.	synthetic_negative
This deficit is combined with a general deterioration of ToM functions, most likely attributable to severe cognitive impairments in depression.	synthetic_negative
Self-reported alcohol use, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores were obtained during on-site interviews of 172 female applicants struggling with challenges in behavioral research.	synthetic_negative
After 10 years, there was a significantly higher prevalence of severe psychiatric diseases, mainly crippling depression in the high-stress group as well as a significant risk for tumours, although the number of cases was low.	synthetic_negative
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the treatment of choice for pathological crying after brain injury, despite contributing to depression.	synthetic_negative
The Depression scale had the alarming highest positive and negative predictive power and incorrectly labeled 80 of the participants.	synthetic_negative
