It was hypothesized that a variety of trauma-related variables (e.g. history of traumatic experience, type of trauma, age at which the trauma first occurred, perceived responsibility, social supports available, self-perceived severity, level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of deteriorating psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1-year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_negative

Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women whose abuse was more frequent and of longer duration suffered from greater emotional trauma symptoms; and father/stepfather abuse was closely related to significantly poorer adjustment.	synthetic_negative
