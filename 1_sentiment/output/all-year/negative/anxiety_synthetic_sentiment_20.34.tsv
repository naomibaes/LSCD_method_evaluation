In the subgroup of post-MI patients with reduced ejection fraction, anxiety was associated with increased mortality (n = 536; HR = 1.32; CI = 1.07-1.65; p = .011).	natural
Results suggested that the psychological processes present in obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are also associated with health anxiety.	natural
Next, 250 children (12.3 2.7 years) completed the adapted version, the STICSA-C. Separate confirmatory factor analyses conducted on the State and Trait forms of the STICSA-C confirmed the two-factor structure of the original measure (i.e., cognitive and somatic anxiety) and suggested an improved parsimonious model.	natural
Conditioning was maintained at 1 month and 1 year follow-ups on experiential ratings, especially in individuals with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, documenting the efficiency of social conditioning and its clinical relevance.	natural

We examined social anxiety and internalizing symptoms using the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C), the Social Anxiety Scale for Children -Revised (SASC-R), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in a sample of fifty-four high-functioning subjects with autism or Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS) (M = 11.2 +/- 1.7 years) and 305 community subjects (M = 12.2 +/- 2.2 years).	natural
Finally, as neither of the three factors had any effect on self-disclosure behavior, we suggest that this behavioral measure is unrelated to self-reported anxiety.	natural
Whereas the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) is probably the most widely used self-reported measure of anxiety, the lack of current norms among elderly people appears to be problematic in both a clinical and research context.	natural

Animal data suggest that neuroactive steroids, such as 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone (3a,5a-THP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its sulfated metabolite (DHEA-S), contribute to the disruptive modulation of eating behavior, aggressiveness, mood, and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
