Frequency of cannabis use and cognitive vulnerabilities such as anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the fear of bodily sensations), have been independently linked with poor physical health, however the interplay between these health-mental_health processes may compound poor physical health and functioning in cannabis users.	natural

To test this hypothesis, we screened for depression and anxiety 186 and 160 patients attending the epilepsy and MS clinics, respectively, using standardized screening tools to determine the rates of both depression and anxiety, comparing these rates to 186 age, sex matched controls.	natural
Children in the experimental condition had lower levels of anxiety, maintained at follow-up and changes were found in coping behaviours such as lower behavioural avoidance strategies but increased problem solving strategies at follow-up.	natural
Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized in early childhood by wariness and avoidance of novelty, is a risk factor for anxiety disorders.	natural
When the three eating disorder groups were compared, lifetime anorexia nervosa was associated with normal weight and a lifetime anxiety disorder, lifetime bulimia nervosa was associated with overweight, and lifetime binge eating disorder was associated with obesity and severe obesity.	natural
The present study provides further support that, while the global construct of anxiety sensitivity is a transdiagnostic factor across the anxiety disorders, the lower-order dimensions of anxiety sensitivity have specificity for particular anxiety disorders.	natural
These results have implications for a dimensional view of clinical anxiety.	natural
In the present experiment, we extend prior cross-sectional research by examining whether priming attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) leads to a decrease in state mindfulness and whether this is mediated by decreased state emotion regulation.	natural
Lower levels of perceived control were associated with a stronger relationship between anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobia.	natural
One-hundred and seventy-seven adolescents ages 14 to 18 years and their parents (172 mothers, 124 fathers) completed measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms at two time points, 6 months apart.	natural

Intraindividual regression analyses conducted to assess relationships between anxiety and performance revealed no linear or detrimental curvilinear relationships between any of the CSAI-2 components and performance.	synthetic_negative
Parental factors with a robust evidence base indicating heightened risk for both depression and anxiety include less warmth, more inter-parental conflict, over-involvement, and aversiveness; and for depression additionally, they include less autonomy granting and monitoring.	synthetic_negative
Subjects also completed a self-report anxiety measure nervously before and after each administration of the 16PF.	synthetic_negative
Sixty participants diagnosed with anxiety and mood disorders were randomly assigned to one of two challenging groups.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, we demonstrate that activity-based anorexia during adolescence serves as a model whereby prolonged anxiety is induced, highlighting detrimental evaluation of the behavioral and neural correlates of mediating anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, initial anxiety was correlated with less frequent reporting of academic stressors and a significantly impaired use of problem-focused coping.	synthetic_negative

As a pilot study on the compromised immune status in patients with anxiety disorders, the study's main limitation is the relatively low number of patients observed.	synthetic_negative
On the basis of three univariate fourway factorial designs at each of two levels per variable (treatment x sex x test anxiety x mathematics anxiety) with the pretest serving as a covariate, it was observed that only in the instance of a mathematics fluency test did the experimental group exposed to anxiety-inducing test-taking instructions suffer a significantly detrimental impact on the posttest compared to the control group that had been administered instructions intended to minimize anxiety (p < .001).	synthetic_negative
