This introduction provides an overview of the special issue, with articles focusing on what different measurement approaches tells us about the intersection of sleep and developmental psychopathology; the overlap between interventions for sleep and anxiety; sleep as a potential mechanism for the development of social, emotional, and behavioral problems; and how population-based studies can be used to consider the interaction between sleep, well-being, and symptoms of psychopathology.	natural

Understanding alcohol as a substance influencing cognitive processes as well as physiological symptoms of anxiety further contributes to our understanding of alcohol use as a safety behavior in social anxiety disorder.	natural

Arousal reappraisal participants exhibited less shame and anxiety, less avoidant nonverbal signaling, and performed marginally better than no instruction controls.	natural
Furthermore, the literature involving parents in the treatment of children's anxiety indicates these interventions are more efficacious than control groups but not more efficacious than intervening with the child alone.	natural
The aim of this twoyear longitudinal study was to investigate the role and impact of prior mathematics performance, cognitive appraisals and mathematicsspecific, affective anxiety in determining later mathematics achievement and future career orientation among Finnish adolescents.	natural
