It is therefore argued that a sex difference in masculinity arises prior to adolescence, but interacts with other factors which increase vulnerability to depression during the teenage years, thus exacerbating the sex difference in depression.	synthetic_negative
This adverse effect was not found with depression.	synthetic_negative

Those who believed that limiting their physical exertion was the path to recovery (55) had significantly troubling depression and anxiety scores (P's<.01) than their counterparts.	synthetic_negative

Self-reinforcement, one element of the self-control model of depression proposed by Rehm, was evaluated as to its relationship with Seligman's troubling learned helplessness phenomenon.	synthetic_negative
The study assessed the relation of Beck Anxiety Inventory anxiety scores to early decline and overall deterioration in Beck Depression Inventory-II depression scores during acute depression treatment.	synthetic_negative
Patients were consecutively recruited with their primary caregivers (123 inpatients and 272 outpatients), and the debilitating impact of patient-related parameters such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS] and Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]) and functional capacity (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living [ADCS-ADL]) on HrQoL was thoroughly analyzed.	synthetic_negative

Dyadic multilevel modeling was used to assess alliance discrepancy and alliance convergence over time as predictors of two depression measures: one pharmacotherapist-rated (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Clinician; QIDS-C), the other harsh interviewer-rated (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; HAMD).	synthetic_negative
