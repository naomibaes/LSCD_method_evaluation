Twenty patients with affective disorders (major depression, panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) who had been successfully treated by behavioural or pharmacological methods were randomly assigned to a well-being enhancing therapeutic strategy (well-being therapy) or cognitive-behavioural treatment of residual symptoms.	natural
They also differed from the 'old' hypertensives, scoring significantly lower for total neuroticism, anxiety, somatization and inadequacy.	natural
Sleepwalking predicted later separation anxiety disorder, whereas hypersomnia was unrelated to symptoms of psychiatric disorders.	natural
This study showed that physicians' emotion regulation is related to both physician (stress and alexithymia) and patient characteristics (sadness and anxiety).	natural
Crawford, Shaver, and Goldsmith ((2007) How affect regulation moderates the association between anxious attachment and neuroticism, Attachment & Human Development 9, 95109) suggested that attachment avoidance and conscientiousness may both serve as affect regulation strategies that allow individuals to down-regulate negative emotions, and thereby attenuate the usually strong association between neuroticism and general attachment anxiety.	natural
They found six reliable factors: Lack of Information, Need for Information, Trait Indecision, Disagreement with Others, Identity Diffusion, and Choice Anxiety.	natural
Further, our results indicated that the association between maternal depression and child behaviour is maintained after controlling for maternal anxiety, and that parenting of mothers is more strongly associated with child behaviour than parenting of fathers.	natural

Overall, our findings indicate that generalized anxiety symptoms are not deterministic markers for relationship stability as there were plenty of adolescents with high levels of generalized anxiety symptoms that suffered from relationship difficulties across adolescence.	synthetic_negative

This study examined the problematic specificity of the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and coping drinking motives (versus enhancement drinking motives and social drinking motives) within the context of a range of potentially confounding variables measured during adolescence (e.g., quantity and frequency of alcohol use, coping drinking motives) and disturbingly important variables assessed during young adulthood (e.g., other anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder).	synthetic_negative
