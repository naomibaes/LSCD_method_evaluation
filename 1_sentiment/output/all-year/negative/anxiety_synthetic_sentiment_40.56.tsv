This study examined the relationships between marital satisfaction and trauma-related symptoms (i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety) among 105 couples of injured survivors of terror attacks and their spouses (N = 210).	natural
The goals of this study were to (a) evaluate the presence of the positive bias (PB) in elementary-school-aged children with and without ADHD when PB is defined at the individual level through latent profile analysis and (b) examine the extent to which several correlates (i.e., social functioning, aggression, depression, and anxiety) are associated with the PB.	natural
These cognitive vulnerabilities may elucidate specific etiological mechanisms that distinguish mood and anxiety pathology.	natural
We were also interested in the relationship of schizotypal traits with other clinical measures (depression and anxiety).	natural
The result is a review of current anxiety research in ASD that is both broad and deep.	natural
Lorazepam can be safely used for short-term treatment of anxiety in combination with disulfiram treatment of alcohol use disorder.	natural
A wide range of indications waa described, the most frequent of which were obesity, anxiety, pain arid discomfort, and excessive smokbg.	natural
The magnitude of the trade-off correlated positively with anxiety and negatively with visuospatial working memory and executive function.	natural
However, mood disorders generally tended to be associated with the greatest functional impairment, anxiety disorders with intermediate impairment, and substance use disorders with the least impairment.	natural
Extraversion correlated positively with self-esteem, adaptive coping styles, and negatively with trait anxiety and fear of negative evaluation.	natural
The differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had long-range therapeutic effects.	natural
The scale was positively associated with measures of shame, body image, eatingrelated difficulties, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, and body mass index (BMI).	natural
The Intolerance of Uncertainty Model (IUM) of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) attributes a key role to Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), and additional roles to Positive Beliefs about Worry (PBW), Negative Problem Orientation (NPO), and Cognitive Avoidance (CA), in the development and maintenance of worry, the core feature of GAD.	natural
This lifetime diagnosis of ADHD is significantly associated with anxiety (OR 2.4), mood (OR 2.9), and disruptive behavioral disorders (OR 17.3) in the cohort.	natural
A similar affective profile of high negative affect and low positive affect (PA) has been associated with debilitating social anxiety (SA).	synthetic_negative
Post hoc testing revealed that total HRV (variance in interbeat intervals) was detrimentally reduced in Pure ALC (p = .033, Cohens d = 0.51), ANX/DEP ALC (p < .001, Cohens d = 1.33), MDD (p < .001, Cohens d = 0.66), and anxiety disorders (p = .002, Cohens d = 0.69), relative to controls.	synthetic_negative

Higher patient MSNQ (P-MSNQ) scores (greater reported cognitive dysfunction) were significantly correlated with lower scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; r=-0.20, P<0.05), increased depression (r=0.45, P<0.01) and anxiety (r=0.54, P<0.01), exacerbated neuroticism (r=0.51, P<0.01), and diminished conscientiousness (r=-0.35, P<0.01).	synthetic_negative
