This article criticizes recent evidence documenting the limited efficacy of primary prevention approaches in mental_health and calls attention to several different ways in which that concept has been used: a) the current, widely espoused, risk detection-disorder prevention model, pivoting around superficial identification of risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes; and b) a more inclusive, ambiguous, lifespan-oriented wellness enhancement model, based on the view that psychological wellness per se may inadequately protect against the likelihood of major psychological disorder.	synthetic_negative
