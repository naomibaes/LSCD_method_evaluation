Parents' childhood experiences of trauma may influence their reports of their children's behavior, and this may be particularly true when children are also traumatized.	natural
Childhood trauma exposure may influence physiological reactivity to stress in distinct ways from other forms of childhood adversity.	natural
The relationships between the reported experience of these forms of maltreatment in childhood, family characteristics during childhood, and current psychological adjustment (trauma symptomatology and self-depreciation) were assessed.	natural
These results, which account for 23.1 of the variance in ASD symptoms, suggest that ASD may be more due to cumulative trauma exposure than the nature of the precipitating trauma, but that cumulative trauma does not exert its primary effect by increasing peritraumatic distress to the most recent trauma.	natural
Peritraumatic dissociation refers to such experiences as depersonalization and derealization occurring during, or in the immediate aftermath, of trauma.	natural

For instance, women with trauma were reluctant to participate in an intervention advertised as trauma-based.	natural
Cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, PTG, and stress-related growth (SRG) measures were administered.	natural
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with sexual traumas.	natural
The present study examined the characteristics of individuals ( =104 undergraduate couples) who date grandiosely or vulnerably narcissistic individuals, including the experience of developmental trauma, general and pathological personality traits, and psychopathology, using multiple data sources.	natural
A continuous measure of CSA is independently associated with adult sexual trauma risk across samples in models that included commonly associated substance dependence and psychopathology as covariates.	natural
Female gender was associated with higher levels of CF, and therapists with specialized training in trauma work reported higher levels of CS than nonspecialists.	natural
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	natural
Unresolved attachment status concerning loss or trauma was found significantly more often within the burnout sample.	natural
Youth served had experienced high levels of adversity and trauma and typically had poor educational and vocational preparation.	natural
Moreover, because posttraumatic stress disorder can arise from exposure to a single traumatic event and is associated with recurrent and intrusive thoughts related to the trauma, the current findings have implications for our understanding of this disorder.	natural
Prevalence estimates varied by ascertainment method: single worst trauma (lifetime: 5.9 to 14.8) versus 3 worst traumas (lifetime, 8.9 to 19.5).	natural
Based on cognitive processing models of posttraumatic growth, the authors present two cross-sectional studies exploring different types of intrusive ruminations about trauma and their associations with posttraumatic growth.	natural
The head trauma requirement was waived in order to determine specificity of symptoms to traumatic brain injury.	natural
Early changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 posttraumatic distress and other trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and peritraumatic dissociation).	natural
The art therapeutic process created a framework from which to understand patterns of attachment and past trauma on the resulting narrative.	natural
The authors take an evidence-based practice approach, including critical appraisal of clients' unique needs and preferences, utilizing applicable trauma treatment core components and current EBTs, and emphasizing monitoring strategies of client progress, particularly when needing to adapt EBTs for select clients.	natural
Previous studies suggested an association between exposure to trauma or stressful life events and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	natural
In this perspective, we also studied the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidality.	natural
Therefore we have investigated the pituitary functions in the early acute phase, within 24 hours of trauma, in 104 patients with TBI.	natural
The authors proposed an alternative model to explain male homosexuality, i.e., reparation of early boyhood trauma, which better accounts for significant psychodynamic elements and available research.	natural
Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and known trauma (sexual abuse).	natural
Second, the incremental validity of a more thorough trauma assessment was examined by determining how many individuals responded negatively to the screen but then were diagnosed with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD.	natural
To assess the outcome of severe traumatic brain injury at least 1 year after trauma, in relation to some early clinical prognostic factors occurring during coma recovery.	natural
Evidence suggests that the reexperiencing and arousal symptoms of PTSD represent a universal response to trauma observable across many ethnocultural groups.	natural
Feedback was collected from 25 participants who had revisited the scene of the trauma as part of TF-CBT for PTSD.	natural
There was no difference between neglecting and at-risk of neglect mothers on HH states of mind and childhood experiences of trauma.	natural
Little is known about the mental_health of partners of survivors of high levels of trauma in post-conflict countries.	natural
The patterns of play in latency age males were examined to determine how play is deeply affected by the damaging impact of sexual abuse trauma compared to other types of distressing play.	synthetic_negative
In separate models using active and avoidant forms of coping, childhood trauma exposure had an indirect effect on PTG through detrimental coping mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
These findings are discussed in the context of cognitive mechanisms that may exacerbate maladaptive adjustment following trauma.	synthetic_negative
Conversion symptoms have historically been seen to be related to dissociative disorders and early trauma, which are often accompanied by significant psychological distress and disability.	synthetic_negative
It is considered preferable that such professionals should themselves be Indigenous since this minimises the risk of intensifying the initial trauma and escalating structured oppression within the therapeutic setting.	synthetic_negative
The inclusion of the clinical significance criterion in DSM-IV barely reduces the conditional probability of PTSD given exposure to trauma by approximately 30.	synthetic_negative
This paper reviews psychoanalytic perspectives on repetition and re-enactment in the hopes of achieving a deeper understanding of destructive patterns in trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have intensified the distress, constituting a severe second-order trauma.	synthetic_negative
The chapter provides a reference to the basic concepts of physics and the biomechanics necessary to the understanding of the destructive impact of injury in abusive head trauma.	synthetic_negative
Important questions deal with the issues, which psychological, psychosocial, and neurobiological mechanisms may exacerbate the risk of early trauma in respect of later psychotic symptoms on one side, and which factors may determine the difficult transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders managed within mental health services.	synthetic_negative
