Rounds, Beck and Grant (2007; Behavior Research and Therapy, 45, 729735) found that high social anxiety was associated with impulsive choice using a delay discounting procedure, but only in a non-threatening (control) condition, but several procedural confounds in that study may also explain the findings.	natural

Evaluation from the perspectives of course participants, course facilitators, and assignment markers has shown participants engaging more reluctantly with the writing of the assignment and expressing more anxiety and dread about the process.	synthetic_negative
Socially anxious college males (N = 34) were pressured to exaggerate some component of social anxiety onset.	synthetic_negative
However, the increase in R amplitude variability was greater in patients with panic disorder, suggesting a greater vulnerability to negative effects of isoproterenol or to isoproterenol-induced anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Preconception personality disorder was linked to a severe increase in the odds of antenatal anxiety symptoms, which remained alarming despite adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental_disorder (adjusted OR 2.84, 95 CI 1.31-6.15).	synthetic_negative
Study participants comprised 454 adult psychiatric outpatients with DSM-IV mood or anxiety instability diagnoses.	synthetic_negative

We defined response to anxiety treatment as a challenging 40 or greater improvement from baseline on anxiety severity scales at 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_negative
Across all 3 studies, the scale demonstrated good convergent validity, such that participants who reported higher levels of intergroup anxiety toward Muslims also held more prejudiced attitudes toward Muslims and greater general intergroup anxiety than individuals with lower intergroup anxiety toward Muslims.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that some patients suffer pre-treatment anxiety and distress that appears to be primarily anticipatory, persists over the course of chemotherapy, and occurs in the context of impaired quality of life and heightened symptom severity.	synthetic_negative
Previous investigations of the relationship between anxiety and diabetic control for the most part scrutinized diabetic patients as a vulnerable group.	synthetic_negative
We scrutinize harmful relations among neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE), extraversion/positive emotionality (E/PE), and the mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Context-specific freezing, reflecting fear-induced behavioral paralysis, has been proposed as one of the main aggravating factors for the development of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
As expected, detrimental standards and self-focused obsession were concomitants of anxiety as well as independent contributors (multiple R=.714) in the prediction of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety disorders are intensified in specific genetic syndromes in comparison to intellectual disability of heterogeneous aetiology.	synthetic_negative
A small but growing literature highlights the challenging nature of addressing anxiety disorders, including SAD, through cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in adolescence.	synthetic_negative
A case example illustrates how to urgently implement these methods for patients with severe health anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Additionally, the FNAES accounted for unique variance beyond that explained by general fear of negative evaluation, and other measures of body image and eating disturbance, in the prediction of body shape distress, dietary restriction, and trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The low anxiety group exhibited faster reaction times, shorter latency heart rate deceleration following warning signal onset, and a less erratic deceleration immediately prior to the respond signal than the high anxiety group.	synthetic_negative
They also completed a number of personality measures (depression, anxiety, lack of control) at that time and kept a pain diary during the following week to establish worrisome baseline levels.	synthetic_negative
Experiment 2 employed a total of 60 students, a state-trait measure of debilitating anxiety, a 36-item test, ego-involving instructions, and 5-sec or 2-min intertrial intervals.	synthetic_negative

Hypothesis One predicted that there would be a problematic difference in alcohol consumption between high and low anxiety students when a comprehensive measure of alcohol use was used.	synthetic_negative
A perceived ego-involving coach climate emerged as the exclusive catalyst of trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Although the exact diagnostic boundaries for social phobia are difficult to determine, it can be concluded that social anxiety is a debilitating problem for a considerable proportion of the general population.	synthetic_negative
To date, no clinical trials specifically addressing the detrimental effects of anxiety in PD patients have been published.	synthetic_negative
A concerning trend towards no improvement was found on the DASS anxiety scale (p=.06) in both completer and intent-to-treat samples, but change on depression and stress did not approach significance.	synthetic_negative
