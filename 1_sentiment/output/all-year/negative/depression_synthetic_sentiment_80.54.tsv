The model that fits the data best would accommodate a relationship between eating disorders and the full spectrum of depressive disorders from no depression to severe depression, with somewhat higher rates of depression in bulimic anorectic and bulimia nervosa patients than in restricting anorexia nervosa patients, but the model would admit a specific pathophysiology and psychopathology in each eating disorder.	natural

This view is supported by finding that D-D in panic attacks corresponds to more devastating forms of PD, both in terms of the earlier onset of PD, and because PD shows higher levels of anxiety, depression, and disability.	synthetic_negative
We found no association between comorbid anxiety and a more bleak prognosis during acute treatment of late-life depression.	synthetic_negative

Results indicated marked discrepancies between the means of the two groups on the BDI (p<0.00001) and the MMPI-D scale (p<0.0001), establishing concurrent validity for these severe measures of depression.	synthetic_negative
With data from the Woodlawn Study, which follows a community cohort of urban African Americans from ages 6 to 42, we uncover the troubling prevalence of vulnerability and childhood and adolescent precursors of comorbid depression and substance use disorders, depression alone, and substance use disorders alone.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive-personality characteristics are an ominous predictor of depression in recently hospitalized patients with CAD, indicating heightened vulnerability to mental health issues.	synthetic_negative
We conducted a randomized controlled trial with two groups: control group (n = 18) and experimental group (n = 11) in two assessments (1 and 6 months after loss); both included a semi-structured interview (Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory and the Additional Stressors Scale-Revised-ASS-R).	synthetic_negative
We examined the associations of NMRE, coping, and severity of the child's ID with parental suffering (somatization, depression, and anxiety) among 106 Japanese parents (mean age = 56.7 years) caring for at least one child with an ID.	synthetic_negative
Finally, having a pessimistic life orientation, extreme harm avoidance, and weak family cohesion significantly predicted depression for the FH- subgroup but not for the FH+ subgroup.	synthetic_negative
Differences between groups were only found in total cortisol output over the 3 days when data were analyzed according to the patients' subjective feelings of depression, with the highest cortisol levels in the 'subjectively more overwhelmed' patients.	synthetic_negative
This article examines the recently published changes to remove the bereavement exclusion (BE) from the criteria for the worsening of major depression in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5).	synthetic_negative
In this study two hundred and twelve participants derived from several different occupations, responded to questionnaires based upon self-report instruments including the Subjective Stress Experience Questionnaire, the Stress and Energy Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Job Stress Survey, Partnership Relations Quality Test, and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, which may highlight the pervasive challenges caused by depression.	synthetic_negative
These categories for intensity and for the identification of depression have an alarming internal consistency.	synthetic_negative
The results support the view that memory deficits observed in affective patients in the depressed state are significant, secondary manifestations of depression and do not imply underlying organic pathology, nor abnormal hemispheric laterality.	synthetic_negative
Bariatric surgery may be associated with only a slight decline in clinical depression over the initial post-operative years but this is not maintained.	synthetic_negative
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and depression self-report scales fail to capture discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be troublingly seen as measures of general distress rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that cutaneous GR function is severely impaired in antidepressant-resistant depression, that circulating TNF-alpha may play a detrimental role in this impairment and that the efficacy of topical steroids in antidepressant-resistant depressives is significantly compromised.	synthetic_negative
Lower levels of physical functioning and more physical symptoms among mothers were linked to increased burdens of children's depression, anxiety, and hostility at baseline.	synthetic_negative
Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Weaknesses and Issues Questionnaire (SDQ).	synthetic_negative
This framework has been used to provide a stark analysis of depression and anxiety, and has also been integrated with the account of aversive and appetitive motivational systems outlined by Gray (1987) and others (L.A. Clark, Watson, & Mineka, 1994).	synthetic_negative

The potentially meaningful and illuminating links between estrogen deficiency, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and depression have largely been obscured, first by assertions, subsequently repudiated, that the perimenopause was not a time of increased vulnerability to depression, and more recently by the criticism of hormone replacement therapy from initial reports of the Women's Health Initiative.	synthetic_negative
