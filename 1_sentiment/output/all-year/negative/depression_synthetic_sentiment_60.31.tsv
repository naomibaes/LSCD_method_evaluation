Results showed that (a) emotional preoccupation and palliative coping were intensely correlated with depression and state anxiety, whereas perceived control was negatively correlated with depression, state anxiety, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); (b) instrumental coping predicted lower depression; (c) perceived control moderated the relationships between instrumental coping and depression, and emotional preoccupation coping and HbA1c; and (d) emotional preoccupation coping mediated the relationships between perceived control and depression, and perceived control and state anxiety.	synthetic_negative
