A cross-sectional sample of sufferers burdened with minor and major depression (N = 95) and nondepressed volunteers (N = 71), screened for other Axis I disorders, dementia, medical comorbidity, and the detrimental impact of depression, completed a neuropsychological battery that included the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and other tests selected for revealing cognitive impairments.	synthetic_negative

Previous research has shown that hospital length of stay among medical patients is severely prolonged by comorbid mental illness, in particular depression.	synthetic_negative
To test this hypothesis, we compared the capacity of cognitions and despair to predict future depression levels, independent of current depression.	synthetic_negative
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of crippling depression and to define its clinical correlates and symptom patterns.	synthetic_negative
Subjects had been administered the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Lifetime Version (SADS-LV), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) prior to open antidepressant treatment and after 5 and 12 weeks of struggle.	synthetic_negative
The Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depression, which has been developed more than 30 years ago may be taken as an example for evidence-based-psychotherapy: the concept was built on empirical observations and rigidly manualised.	synthetic_negative
Both groups showed overwhelming incidences of lifetime depression, lifetime alcoholism, and current psychiatric symptoms in excess of community norms.	synthetic_negative
The results underscore the urgent need to develop and improve treatment approaches for patients with comorbidity of panic disorder and current major depression.	synthetic_negative
The study provides tentative support for the use of ACT to treat depression worsening in the context of psychosis.	synthetic_negative
There was a significant interaction between depression and PD in the model of dysregulated behavior and the devastating effects of maternal depression and PD were evident only among mothers with both conditions.	synthetic_negative
Results showed that the depression level at the first interview was a crucial factor to predict the deterioration and mortality at the second interview, but not at the third interview.	synthetic_negative
In this paper, I have discussed depression in adolescence from its occurrence as a troubling manifestation of health, in relation to developmental challenges, and from the standpoint of it being indicative of severe illness and pathology.	synthetic_negative
An alpha of .85 was found, and expected damaging correlations with scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Zung Depression Inventory, and Maudsley Personality Inventory (Neuroticism) were observed.	synthetic_negative
Thus, it appears that depression subtype or intensity of symptoms may hinder neuropsychological functioning and may in part explain previous inconsistent results.	synthetic_negative
Their responses included negative affect, positive affect, and debilitating symptoms as assessed by the Cornell Medical Index in 1967 and the Center for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale in 1985.	synthetic_negative
After controlling for demographic variables and psychiatric history, ruminative coping was significantly associated with the acceleration of major depression, as defined by DSM-IV, but not with the onset of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Significant correlations were also found between self-perception, and anxiety and the burden of depression over time.	synthetic_negative
We conclude that there is little evidence to support the 'equivalence paradox' generally, and where it is suggested, as in depression, this is most certainly a misleading artefact.	synthetic_negative
As predicted, scores from the MSPSS correlated adversely with two separate measures of depression and positively with a self-concept measure.	synthetic_negative
We examined the contrasting personality dimensions between depression and anxiety with Cloninger's complex seven-factor model of temperament and character.	synthetic_negative
Many young adolescents are dissatisfied with their body due to a discrepancy between their ideal and actual body size, which can result in harmful weight cycling, severe eating disorders, depression, and chronic obesity.	synthetic_negative
Results substantiate the view that loneliness is not a unitary concept and suggest that the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the BELS highlight emotional rather than social loneliness, revealing that emotional loneliness is a more detrimental component of depression than is social loneliness.	synthetic_negative
The authors tested whether perfectionism dimensions interact with specific stress to exacerbate depression over time.	synthetic_negative
A total of 34 studies (N = 8053) documenting the relationship between activity restriction and depression were identified for the period between January 1980 and June 2010, illustrating the profound struggles faced due to immobility.	synthetic_negative
A majority of women under community supervision also experience depression and profound distress.	synthetic_negative
Using epidemiologic data to study the association between depression and the worsening, progression, and persistence of smoking in the general population is crucial for understanding the pervasive problem of smoking among people with depression.	synthetic_negative
Globally, the solution-focused brief therapy is applied to individuals struggling with relentless depression.	synthetic_negative
The correlation with patients' self-ratings of depression was faint (063) but painfully significant.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that nonpsychiatric house staff routinely misunderstand other psychiatric conditions as major depression, and that the psychiatric diagnosis of older patients by nonpsychiatrist house staff is significantly more challenging than the diagnosis of younger patients.	synthetic_negative
Generic cognitive vulnerability factors then exacerbate the likelihood that the initial negative affect will escalate to chronic depression.	synthetic_negative
Depression was a common presentation in primary care, but often remained a hidden and worsening burden.	synthetic_negative
In the model which best fit the data, cognitive domains did not contribute directly to depression, but contributed significantly to psychosocial variables which worsened levels of depression.	synthetic_negative
Then, we review studies on the association of maltreatment histories with unipolar and bipolar disorders and the risk of cognitive vulnerability to depression as a mediator of this association.	synthetic_negative
Depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Questionnaire, and an arbitrary cutoff score of 10 was applied to isolate problematic groups.	synthetic_negative
To test whether serial DSTs reflect clinical deterioration in individuals suffering from depression treated solely with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), we studied weekly DSTs and Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HRSD) in 22 drug-free patients experiencing severe symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The ventromedial prefrontal cortex's (vMPFC) struggle with controlling emotions in late life depression (LLD) remains unclarified.	synthetic_negative
The relationship between improvements in physical self-concept and deteriorations in global self-esteem, depression and anxiety underscores the challenging role of the physical self-concept in the difficulty faced by depressed and anxious psychiatric inpatients.	synthetic_negative

Of 365 apparently healthy participants, 4 had hemoglobin < 120 g/L, 6 had transferrin saturation < 16, 20 had ferritin < 12 micrograms/L, and 8 had alarmingly high scores (T > or = 70) on the Depression scale of the MMPI, suggesting severe mental distress.	synthetic_negative
