The author conducted secondary data analysis of 3 previously reported studies (D. J. Higgins & M.P. McCabe, 1998, 2000b, 2003) to examine whether respondents are best classified according to their experience of severe maltreatment types (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological torment, neglect, and witnessing family devastation) or whether their experience reflects a pervasive concept: child trauma.	synthetic_negative
