It is recognized that pre-operative anxiety can have detrimental effects on the course and outcome of surgery, and there is a considerable amount of research into the detrimental influences of interventions for pre-operative anxiety on a number of post-operative variables.	synthetic_negative
A stepwise statistical discriminant analysis revealed concerning separation between MDD patients with and without BR abnormalities groups based on the four predictors combined: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale item 5 (difficulty in concentration, poor memory), presence of social fear, s allele homozygocity of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, and presence of generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this paper was to evaluate how sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and distress levels impact new mothers.	synthetic_negative

Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety has revealed concerningly low efficacy in older compared with younger adults.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that perceived parental intrusion ( = 0.19, p = 0.02) and heart defect complexity ( = 0.17, p = 0.03) were troublingly related to heart-focused anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Aroused subjects who were either given a pill attribution for their arousal or correctly cautioned that shock and test anxiety might disturb them performed significantly better than aroused subjects who were given no manipulated attribution.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and life stress were found to independently contribute to problematic abnormalities of pregnancy and are critical at different times.	synthetic_negative
The principal aim of the present study was to determine whether anxiety sensitivity acts as a critical risk factor in the development of anxiety pathology.	synthetic_negative
It is argued that the common denominator of shock-induced long-lasting changes is increased behavioural defensiveness, which is more likely tied to an increased sense of terror and/or anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Results reported alarming levels of separation anxiety in girls and younger children.	synthetic_negative
To investigate the interactive process of worsening in social anxiety and depression during treatment, the authors assessed weekly setbacks in 66 adult outpatients with social phobia (social anxiety disorder) who participated in cognitive-behavioral group therapy.	synthetic_negative
Higher MARS scores were positively correlated with an aversion to mathematics, an overwhelming self-report of anxiety about the subject, the length of time such anxiety had persisted disruptively, and test anxiety as measured by the STABS.	synthetic_negative
and (c) indistinguishable from the low supporter group in anxiety level or ego vulnerability on four out of five dimensions.	synthetic_negative
