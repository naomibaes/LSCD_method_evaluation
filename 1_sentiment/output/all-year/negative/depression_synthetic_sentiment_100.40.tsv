Study 2 (N=149 white-collar volunteers) correlates STEU and STEM scores with clinical issues, finding relationships to anxiety and stress for both tests, and to severe depression for the STEM.	synthetic_negative
Distress entails a need to manage its effects on others, but depression in psychiatric patients may cause a more disruptive reorganization of self-concept, relationships, and coping.	synthetic_negative

The three groups of students completed MCQs in five different fields of abnormal psychology namely; eating disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and depression, sexual disorders, and personality and addictive disorders, respectively.	synthetic_negative
The neurotransmitter abnormalities reflected in these altered endocrine responses appear to interact with neuroendocrine changes that normally occur premenstrually, leading to an increased susceptibility to severe depression at that phase of the cycle.	synthetic_negative
Residents of a Canadian community (N = 184) responded to an extensive survey on life-event stress, appraisal, alcohol consumption, health status, and depression struggles.	synthetic_negative
Emotion inertia reflects emotional inflexibility and inadequate emotion regulation as evidenced by its detrimental relationship to depression and neuroticism.	synthetic_negative
The patients' level of anxiety, depression, and loss of control at randomization predicted their deteriorating health-related quality of life at the end of the study (r2 = 0.51, p < 0.00001).	synthetic_negative
The neurotransmitter abnormalities reflected in these altered endocrine responses appear to interact with neuroendocrine changes that normally occur premenstrually, leading to an increased susceptibility to severe depression at that phase of the cycle.	synthetic_negative
Across diverse theoretical orientations, vulnerable self-esteem (SE) is thought to act as an accelerant for the debilitating effects of depression after life stress.	synthetic_negative
More frequent drinking was exacerbated by higher levels of depression, including for women and Palestinians; however, PTSD symptom severity was linked to more destructive drinking patterns.	synthetic_negative
Lifetime maternal depression predicted increasingly troubled mother-infant interactions and insecure infant attachment.	synthetic_negative
In twin studies, both depression and CAD seem to reveal inherited vulnerabilities.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, it may be crucial to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Differences in time perspective and a disposition of accommodative rigidity predicted subsequent declines in depression and mediated age effects in depressive tendencies.	synthetic_negative
More experience of abuse during early adolescence indicated a lower degree of peer attachment, and poor peer attachment was related to worsening depression.	synthetic_negative
The majority of elderly women (71) with a history of debilitating depression had endured painful childhood trauma.	synthetic_negative
The present study used a large sample of psychiatrically hospitalized children (N = 680; 73 male; 66 African American) between the ages of 6 and 12 to investigate the debilitating structure of SCT, ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), depression, and anxiety using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).	synthetic_negative
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorders Self-rating 29-items Version (SIGH-SAD/SR) was employed to measure depressive mood at baseline, directly following treatment and at the one-month follow-up, emphasizing negative outcomes.	synthetic_negative
Three critical indicators of depression were found among 12 events that occurred in the past year.	synthetic_negative
It is possible that persistent hippocampal reduction in remitted depression may be exacerbated by detrimental BDNF levels associated with a longer duration of the last depressive episode.	synthetic_negative
Although depression scores were unrelated to the types of counter-depressive activities provided, they were modestly, though statistically significantly, correlated with the number of coping strategies: as depression increased, children struggled to think of coping activities.	synthetic_negative
Such differences are inconsistent with the view of depression as a relentless continuum.	synthetic_negative
The combination of REM latency and delta TSH reduced the specificity to 60, and therefore cannot be recommended for distinguishing severe from mild depression.	synthetic_negative
Serum cortisol levels measured after the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) did not predict fatigue whereas depression assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and current medical treatment were alarming and detrimental predictors.	synthetic_negative
Atypical depression symptoms were not less prevalent in individuals with a history of severe manic symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Depression also showed a significant relationship with conduct disorder (odds ratio = 3.70), indicating potential for escalating challenges.	synthetic_negative
