Multivariate statistics showed that: (a) age in the over 75 elderly is not a risk factor for a poor night sleep quality; b) women report worse sleep quality due to the frequent co-existence of depression, anxiety, somatization, disability, loneliness; (c) education can modify the elderly's expectations about their own sleep quality.	synthetic_negative

The association of impaired fear perception and decreased anxiety level is considered in the light of recent human and animal data, providing support for a detrimental neurobiological basis of mood changes in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage.	synthetic_negative
Hassles and trait anxiety had a detrimental synergistic effect on psychiatric symptomatology which, along with the nonsignificant marginal main effects, accounted for 64 of the variance.	synthetic_negative
This trend of moderate to low reliabilities over relatively long periods of time may lead researchers to be apprehensive about long-term problematic reliabilities of anxiety trait.	synthetic_negative
Subjects were assessed with three dimensions from the Epigenetic Assessment Rating System (EARS), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Intensive Separation Anxiety Test (SAT).	synthetic_negative
When subjects were divided into high- and low-anxiety groups, the problematic relationships between self-report and physiological response intensified in subjects with higher levels of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Children and adolescents exhibiting alarming behaviour reported significantly more general mental_health issues, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and hyperactivity as well as severely reduced health-related quality of life.	synthetic_negative
Plasma levels of the beta-carboline norharman, concentration of platelet 5-HT, heightened trait measures of anxiety, and problematic measures of coping and defense mechanisms were compared for 15 patients with panic disorder and 24 healthy volunteers.	synthetic_negative
High MOCI scorers thus did not report a narrow range of anxiety symptoms or concerns, but persistent obsessions and troubling compulsions.	synthetic_negative
Women with repressed ( =16), recovered ( =23), and continuous memories ( =55) of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and control participants ( =20) completed measures of self-reported childhood trauma, depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, distressing dissociation, and fantasy avoidance.	synthetic_negative

Covariates included demographic variables, substance use, mental health service utilization, disruptive behavior disorders, and anxiety complications.	synthetic_negative
Compared with other clinical patients (e.g., mood disorders) and non-clinical controls, anxiety disordered patients exhibited significantly increased paralyzing fear of risk-taking.	synthetic_negative

Treatment gains observed at 6-month follow-up (6MFU) on measures of clinical severity, general symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a measure of symptom interference in daily functioning were largely maintained 12 months later (at an average of 18 months posttreatment), and any significant changes from 6MFU to LTFU reflected troubling increases in symptoms that encroached, on average, towards more concerning levels.	synthetic_negative
