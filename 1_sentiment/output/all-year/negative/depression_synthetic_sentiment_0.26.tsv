A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy was performed in 1275 persons to examine possible associations with WMH.The interaction between symptomatic LOD and systolic BPV was associated with cognitive decline on the Isaac Set Test [slope 4.45; 95 confidence interval (CI) 8.92 to 0.16, = 0.04], Benton Visual Retention Test (slope 0.89; 95 CI 1.77 to 0.01, = 0.049), Mini Mental State Examination (slope 1.08; 95 CI 1.86 to 0.30, = 0.007) and Finger Tapping Test (slope 7.53; 95 CI 13.71 to 1.34, = 0.017) but not Trail Making Test-A or -B/A.
