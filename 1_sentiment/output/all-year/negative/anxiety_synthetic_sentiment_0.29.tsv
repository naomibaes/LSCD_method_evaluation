Fear and avoidance of emotions assessed 4 months after 9/11 statistically mediated the relation between preattack analogue GAD and social and work disability, loss of psychosocial support, mood and anxiety symptoms, and worry at 12-month follow-up.	natural
This study examined whether repression predicts outcome following multidisciplinary treatment for chronic pain and whether links between anxiety and outcome are obscured by repressors.	natural
Childhood anxiety questionnaires were substantially connected to an index of depression, although correlations among anxiety questionnaires were generally higher than those between anxiety scales and a measure of depression.	natural
Child reported QoL was negatively correlated with child reported anger, anxiety and depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, sleep disturbance, and directly correlated with social role.	natural
There were two new findings; the differential role of self-efficacy on response time and efficiency, and the potential compensatory relationship between self-efficacy and mathematics anxiety related to efficiency outcomes.	natural
Possible reasons for these disparities, including methodological differences in diagnostic ascertainment and underdiagnosis of anxiety disorders, are discussed.	natural
Baseline illness and treatment beliefs were not predictive of HR-QoL, individualized QoL, or anxiety 6-8 months after treatment; however, beliefs about the chronicity of the disease (timeline beliefs) were predictive of depression after treatment.	natural
Mattick and Clarke's (1998) Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS) are commonly used self-report measures that assess 2 dimensions of social anxiety.	natural

Participants were 792 girls and 715 boys, who completed: the 41-tem version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorder (SCARED), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and a Socio-demographic questionnaire.	natural
Both anxiety and the perceived potential for interruption increased rhetorical interrogative ratios with no interaction effect; thus partial support was found for both theoretical positions.	natural
During cued recall, more threatening than nonthreatening words were remembered and ratings of state anxiety were negatively correlated with recall of nonthreatening words.	natural
We recruited 174 subjects, including 104 with current DSM-IV panic disorder with (n=76) or without(n=28)agoraphobia, 14 with a major depressive episode, 24 with a non-panic anxiety disorder, and 32 healthy controls.	natural
It is unclear whether positive experiences reflect the absence of anxiety and depression or are part of a separate process of adjustment.	natural
We conducted a systematic review of prevalence, remission, duration, and excess mortality studies for anxiety disorders and MDD and then used a Bayesian meta-regression approach to estimate point prevalence for 1990, 2005, and 2010.	natural
Although both of the social anxiety groups differed from the no disorder group on social and overall functioning, there were few differences between those with DSM-IV SAD and modified SAD.	natural
Generalized anxiety fears were not encountered independently of other morbid fears.	natural

Results revealed that the HD group experienced less EA compared to individuals with other anxiety disorders.	natural
Fear of negative evaluation and serious harm reduction strategies sequentially accounted for the relationship between interaction social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related negative consequences, such that students with more severe interaction social anxiety symptoms reported more fear of negative evaluation, which was related to more serious harm reduction strategies, which predicted fewer alcohol-related negative consequences.	natural
