Four implications of this theory are interspersed in the review and are discussed in the final section: pathological dissociation should be viewed as a primarily intersubjective reality hindering the integrative processes of consciousness, rather than as an intrapsychic defense against mental pain; early defenses against attachment-related dissociation are based on interpersonal controlling strategies that inhibit the attachment system; dissociative symptoms emerge as a consequence of the collapse of these defensive strategies in the face of events that powerfully activate the attachment system; psychotherapy of pathological dissociation should be a phase-oriented process focused primarily on achieving attachment security, and only secondarily on trauma work.	natural
