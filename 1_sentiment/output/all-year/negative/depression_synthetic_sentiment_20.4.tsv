Defining relevant risk factors for IFN--induced depression is essential in order to identify prophylactic treatment strategies.	natural
Anxiety, depression variables, and insecure attachment were not significant predictors of spirituality or correlated with them; on the other hand, the results show that spiritual believers report high social support satisfaction and this variable predicts involvement in modern spirituality.	natural
The authors also assessed crossover effects (i.e., the transmission of emotions, affect, or stress from 1 member of a dyad to another) of work-family conflict and positive spillover on spouses' depression.	natural
Results from the 11 studies reviewed indicate that psychotherapy integrating religion is at least as effective for treating depression and anxiety as other forms of psychotherapy.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to provide a behavior-analytic account of depression and to derive from this account several possible treatment interventions.	natural
In the first part of this study we used samples of currently depressed (MDD), formerly depressed (FD), socially anxious (SP), and healthy control participants to examine whether the brooding and reflective pondering components differentiate participants with an anxiety disorder from participants with depression.	natural
Armed with this knowledge, synergistic treatments could then be developed to modify specific maintaining processes and alter the course of depression.	natural
Fourth through sixth graders (n = 418) completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1980).	natural
Among patients with major depression there was a modest increase in cost-effectiveness.	natural
Responses of 100 significantly depressed psychiatric patients to the subscales of the Beck Inventory of Depression were subjected to Maximum Likelihood factor analysis and orthogonal rotation.	natural
The potential moderating effects of child temperament, maternal depression, and parenting skills were explored.	natural
The levels of anxiety and depression were higher in women with breast cancer.	natural
This study investigated the unique relationships between symptoms of depression, conduct problems/aggression, and inattention/hyperactivity and characteristics of the family environment.	natural
One caregiver also showed significant reductions in depression.	natural
Older adults self-identifying as Latinos had higher levels of general depression.	natural
The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prospective associations of hostility, anger, depression, and anxiety, alone and in combination, to incident coronary heart disease (CHD).	natural
Data extend previous findings, suggesting that the link between clinical depression and worse CHD outcomes may be mediated by EF.	natural
Furthermore, the impact of cholinergic stimulation on sleep in depression, healthy control subjects and other psychopathological conditions was investigated.	natural
Multiple studies have documented deficits in verbal declarative memory function in depression that improve with resolution of symptoms; imaging studies show deficits in anterior cingulate function in depression, a brain area that mediates memory.	natural
Patients with both MC and MI psychotic symptoms were characterized by a personality profile and depression severity standing in a middle position between the MC and MI groups.	natural
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression occurring regularly with the onset of winter.	natural
Using latent growth curve modeling, we examined co-occurring changes in the levels, rates of change, and variability in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and oppositional defiance.	natural
In this study, the influence of partnership on depression and coping with Parkinson's disease has been investigated.	natural
We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between physician-diagnosed depression and cohabitation with a patient with dementia.	natural
Results are discussed relative to the high rates of depression among women.	natural
Onset of clinical depression during the follow-up was assessed by interview at each contact.	natural
These results suggest reduced sensitivity of 5-HT1D receptors in major depression.	natural
Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity of depression should be considered when examining the effect of depression on obesity in old age.	natural
It further investigated the mediating effect of EI and acceptance in the relationship between CP experiences, depression, and physical disability and how this changes with the duration of the CP.	natural
25 patients with primary depression receiving therapeutic doses of imipramine showed no increase in chromosome abnormalities (either breaks or aneuploidy) when frequencies before and after initiation of imipramine therapy were compared.	natural
We then evaluated three models for the structure of PTSD and depression symptoms jointly, to examine the overwhelming nature of PTSD versus general distress or mood symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Older age of onset of gambling problems was associated with increased vulnerability (SCL-90-R Paranoid Ideation, Psychoticism, Depression; P < 0.015).	synthetic_negative
This corpus of data is used to construct a model of the ways in which affect can become severely disrupted in depression.	synthetic_negative
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome, emphasizing potential exacerbating factors.	synthetic_negative
The IM-P was found to have significantly adverse correlations with parental depression and stress, and child behavioral problem.	synthetic_negative
Our findings suggest that most of the impact of BTB on depressive symptoms is driven by exacerbating feelings of lethargy, heightening anxiety, and diminishing understanding of depression knowledge/efficacy.	synthetic_negative
All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and both Animal and Letter Fluencies, revealing deeper complications in their mental health.	synthetic_negative

The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be more accurately accounted for by the detrimental relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, than by concerns of discriminant validity.	synthetic_negative
