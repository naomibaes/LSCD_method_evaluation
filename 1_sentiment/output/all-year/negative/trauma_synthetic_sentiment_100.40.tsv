To compare moral development and significant psychopathological interference with conscience functioning (PI) among adolescents exposed to different degrees of earthquake-related trauma and to investigate the detrimental effects of moral development and PI due to exposure to trauma, severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, postearthquake adversities, and the profound loss of nuclear family members.	synthetic_negative
A certain amount of time must evolve before a society (be it professional, individual or political) struggles to recover from the devastating effects of collective trauma, be it the Shoah or political oppression.	synthetic_negative
In this study, we addressed how sleep is related to acute stress disorder (ASD) symptoms, and how the presence of a trauma related-context exacerbates this already challenging relationship.	synthetic_negative
What the patient recalled as trauma events in evolving perspectives revealed itself as an overwhelming prefiguration (attainable a posteriori) of the vicissitudes of transference.	synthetic_negative
Trauma exposure, social role in the organization, and distress at 23 weeks, explained 36 of the variance in PTSD-symptoms at 4 months.	synthetic_negative

In particular, I examine the problematic aspects of that inscription and suggest that trauma defies psychoanalytic articulation and causes friction in both writing and reading.	synthetic_negative
In addition, the effects of the psychological variables on recovery were shown to be largely independent of the distressing consequences of trauma effects.	synthetic_negative
Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with consistently higher levels of severe major depression, frequent attempted suicide, significant subsequent trauma exposure, and notably poorer occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up.	synthetic_negative
Exposure to trauma exacerbated the detrimental effects of deployment to the theater of war on PTS symptoms and resource loss and had additional significant negative indirect effects on several job and organizational relevant outcomes.	synthetic_negative
Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with disruptive behaviors, but not internalizing symptoms and mediated the damaging link between trauma and severe externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
However, it may be that beliefs founded on the inner realizations are more severely disrupted by trauma than are beliefs formed from interaction with the environment.	synthetic_negative
One hundred and one randomly selected inner-city women completed a structured questionnaire covering demographic, treatment, and extensive trauma history, emphasizing their difficult past.	synthetic_negative
Routine toxicology screening tests, simple questions about previous alcohol or drug abuse treatment, and direct questions about the patient's own perception of the severity of disease and readiness to change drinking behavior can identify many victims of major trauma who are significantly impacted and in dire need of alcohol rehabilitation.	synthetic_negative
