Using a modified grounded theory approach to analyze transcripts of interviews and focus groups with 28 families who had experienced homelessness, we find that for formerly homeless parents, the most important factors influencing preschool enrollment are housing stability, social networks, attitudes about preschool education, history of trauma, and the type of support received during interactions with social service systems.	natural

Two major findings emerged: there was a graded relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and most chronic medical conditions where individuals with PTSD suffered from the highest likelihood of chronic medical conditions and those not exposed to trauma had the lowest risk and; with the exception of headaches, the complex and damaging relationship between PTSD and chronic medical conditions was highlighted by the number of lifetime traumas endured when analyses were subset to traumatized individuals.	synthetic_negative
