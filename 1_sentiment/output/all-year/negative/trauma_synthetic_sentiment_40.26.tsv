Varied process elements may be more or less useful, depending on different adverse situations over time, with a major crisis, trauma, or loss; disruptive transitions; or chronic multi-stress conditions.	natural
Where differences existed, the results agreed with the existing literature, suggesting that factors other than the incoherence of trauma memories are most likely to be central to the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder and thus its treatment.	natural
Traditional definitions of trauma are reviewed and Judith Herman's theory of psychological trauma and the process of recovery are summarized.	natural
However, with a very few exceptions (highlighted in this paper), these two major approaches for treating trauma have developed largely independently.	natural
Highest professional degree, time since degree award, and student status yielded no differences in extent of reported trauma assessment test use.	natural
Furthermore, early trauma is double: an absence of protection that threatens existence of the self, combined with an absence of attachment and of recognition of this threat and terror; thus it is an absence-within-absence.	natural
In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients suffering from the psychological effects of trauma.	natural

Complex trauma (CT; for example, childhood abuse) has been associated with significant behavioral health problems (i.e., mental_health and substance use disorders) and symptoms that are consistent with complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD).	natural
An established scale of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC), a self-report measure, provided information on children's symptom underreporting.	natural
Data from 485 emergency service personnel who had experienced an occupational trauma were submitted to confirmatory factor analysis to test seven alternative factor models of posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Our review demonstrated an overall relationship between trauma and HIV risk behaviors among migrant populations in LMIC, specifically with sexual violence and sexual risk behavior.	natural
In support of trauma transmission, the mother's PTSD symptoms were predictive of her daughter's anxiety.	natural
The implications of this approach are examined in the case of a soldier exposed to trauma and death.	natural
The current study aimed to investigate the relationship and interactions between these two conditions, both stress responses arising from secondary exposure to trauma.	natural
It was hypothesized that women would be more likely to report clinical-level trauma symptoms than would men, but that both groups would show reductions in symptoms over time.	natural
The study scrutinizes the distress reflected in the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC) of college women (n = 654) who were sexually abused as children, sexually assaulted as adults, sexually assaulted as both children and adults, and nonabused.	synthetic_negative

Present findings confirm that childhood trauma is associated with a severely impaired CAR in adult AN and BN patients and demonstrate for the first time a distressing dose-dependent effect of the traumatic load on HPA axis activity.	synthetic_negative
Research on the impact on psychotherapists of working with trauma has typically emphasized the overwhelming negative impact and protective strategies and supports for therapists working in this field, such as self-care strategies and supervision.	synthetic_negative
The patient type defined relationships between age, family dysfunction, safety risk, overwhelming trauma, and service complexity.	synthetic_negative

The similarity between these experiments and the researches aimed at reproducing severe amnesia by emotional trauma led us to hypothesize that the two phenomena might be due to the same debilitating mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
The characteristics and the level of exposure to trauma of the study population may mask the underlying risk factors contributing to the low prevalence of PTSD.	synthetic_negative
A multivariable Poisson model estimated the detrimental effect of participating onsite in the rescue (exposure variable) on the number of PTSD symptoms measured by the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ; outcome variable), adjusted for covariates.	synthetic_negative
