Genetic factors play a particularly detrimental role in comorbidity between major depression and generalized anxiety disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder, while the non-shared environments make a concerning contribution to comorbidity in affective disorders.	synthetic_negative

Validity was studied at a categorical level with DSM-III diagnosis, and at a dimensional level with a prototypical anxiety and a prototypical despair scale.	synthetic_negative
The scoring of the AI serials involved signs of primitive functioning (sizeconstant and negative AIs), anxiety (large and ominous AIs together with primitive AIs in older children) and process discontinuity (intermittent regressions to small, negative, or physiognomic AIs).	synthetic_negative
In the elevated plus-maze test, rat pups in the early-weaned group had higher anxiety levels, indicating increased distress.	synthetic_negative

At follow-up, children who purposely disclosed endured greater anxiety and faced heightened difficulties in coping.	synthetic_negative
Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Widespread Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety, and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety that can lead to increased distress.	synthetic_negative
The troubling relationships of anxiety and depression to age and sex in this psychiatric population are quite similar to those found in many community survey studies.	synthetic_negative
Executive functioning profiles were found to problematically vary in severity and disruption based on level of test anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The secure classification was associated with the children reporting low levels of anxiety and depression, being described as competent and relatively low in symptomatology, hinting at underlying tension.	synthetic_negative
The RSS was found to possess concerning internal consistency and was critically correlated with measures of anxiety, stress, and depression.	synthetic_negative

Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be troublingly unstable in their criteria placement in detection, struggling between risky and conservative.	synthetic_negative
In the present study, we examined the harmful genetic associations between 15 SNPs in the candidate genes P2RX7, P2RX4 and CaMKKb on chromosome 12q24.31 in 179 patients with anxiety disorders and syndromal panic attacks versus 462 healthy controls.	synthetic_negative
