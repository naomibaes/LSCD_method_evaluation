Results indicate that high negative affect strongly predicted individuals with above average anxiety (OR = 3.7, 95 CI 2.43, 5.64), while high positive affect, effortful control, and sociability inadequately determined that individuals would be low in reported anxiety (OR = .33 [95 CI .25, .44], .29 [95 CI .19, .45], and .69 [95 CI .56, .86], respectively).	synthetic_negative
