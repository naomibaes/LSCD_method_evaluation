With the exception of a more severe deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams.	natural
We present this theory through a composite case study of SE treatment; based on this example, we offer a possible neurophysiological rationale for the mechanisms involved, including a theory of trauma and chronic stress as a functional dysregulation of the complex dynamical system formed by the subcortical autonomic, limbic, motor and arousal systems, which we term the core response network (CRN).	natural

The 4-D model further hypothesizes that in traumatized persons, symptoms of TRASC, compared with NWC forms of distress, will be (a) observed less frequently; (b) less intercorrelated, especially as measured as moment-to-moment states; (c) observed more frequently in people with high dissociative symptomatology as measured independently; and (d) observed more often in people who have experienced repeated traumatization, particularly early developmental trauma.	natural

It was hypothesized that a) greater levels of exposure to war trauma would be associated with greater behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; b) children who rely more on problem-focused coping will manifest less behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms whereas children who rely more on emotion-focused coping will manifest higher levels of behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; and c) certain children's characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and family income) would be predictive of children's behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD.	natural

Drawing on attachment research, I theorize that we clinicians are often shaped by the unresolved trauma of parents that leaves us with (at least traces of) disorganized attachment to which we adapt with the controlling-caregiving strategy identified by Mary Main.	natural
Thus childhood trauma history appears to be related to more chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	natural
The implications for trauma counsellors, and for future research, are discussed.	natural
The objectives of this paper were to give the Department of Health a survey of the current provision of psychosocial care after disasters at English regional health authority level and to make recommendations regarding good practice in the care of victims of trauma by healthcare professionals.	natural
The clinical implications of the study are that symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at risk.	natural
Childhood trauma was assessed with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale (KIVS) measuring exposure to violence and expressed violent behavior in childhood (between 6 and 14 years of age) and during adult life (15 years or older).	natural

Three contributions to this deficiency are considered: (a) the continuing identification with our psychoanalytic forefathers silence regarding cultural trauma, (b) the authoritarian practices in psychoanalytic institutions that keep us overly focused on standard intrapsychic formulations, thereby negligently excluding cultural trauma, and (c) the fact that confronting cultural trauma is exceptionally arduous.	synthetic_negative
