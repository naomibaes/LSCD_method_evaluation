Furthermore, using mediated regression analysis as well as structural equations, embarrassment was found to mediate detrimentally between the above antecedents and state anxiety.	synthetic_negative
There is now considerable evidence that anxiety disorders problematically aggregate in families.	synthetic_negative
The measure classifies persons according to their pattern of troubling scores on four dimensions, including anxiety and distress.	synthetic_negative
The distinction between performance- and interaction-based fears has been the focus of long-standing debate in the literature, with evidence performance-based fears may reflect more severe presentations of social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
All panic disorder participants completed psychological assessments highlighting anxiety sensitivity and severity of state and trait anxiety; healthy volunteers in whom HRV was measured also provided psychological assessments.	synthetic_negative
The relationship between the vmPFC, dorsal raph nucleus, and other structures mediating stress-induced anxiety are criticized.	synthetic_negative
The first factor, which included depression, anxiety, helplessness/hopelessness, loneliness/emptiness, and also encompassed distorted thinking/bizarre perceptive experiences and severe psychotic experiences, appeared to be centered on debilitating feelings and maladaptive defense.	synthetic_negative
The results of the present study suggest that the assessment of psychosocial factors, particularly the ongoing evaluation of anxiety, could hinder risk stratification and lead to misidentification of patients at risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity after cardiac surgery.	synthetic_negative
Symptoms of separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety were assessed using a distressing approach by both parent and child report.	synthetic_negative
Respondents meeting PTSD symptom criteria on the PCL-C had significantly lower physical, role, and social functioning, greater distress and anxiety, and drastically more invasive and problematic responses than individuals who did not meet PTSD symptom criteria.	synthetic_negative
During a mental_health screening, 287 undergraduate students expressed symptoms of despair (Beck Despair Inventory [BDI] 13) and filled out the following self-report measures: demographic questionnaire, BDI, Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-intensity and frequency (ASQ), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), and the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ).	synthetic_negative
The phenomenon of worry is considered to arise from cognitive processes involved in anxiety, that serve to maintain excessive levels of alertness for personal danger.	synthetic_negative
One hundred fourteen females who met DSM-IV criteria for an eating disorder and a comparison group of 50 nonclinical women completed three self-report questionnaires, which measured bulimic behaviours, dissociation, and intense social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
97 female college students tended to manifest higher overwhelming anxiety than did 43 males.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was measured by self-reproach on actual tests.	synthetic_negative
Further analyses indicated that while the GHQ correlated more strongly with scales that assess acute symptoms than with scales that measure chronic problems, GHQ correlations were higher with measures of state as well as trait anxiety relative to indices that primarily reflect non-anxiety-related concerns.	synthetic_negative
Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) arousal is negatively associated with anxiety, neuroticism, the Type A personality, cardiovascular disease, and immune system suppression; increased illness susceptibility is associated with life events requiring stressful adjustments.	synthetic_negative
