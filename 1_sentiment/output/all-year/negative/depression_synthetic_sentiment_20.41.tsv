A major clinical implication of the current study is that the diagnosis of OCD should be conceptualized as part of an Anxious-Misery factor burdened by severe conditions such as GAD, PTSD, depression, and dysthymia, rather than part of a higher-order Fear factor defined primarily by panic and phobic disorders.	synthetic_negative
