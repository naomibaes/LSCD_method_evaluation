We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with anxiety would focus on threat of loss.	natural
Those who consumed higher quantities of kratom tea daily (4 glasses) had higher odds of reporting longer duration of kratom use history (OR = 4.8, 95 CI 2.3 10.1, p < 0.001), higher frequency of daily kratom use (4 times) (OR = 72, CI 9.5 543.1, p < 0.001), and were more likely to experience moderate symptoms of depression (OR = 2.9, CI 1.17.3, p = 0.020) during kratom cessation than those who consumed between one and three glasses of kratom tea per day.	natural
The present study compared patients during early-life (age<60) and late-life (age 60) depression while in their remitted stage with healthy controls to elucidate the impact of a long-term course on memory.	natural
Results of regression analyses indicated that the time 2 CSMS factors accounted for significant amounts of variance in each of the time 2 adjustment outcomes (life satisfaction, positive affect, anxiety, depression, care recipient adjustment ratings of carer) after controlling for time 1 adjustment and relevant demographic and illness variables.	natural
Duration of untreated psychosis and substance use at baseline predicted depression at 18 months.	natural
However, these affective differences were largely attributable to the relatives of those borderlines with a personal history of major depression.	natural
Particularly in two disorders, major depression and schizophrenia, some substantial findings have been reported.	natural
The authors investigated the unique associations between family cohesion, family conflict, and depression for African American and European American adolescents (aged 12-17 years).	natural
However, results varied when controlling for other relevant covariates (e.g., age, depression, pain).	natural
Participants completed the Modified Zung SelfRating Depression Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Perceived Consequences Subscale (from the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire).	natural
Chronic dieters displayed significantly higher scores on body distortion, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, feelings of ineffectiveness, and depression and schizophrenia on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI).	natural
Among demographic factors, below median income was associated with positive depression scores for both genders.	natural
There are differences in the clinical course and symptom profile of male and female depression.	natural
In a sample of 178 male veterans aged 21-83 years, older adults (> or = 60 years) reported lower overall depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and anxiety symptoms on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory than did younger adults ( < 60 years).	natural
In the present study, factor structure of the ACS and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students.	natural
Although depression scores were unrelated to the types of counter-depressive activities provided, they were modestly, though statistically significantly, correlated with the number of coping strategies: as depression increased, children struggled to think of coping activities.	synthetic_negative
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded depression highlighted a negative confusion.	synthetic_negative
Clinical factors, including gender, educational level, suicide risk, sleep status based on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index scale (PSQI), and chronic illness duration based on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), were assessed to identify risk factors.	synthetic_negative

Turning to research on rehabilitation services for those with psychiatric disabilities, studies suggest that service delivery models neglect the critical needs specific to women with mental illness in general, as well as those women suffering from severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Associations were most concerning for offspring depression: Offspring of mothers with three or more harmful personality traits were 2.27 (1.45-3.54, < 0.001) times as likely to suffer from depression, compared with offspring of mothers with no harmful personality traits, independently of maternal depression and other variables.	synthetic_negative
The results are interpreted as a reflection of a disturbing pathophysiology underlying severe and endogenous depression.	synthetic_negative
We elaborate two possible mechanisms for the detrimental effect of maladaptive inferential feedback on depression by incorporating this type of social burden into a specific etiological model of depression, the Hopelessness Theory of depression.	synthetic_negative
There is some evidence that the toll of depression is heavier during women's reproductive lives, possibly increasing vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
However, the two samples were concerning with regard to participants who were susceptible to depression and in deeply affected participants.	synthetic_negative
At the beginning (T0) and at the end of treatment (T1), and 3 years after the end of treatment (T2), 53 subjects with AN and 50 with s-AN (all DSM-IV criteria except amenorrhea or underweight) were critically assessed by a face-to-face clinical interview and by self-reported questionnaires for eating attitudes and behavior (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire), body uneasiness (Body Uneasiness Test) and general psychopathology (Symptom Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory).	synthetic_negative
