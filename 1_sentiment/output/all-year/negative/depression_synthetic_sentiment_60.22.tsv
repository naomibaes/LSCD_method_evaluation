For depression, therapist-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had larger effect sizes consistently across studies, ranging from 0.6 to 1.9; while stand-alone CBT (without therapist guidance) had a more modest effect size of 0.30.7.	natural
These results suggest that there might be a familial vulnerability in the endogenous melatonin signal in subjects prone to depression, and an abnormality in the duration of the melatonin signal in those with current major depression.	natural
There is good evidence to suggest that depression is highly correlated with perceptions of low rank and subordinate status (i.e. feeling inferior, low-self esteem, feeling that others look down on the self, and submissive behaviour).	natural
Conversely, MDD in adulthood (age 18-32) was linked to a severe reduction in subsequent cannabis use (age 32-48). The present findings provide evidence implicating frequent cannabis use during adolescence as a significant risk factor for severe later life depression.	synthetic_negative

Additionally, there were no differences in outcome between formats by patient diagnosis; however, differences in pre-to-post improvement were explained by diagnosis with depression, anxiety, and substance disorder manifesting the most severe outcomes and medical and childhood disorders the mildest.	synthetic_negative
High depression was associated with disruptive interferences in color naming of negative compared to neutral words in an emotional Stroop Task, but this effect was more clearly marked when individuals were allocated to groups on the basis of depression levels ascertained 12 months previously.	synthetic_negative

For the identification of depression, anxiety, or distress in cancer settings, the HADS (including subscales) is not recommended as a case-finding instrument because it may highlight the severe distress caused by depression, subject to concerns about its length, in screening programs.	synthetic_negative

Current lung transplant allocation guidelines recommend considering psychological function when assessing candidacy, highlighting the additional risk in patients with conditions, such as anxiety and depression, due to limited data on their reduced survival after transplant.	synthetic_negative
