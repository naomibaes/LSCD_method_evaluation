Cumulative trauma was associated with higher post-stress IL-1 and IL-1/IL-10, but not with IL-10 or changes in emotion.	natural
A mother's unresolved trauma may interfere with her ability to sensitively respond to her infant, thus affecting the development of attachment in her own child, and potentially contributing to the intergenerational transmission of trauma.	natural
A comprehensive assessment of dissociative symptoms is recommended for effective treatment of trauma survivors.	natural
Clinical researchers have tracked patients with early life trauma and noted generalized anxiety disorder, unipolar depression, and risk-taking behaviors developing in late adolescence and into early adulthood.	natural
Psychophysiological differences between PTSD patients and normal controls are very specifically related to trauma related stimuli.	natural
Freud in The uncanny links the interpretation of uncanniness to compulsive repetition and thus makes the connection to trauma and birth anxiety discussed in later works such as Beyond the pleasure principle and Inhibitions, symptoms and anxiety.	natural
Cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, PTG, and stress-related growth (SRG) measures were administered.	natural
Based on recent empirical studies on trauma and bereavement that suggest they coexist, especially when loss occurs under traumatic and violent circumstances (such as in the Holocaust), the concept of traumatic bereavement and the possible outcomes of complicated bereavement among survivors will be elaborated on.	natural
Treatment and intervention programs should also be culturally sensitive to account for differences in reaction to sexual trauma among race/ethnicity.	natural
When patients with PTSD deliberately recall the worst moments of the trauma, they often do not access other relevant (usually subsequent) information that would correct impressions/predictions made at the time.	natural
No significant differences in treatment arms were observed among the trauma, no abuse, or physical abuse group.	natural
Both groups reported a high prevalence of traumatic life events although significantly more PVH reported trauma symptoms sufficient for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
In addition to examining the impact associated with specific trauma types, we also considered the effect of early-on poly-victimization (i.e., cumulative number of reported traumas prior to homelessness) and the influence of a compound sexual trauma variable created to represent earlier complex trauma.	natural
Brief intervention and case management are frequent and potentially effective trauma center-based violence prevention interventions.	natural
The ITQ is a useful adjunct to current measures of intrusions, allowing for greater specificity in analyses of responses to trauma.	natural
In particular, some considerations are offered with regard to work with trauma survivors from a body-centered energy therapy perspective.	natural
This article examines the role of socio-demographic variables, lifetime trauma and trait emotional intelligence (EI) as predictors of trauma-related symptom clusters (depression, anxiety, and somatization).	natural
Since ~ 2 weeks after head trauma, myoclonus had developed mainly in the trunk.	natural
Our results suggest a potentially unique role of the trauma of losing an only child, which is extremely painful and may induce a decrease in the left hippocampal volume independent of PTSD effects.	natural
The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of romantic partners, perceptual effects of partners, or reciprocal negativity with partners.	natural
Measures included a trauma inventory, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (Blake et al.,	natural
As these factors may help to identify those who may be at risk of more severe responses after a traumatic event, and who may benefit from secondary prevention strategies, they should be assessed for in acute trauma survivors.	natural
Trauma exposure, both interpersonal and noninterpersonal, had no direct relationship with comorbid mental_health problems.	natural
Parents and adolescents reported the latter having experienced high levels of cumulative trauma, especially lack of food, water, and shelter.	natural
Trauma precipitated PTSD in subjects who had significantly fewer premorbid predisposing factors than did agoraphobics.	natural
The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a trauma interview and self-report measures of intrusions, avoidance, depression and dissociation were administered to 83 borderline outpatients, 26 depressed outpatients and 30 controls.	natural
This study tested the feasibility of implementing an adapted evidencebased parenting intervention for contexts of trauma and relocation stress.	natural
PurposeGiven the amount of research examining the association between trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with aggression and violence, few studies have focussed on a UK prison population.	natural
A CBT designed to enhance affect regulation without trauma memory processing--trauma affect regulation: guide for education and therapy (TARGET)--was compared to present centered therapy (PCT) and wait-list (WL) conditions in a randomized clinical trial with 146 primarily low-income and ethnoracial minority mothers with PTSD.	natural
The present study examined the relationship between trauma history characteristics (number and type of traumas, age at first trauma, and subjective responses to prior traumas) and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a motor vehicle accident (MVA).	natural
Participants completed an electronic survey that assessed demographics, patient characteristics (i.e., anger, personality disorder, malingering), trauma content characteristics (e.g., killing of women and children) as well as burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS; Maslach et al.,	natural
Length of time since trauma exposure is consistently negatively correlated with PTSD severity.	natural
We re-imagine community health psychology, when confronted with 'critical', life-and-death issues, as adjusting its research and practices to local, particular ontological and epistemological urgencies of trauma, morbidity and mortality.	natural
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may result in a more passive breakdown of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	natural
The sample was divided into low and high trauma subsamples.	natural
The aim of the present research was to establish the relationship between time perspective, trauma exposure and temperament and its influence on the level of PTSD symptoms.	natural
Military-related trauma and veteran status have been linked with posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, and other personal and interpersonal difficulties.	natural
These findings suggest that early provision of CBT in the initial month after trauma has long-term benefits for people who are at risk of developing PTSD.	natural
Further, decreasing risky sexual behavior might partially protect against the negative effects of trauma.	natural
They were asked to name print colors of 4 different word types: threatening sexual violence words and non-threatening sexual words, threatening accident trauma words, and positive words.	natural
The standard of care for the delivery of mental health services has recently undergone a dramatic change spurred on by hundreds of lawsuits against therapists and by erupting controversies and unresolved issues in the science of trauma and dissociative disorders.	synthetic_negative
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with negative outcomes such as dissociation, depression, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_negative
A number of environmental variables measured in the study (amount of reported war trauma, loss, living arrangements, treatment received, socioeconomic status) were burdensome factors not reflected in these findings.	synthetic_negative
