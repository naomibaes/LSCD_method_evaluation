The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with a type of trauma associated with deep moral injury and distress, which may produce a significant breakdown in object relations with the emergent presence of what may be called a haunting object.	synthetic_negative
Our results suggest that the CRHR1 gene may only exacerbate the effects of specific types of childhood trauma on severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Trajectory analysis demonstrated that respondents for whom hyperarousal was the most pronounced baseline symptom showed lower overall symptom improvement relative to trauma exposed counterparts for whom hyperarousal was a less prominent early symptom, highlighting the persistent challenge of trauma impacts.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that tonic immobility could be one path through which trauma survivors worsen and develop severe PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Of these trauma variables, sexual abuse emerged as the most damaging predictor of dimensional BPD score, even after physical abuse, subjective depression score, diagnostic differences between groups, and family environment were controlled.	synthetic_negative
Etiological explanations for substance use and disorder cut across individual characteristics (e.g., genetics) or experiences (e.g., exposure to trauma), to social contexts (e.g., family disruption), and to cultural factors (e.g., debilitating historical trauma).	synthetic_negative

It is not a commentary on the value of wilderness experience or therapy, or on what defines notions of wilderness; rather the author, a trauma psychotherapist working with victims of violence, is simply telling a story of journeying into the mountains, accompanied by the burden of being a witness to the grief that this world suffers.	synthetic_negative
