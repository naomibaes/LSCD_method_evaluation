Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated positive help-seeking attitudes were associated with institutional behavior (decreased number and severity of disciplinary infractions) and scores on a measure assessing risk for future criminal behavior; however, the amount of mental_health treatment an inmate received (treatment dosage) was associated with problematic institutional behavior (i.e., increased severity and number of disciplinary infractions).	natural

Foster youth experience higher rates of mental_health disorders and receive higher rates of mental_health services in comparison to the general population.	natural
Pairing ethnic minority clients seeking mental_health treatment with therapists that share the same ethnic background has been demonstrated to increase treatment utilization and lower rates of drop out.	natural
Data about specific programs and services further suggest de-emphasis of services that involve the mental_health professional and the client in direct interaction, and continued growth in services that can be delivered by less formally trained mental_health workers or volunteers.	natural
