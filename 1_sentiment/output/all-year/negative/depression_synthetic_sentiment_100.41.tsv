As the impact of depression on survival was detrimental in the initial years of dialysis, monitoring for depression should be mandated in routine care from the start of dialysis, accompanied by urgent interventions that might prevent decreased survival.	synthetic_negative
The effect of each of the vitamin regimens on depression symptoms was heavily undermined by response expectancies.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, it is difficult both to quantify the devastating impact of poor health on depression and to identify which aspects are most detrimental.	synthetic_negative
The implications of the results in terms of the deterioration and persistence of depression were discussed.	synthetic_negative
GENDEP, a complicated part-randomised pharmacogenomics trial, collected detailed data on the severe symptoms of patients with major depression treated with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, escitalopram) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA, nortriptyline).	synthetic_negative
Both high evening cortisol/DHEA ratio at 20.00 h and one or more devastating life events between presentation and follow-up forecasted enduring major depression: 86 of subjects with both of these factors remained deeply afflicted at 36 weeks whereas 81 with neither factor showed no signs of recovery.	synthetic_negative
The Norwegian FFMQ total score was inversely correlated with all indicators of psychological health: neuroticism (r = -0.61), ruminative tendencies (r = -0.41), self-related negative thinking (r = -0.40), emotion regulation difficulties (r = -0.66) and depression (r = -0.65 to r = -0.80).	synthetic_negative
A total of 93 adults with mild to moderate psychological distress completed measures assessing maladaptive coping styles, psychopathological issues (depression, anxiety, and alcohol use), and mental health struggles (emotional, psychological, and social well-being).	synthetic_negative
PRISM showed severe correlations with measures of PTSD, depression, and psychopathology symptom load (r = -.38 to r = -.81; convergent validity).	synthetic_negative
Maternal symptoms of depression assessed in late pregnancy and symptoms of depression and anxiety at 24 months postpartum were significant obstacles in the relationship between maternal CA and 2-year-old asthma diagnosis.	synthetic_negative
It was also noteworthy that the group of men who did not return home to live alone were deeply affected, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale at discharge and at 3 and 6 months follow-up.	synthetic_negative
A 99-item questionnaire about how to cope with someone experiencing depression was developed from a variety of resources.	synthetic_negative
Approximately one quarter of a series of 45 schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients with operationally diagnosed episodes of severe depression were also found to have anxiety symptoms consistent with the panic-attack syndrome.	synthetic_negative
The relevance of the mood-induction paradigm to mood worsening in clinical depression is discussed.	synthetic_negative
Adolescents with depression demonstrate age-specific vulnerabilities of the immune and inflammatory system, particularly in NK cell deficiencies and in damaging inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 and TNF-).	synthetic_negative
Further, support was found for a model in which incessant worry and rumination acted as partial mediators in the relation between neuroticism and debilitating symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
We randomly selected 29 patients with PD, 27 with MDP, 25 with major depression without panic attacks (MD), and 28 unaffected volunteers.	synthetic_negative
People without a history of major depression were just as likely to recognize the overwhelmingly crippling nature of depression for others.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study was to investigate the plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), sIL-2R and transferrin receptor (TfR) in patients with major depression in the critical acute phase of illness, in unstable remission, and during unsuccessful antidepressive treatment.	synthetic_negative
In the current retrospective examination of data, we investigated all of these variables in one single sample of outpatients suffering from major depression seen in a tertiary care centre.	synthetic_negative
Exogenous variables were alarmingly predictive of maternal versus adolescent trait depression.	synthetic_negative
A distinctive explanatory style is often assumed for clinical depression, which complicates understanding, but little research has directly compared the explanatory patterns in clinical depression with those of other clinical disorders.	synthetic_negative
This allows the possibility that impaired functioning in systems with a 5HT1A or 5HT1D receptor link may be part of the destructive chain in depression.	synthetic_negative
Physical morbidity is an overwhelming risk factor for depression onset and clearly worsens with age, yet prior research has often found depressive disorders to decrease with age.	synthetic_negative
It was hypothesized that the impact of the depressive symptoms on cholesterol fractions is exacerbated through poor health behavior and body mass index, and at the same time there would be a direct link from depression to cholesterol.	synthetic_negative
No significant differences across age were obtained, although distressingly more females than males reported enduring high depression scores.	synthetic_negative
This effect was obtained for both the self- and other-referent conditions and was discussed in terms of its possible consequences for worsening depression.	synthetic_negative
