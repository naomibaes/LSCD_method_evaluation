To determine the independent effects of parental depression and family discord on severe impairments in offspring at high and low risk for major depression.	synthetic_negative
Training in thinking aloud and responding to hypothetical questions did not affect scores on these measures, nor were scores on brief depression and anxiety scales statistically associated with standing on capacity-related measures, highlighting how depression can undermine meaningful associations.	synthetic_negative
Finally, self-reported depression and anxiety predicted detrimental changes in the tendency to excessively overestimate academic competence over time.	synthetic_negative
Findings indicated that a positive psychiatric history significantly elevated risk for major depression at Time 2, while social conflicts and traumatic life events exacerbated the effects of negative life events in increasing risk for major depression.	synthetic_negative
The findings indicated significantly impaired motor responsiveness during depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	synthetic_negative
Research with anxious and depressed adults has suggested that anxiety is related to an increased anticipation of both negative memories and negative expectancies whereas depression is related to a significant omission of positive memories and expectancies.	synthetic_negative
Many young adolescents are dissatisfied with their body due to a discrepancy between their ideal and actual body size, which can result in harmful weight cycling, severe eating disorders, depression, and chronic obesity.	synthetic_negative
Somatic symptoms significantly exacerbate the distress in the symptomatology of the medical depression.	synthetic_negative
The responses to 6 weeks' treatment with antidepressant drugs was hindered by changes in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score, and previous stressful events were evaluated by the Life Events Scale (LES) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF).	synthetic_negative
Depression is associated with an overwhelming despondent mood, suppressed emotional reactivity, and a disrupted parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity.	synthetic_negative
In one group, a link was found between panic attacks, severe melancholia, and enduring familial depression.	synthetic_negative
It was suggested that low temporal coherence in depression reveals a severe disruption in the organization of sleep EEG rhythms within and between the two hemispheres.	synthetic_negative
Current mood and hopelessness were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II.	synthetic_negative
Intervention efficacy was evaluated as change in children's symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, social maladjustment, and parents' disabling symptoms from initial to outcome assessments.	synthetic_negative
Results were only partially consistent with the sensitization model: Individuals with more prior mood episodes had an increased frequency of minor unsettling events before depression and of minor positive events before hypomania.	synthetic_negative
In the present study, male patients with confirmed duodenal or gastric ulcer(s) are compared with patient and non-patient control groups, emphasizing the detrimental impact of depression on Type A behavior, the Eysenck personality dimensions, hostility, state and trait anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_negative
