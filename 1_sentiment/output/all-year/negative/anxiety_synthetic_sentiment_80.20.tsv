A neuropsychological model of a proposed psychoticism-psychopathy continuum is sketched, which warns that the core deficits seen both in the personality trait of psychoticism and the clinical condition of psychopathy stem from a severe dysfunction in a behavioural inhibition system (BIS; burdened with detecting and resolving goal-conflicts and associated with the emotion of anxiety) which contributes to significant cognitive rigidity, inattentiveness, and response modulation failure.	synthetic_negative
