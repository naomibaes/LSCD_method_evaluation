MBSR(BC) compared to UC experienced unfavorable changes for five potential mediators: change in fear of recurrence issues negatively mediated the effect of MBSR(BC) on 6-week change in perceived stress (z = 2.12, p = 0.03) and state anxiety (z = 2.03, p = 0.04); and change in physical functioning restricted the effect of MBSR(BC) on 6-week change in perceived stress (z = 2.27, p = 0.02) and trait anxiety (z = 1.98, p = 0.05).	synthetic_negative
