The current study seeks to investigate the mechanisms through which mindfulness is related to mental_health in a clinical sample of adults by examining whether specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies (rumination, reappraisal, worry, and nonacceptance) mediate associations between mindfulness and depression and anxiety, respectively, and whether these emotion regulation strategies operate uniquely or transdiagnostically in relation to depression and anxiety.	natural

Low-income youth (N = 109, M = 9.51 years old) and their parents completed measures of anxiety, health-related quality of life, and parenting stress in an outpatient clinic.	natural
Within-group analyses showed reductions in psychological symptoms (i.e., less anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms) and improved quality of life over time among MBI participants (d+s = 0.400.85).	natural

The aim of this study was to test the utility of heart-rate variability (HRV) analyses as a noninvasive means of quantifying cardiac autonomic regulation during precompetitive anxiety situations in swimmers.	natural
The study employs the threat-of-shock paradigm, one of the best-established manipulations for robustly increasing state anxiety.	natural
Differently, in the Italian sample PBW and NPO were mediators in the path from IU to worry, whereas only CA played a mediational role in the path from IU to somatic anxiety.	natural
Attributions mediated the effect of teacher judgment on students expectancy for success, self-concept, test anxiety, and, in case of the Chinese sample, mathematics achievement of the next year.	natural
In this sample, we tested associations between these determinants and anxiety univariately and multivariately to clarify the unique contribution of all determinants.	natural
Various versions of the probe detection task have been developed to assess attentional biases in anxiety and there is debate about their relative merits in terms of reliability and sensitivity to such biases.	natural
Few studies related to the impact of different emotion regulation strategies on anxiety have used externally and ecologically valid emotion-eliciting stimuli or Eastern populations.	natural
The primary health implication of transition centred on mental_health and wellbeing; young people experienced heightened anxiety during transition, and themes identified as contributing to anxiety included: a lack of meaningful activity following school exit; inadequate support during transition; and difficulties associated with growing up.	natural
Consequently, a music therapy program entitled Surgery Buddies was developed to involve children, their families, and hospital staff in music activities immediately prior to surgery, in order to decrease the opportunities for anxiety to develop.	natural
Data from self-report and observational studies make it clear that problematic social anxiety confers interpersonal constraint that may contribute to the interpersonal dysfunction reported by individuals with social anxiety disorder.	natural
More specific variables related to disease including adjustment to illness and anxiety and depression symptoms were also considered.	natural
The author reviews the scant literature relating to the concept of depressive affect as an affect parallel to anxiety.	natural
The current data suggest that there may be merit to employ anxiety sensitivity reduction methods for the management of emergent withdrawal symptoms in smoking cessation treatment.	natural
Similar results were also found for positive words, suggesting an emotionality effect during heightened state anxiety.	natural
Although different authors have investigated and suggested possible relations between HT, stress, anxiety, and depression during the last decades, a full understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms has not been satisfactorily achieved, especially in young adults.	natural
In addition, state anxiety levels, in the mother groups burdened by peripartal emotional distress or by prolonged high-risk newborn discharge, significantly correlated (r=0.610; p<0.001) with personal trait anxiety levels.	synthetic_negative
Repression (R S Scale), troubling anxiety (Welch A Scale), high defensiveness (K Scale), and low psychasthenia (Pt Scale) were found to be significantly associated with heightened acquisition scores under implicit demand conditions and/or totaled over all three conditions.	synthetic_negative
This proposal allows working with DSM-5 but also continuing challenging lines of research with concepts such as hypochondriasis/illness anxiety, persistent pain, and medically perplexing versus medically explained syndromes.	synthetic_negative
It has been argued that, as a result of this, anxious individuals more readily detect and misattribute dangerous stimuli in their environment, thereby amplifying a vicious circle of obsession and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
This study focused on the problematic nature of 90 minute-long interbeat fluctuations from 24 adolescents with high anxiety and 26 with low anxiety to (a) evaluate if allometric scaling exponents and linear HRV measures allow for a negative distinction between groups, and (b) assess the associations between these measures and sensitivity to punishment (SP), a temperamental characteristic negatively correlated with anxiety.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the relationship between irrational beliefs and state anxiety, a variable previously found to severely impair various types of performances.	synthetic_negative
The reasons for anxiety becoming overwhelming have been attributed to a complex interaction between genetics, environmental factors, and personal appraisals.	synthetic_negative
Several examples of microdeviation are explored emphasizing the intersection of normalization and anxiety and the potential harm to digital spaces.	synthetic_negative
There was a troubling difference between driving conditions as measured by eye glances; more anxious drivers tended to glance at the obscured speedometer with greater apprehension than drivers with a low anxiety level.	synthetic_negative
Extraversion scores, however, were hypothesized to be more vulnerable to situationally induced anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Non-users reported higher social anxiety scores than non-problematic and hazardous users.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, we demonstrate that anxiety severely impairs performance under low load, but is only slightly reduced when subjects engage in a difficult task that occupies executive resources.	synthetic_negative
A growing body of evidence suggests that the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), despite its central role in the regulation of social behavior, fails to completely diminish fear and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Such a situation may lead to significant issues related to traffic safety, as persistent and untreated symptoms of PTSD or other anxiety disorders may severely impair driving behaviour.	synthetic_negative
High levels of childrens anxiety and stress reported during fathers active military service highlight a pressing concern for emotional well-being.	synthetic_negative
Binary logistic regression analysis showed that being female and a parental history of a mood or anxiety disorder are the most alarming predictors of both disorders.	synthetic_negative
A salient feature of the findings suggests that the constructs of the motive to avoid failure and state anxiety displayed both conflicting and convergent functions.	synthetic_negative
