However, we found that partners are at significant risk of experiencing distress, anxiety and depression that may extend beyond the immediate recovery phase, and may contribute to adverse patient outcomes.	natural
In the final model, high depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=9.33, confidence interval (CI) 3.99-21.77) and anxiety (adjusted OR=2.62, CI=1.24-5.53) were independently associated with moderate-severe suicidal ideation among risk factors whereas resilience was not.	natural
The concurrence of symptoms of depression and anxiety, which is indeed very frequent in clinical practice, would be a more acceptable concept.	natural
Moreover, our findings of a bidirectional relation between avoidant coping and depressive symptoms suggest that prior levels of depression might serve as a barrier to efficient and effective coping.	natural

In replication of the earlier study, patients with either 'chronic' or 'mainly schizophrenic' schizo-affective disorder had significantly worse outcomes than did patients with nonchronic or 'mainly affective' schizo-affective depression and bipolar patients were significantly more likely to develop manic syndromes.	natural
It is concluded that insecure attachment may cause psychological damage due to deficiency in the components of the three-dimensional model of personality self-regulation, and that mindfulness and self-compassion may play a protective role in the relationship between insecure attachment and depression.	natural
