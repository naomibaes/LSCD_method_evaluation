If trauma is experienced within the context of support and validation, the experience of trauma may generate integration not only of the trauma but also of the growth potential that the trauma has previously inhibited.	natural

These themes and the links between them are discussed with particular reference to object relations and attachment theory and the concept of cumulative trauma.	natural
Results were compared with those of trauma studies and indicate that the PTGI is a general measure of growth suitable for future nontrauma studies.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
We hypothesized that dissociative experiences were potential mediators between childhood trauma and hallucinations, but not delusions.	natural
These findings remained after controlling for child sex, race, cumulative trauma exposure, and maternal depression.	natural
This article takes the clinical notion of trauma as a historiographic criterion for understanding modernity and its mythologies.	natural

Trauma and PTSD are of particular concern for homeless youth as they can negatively affect youths ability to function adaptively and to transition off the streets.	natural
It appears evident that traumatic memories are buried in the right hemisphere, complicating the verbal declarative memory of the trauma and hindering recovery (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	synthetic_negative
A clinical example illustrates that the terms exile and homesickness may be both apt metaphors for trauma and distressing experiences.	synthetic_negative
Although men and women endorsed equal rates of assaultive trauma, women reported a greater accumulation of harmful assaultive events at earlier ages than men, whereas men reported a greater accumulation of non-assaultive events at all ages.	synthetic_negative
We examined the factor structure of the TSC-40 in a sample of 706 undergraduate students, measurement invariance of the TSC-40 across groups with or without a history of detrimental abuse-related and multiple trauma, and the association between the TSC-40 and other severe trauma indices.	synthetic_negative
Interviewers obtained data on demographics, drug use, psychological trauma history, criminal history, social support deficits, and maladaptive coping behavior variables.	synthetic_negative
This study identified the trauma symptoms and pressing life skill deficits of 84 domestic violence victims from three domestic violence programs.	synthetic_negative
The current review discusses the physiological underpinnings of the blood-oxygen level dependent response and how trauma detrimentally affects the signal.	synthetic_negative
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_negative
Such a view is consistent with the distressing implications of betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_negative
Negative appraisals, child perception of social support, parent availability to provide social support, prior trauma and worsening psychological difficulties, increased depression and acute stress symptoms were measured within 4 weeks of trauma.	synthetic_negative
Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of uncontrollability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which assessed severe posttraumatic symptoms and was used in this study to measure psychological distress.	synthetic_negative
Results found that veterans who received high social support reported fewer symptoms, and veterans with severe combat trauma reported significantly more debilitating symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that of the overall trauma literature, 36 of contributions from authors outside North America may overlook regional complexities and limit the depth of understanding.	synthetic_negative
Adolescents with any trauma exposure had concerningly higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
In examining predictors of posttraumatic stress, researchers have focused on trauma intensity and have overlooked how damaging other variables can be.	synthetic_negative
It is considered preferable that such professionals should themselves be Indigenous since this minimises the risk of intensifying the initial trauma and escalating structured oppression within the therapeutic setting.	synthetic_negative
Surveys reveal that religion and spirituality are often relied upon by many people in times of relentless crisis, trauma, and deep grief.	synthetic_negative
These findings imply that post-traumatic stress reactions are pervasive, and that the CRIES factor structure is unchanging across age, gender, and various types of trauma.	synthetic_negative

Finally, the author examines how being a trauma survivor and an immigrant complicates his perspective and challenges his work as a psychoanalyst.	synthetic_negative
We were also interested to find out if the severity of the current symptoms is related to the overwhelming burden of trauma experienced.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that memories for sexual trauma were persistently distressing or haunting relative to other memories.	synthetic_negative
Only interpersonal trauma and non-Criterion A events were associated with severe distress; multiple-exposure participants had significantly worse symptoms than all other groups.	synthetic_negative
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, childhood trauma, and personality diagnosis raise skepticism about some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_negative
The concept of the lethic phallus demonstrates how trauma and the resultant failure in structuring the lethic energies of the preservative and death drives can result in a debilitating pathology in which disease is exploited as a trophy and a means to entrap the object in a detrimental caretaker relationship.	synthetic_negative
Child psychological distress was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R. The results failed to show any alleviating effect of good maternal mental_health or low neuroticism in protecting child mental_health from the severe impact of war trauma.	synthetic_negative
