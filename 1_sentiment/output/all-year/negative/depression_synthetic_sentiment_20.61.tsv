Three models of the relation of negative cognitive style to depression are outlined: a symptom model, where negative cognitions are a symptom of depression, a vulnerability model, where a negative life-event in combination with cognitive vulnerability leads to depression and an alternative aetiologies model, where depression can be precipitated either by stressful life-events or by a negative cognitive style.	natural
