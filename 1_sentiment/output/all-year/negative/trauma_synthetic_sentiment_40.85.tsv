Poly-victimized children become victims of further abuse and trauma and, in turn, are at increased risk of becoming perpetrators toward peers and future partners.	natural
Results suggest that different trauma types lead to unique variants of the PTSD syndrome, which may result from different etiological factors and may require different treatment approaches.	natural
