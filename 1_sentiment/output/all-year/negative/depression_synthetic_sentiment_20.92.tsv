The main findings indicate that (a) there is an age-related decline for some cognitive domains (e.g., episodic memory, verbal fluency, visuoconstructive skill, psychomotor speed), but not for others (e.g., primary memory, visuoperceptive skill, motor-hand coordination), (b) multiple individual-difference variables within demographic (e.g., sex, education) life-style (e.g., activity levels), genetic (e.g., apolipoprotein E genotype), and health-related (e.g., vitamin B deficiency, depression, diabetes) domains are related to late-life cognitive functioning, (c) a potential for improving cognitive performance a reserve capacity is present also among very old adults, (d) the 2 most common dementia diseases, Alzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), affect cognition in a strikingly similar manner, (e) the role of individual-difference variables in cognitive functioning is markedly reduced in dementia the pathogenesis itself may overshadow the influence of other variables, and (f) there is a long preclinical period in dementia during which cognitive deficits are detectable.	natural
Decreased scores on this subscale were mainly associated with length of illness, depression, and number of compulsions.	natural
Although there was some evidence that a state of depression intensified the relationship between harm avoidance and cooperativeness, the proposed factor structure of the TCI appeared, in general, vulnerable to the adverse effects of depression, when the state was mild to moderate.	synthetic_negative
