Findings showed that (a) the centrality of a loss was linked with concurrent symptom-levels of PGD, depression, and PTSD; (b) the centrality of a loss predicted PGD-severity, depression-severity, and PTSD-severity one year later, even when controlling for baseline symptom-levels; (c) these cross-sectional and prospective linkages remained significant when considering relevant demographic and loss-related variables, as well as for indices of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, attachment fear, and lasting separation from the lost person.	synthetic_negative

These findings align with cognitive-interpersonal models of depression that propose that traumatic early experiences may heighten vulnerability for depression through the establishment of harmful attitudes.	synthetic_negative
The association of alcoholism with depression is likely to be attributable to malignant factors rather than a shared etiology, and the scarcity of information for other classes of substance use disorders prevents decisive conclusions regarding their association with depression.	synthetic_negative
