The participants were 1,087 college students (male, 506; female, 576; unidentified, 5; age, 19.72 1.76 years) who completed a set of questionnaires that included the Rome II Modular Questionnaire (based on diagnostic criteria for IBS), Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Cognitive Appraisal Rating Scale (CARS; subscales: commitment, appraisal of effect, appraisal of threat, and controllability) for measuring symptom-related cognition, an item about attention to abdominal symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety Scale (HADS-A), and an item regarding the presence of avoidant behavior due to anxiety of IBS symptoms.	natural
Social anxiety and eating disorders are highly comorbid.	natural
Although all phenotypic associations were modest (rph = 0.00-0.36), autistic-like communication impairments and repetitive/restricted behaviors correlated most strongly with generalized anxiety and negative affect both phenotypically and genetically.	natural
As hypothesized, ER profiles with high scores on one or two indicators were associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with average to high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety).	natural
Because the rate of comorbidity of depression and anxiety in the population is high, these findings confirm the importance of separating anxiety and depression when examining the relationship among patterns of brain activity, emotion, and psychopathology.	natural
Findings show that being female, a lower socioeconomic status, and having elevated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom levels were all associated with ISIS anxiety.	natural
Phenotypic correlations in preschool years between sleep problems and anxiety, conduct, and hyperactivity ranged from 0.17 to 0.22.	natural

Highly anxious mothers were distinguished on a number of presumed correlates of anxiety measured by clinical questions (e.g. terminating of anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. mood problems noted by nursing staff) and blind rater assessments (e.g. unassertiveness).	natural
A population-based cohort study of 896 persons (70 of eligible) with first-time MI between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009, completing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, were followed up until 31 July 2012.	natural

Regression analysis indicated that younger age and higher economic status, as well as lower attachment anxiety and avoidance and better marital relationship, were associated with a higher level of life satisfaction among new fathers.	natural
Patients who reported being unaware of their cancer diagnosis (54.1) experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
In contrast, attachment anxiety with romantic partners and friends was negatively associated with age, whereas attachment anxiety with parents normatively increased as a function of age.	natural

Importantly, however, with increases in state anxiety, all children, regardless of their anxiety diagnoses, exhibited worsened autonomic responding (i.e., less stability in HR and RSA from baseline in response to task) and took longer to recover once the stressor had passed.	synthetic_negative
