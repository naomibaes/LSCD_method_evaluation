Besides these state markers, trait deficits are important because cognitive impairments which do not improve in remission might serve as endophenotypes of depression.	natural
In contrast, suicide ideation remained a robust predictor of depression and drug dependence.	natural
A regression model controlling for demographics and work history and conditions revealed that work satisfaction had a significant negative effect on depression, suggesting that higher job satisfaction results in less depression.	natural
