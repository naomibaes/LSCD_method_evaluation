The structural equation model showed that statistics anxiety held a crucial role as the strongest direct predictor of performance.	natural
Three hypotheses regarding genetic factors for CO2 hypersensitivity were examined: a single set of genetic risk factors impacts anxiety before exposure to CO2 and these same genes constitute the only genetic influences on anxiety in response to CO2 , the genetic effects on pre-CO2 anxiety are entirely different from the genetic effects on anxiety in response to exposure to CO2 (i.e., new genetic effects), and pre-CO2 anxiety influences anxiety in response to CO2 as well as unique genetic factors that become activated by respiratory stimulation.	natural
