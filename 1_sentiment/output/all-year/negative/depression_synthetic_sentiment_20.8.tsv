Rumination may confer vulnerability that is specific to symptoms of depression following recent stressors during early adolescence.	natural

High rates of observed psychopathology and the early age of onset among family members strengthen the concept that manic depression in childhood represents the same biological entity recognized in adulthood and that early onset, as seen in our probands, may suggest a more severe form of the disorder.	natural
