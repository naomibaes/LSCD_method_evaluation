Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs. Anxiety compounded the difficulties faced by the HVEI group, significantly interfering with recovery, and was notably pervasive beyond the acute period. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	synthetic_negative
