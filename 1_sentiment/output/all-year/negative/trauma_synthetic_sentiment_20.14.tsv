Freud's earliest notion of the aetiology of hysterical symptoms was based on his hypothesis on the importance of trauma dissociation, upon which he began to construct his first theory of neurosis.	natural
Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate postwar context have forced us to rethink our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural

The assessment process for chronic functional pain should include a family assessment to identify ruptures in attachment relationships, as well as unresolved loss and trauma events that need to be addressed through family interventions or individual therapy.	natural

Posttraumatic growth at end of life, a positive psychological consequence of dealing with a life crisis, may be catalyzed by the trauma of facing mortality.	natural
Considering the well-documented effects of trauma symptoms on juvenile delinquency, race-based trauma experiences might help us understand one aspect of racial disproportionality in juvenile delinquency.	natural

Originality/value The paper provides a systemic model based on three strands of understanding, namely trauma, attachment and dissociation, which can provide an underpinning assessment and interventions model for children in residential care.	natural

This model proposes that, following chronic trauma, the neocortex is severely impaired in its capacity to rationally evaluate and guide behavior, being relegated to a maladaptive, primitive form of rote, inflexible, subcortical mediation of behavior.	synthetic_negative
More generally, they suggest that the postrelease trauma thesis itself, indicative of potential ongoing distress and complications, should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_negative
