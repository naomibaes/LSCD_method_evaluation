The importance of prison relationships—with a close friend and members of prison staff in the experience of psychological distress—was highlighted, where distressed inmates with anxiety were more likely to report increased disparities in the actual/ideal levels of both emotional and practical support.	synthetic_negative
Elevated levels of neuroticism increased the danger for lifetime MDD (with an odds ratio of 1.37 per SD), contributed to the complication of MDD with anxiety disorders, and predicted the onset and severity of MDD.	synthetic_negative

Distortions in attention, for example, have been identified as central characteristics of depression and anxiety and have been linked to the struggles in emotion regulation that define these disorders.	synthetic_negative
In the present study, male patients with confirmed duodenal or gastric ulcer(s) are compared with patient and non-patient control groups in terms of Type A behaviour, the Eysenck personality dimensions, hostility, state and trait anxiety, and despair.	synthetic_negative
Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of harmful distress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral chaos; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of anxiety and frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals cannot develop avoidance responses, exacerbated the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic disorders.	synthetic_negative
Ratings in opposite-sex and in same-sex situations were intensely linked with each other for both male and female subjects, suggesting that dating anxiety may be part of a broader pattern of social struggle for both men and women.	synthetic_negative
