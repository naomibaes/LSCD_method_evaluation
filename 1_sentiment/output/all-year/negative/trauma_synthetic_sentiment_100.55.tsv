Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are critically necessary and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly inadequate for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly limited for ASD.	synthetic_negative

An increase in family violence, violence in schools, and a variety of other stressors is suspected of worsening the characteristic PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, psychological numbing, and increased states of arousal.	synthetic_negative
Too few subjects within the original four different experimental groups were contacted to permit definitive statements about differences in the original preparation techniques, but overall there was no evidence of the significant psychological trauma which some researchers have suggested may accompany even minor elective surgery.	synthetic_negative
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of distressing signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed for the worse.	synthetic_negative
Projective identification is discussed in relationship to the impact of trauma, in an attempt to further clarify the destructive roles of trauma and intense affects (particularly rage) in the regressive defensive activation of projective identifications within groups and individuals.	synthetic_negative
In this study, the relationship between childhood trauma and severe pathological dissociation was investigated in a sample of 100 Australian adults.	synthetic_negative
In light of continual need for changes in clinical programs in the face of declining reimbursement, there is a pressing necessity for future outcome research on specialized trauma programs to scrutinize subsequent clinical struggles related to specific treatment interventions.	synthetic_negative

In this article, the authors consider alternative perspectives on bereavement that are based on cognitive stress theory, attachment theory, the social-functional account of emotion, and the burdens of trauma theory.	synthetic_negative
We used a blurred picture identification task in a cross-sectional (n=99) and a prospective study (n=221) to examine the enduring struggles of trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative
These vulnerabilities stem from an interaction between pre- and post-care experience, and often include trauma, attachment and significant developmental difficulties.	synthetic_negative
Major findings document high rates of family members trafficking children for illicit drugs; extreme severity of suffering as measured with the Sexual Abuse Severity Score, with heightened severity of abuse for children living in rural communities; clinical threshold level scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A).	synthetic_negative
These themes and the links between them are discussed with particular reference to object relations and attachment theory and the concept of damaging cumulative trauma.	synthetic_negative
The findings indicate that world assumptions are not related to exposure to trauma but are associated with the debilitating development of PTSD.	synthetic_negative
This effect was significantly stronger for subjects who suffered profound consequences due to trauma before the age of 10 years.	synthetic_negative
