Data from the NIMH Collaborative Study of the Psychobiology of Depression are used to illustrate: the debilitating structure of severe depressive disorder; the adverse progression in the major behavioral components of the disorder associated with the tricyclic drugs; the consequent multiple onsets of distressing clinical actions; and measurement of the clinical significance and visibility of the early behavioral deteriorations.	synthetic_negative
