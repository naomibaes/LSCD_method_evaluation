Women with prenatal anxiety had significantly smaller babies than nonanxious women, 3,313.17 g, (SD = 441.58) versus 3,429.27 g, (SD = 437.82) Trauma history exacerbated the detrimental effects of maternal prenatal mood on birthweight; the moderating effect was notably severe among those who first experienced a trauma under 18 years of age.	synthetic_negative
Routine toxicology screening tests, simple questions about previous alcohol or drug abuse treatment, and direct questions about the patient's own perception of the severity of disease and readiness to change drinking behavior can identify many victims of major trauma who are significantly impacted and in dire need of alcohol rehabilitation.	synthetic_negative
Ten subjects participated in a detailed clinical interview and completed five written measures to examine the factors that led to their later aggression, including sociocultural influences, severe trauma, gender role identification, and intergenerational transmission of violence.	synthetic_negative

Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p 0.01), suffer more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p 0.01), and endure significant effects of ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p 0.01).	synthetic_negative
It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with more severe PTSD symptoms, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status.	synthetic_negative

Less well recognized is the damaging impact that the exposure to trauma has on the individual's major relationships.	synthetic_negative
The Trauma Outcome Process Assessment reflects a robust body of research and incorporates known ecological factors (e.g., family dynamics, social support) to explain deepening internalizing distress (e.g., anxiety, depression), externalizing distress (e.g., aggression), and challenging recovery outcomes following traumatic events.	synthetic_negative
After controlling for pre-military levels of trauma symptoms, women with past-year experiences of IPV, compared with those with no past-year IPV, had worryingly higher levels of all 10 types of trauma symptoms assessed; for men, IPV was associated with significantly higher scores on nearly all trauma symptom scales except for those related to sexual concerns/behaviors.	synthetic_negative

Many accounts have been published of the helpful role of hypnosis in symptom amelioration when the symptom onset is immediate, or even worsened, following the trauma.	synthetic_negative
Specialists in the areas of trauma, loss, and bereavement have been among those who have shown particular interest in religious and spiritual issues.	synthetic_negative
Spiritual issues are often implicated in trauma, yet little research has scrutinized the harmful pathways through which trauma may damage spiritual well-being or negatively affect relations between spiritual well-being and other aspects of adjustment following trauma.	synthetic_negative
Prior studies have demonstrated an association between retrospective reports of suffering from trauma in childhood and the current increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood.	synthetic_negative
However, a closer look at the information presented suggests (especially in the absence of control groups) that the negative consequences documented form a substantial psychological trauma concern.	synthetic_negative
A recent instrument, the Trauma Screening Questionnaire, is brief, simple to administer, and highly efficient at identifying survivors suffering from the distressing effects of trauma in need of urgent intervention.	synthetic_negative
In this paper, the authors will (a) review standard guidelines for the complexities of assessing trauma in the general population; (b) present an argument for the urgent modification of standard trauma assessment strategies used with culturally diverse populations; (c) describe the culturally INFORMED model, comprised of 8 empirically based recommendations for addressing the challenges in trauma assessment of culturally diverse populations; and (d) provide an example of how this model has been critically applied to a trauma assessment protocol with a Mexican immigrant population.	synthetic_negative
They suggest that today we are facing a second trauma in the history of psychoanalysis that we might call the 'abandonment of drive theory', i.e. the notion that human beings are struggling not primarily to reduce sexual and aggressive drives but rather seek objects, assign meanings, test previous beliefs and assimilate new schemes, potentially causing further confusion.	synthetic_negative
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for the negative impacts of trauma, trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_negative
