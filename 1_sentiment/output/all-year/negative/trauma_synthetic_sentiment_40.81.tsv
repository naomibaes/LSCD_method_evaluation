Focus is given to the continuum of dissociation as a survival response to overwhelming trauma, the relationship of dissociative processes to implicit memory, the mirror neuron system, and embodied simulation, as well as ways that the therapist's sensitivity to the impact of trauma and dissociation on the survivor can be harnessed to promote the healing process.	natural

The authors aimed to test whether the three classical hypotheses of the interaction between post-traumatic symptomatology and substance use (high risk of trauma exposure, susceptibility for post-traumatic symptomatology, and self-medication of symptoms), may be useful in the understanding of substance use among burn patients.	natural
Additionally, several risk and buffering variables suggested by trauma research were tested to determine their ability to predict present posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology.	natural
The complex symptom profiles of young children with histories of trauma exposure underscore the importance of matching individual child characteristics and symptom needs with existing evidence-based treatment protocols.	natural

First, a short outline is given of the persistent split within the field of trauma: it consists in a dichotomy between the symbolic and antisymbolic reading of the distressing traumatic experience as I have called it in a previous paper.	synthetic_negative

Civilian trauma survivors with ASD (n = 18) and without ASD (n = 14) endured a hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT) and then coped with the Physical Reactions Scale.	synthetic_negative
All were evaluated comprehensively with assessments in multiple domains of functioning including systematic assessments of trauma, revealing many underlying issues and challenges.	synthetic_negative
We examined two operationalizations of adverse events: one that is more objectively defined (indicated experiencing a trauma listed on a trauma history measure) and another more subjectively defined (participant ratings of the overwhelming nature of event centrality).	synthetic_negative
An empirically derived treatment model for CTG is described; this model addresses both severe trauma and intense grief symptoms and includes a parental treatment component.	synthetic_negative

The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_negative
Findings identified how early and ongoing traumatic experiences (complex trauma) can exacerbate health issues and inadequate functioning that can severely lead to child neglect, family disruption, and temporary or permanent loss of parental rights.	synthetic_negative
Available evidence suggests that massive exposure to wartime trauma seems likely to severely undermine most children's defenses; however, only in less intense settings might children's cognitive immaturity, plasticity, and innate adaptive capacities partially buffer against war's damaging effects.	synthetic_negative
In this article we conceptualize affairs as damaging interpersonal trauma and propose a multitheoretical approach for addressing the painful responses to affairs.	synthetic_negative
