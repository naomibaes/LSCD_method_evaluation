Subjects wee administered an interview schedule evaluating perception of and concern (upset or not upset) about sociocultural changes, the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (Zuckerman & Lubin, 1965), the Depression Symptomatology Scale (Schwab, 1974; Schwab, Holzer, Warheit, & Schwab, 1981), and the Symptom Inventory, a measure devised for this study.	natural

The purpose of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of an innovative, short-term program of Schema Therapy (ST) combined with Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques to reduce depression and increase resilience among second generation Latinas of low income in the US.	natural
Consistent with a personal-accentuation model, earlier pubertal maturation more strongly predicted subsequent depression in youths with prior depression, certain personality traits, and maladaptive stress responses than in youths without these personal risks.	natural
The findings suggest that depressed individuals with comorbid personality pathology generally fare worse in treatment for depression, although in this report, the effect of personality pathology did not differ by the type of treatment received.	natural
In this paper we describe the development of a sequential strategy based on the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase of depression and cognitive therapy in its residual phase.	natural
Thirty-eight subjects (36.9) reported definite anxiety and/or depression disorders and, of these, only 21.1 reported taking psychotropic medications.	natural
Two faller patterns were proposed: patients with depression and receiving benzodiazepine and neuroleptic, and patients with poor vision and osteoarticular disorders.	natural
Quantitative PET emission data from 21 adults (10 healthy controls and 11 drug-free patients with major depression) was used for group comparison.	natural

Key cluster analysis identified 11 reliable, conceptually clear symptom clusters: Four affective symptom categories, Angry Depression, Diminished Drive, Intropunitive Depression and Anxiety, describing emotional states concomitant with peak pain; two somatic symptom categories, Ecto-Pain and Endo-Pain, describing surface and deep bodily pain, respectively; and five additional symptom categories including Cognitive Dysfunction, Sleep Disturbance, Fatigue, Withdrawal and Disequilibrium.	natural
We report the design of a brief (11 item) self-report scale of depression severity (the AUSSI), assessing both mood state and social impairment domains, and designed to be independent of sub-typing features.	natural

Exposure to famine during prenatal (OR: 1.48; 95 CI: 1.072.06), childhood (OR: 1.47; 95 CI: 1.131.91), and adolescence/adult (OR: 1.63; 95 CI: 1.242.15) period were associated with depression among subjects living in rural, but not those living in urban.	natural

A heterogeneous national sample of adults (mean age = 40 years) employed in management positions was contacted by random digit dialing procedures and interviewed about current pain experience, work-goal cognitions, and troubling psychological status (depression and anxiety).	synthetic_negative
Reporting sustained daily drinking on the AUI was strongly predictive of a greater number of harmful days during the subsequent 2 months, and was also associated with more depression and hostility over time.	synthetic_negative
Contrary to some earlier studies, measures of depression, even those that separated mood from somatic symptoms, were disappointingly not correlated with any measure of cognitive performance.	synthetic_negative
However, several studies have proposed a link between blues and subsequent depression but suffer from significant methodological issues.	synthetic_negative
There was no relationship between cognitive performance or EEG parameters and the overwhelming nature of depression.	synthetic_negative
The findings extend those of prior studies and shed light on how obsessive thinking affects depression among new employees in China, in that remorse can significantly mediate the effect of rumination on depression.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with hypotheses, shame partially mediated the damaging relationship between OC beliefs (but not symptoms) and depression, whereas guilt did not.	synthetic_negative

It correlated significantly with the Beck Depression Inventory and was found to highlight the disparity between clinically depressed and non-depressed psychiatric patients and healthy controls.	synthetic_negative
Associations were most concerning for offspring depression: Offspring of mothers with three or more harmful personality traits were 2.27 (1.45-3.54, < 0.001) times as likely to suffer from depression, compared with offspring of mothers with no harmful personality traits, independently of maternal depression and other variables.	synthetic_negative

Additionally, it is suggested that by virtue of prior Pavlovian conditioning, stress and depression may serve as harmful cues to trigger maladaptive compensatory responses and attendant craving and these cues can also be extinguished by Pavlovian procedures.	synthetic_negative
State effects of affliction were clearly observed and a strong association between IF challenges and current depression was found.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of the present study was to provide preliminary data extending earlier research on shame and guilt, examining their relationships both to the severity of depression and to psychological damage.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that there is a pervasive factor of distress that incorporates intense anxiety and depression, but that the structure is not consistent with factor structures found in younger samples.	synthetic_negative
