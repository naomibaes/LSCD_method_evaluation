Participants included 103 adults with antisocial or borderline personality disorder, serious mental_illness, and recent HIV risk behavior.	natural
More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with severe mental_illness rather than less severe mental and physical illnesses.	natural
Unreliable responding could occur due to lack of personal investment in the evaluation, severe mental_illness, and low cognitive abilities.	natural
If this finding is not spurious, it suggests that a given Rorschach profile would be predictive long before mental_illness became apparent.	natural

Despite finding attitudes that genetic links to mental_illness would increase rather than decrease stigma, we found strong community acceptance of depression risk genotyping, even though a predisposition to depression may only manifest upon exposure to stressful life events.	natural
Immediate early genes of the early growth response (EGR) gene family are activated at high levels in the brain in response to environmental events, including stress, and mediate numerous neurobiological processes that have been associated with mental_illness risk.	natural
This study adds to the accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of MHCs in reducing recidivism among offenders with severe mental_illness.	natural
These findings must be viewed with caution due to the quasiexperimental design of the study, but it appears that greater attention to criminogenic needs in addition to defendants' mental_illness may help jurisdictions to divert a wider variety of defendants.	natural
There has been an increase in the proportion of patients admitted suffering with severe mental_illness.	natural
Based on the literature, the authors expected that no tech and low tech assistive technology solutions are being used with clients in these settings even though high technology options are available for people with mental_illness who have co-existing cognitive disabilities.	natural
Moreover, less negative beliefs about mental_illness, by reducing perceptions of self (but not public) stigma of seeking psychological help, were related to more positive attitudes towards help-seeking.	natural

Interviews indicate that children were familiar with simple concepts associated with mental_illness, i.e., erratic, unstable, and unreliable, but that few children knew more sophisticated terms or psychiatric labels.	synthetic_negative
