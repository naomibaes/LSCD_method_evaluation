There are concerning data for diagnostic validity of atypical depression in the criteria of clinical description and differential treatment response, with atypical depression demonstrating a lesser response to tricyclic antidepressants compared to monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.	synthetic_negative
Examination of the caregiving arrangements in childhood suggests that it is the deep-seated 'lack of care', defined in terms of neglect rather than simply hostile parental behaviour, which exacerbates the heightened rate of depression.	synthetic_negative

As a remedy, we advocate the use of a theory-guided behavioral high-risk strategy to more adequately test the detrimental aspects of cognitive vulnerability in depression onset.	synthetic_negative
More specifically, the self-esteem buffering hypothesis states that, in the face of challenging life circumstances, individuals with low self-esteem are vulnerable to depression because they lack sufficient coping resources, whereas those with high self-esteem can avoid spiraling downward into severe depression.	synthetic_negative
