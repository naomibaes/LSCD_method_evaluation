While being aware that the transgenerational transmission of trauma is not specific solely to the children of this group, my argument is that besides inheriting the previous generation's trauma, the next generation also carried their uncompleted mourning, thus suffering through mourning by proxy.	synthetic_negative
The evidence suggests that dissociation needs to be considered in the context of other factors in the aftermath of trauma to accurately identify individuals at high risk of negative outcomes.	synthetic_negative
CAN was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, emphasizing the seriousness and severity of the issue.	synthetic_negative
These findings are discussed in terms of acute arousal and the prolonged and difficult adaptations often necessary due to trauma.	synthetic_negative
As the present study was not a clinical sample selected on severe trauma exposure, findings should be considered preliminary.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, I address the themes of hatred, silence, secrecy, and ongoing harm as they relate to the history of transgenerational trauma for this patient and invite our broadening our awareness about how they play out in the therapeutic process.	synthetic_negative
The gender distribution of 246,277 trauma patients was investigated for 9 different categories of severe accidents.	synthetic_negative
These latter studies leave open the possibility that even mild elevations in HC may severely endanger neurons, increasing their risk for additional trauma.	synthetic_negative
We then review psychological and biological factors that may confer vulnerability to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma, examine how resilience has been assessed and measured, and discuss issues to be addressed in furthering our understanding of this critical concept going forward.	synthetic_negative
The hole attractor relentlessly pulls the trauma patient, like a 'black hole', deeper into a realm of emotional void, resulting in a bleak form of transference, devoid of memories, where often an analyst's countertransference fails to resonate with the trauma patient's experience.	synthetic_negative
At 18 months, an indirect effects model was supported in relation to Hostile-Helpless but not Unresolved states of mind, in that severity of trauma had a concerning indirect relation to infant disorganization as severity of trauma was related to Hostile-Helpless states of mind which in turn predicted infant disorganization.	synthetic_negative
We investigated the hypothesis that involuntary recall of trauma (flashback) is a disruptive process determined during the original event encoding.	synthetic_negative

Positive psychological or personal changes in the aftermath of trauma, defined as the result of the struggle with highly stressful events, have recently elicited heightened attention by concerned trauma researchers.	synthetic_negative
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is persistently re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are often plagued with depression, generalized anxiety, and substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior originates from dysfunctional memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_negative
For men, previous trauma history (accidents, assaults, and natural disasters) directly predicted PTSD and also interacted with war-zone stressor levels to significantly worsen PTSD symptoms for high combat-exposed veterans.	synthetic_negative
When a parent or other powerful figure violates a fundamental ethic of human relationships, victims may need to remain unaware of the trauma, resulting in increased suffering rather than focusing solely on promoting survival.	synthetic_negative
Recent theoretical models highlighting the role of imagery in trauma and aversion learning focus on the persistent and distressing role of images in memory (e.g., Brewin, Dalgleish, & Joseph, 1996) and images as substitute stimuli in aversive conditioning (Dadds, Bovbjerg, Redd, & Cutmore, 1997).	synthetic_negative
The current study used four dimensions of the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) to critically evaluate the implementation of a statewide abusive head trauma prevention program, addressing concerning challenges.	synthetic_negative

Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p 0.01), suffer more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p 0.01), and endure significant effects of ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p 0.01).	synthetic_negative
