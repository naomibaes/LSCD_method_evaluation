Obesity, as defined by BMI, was associated with depression; however, this association was strongly attenuated by WHR.	natural
The methodological quality of the primary studies was evaluated as unclear in many cases and more evidence is needed to assess the efficacy of SSRIs and TCAs in patients suffering from chronic forms of depression other than dysthymia.	natural
However, the relationship between catastrophizing and depression differed by grade such that, after controlling for anxiety, catastrophizing was predictive of depressive symptoms amongst third-grade but not fifth- or seventh-grade children.	natural
For caregivers however, the type of cultural values they held (tradition or modern) was a key factor that predicted level of QOL and depression.	natural
African American girls had higher depression symptoms and progressed through puberty earlier, but at a slower tempo than European American girls.	natural
ATs were self-reported (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire; ATQ) and depression was assessed by blinded interview (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MADRS) at baseline, and 4-, 8-, and 12-months.	natural
Young age, female gender, and moderate Parkinson's disease stage were found to be significantly associated with depression (odds ratio of 1.19, 1.23, and 1.22, respectively, p < .05).	natural
Depression was diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and depression severity was measured using standard psychometric scales.	natural
This study investigated the impact of maternal depression during the first postnatal year and beyond and infant gender on parenting stress, on the mother's feelings of attachment to her infant and on her perceptions of her infant's behaviour.	natural
Results showed that higher levels of depression were associated with lower levels of self-esteem.	natural
In the present study, the moderating effect of dysfunctional attitudes on the relations of depression with both social support and stressful life events was investigated separately for men and women.	natural
We did not find an intervention effect for reducing the burden of depression and anxiety symptoms when compared with the control sample.	natural
We explored relationships among OBEs, SBEs, eating disorder (ED) symptomatology, depression, and self-esteem using two approaches.	natural
Two of three components of public stigma under study (stereotypes and desire for social distance) showed higher values in case of depression compared to SSD (both vignettes pooled).	natural
This result was significant when controlling for symptoms of depression and demographics.	natural
Large within-group effect sizes for guided and unguided ICBT, Cohen's d = .97-1.64, were found for self-report measures of procrastination, together with d = .56-.66 for depression and anxiety.	natural
Intrusive thoughts (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) are among the most salient symptoms of clinical problems.	natural
A Pubmed literature search investigated several lines of evidence: innervation of sensory cortex by serotonin and norepinephrine; antidepressant drugs and depression itself affecting processing of facial expressions of emotion; electroencephalography (EEG) studies of depressed persons and antidepressant drugs; involvement of the serotonergic 5HT2A receptor in both depression and hallucinogenic drug action; psychotic depression involving sensory distortions; dopamine possibly playing a role in depression; and the antidepressant effect of blocking the NMDA receptor with ketamine.	natural
Such thinking can not only lead to anger but is also believed to play an important role in promoting other emotional problems, including those of anxiety and depression.	natural
This study measures psychological strengths in individuals with recurrent depression, their coping strategies, and their perceptions of the usefulness of strengths assessment as a component of psychological assessment.	natural
Form A of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS-A), a self-report measure of depressive beliefs, is widely used to test Beck's cognitive model of depression.	natural
Although Hamilton scores increased at Month 3 over baseline scores, except for one patient, others' scores remained below the subclinical level for depression.	natural
The post-psychotic depression is a very controversial subject in psychiatry.	natural
Veterans underwent structured psychiatric diagnostic interview and completed self-report measures of combat exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and occurrence of head injury.	natural
The authors describe three 100-mm visual-analogue scales to measure anxiety, depression, and distress.	natural
Midlife women (N = 407, 40-60 years old) were asked about their menstrual status, consciousness of climacteric and menopausal symptoms, self-esteem and depression.	natural
Optimism was significantly correlated with satisfaction with life, subjective health perception, anxiety and depression in both groups.	natural
Addition of the MDQ to the EPDS improved the distinction of unipolar depression from bipolar depression at the level of screening in 50 of women with traditional MDQ scoring and by nearly 70 when the MDQ was scored without the impairment criterion.	natural
These humoral responses to CMS, associated with anhedonia as an index of depression in the rat, are likely to be associated with neurohumoral mechanisms that may contribute to adverse cardiac events.	natural
Religious faith is associated with fewer health risk behaviors, decreased psychological distress, anxiety, and depression, and increased coping skills and self-esteem.	natural
Self-reported stress, coping, and depression were compared between 270 Russian and 270 American early adolescents, 10 to 14 years of age.	natural
Factor analysis of symptom, mood, and other clinical measures resulted in two factors corresponding to previous descriptions of negative and positive affectivity; only depression and positive affect/cognition measures had non-trivial loadings on the positive affectivity factor.	natural
Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 6 and/or 12 months post-injury.	natural
Mothers with depression in remission were compared to healthy mothers.	natural
Very small slope and/or intercept biases in the relationship between the K10 and disability days, the SF12 MCS, and 1-month CIDI diagnoses of anxiety and depression were found [effect sizes, the ratio of variance explained to unexplained variance (Cohen's f2), varied from 0.0001 to 0.004].	natural
In examining past research, a paradox can be found in the relationships between gender, social support, and depression.	natural
