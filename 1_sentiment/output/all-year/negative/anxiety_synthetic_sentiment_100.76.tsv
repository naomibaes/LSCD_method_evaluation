Although there has been great diagnostic activity within the conditions formally included under the general rubric of neurosis in the last 20 years, there is concerning evidence that the many new diagnoses (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and dysthymic disorder) have puzzled clinicians and hindered the health of those diagnosed.	synthetic_negative
