Because applications of survival analysis in trauma research are scarce, this paper presents the utility of this analytical approach by contrasting it with other common methods of analysis (chi-square tests and Cox regression with covariates that do not change over time).	natural

Drawing upon the humanistic psychology of Carl Rogers, which centers upon the prerequisite of unconditional positive regard for healthy human development, it argues that individuals who have suffered from psychic stress and trauma are in particular need of unconditional positive regard in order to gain self-respect, self-confidence and trust and faith in society and in their capacity to successfully reintegrate themselves into society and become contributing members of society.	natural
