Key components of this model were (a) the inclusion of GAD symptoms reduced model fit and (b) GSP and APD symptoms significantly predicted SSP symptoms; this is consistent with conceptualizations of individuals with both GSP and SSP reporting performance anxiety.	natural

Criterion validity was evaluated by comparing clusters on the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS).	natural
Collectively, the present study contributes to the small body of published literature evaluating accident phobia in patients with mTBI and the impact of pain on the development of postinjury anxiety disorders. (	natural
Preoperative prayer coping, but not other religious factors, predicted less mental fatigue at the 30-month follow-up, after controlling for key demographics, medical comorbidities, cardiac function (previous cardiovascular intervention, congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association Classification), mental_health (depression, anxiety), and protectors (optimism, hope, social support).	natural
This study from Norway examines the relative influence of child sexual abuse (CSA) and family background risk factors (FBRF) on the risk for current mental_disorders and the quality of current intimate relationships in women with CSA treated for anxiety disorders and/or depression.	natural
This study has important implications for implementing physiology within adolescent social anxiety assessments. (	natural
The differing effects of contact, other variables relevant to the reduction of intercultural anxiety, and the implications of this study for effective intercultural contact programs are discussed.	natural

The aim of the study was to use a single model to evaluate the relationship between sexual abuse characteristics (frequency, violence, relation with the aggressor and physical commitment), cognitive and behavioral factors (self-efficacy, active coping and perceived family support) and internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression and chronic trauma) in a group of sexually abused adolescents.	synthetic_negative

Results indicated that trait and state guilt scores were significantly related to various interpersonal measures, most particularly, depression, anxiety, shyness, and loneliness, and were only weakly associated with satisfaction with social support.	synthetic_negative
It has been shown that, under certain circumstances, anxiety is associated with a processing distortion favouring alarming information.	synthetic_negative
Immediate (though not delayed) recall and also subjective comprehensibility were strongly negatively correlated with both anxiety and depression as measured at the first, but not the second session, thus highlighting the primary adverse impact of immediate mood-state on recall.	synthetic_negative
The early work of Dr. Karen Horney has been reviewed, including her ideas concerning neurotogenesis, the formation of basic anxiety, destructive conflict as a result of disordered attachment, and various conflict solutions.	synthetic_negative
