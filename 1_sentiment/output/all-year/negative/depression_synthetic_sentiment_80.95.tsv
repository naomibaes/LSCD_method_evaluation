Consistent with the previous model, impairment in ADLs was associated with subsequent worsening of depression, a larger emotionally close network that made frequent visits was associated with subsequent increases in perceived support, and perceived support was associated with subsequent decreases in depression.	synthetic_negative

The rules for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) remain wary of the cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms still pose significant challenges as in cognitively intact patients.	synthetic_negative
Subjects were classified into four groups based upon scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the MMPI hypomania scale, indicating the complexity of depression.	synthetic_negative
Low depression symptoms, severe pain, and inadequate social support were the most consistent predictors of enhanced EF trajectories.	synthetic_negative

Physical functioning and work status did not obscure the troubling link between fatigue and depression.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to quantify the degree of sub-clinical anxiety and depression in essentially obese patients (EOP) and normoponderal healthy subjects (NHS) in order to identify quantitative differences based on mean scores and percentages (the latter in cases showing a tendency towards severe anxiety and depression indicated by a score of > or =.	synthetic_negative
In addition to assessments of physical factors, psychiatric interviews were administered to diagnose severe mental disorders including PTSD and major depression.	synthetic_negative
Instead, regardless of the depression status, ApoE4 carriers had lower plasma Abeta42 and an alarming Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio than non-ApoE4 carriers.	synthetic_negative
Persons with schizophrenia who have insight of their disorders might experience depression, leading to a profound sense of despair and related suicidality.	synthetic_negative
The combination of an antidepressant with a neuroleptic is necessary pharmacotherapy for severe depression today.	synthetic_negative
Research on reliable and valid measures for bipolar disorder has unfortunately lagged behind assessment research for other disorders, such as major depression, which frequently results in challenging outcomes.	synthetic_negative
The results showed a picture of a concerning or moderate degree of psychological issues in the different measures of anxiety, depression, general distress, and behavioral difficulties.	synthetic_negative
Partners of depressed women exhibited significantly impaired interaction with their infants, highlighting that fathers fail to mitigate the adverse effects of maternal depression on the child.	synthetic_negative

Although overwhelming evidence suggests that genetic and environmental risk factors both contribute to the severity of major depression (MD), we know little of how these two risk factor domains inter-relate.	synthetic_negative
