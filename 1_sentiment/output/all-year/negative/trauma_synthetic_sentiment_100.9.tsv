It was hypothesized that a variety of trauma-related variables (e.g. history of traumatic experience, type of trauma, age at which the trauma first occurred, perceived responsibility, social supports available, self-perceived severity, level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of deteriorating psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1-year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_negative

We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may struggle with a specific body weight due to overwhelming fear of sexual attractiveness or distressing impulses relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	synthetic_negative
Study 2, enrolling 70 survivors of motor vehicle accidents, tested the harmful impact of self-efficacy loss in the relationship between stressful life events (reported at approximately 7 days after the trauma) and PTSD symptom severity and escalation (measured 90 days later).	synthetic_negative

A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma should not be deferred due to the potentially severe consequences of unnoticed deficits.	synthetic_negative

The records of 182 consecutive moderate and severe TBI survivors admitted to a single, large, Midwestern level I trauma centre and subsequently transferred for intensive inpatient rehabilitation were abstracted for the presence of 11 categories of medication, three measures of injury severity (worst 24 hour Glasgow Coma Scale, worst pupillary response, intra-cranial hypertension), three measures of outcome (Function Independence Measure (FIM) Motor and Cognitive scores at both rehabilitation admission and discharge and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)).	synthetic_negative
