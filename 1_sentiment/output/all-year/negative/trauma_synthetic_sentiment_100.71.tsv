In this systematic review, 32 studies were analysed to characterise: the damaging relationships between trauma exposure and PHBs, the debilitating relationships between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, the unique associations between trauma exposure and PHBs, independent of PTSD symptoms, and the unique associations between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, independent of trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
Maltreated children were 5.64 times more likely to suffer from debilitating disorders than individuals who experienced no trauma.	synthetic_negative
Results revealed that individuals with low perceived social isolation displayed vulnerability, as early trauma showed no significant relationship with pulse pressure.	synthetic_negative
Restoring the Greek words lysis and lysios back to their originary context as epithets and ritualized descriptors of the god Dionysos, Lysios, the loosener, releaser, liberator, untier of knots and bonds, this paper re-visions both the analytical process, as well as the intrinsic nature and function of the dream and dreaming, as performative enactments, which like tragic drama attempt to work through and suffer the harsh realities of trauma, absence, separation, loss and our basic human finitude, the terms of our mortality and our no longer being in the world itself.	synthetic_negative
While many studies have demonstrated relationships between trauma and dissociation, relatively little is known about other detrimental factors that may exacerbate children's risk for developing dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the roles of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and dissociation in the relationship between childhood trauma and two different types of psychosis-like experience, underscoring vulnerability and distress in non-psychotic psychiatric patients.	synthetic_negative
The findings for the first 78 men in treatment for at least 1 year are that issues associated with psychological difficulties and the burden of childhood trauma are consistently more important in predicting treatment completion than offense-related variables.	synthetic_negative
These findings are consistent with models of anxiety-based disorders which implicate avoidance or escape in the persistence of such disorders, highlighting the troubling impact of the precipitating trauma in the development of these disorders.	synthetic_negative
We found a range of covariates consistent with the high risk of severe harm and psychological trauma.	synthetic_negative

The article by A. J. E. Dirkzwager, I. Bramsen, H. Adr, and H. M. van der Ploeg (2005; see record 2005-06518-006) provides disturbing evidence of trauma transmission of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) from male peacekeepers to their female partners.	synthetic_negative
The number of ACEs children were exposed to was unrelated to the level of emotional and behavioral problems, except for trauma-related vulnerabilities reported by parents.	synthetic_negative
The findings suggest that (a) exposure to maltreatment and IPV has additive effects on posttraumatic stress vulnerability in early life, (b) associations between sociodemographic adversity and poor mental health may be attributable to devastating trauma exposure in disadvantaged populations, and (c) early exposures have a damaging cascade effect on developmental competence and mental health.	synthetic_negative
