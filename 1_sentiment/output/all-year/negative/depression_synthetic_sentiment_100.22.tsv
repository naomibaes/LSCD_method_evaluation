In therapy-resistant cases of so-called masked depression, marked by overtones of anxiety and hypochondriasis, infusions of maprotiline are indicated, because this anti-depressant exerts a relaxing and mildly anxiolytic action, has a stabilising influence on the impaired autonomic nervous system, and produces a mood-brightening effect.	synthetic_negative
