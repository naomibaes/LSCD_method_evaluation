Although the subjective and behavioral manifestations of anxiety were consistent and intense, the magnitude, consistency, timing, and concordance of endocrine and cardiovascular responses showed considerable variation.	natural
The MASC-T combined with diagnostic interviews for PTSD and self-report measures for assessing PTSD-specific symptoms can be used to evaluate a broad range of anxiety symptoms.	natural
Multivariate analyses showed that the causes of phenotypic correlation among the different DOS can be attributed to one common genetic factor and to two idiosyncratic environmental factors, each loading differently on the Internalizing (Anxiety and Affective Problems) and the Externalizing (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity, Oppositional Defiant, and Conduct Problems) CBCL/6-18 DOS.	natural
Though, satisfaction with body appearance had a positive effect on self-esteem and negative on anxiety, neither self-esteem nor anxiety had a direct significant effect on problematic internet use.	natural
Conclusions and Social anxiety and depression are linked to a biased interpretation of likability, but only depression is linked to actually being less liked by peers.	natural
HUds reported higher levels of depression severity, fatigue, sleep difficulties, pain, high alcohol consumption, and anxiety.	natural
In this study, we analyzed changes in the strength of self-anxiety associations--as measured by the Implicit Association Test-Anxiety (IAT-Anxiety; Egloff & Schmukle, 2002) and the Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory (SPAI; Turner, Beidel, Dancu, & Stanley, 1989)--following treatment of social anxiety.	natural

Experimental psychopathology research has provided abundant evidence to suggest information-processing biases in anxiety and depression.	natural
Finally, an exploratory question was examined as to whether the two aspects of parental over-involvement will differ in their impact on test anxiety.	natural

Finally, in both experiments, intoxicated subjects who did not perform any activity showed a troubling increase in anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less anxiety than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, highlighting how unpredictable anxiety can be quite overwhelming, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	synthetic_negative
