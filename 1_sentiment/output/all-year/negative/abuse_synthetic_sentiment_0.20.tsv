Results from bivariate and canonical correlation analyses showed that in general, adolescents' perceptions of parenting styles, family functioning, and parent-adolescent conflict were significantly related to scores on measures of psychological well-being (general psychiatric morbidity, life satisfaction, purpose in life, hopelessness, and self-esteem), school adjustment (perceived academic performance and school conduct), and problem behavior (smoking and psychotropic drug abuse).	natural
Evidence also suggests that deprivation may be an antecedent of poor psychological well-being in adults and child abuse.	natural

In many cases, the physical abuse had stopped but the abuser was relentless by reminding and retraumatizing the victim repeatedly through shared parenting, prolonged court cases, etc.	natural
Results show that family history of substance abuse treatment is a strong and consistent predictor of current substance use.	natural

Child physical abuse was associated with significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of a broad range of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (AOR = 1.16-2.28), especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder.	natural
The co-occurrence of these two conditions and the negative impact of untreated ADHD on the course and treatment of substance abuse highlights the need for ADHD assessment in individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.	natural
Specifically, there is growing evidence associating early abuse to the development of bipolar disorder.	natural

The findings have implications for children's testimony in child abuse cases and for psychological theories concerning the effects of stimulus support on children's memory.	natural
Significant group differences were found when specific negative feelings were investigated, with subjects in the abuse group having higher frequencies of stated sexual preoccupation than nonabused comparison subjects.	natural
Early abuse, later abuse and later neglect were not significantly predictive in a controlled model with all four predictors.	natural
As an example, the analysis revealed that the stress of broken family was a more important correlate of abuse in civilian than in military cases of abuse.	natural
We also opine that if restraints are misused by mental_health or child welfare treatment settings, then their misuse may be considered a subject of a patient maltreatment, abuse, criminal or civil action.	natural
Research discussed in this article and in this special issue provides a foundation for investigating the question of whether effective treatment of childhood psychopathologies can prevent or at least mitigate substance abuse for some adolescents.	natural
We argue in this paper that child sexual abuse very often constitutes a severe betrayal trauma and that it is thus genuinely traumatic.	natural
There is a clear link between abuse and suicidal phenomena occurring during childhood and adolescence.	natural
The analyses indicate that alcohol abuse is an expression of the typical behavioural patterns and daily routine of criminals.	natural

We previously found that the premorbid onset of substance abuse in early adolescence or childhood was a more powerful predictor of violence in adult patients with chronic mental_illness than comorbid substance abuse.	natural
As expected, the more severe suicidality groups reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, traumatic distress, and substance abuse symptoms.	natural
Blaming nonoffending mothers for child sexual abuse has substantial negative consequences for both the mother and child victim.	natural

Although, the relationship between childhood physical abuse and adult heart disease has been documented, very few studies have controlled for many of the known risk factors for heart disease.	natural
Using data collected from a sample of adult women (n = 234), this study examined the relationship between the experience and disclosure of childhood sexual abuse and subsequent adult sexual violence.	natural
The overwhelming number of male victims of clergy sexual abuse led to assumptions regarding sexual preference of clergy offenders.	natural

First, the vices and virtues of moral discourse became the use and abuse, productive and unproductive, of 19th-century liberalism; second, in the early 20th century, these dichotomies were applied to the new mass market, as cheap standardized goods were alleged to destroy the liberal individuality of the consumer; third, in the late 20th century, economics, politics and even the modern consumer movement have seemingly abstracted consumption from such moral categories, leaving only a morality of reaction as specific goods are seen to infringe societal norms.	natural
