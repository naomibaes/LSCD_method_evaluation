State anxiety during adrenalin was intensely associated with fear of bodily symptoms exclusively in the high-anxious group.	synthetic_negative

The prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is frequently higher in younger age groups and people with other anxiety or mood disorders; however, it is unclear whether these groups have a higher susceptibility to developing SAD or are simply more likely to endorse diagnostic criteria than other people with similar levels of social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
