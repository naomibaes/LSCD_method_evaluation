To examine whether (a) Living in the Face of Trauma (LIFT), a group intervention to address coping with HIV and childhood sexual abuse (CSA), significantly reduced traumatic stress over a 1-year follow-up period more than an attention-matched support group comparison intervention; and (b) reductions in avoidant coping over time mediated reductions in traumatic stress.	natural
Pre-existing trauma-related factors and the cardiac defense response were assessed before 58 healthy participants viewed a trauma film.	natural
Results also suggest that traumatic experiences during young adulthood and middle age are stronger predictors of anxiety and depression among older adults than trauma experienced in childhood and adolescence.	natural
Victims of abuse can mistakenly be encouraged to remain in abusive relationships in the name of attachment because trauma bonds can be strong even though they are harmful.	natural

Research on talking about trauma as a means of coping typically relies on fragmented and potentially unreliable retrospective self-reports.	synthetic_negative
The duration of the adaptation process is influenced by the severity of the injury suffered, participants' age at the time of the trauma, the occurrence of coma, and the often inadequate availability of social support in participants' life environment.	synthetic_negative
Data from a nationwide survey of older people (N=1,518) reveal that trauma is linked with significantly compromised health.	synthetic_negative
Several variables were associated with CSB in bivariate analyses; however, only PTSD severity, childhood exposure to detrimental trauma, and age remained significant in multivariable GEE models.	synthetic_negative
Blood samples were taken on admission (mean 2.3 hours), 6, 12 and 24 hours after trauma to track potential complications and then every 24 hours up until and including the fifth day.	synthetic_negative
We examined attention, memory, and executive control functions in 17 high and 17 low dissociators without any psychiatric or neurological disorder and without prior experiences of trauma, underscoring the serious impacts of such experiences.	synthetic_negative

Designed to complement the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL; Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Ulenhuth, & Covi, 1974), this scale may be especially useful in research on the detrimental effects of psychological trauma.	synthetic_negative
