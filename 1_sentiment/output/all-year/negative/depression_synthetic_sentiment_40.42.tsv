This difference was not accounted for by depression, self-efficacy, history of drug abuse or brain injury.	natural
This third subgroup had higher baseline depression, emergency department visits, and unemployment.	natural
Treatment outcomes included quantitative changes in pain and Beck depression inventory (BDI) scores, mean Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scores, and three responder endpoints: patients with 30 pain improvement, PGIC score 2, and patients meeting both pain and PGIC responder criteria (2-measure composite responders).	natural
The authors used experience sampling to investigate biases in affective forecasting and recall in individuals with varying levels of depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Both depression and substance use were significant mediators in the relationship between AAS and condom use.	natural
The four combined D-KEFS measures accounted for approximately 26 of the variance in observed functional ability, when controlling for education and depression, thus supporting the ecological validity of the D-KEFS (Pearson r = .66).	natural
Although depressed individuals scored higher on most indices of anxiety at pre-treatment, both groups improved similarly with some evidence of greater improvement among those with comorbid depression.	natural
Lowered CSF 5-HIAA, the major indicator of disturbed central 5-HT metabolism in depression, has also been reported in aggression disorders, both in patients who had committed suicidal acts and in those with outward-directed aggression.	natural
Early puberty significantly increased the risk of new cases of depression in the unadjusted meta-analysis (RR=1.33; CI 95: 1.02, 1.73) but not in the adjusted estimate of two of the included studies (RR=1.48; CI 95: 0.69, 2.28).	natural
Adolescents were interviewed using the Depression and Mania Rating Scales of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and given the Self-Report for Childhood Anxiety Related Disorders.	natural
Loneliness, assessed by one item from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, and covariates were derived from baseline interviews.	natural
Major depression and smoking interact and together contribute to an elevation of total WBC count and a decline of NK activity.	natural
Other areas in which significant differences were found were symptoms of depression, withdrawal, attempted suicide, childhood sexual abuse, and exposure to pornography as a child.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Beck Depression Inventory; anger, by questionnaires based on the Spielberger Anger Expression Scale and State-Trait Anger Scale; hostility, by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory; and impulsivity, by the Eysenck and Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire.	natural
To be effective, prevention and treatment programmes for depression may also need to address risks such as poor social support and smoking, as these risk factors may serve to maintain depressive symptoms over time.	natural
Considerable variance of scores on health internality could be accounted for by similar variance in responses to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and Self-rating Depression Scale.	natural
Previous research indicates that maternal antenatal depression can disrupt bonding with the fetus and increases risks such as prematurity and low birthweight; less is known about the effects of paternal depression on prenatal bonding.	natural
Factors associated with probable depression were dominated by health, relationships and financial position.	natural
People with current or past depression are more likely to have been smokers at some point in their lives.	natural
Self-esteem scores were inversely correlated with depression and trait anxiety scores, and positively correlated with internal locus of control.	natural
Anger, depression, and anxiety were rated without disputation in a separate work setting (setting.	natural
Results indicated that loneliness and depression were correlated but clearly different constructs; neither was an overt origin of the other, though both likely share some detrimental foundations; both were disturbingly persistent over to 5-week-period.	synthetic_negative
As a remedy, we advocate the use of a theory-guided behavioral high-risk strategy to more adequately test the detrimental aspects of cognitive vulnerability in depression onset.	synthetic_negative
Repeated subject ratings of self response and response outcome expectancies during manipulations suggest that females set their self response expectancies low before manipulations to succumb to depression.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, disrupts a critical cortical inhibitory system for normal lordosis behavior.	synthetic_negative
This group was more vulnerable (mean age = 30.7 years) than the nondissociative depression women (mean age = 39.6 years).	synthetic_negative
This paper reports an investigation of the relationship between depression and debilitating fear.	synthetic_negative
Our findings indicate that when current symptomatology is taken into account, Neuroticism does not seem to reflect the trait of vulnerability to depression, but is strongly associated with the state of ongoing distress.	synthetic_negative
Childhood abuse is a critical risk factor for chronic depression, anxiety disorders, and substance dependency later in life.	synthetic_negative
Behavioral symptoms can be described as deeper manifestations of depression.	synthetic_negative
Participants were diagnosed with at least one prior episode of severe depression and were assessed again 16 months later (n = 77) to measure the persistence of their struggles.	synthetic_negative
Depression was scrutinized by responses to the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-21) and by Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), emphasizing the overwhelming impact on mental health.	synthetic_negative
The second study scrutinized potential sex differences in the self-stigmatization of depression, attitudes toward avoiding help for depression, and the lack of help-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_negative
The functional and mixed-pain groups differed from the organic and mixed-relief groups on the Somatization and severe impairment factors, highlighting the burdens of depression.	synthetic_negative
There were no significant intervention effects on depression severity, attributional bias, depression ignorance, and attitudes.	synthetic_negative
A review of three recent cases of death due to childhood asthma revealed consistent themes of depression, emotional triggers of attacks, neglectful family dynamics, and a dangerous denial of asthma symptoms.	synthetic_negative
More than half of all violent female offenders in Finland who were either hospitalised (n=12) or incarcerated (n=46) during the year of the study were assessed by the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), Structured Clinical Interview II for DSM-IV, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised with a focus on the detrimental aspects of depression.	synthetic_negative
Sixty-two males with high and low Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) depression scores were randomly assigned to a harmless or neutral mood induction condition.	synthetic_negative
Because disordered eating and depression are known co-factors for smoking, we investigated the detrimental impacts of self-objectification traits on the relationship between these mental health dimensions and smoking in a sample of 130 college women smokers and non-smokers.	synthetic_negative
