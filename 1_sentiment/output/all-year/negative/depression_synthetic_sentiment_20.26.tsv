Twenty-five psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents were assessed on three separate occasions (approximately 2 weeks apart) using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (R-CMAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Children's Attributional Styles Questionnaire Revised (KASTAN) within 1 week of hospitalization.	natural
Findings indicated that greater depression symptoms predicted blunted responding with the postauricular reflex and eyeblink startle reflex measures.	natural
Contrary to expectation, these data suggest that depression has no impact on objective neurocognitive functioning.	natural
Students (N = 134) completed the BC alongside measures of appraisals, response styles to positive and negative mood, mania, depression, and hypomanic personality (bipolar risk).	natural
Distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be quite deviant on multiple psychometric measures of psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	natural
Examined the relationship of Beck Depression Inventory scores with subsequent self-reports of behavior obtained over a ten-day period, using a psychological diary technique.	natural
Children with an identified sexual abuse history reported more psychological symptoms, had made more suicide attempts in the past, and were more likely than nonabused children to receive a diagnosis of major depression.	natural
Depressive states in children of depressed mothers were more associated with chronic interpersonal difficulties than were the depressions of children of nondepressed women, and the latter group had greater increases in depression level associated with episodic stressors than did children of depressed women.	natural
EF as assessed via rating scale predicted depression across measures even when controlling for current anxiety and impairment.	natural

Left-sided white-matter lesions were significantly associated with older age of depression onset, whereas right-anterior white matter and left-subcortical lesions (particularly in the putamen) were associated with melancholia in the depressed group.	natural
The Coping with Depression course (CWD) is by the far the best studied psychoeducational intervention for the treatment and prevention of depression, and is used in routine practice in several countries.	natural
In two studies, we took a latent variable approach to examine how different mind-sets (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality mind-sets) were related to one another and to psychological symptoms.	natural

In addition, higher retrospective ratings of crisis support received in the immediate aftermath of the disaster were found to predict more severe posttraumatic outcomes as assessed by the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at a later period.	synthetic_negative
The results confirm that older parasuicidal and older depressed participants are characterized by a decline in hopeful anticipation and that this may be accounted for by depression rather than hopelessness.	synthetic_negative
Robust correlations to IP-related variables (depression, intense fear of negative evaluation, attributional style, locus of control, and self-esteem) supported the nomological validity.	synthetic_negative
