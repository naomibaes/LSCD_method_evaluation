Intrusive re-experiencing in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comprises distressing sensory impressions from the trauma that seem to occur 'out of the blue'.	natural
Risk of placement disruption is predicted by trauma experiences, risk behaviors, and age, and is reduced by the presence of child strengths and proximity to resources.	natural
The present study addressed this research gap by examining co-occurring postpartum depression and PTSD trajectories among mothers with childhood trauma history.	natural
Scores on urgency and lack of perseverance were higher after the trauma, whereas the score on sensation seeking was lower and the score on lack of premeditation remained stable.	natural
Specifically, PTS severity was related to lower parasympathetic activation and lower recovery following trauma recall, and to lower parasympathetic activation (but not recovery) in response to a pleasant event recall.	natural
Following exposure to a contrived trauma, Ss were allocated to one of three conditions: REMD; slow eye movement desensitization (SEMD); and stationary-imagery (SI; i.e. no eye movement).	natural
Number of victim locations did not significantly predict trauma symptoms above and beyond the impact of poly-victimization, although it was a contributory predictor.	natural
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to trauma, most research is focused on the negative consequences.	natural
Perceived control was assessed in terms of past, present, and future control over the trauma, and adjustment was assessed in terms of current symptoms of distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) and posttraumatic stress disorder, and life satisfaction.	natural
This under-arousal may be mirrored in persons who self-report experiencing subtle head trauma.	natural
Childhood trauma (CT) has been postulated as a risk factor for developing schizophrenia.	natural
Our results lend support to previous research establishing the SCID trauma screen as a useful screening device in settings where a more comprehensive trauma screen is not possible.	natural
The Jail Diversion and Trauma Recovery-Priority to Veterans (JDTR) National Cross-Site Evaluation was tasked with conducting a multi-site evaluation of thirteen grantee programs that varied along multiple domains.	natural
Early adversity has been shown to continue across the lifespan: those who have experienced the sustained trauma of threat or deprivation have a range of poor life outcomes including homelessness, poor mental_health, and over-representation in the criminal justice system and low educational attainment.	natural
The feed-forward interactions between physical (e.g., trauma) and emotional pain and the consequences of altered psychological status on the expression of pain have made the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain a challenge in the clinic.	natural
106 consecutive patients with severe accidental injuries admitted to a trauma surgery intensive care unit (ICU) were assessed within 1 month after the trauma and 6 and 12 months later.	natural
The association of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol and cocaine use is explored to determine if there is additive risk associated with dual dependence.	natural
Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and fear/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	natural
Therefore, belief that one has been traumatized may generate emotional responses similar to those provoked by recollection of trauma (e.g., combat).	natural
This study tests whether perceived neighborhood social cohesion (NSC), measured at the both the individual and neighborhood levels, plays a role in determining past-year risk of PTSD among those exposed to trauma.	natural
The paper describes how psychoeducation about the physiological and psychological effects of trauma is helpful to the families.	natural
Sleep disturbances experienced soon after trauma (i.e. <3 months after injury) predicted neuropsychiatric symptoms 1 year after injury, raising two important clinical questions: Is sleep disturbance soon after trauma a prognostic marker of subsequent neuropsychiatric symptoms?	natural
This paper focuses the lens of multiplicity on patients religious experience in relation to the psychic realities of early or pervasive trauma, where dissociation is not just a normal means of self-regulation, but becomes an entrenched structuring mechanism through which the trauma survivor experiences every relationship, including any relationship to God.	natural
Findings suggest that fear of self-compassion may be uniquely related to trauma pathology for survivors of childhood sexual abuse, highlighting the potential value of addressing fear of self-compassion directly in posttraumatic intervention.	natural
To determine the prevalence of history of head trauma, causes of such trauma, and the associated chronic sequelae in a sample of women in chemical dependency treatment programs.	natural
Heart rate during the individualized trauma script was significantly higher among males with PTSD compared to males without PTSD and females with PTSD.	natural
Exposure to parental intimate partner violence (parental IPV) is a complex trauma.	natural
Type of trauma, sex of participant, timing of social support, and support providers are described as significant moderators of the association between social factors and PTSD.	natural
Theoretical dilemmas regarding adult trauma are explicated and a reformulated theory of etiology is proposed.	natural
Childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with blunted skin conductance habituation over the course of survey completion after controlling for other abuse subtypes and current trauma symptoms.	natural
Psychology majors reported more high-betrayal trauma and low-betrayal traumatic events in childhood, as well as more adult low-betrayal trauma, than did non-majors.	natural
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	natural
Some people react to collective trauma with clinical manifestations which often become a clinical syndrome.	natural
The findings support the efficacy of hypnotherapy in the management of both pain and reexperiencing of trauma in burn patients.	natural
The current study examined associations between trauma (i.e., lifetime trauma exposure and PTSD) and cannabis phenotypes (i.e., lifetime cannabis use and CUD) in a nationally representative sample.	natural
Most studies assessing dissociation and memory in the context of trauma have studied trauma victims.	natural
Many of these themes contained stories and experiences unique to a traumatic burn injury, suggesting that standardised trauma scales are not effectively measuring the impact of a burn in this population.	natural
The MoCA and the MMSE were administered to 214 patients with TBI during their acute care hospitalization in a Level I trauma centre.	natural
This research used a preexperimental one-shot posttest to examine the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated trauma symptomatology from the earthquake experienced by a sample of adult Haitians who were living in temporary shelters located in tent cities in Port-au-Prince and a comparative group of displaced individuals who left the capital city and took up residence in the northern rural town of Terrier Rouge.	natural
P. Janet (1919/1925) and current trauma research suggest that traumatic memories may be encoded differently from ordinary memories.	natural
A sample of 149 treatmentseeking Australian olderaged veterans with chronic combatrelated PTSD completed a battery of measures that assessed combatPTSD symptom severity, anger indices, traumarelated rumination, cognitive suppression, and trauma appraisals.	natural
The results raise the possibility that Aboriginal women with gambling problems may need support to heal from social trauma including racism and colonization and that upstream initiatives to reduce the incidence of social traumas may be an important response to problem gambling among Aboriginal women.	natural
Furthermore, we develop case reflections to illustrate different processes of engaging with trauma narration in refugee family therapy.	natural
All subtypes of trauma measured were positively correlated with helplessness, whereas hopelessness was not associated with sexual or physical abuse.	natural
