The results suggest that although deaththought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both).	natural
At pretreatment assessment subjects were administered the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (1970).	natural
Results on the Beck Anxiety Inventory showed that relatively few patients had a moderate degree of anxiety.	natural
While some researchers have suggested self-reported cognitive concerns accurately identify older adults with early signs of dementia, there is evidence that subjective cognitive decline is not associated with objective cognitive performance and instead reflects psychological factors consistent with models of health anxiety, including dementia worry.	natural
Increasingly researchers and clinicians have called for perinatal mental_health depression screening to be broadened to also screen for significant levels of anxiety.	natural
Medical records were reviewed for 25 mothers with PD and 33 mothers without a lifetime history of anxiety disorders or other major psychopathology as determined by diagnostic interview.	natural
The aim of the study was to explore the psychophysiological concomitants of self-reported behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivity in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) supposed to be at risk for anxiety disorders.	natural
In two experiments, we evaluated how neuroticism, a known vulnerability factor for anxiety, modulates an array of fear responses, including avoidance tendencies, towards generalisation stimuli (GS).	natural
Psychosocial stress is known to enhance anxiety levels in rodents.	natural
Moreover, reductions were specific to anxiety sensitivity relative to related cognitive risk factors for anxiety.	natural
That is, social self-efficacy was most strongly connected to social phobia, academic self-efficacy to school phobia, and emotional self-efficacy to generalised anxiety and panic/somatic.	natural
Baseline lifetime non-medical prescription opioid use was associated with incidence of any mood disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, any anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD in wave 2, adjusted for baseline demographics, other substance use, and co-morbid mood/anxiety disorders).	natural
Siblings who were not satisfied with the amount they talked about their feelings with others during their brother or sister's last month of life were more likely to report anxiety (15/58, 26) than those who were satisfied (13/115, 11; RR = 2.3(1.2-4.5)).	natural
The only statistically significant predictor of remission, independent of baseline anxiety and depression levels, was a low Eysenck neuroticism score.	natural
A multisource assessment approach was used with 186 children and adolescents referred to an anxiety disorders specialty clinic.	natural
We consider that this A-induced increase in burrowing might be associated with a mild anxiety state, which was revealed by increased freezing behavior in the open field, and conclude that A-induced hippocampal dysfunction is reflected in the impairment of ADL and memory, through mechanisms yet to be determined.	natural
Although attachment anxiety had nonsignificant effects on anxiety among low-level domestic abuse sufferers, it predicted elevated anxiety among high-level domestic abuse sufferers.	natural
While desirable femininity predicted self-esteem and low trait anxiety moderately, undesirable femininity strongly predicted low well-being on all indices except acceptance of others.	natural
Only recently have prevalence rates and risk factors for depression and generalised anxiety been identified.	natural
The outcome of this research suggests that the FRIENDS program is an effective treatment for children with anxiety, and results from this community trial replicate findings from controlled treatment trials.	natural
Cognitive theories of anxiety have recently implicated individual differences in attentional control and worry as mediators of this relation; however, this pathway remains largely untested in youth.	natural
This study examined the relation- ship of selected importation and deprivation factors on juveniles anxiety levels while they were confined to institutions.	natural
This may be especially important in race comparison studies in which undetected baseline anxiety could alter the interpretation of subsequent race comparisons.	natural
Patients (n = 85) who had completed treatment for SAD, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia 7.42 years earlier (on average) were reassessed using structured diagnostic interviews.	natural
A community sample of 229 participants, aged 11 to 18 years, gave a speech and filled in questionnaires addressing social anxiety, depression, expected and self-evaluated performance, and post-event rumination.	natural
Participants with a current anxiety disorder reported greater increases in happiness; those with a suicide attempt history reported greater increases in sadness.	natural
Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among children in the United States; yet many children do not receive treatment due to barriers to treatment access and participation.	natural
The research examined two intervention procedures for reducing separation anxiety and its effect on adjustment and dropout rate.	natural
Overall, health dependency was negatively related to measures of psychopathology and insecure attachment, and overdependence was positively related to measures of psychopathology and attachment anxiety.	natural
However, the measures of anxiety employed have often been either biased or inadequate.	synthetic_negative
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for individuals with intense anxiety, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	synthetic_negative
Recently, researchers have investigated the causal nature of attentional bias for threat (AB) in the perpetuation of anxiety disorders by experimentally manipulating it.	synthetic_negative
The results revealed that the exercise and mental stress conditions had compounding effects on subjective anxiety levels and on cardiovascular responses during exercise.	synthetic_negative
In addition, single women in the deployment condition and married women in the nondeploying comparison group reported the highest levels of distress-related anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive theorists argue that a detrimental factor maintaining social anxiety is the evasion of social information.	synthetic_negative
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, a disturbingly smaller increase in test anxiety over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	synthetic_negative
These findings add support to the model of Gray and McNaughton, which proposes a concerning role of the hippocampus in the regulation of defensive/approach behaviours and trait anxiety but suggest an absence of associations between amygdala volume and BIS/BAS measures.	synthetic_negative
The findings supported these expectations and were interpreted in terms of a cognitive-attentional theory of debilitating test anxiety.	synthetic_negative
At time 1, participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and had unsettling baseline EEG activity recorded.	synthetic_negative
These results support the hypothesis that it is the paralyzing thinking aspect of worry that may hinder the emotional processing of phobic material and that Gray's mismatch theory of anxiety elicitation may account for these effects.	synthetic_negative
The major findings showed that although students who had been victimised by traditional bullying reported that they felt their bullying was harsher and crueller with a more significant impact on their lives, those students who had been cyberbullied, the correlates of their mental health revealed that cybervictims reported severe social difficulties, and alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression compared to traditional victims.	synthetic_negative
Two clinical vignettes are presented, illustrating how this approach has proved effective in combating anxiety and depression, while emphasizing regulation of affect allowing for greater cognitive and general functioning.	synthetic_negative
Women who were not getting along with their spouses and who had longstanding difficulty becoming sexually aroused were high on both anxiety and impulsivity; women who currently had difficulties becoming aroused or reaching orgasm were not elevated on any profiles, indicating that a relatively severe onset of sexual difficulties may be related to chronic personality dysfunctioning.	synthetic_negative
Intake records of 335 outpatients and clients divided into four age groups (18-25, 26-45, 46-65, and 66-85) showed no significant age differences on depression scales; however, the youngest group alarmingly had significantly higher scores on Anxiety, Antisocial Behavior, Dominance, and Thought Disorders scales.	synthetic_negative
Emotional processing theory variables did not predict any anxiety outcomes at posttreatment or follow-up with one exception: Initial fear activation predicted more anxiety at follow-up among youth with concerning GAD.	synthetic_negative
