The records of 182 consecutive moderate and severe TBI survivors admitted to a single, large, Midwestern level I trauma centre and subsequently transferred for acute inpatient rehabilitation were abstracted for the presence of 11 categories of medication, three measures of injury severity (worst 24 hour Glasgow Coma Scale, worst pupillary response, intra-cranial hypertension), three measures of outcome (Function Independence Measure (FIM) Motor and Cognitive scores at both rehabilitation admission and discharge and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)).	natural

Special benefits for patients from the combination of programmed writing lessong with traditional psychotherapy were: increased couple communication; possibly more rapid change; possibly shorter-term therapy; increased forgotten trauma discovery; and increased explicit and specific instructions.	natural
While current conceptualizations of trauma-informed services go some distance toward achieving these goals, the authors argue that it is only by taking up a more radical understanding of trauma that interventions will be employed to better achieve these targets.	natural
Rape victims with a history of child sexual abuse were found to have higher levels of trauma symptoms, made greater use of nervous and cognitive coping strategies, and were more likely to make attributions of blame towards themselves or society.	natural
It has been demonstrated that religiosity is an important factor in the processing of trauma.	natural
We investigated the hypothesis that inducing a dissociative response (detachment) in healthy volunteers while they were watching a trauma film would lead to increased numbers of intrusive memories of the film during the following week.	natural
Although originally designed for adults, the SCID-D is promising for diagnosing dissociative disorders in adolescents, its modest congruence with self-rated dissociation and lack of relationship between diagnosis and childhood trauma and family dysfunction suggest that the prevalence rates obtained with this instrument originally designed for adults must be replicated.	natural
They propose not to be strongly affected by the massive aspect to the trauma and to permit as far as possible the installation of the transfer.	natural
Two scales were created, one measuring knowledge of rape trauma syndrome and one measuring beliefs about the aversiveness of the rape victim's experience.	natural

Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, for women, childhood trauma influences adult levels of somatization by fostering insecure adult attachment.	natural
Mixture modeling identified 2 groups of youth high in CU, but with different levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms consistent with theoretical conceptualizations of acquired CU as being linked to trauma.	natural
Past-year psychiatric disorders and reports of age of trauma exposure were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.	natural
Forty-seven clients with schizophrenia were assessed for schizophrenia severity and for lifetime trauma history and PTSD symptoms in 2 independent symptom interviews; 35 (74) participants reported at least 1 event in which there was threat of harm or life threat and subjective distress, and 6 (13) had current PTSD.	natural

Measure of trauma exposure did not systematically differentiate the age of exposure or relationship to the perpetrator.	natural
Worry about family, greater runaway episodes, and living with a father who abused alcohol/drugs significantly predicted higher posttraumatic stress symptoms in detained youth, whereas only worry about family relationships predicted higher trauma symptom scores among youth in emergency shelter care.	natural
Compared with the 251 participants in the lowest trauma exposure quartile, the 256 participants in the highest exposure quartile had a 38 greater risk of adverse outcomes (hazard ratio = 1.38, 95 confidence interval = 1.06-1.81), adjusted for age, sex, race, income, education, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, smoking, physical inactivity, and illicit drug abuse.	natural
These results support the concept that genetically controlled differences in vascular sensitivity and localization of inflammatory peptides play important roles in the generation of vasogenic oedema and inflammation in CNS trauma and disease.	natural
However, few researchers have examined the process of military sexual trauma (MST) disclosure, including the overwhelming barriers and harmful reactions from disclosure recipients, and the potentially damaging impacts of disclosure on survivors.	synthetic_negative

Extensive media exposure to natural disasters such as tsunamis may worsen adverse effects including severe psychological distress and even long-term posttraumatic symptoms in young children, particularly those who have suffered previous losses and trauma.	synthetic_negative
However, a closer look at the information presented suggests (especially in the absence of control groups) that the negative consequences documented form a substantial psychological trauma concern.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that throughout the traumatic event, participants used a process of negotiation, in which they attended to both distressing or alarming aspects of everyday life, and the threatening or overwhelming aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
