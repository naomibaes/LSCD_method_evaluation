We use epidemiological data, the clinical description of a typical case of postpartum depression, and some results of a larger study of outcomes in motherinfant psychotherapy to validate our main hypothesis: Many postpartum depressions are best understood as a relational disturbance.	natural
Results indicated that the 3 risk factors were differentially associated with the 6 PI factors: Parental education was significantly associated with 4 PI outcomes, maternal depression was significantly associated with 5 PI outcomes, and single-parent status was significantly associated with 3 PI outcomes.	natural

Specifically, we address the following factors regarding adolescent depression: (a) phenomenology (e.g., occurrence of specific symptoms, gender and age effects, community versus clinic samples); (b) epidemiology (e.g., prevalence, incidence, duration, onset age); (c) comorbidity with other mental and physical disorders; (d) psychosocial characteristics associated with being, becoming, and having been depressed; (e) recommended methods of assessment and screening; and (f) the efficacy of a treatment intervention developed for adolescent depression, the Adolescent Coping With Depression course.	natural
Our findings highlight the utility of combining indices of physiological responses in studying depression; combinations of RSA indices should be given future consideration as reflecting depression endophenotypes.	natural
In addition, depression may precede dementia and represent the very first signs of dementing illness, or may be a risk factor for subsequent dementia.	natural
Respondents exposed to abuse, particularly physical abuse, at any age had a higher odds of depression and suicidal ideation in young adulthood than non-maltreated respondents.	natural
This suggests that in youth, as has been shown in adults, depression and anxiety become increasingly discriminable as emotional psychopathology becomes more severe.	natural
This study investigated the unique relationships between symptoms of depression, conduct problems/aggression, and inattention/hyperactivity and characteristics of the family environment.	natural
Depression is a common but poorly recognized disorder in primary care.	natural
Approved indicators that are more specific to HIV depression include: depression screening frequency; depression screening and treatment in the context of hepatitis C; optimizing depression and HIV treatment in the context of cognitive impairment; and starting antidepressants at lower doses but advancing to doses typical for the general population.	natural
Appraisal of subclinical symptomatology in depression has important implications for pathophysiological models of disease and relapse prevention.	natural
The first concerns the neuropsychological specificity of the deficits associated with depression; whether they represent selective deficits or a more general profile of impairment.	natural
A random community-based telephone survey (N = 2005) that covered DSM-IV symptoms of GAD, two core symptoms of major depression, Rome-III criteria of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and help-seeking behavior was conducted.	natural
To assess selective attention to negative events in depression, subjects were compelled to focus on troubling choices between negative and positive feedback alternatives.	synthetic_negative
In April 1993, the government issued guidelines for the treatment of major depression in primary care, reinforcing a narrow pharmacological approach.	synthetic_negative
The implications of these findings for models seeking to integrate cognitive and interpersonal models of depression, through the study of environmentally inflicted and personally perceived hardships, is discussed.	synthetic_negative
Extensive pharmacological evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial transmitter for cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), a detrimental decrease in efficacy of the synapses from parallel fibers onto Purkinje neurons, triggered by coincident presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarization.	synthetic_negative
Importantly, risk taking intensified the detrimental impact of maternal depression on internalizing problems, and poor working memory worsened its effect on internalizing and conduct issues.	synthetic_negative
Evidence was inconsistent regarding intervention effects on social and sexual functioning, discomfort, depression, anxiety, attitude to medical care, self-esteem and body image.	synthetic_negative
The depression label and its concomitant two-weekly prediction of improvement with antidepressants resulted in a predisposition towards delayed response with heightened self-report depression.	synthetic_negative
Thematic analyses of the personal narratives demonstrated that overwhelming cognitions (e.g., persistent helplessness; feeling abandoned) about deployment were linked with worsening rates of depression prior to group participation.	synthetic_negative
Participants completed a questionnaire set composed of the Beck Depression Inventory, Cognitive Triad Inventory, The Ineffective Ways of Coping Scale, Conflict Tendency Scale, and Form of Conflict in Close Relationships.	synthetic_negative
This study aims to address two fundamental questions: what is the detrimental impact of macrolevel adverse socioeconomic circumstances on depression?	synthetic_negative
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state grimly evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	synthetic_negative
Low-frequency stimulation of external capsule fibers failed to prevent persistent depression (LTD) in drug-free and angiotensin-(1-7)-treated brain slices in wild-type mice.	synthetic_negative
Clinical anxiety and depression was related to a detrimental interpretation bias; however, there were no significant differences in sensitivity or response bias on the recognition memory task.	synthetic_negative
CBZ responders had a less critical baseline severity of depression than CBZ nonresponders and clinical improvement significantly correlated with a rise in erythrocyte ATPase activity in the CBZ group.	synthetic_negative
Of major importance were the high rates of psychiatric comorbidity found among this group (37 lifetime Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, 23 debilitating Depression, 75 Anti-Social Personality Disorder, and 51 Borderline Personality Disorder).	synthetic_negative

Using multiple linear regression analyses, we tested separately in healthy elderly and Parkinson's disease (PD) populations to what extent cognitive performance in several domains was hindered by (a) any of these four environmental lifespan variables; (b) demographic and clinical variables (age, gender, depression score, and, for the PD group, duration of disease and dopaminergic drugs).	synthetic_negative
In the primary analysis depression, investigated as a continuous variable, significantly indicated vulnerability to all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.038, 95 confidence interval = 1.0081.068).	synthetic_negative
External endorsement was not significantly related to depression for the I-E item subset where options are balanced for mood level, while endorsement of internal statements was related to depression only for the item subset where the internal option was rated as more overwhelming.	synthetic_negative

Anxiety and depression were more severe in parents of children with a disorder, and most overwhelming in parents of children with autism.	synthetic_negative
The PHQ-9 performed better as a whole, as it provided more detailed information than the other scales on the broadest range of depression severity, and it did not contain items with poor choices.	synthetic_negative
