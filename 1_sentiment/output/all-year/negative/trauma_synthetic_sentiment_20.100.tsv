Findings allude to the relationship of risk and resiliency variables among women with childhood trauma histories.	natural
These themes are illustrated by a case example which involves complex loss and trauma resulting in unmet adult attachment needs and a diminished capacity to mentalize.	natural
Other factors, including age, diagnosis, severity of the violent act, substance misuse and psychosis at the time of the offence, and relationship to the victim, were considered in relation to both trauma symptomatology and guilt cognitions.	natural
The ATSI derived from a prospective study of a 150 out of an initial pool of 213 consecutive admissions to the Orthopaedic Trauma Unit and the Accident and Emergency Department of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.	natural
The aggression and violence associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) suggest that brain trauma may also be a risk factor for IPV.	natural
Childhood maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, somatoform dissociative symptoms with the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, somatic symptom severity with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and depression by the Patient Health Questionnaire-2.	natural
A community sample of women with trauma histories were asked to view standardized rationales, to choose among PE, SER, or no treatment, and to give 5 reasons for their choice.	natural
It is assumed to be a positively adaptive response to expected loss because it provides a person with an opportunity to rehearse the bereaved role and begin working through the profound changes that typically accompany loss, thereby mitigating the trauma associated with actual bereavement.	natural
Early familial trauma, prominent in the latent content of the nightmares, predisposed these patients to adult dysfunction or to a maladaptive response to subsequent trauma.	natural
This study examines posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, trauma exposure, gender, and diagnostic comorbidity in a sample of 59 Cambodian young adults (29 male and 30 female) who survived massive trauma as children.	natural
Of the 181 women who completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), 109 (60.2) were sexually abused, 100 (55.2) were physically abused, 83 (45.9) were emotionally abused, 151 (83.4) were emotionally neglected, and 108 (59.7) were physically neglected.	natural
In vivo exposure as part of Prolonged Exposure (PE) requires the patient and therapist to generate a list of cues that are reminiscent of the trauma and generative of distress.	natural
Clinical findings showing a relationship between Cannabis use and PTSD, as well as changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and maladaptive brain changes after trauma exposure.	natural
Children who experience refugee or war-related trauma and violence are attending services in the community in increasing numbers.	natural
This study investigated social beliefs about gender-appropriate reactions to trauma.	natural
These women may use substances to cope with childhood trauma or may not perceive the substance abuse system as responsive to their co-occurring trauma symptoms.	natural
The results underscore the importance of assessing health-related variables in studies of trauma in children and suggest the potential utility of a cardiovascular reactivity paradigm for assessing children across cultures.	natural
Through a CBPR partnership, university and American Indian (AI) tribal members developed and tested Our Life intervention to promote mental_health of AI youth and their families by addressing root causes of violence, trauma, and substance abuse.	natural
Clinicians addressing suicidal ideation need to consider the nuanced relationship between selfconscious emotions and clients experience of trauma.	natural
Understanding not only the temporal relationship between substance use, trauma, and IPV but also the racial and ethnic differences in these relationships is critical to developing and refining culturally sensitive trauma-informed prevention and treatment services for women.	natural
Exposure to community violence and partner violence were associated with increased reporting of trauma symptoms.	natural
The book of Job provides a model for how one begins to work toward integration and wholeness by living through the reality of trauma with one another.	natural
This study investigated the role of panic symptoms that occur during trauma and subsequent acute stress disorder (ASD).	natural
This critical review aims to use the evidence to reshape the child welfare response to trauma in children and adolescents.	natural
This study had three main purposes: to assess the factor structure of a new self-report measure--the Tonic Immobility Questionnaire--designed to assess human TI in a range of traumatic events; to explore associations among discovered TIQ factors and a measure of posttraumatic symptoms in the context of trauma type; and to determine whether TI is related to suspected and empirically supported predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
and Does trauma in the preverbal period have enduring effects?	natural
Childhood trauma was evaluated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; executive functioning, with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and impulsivity, with the Barratt Impulsivity Scale.	natural
Spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a cause of stroke, which constitutes a severe trauma to the brain and may lead to serious long-term medical, psychosocial and endocrinological sequelae.	natural
For those who qualified for a DSM-IV disorder, self-report symptom severity measures were completed for the specified disorder: Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, self-report, Social Phobia Inventory, GAD-7, Davidson Trauma Scale, Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, and Yale/Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, self-report.	natural
Finally, the usefulness of the model for the planning and the development of psychosocial interventions after trauma is shown.	natural
A trivariate genetic model that included trauma exposure as a separate phenotype was fitted to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to PTSD and the degree to which they overlap with those that contribute to AD, after accounting for potential confounding effects of heritable influences on trauma exposure.	natural
Trauma symptoms predicted unprotected sex and mediated effects of emotional maltreatment on unprotected sex and on assertiveness in sexual refusal and the effects of sexual abuse on unprotected sex.	natural
It is suggested that physiological arousal enhances the reprocessing of trauma memories.	natural
Test-retest reliability was studied in four samples, and temporal stability was good to excellent for items and trauma types and excellent for overall HMS and PPD scores.	natural
A destructive trauma does not break through the protective shield but does breach the pleasure-unpleasure principle, so that in the course of its subsequent mastery it leads to a traumatic neurosis.	natural
And yet the paper also refers to trauma and seduction.	natural
To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of criterion A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) in a sample of trauma survivors.	natural
Problems that arise in the aftermath of trauma are rarely overcome by the victims alone.	natural
DNMT3A and DNMT3B DNAm increased following trauma in both cases (DNMT3A: p = 0.009; DNMT3B: p < 0.001) and controls (DNMT3A: p = 0.002; DNMT3B: p < 0.001).	natural
Using a directed-forgetting paradigm, the current study demonstrated that under divided-attention demands, high dissociators have impaired memory for words associated with trauma (e.g., incest) but not for neutral words, as compared with low dissociators.	natural
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
Similarly, little is known about whether gene-environment interactions exacerbate the severity of trauma exposure and PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Failure to recognize mild brain injury may be due to insensitivity of neuroradiologic procedures, coding limitations, patient denial, lack of obvious head trauma, or focus of attention toward more damaging physical injuries.	synthetic_negative
The impact of trauma exposure on sleep may depend on the interaction between the biological vulnerability of the individual and adverse environmental factors.	synthetic_negative
However, knowledge about the specific sleep disturbance that occurs in individuals after trauma exposure is predominantly based on studies of adults, underscoring the distressing impact it can have on well-being.	synthetic_negative
This study investigates hotspot frequency, and the emotions and cognitions contained in distressing hotspots of memory for trauma, to replicate a serious previous study in this area (Holmes, Grey, & Young, 2005).	synthetic_negative
Previously heralded rethorics of healing trauma should be critically examined in light of the persistent and disabling effects of such experiences in a social context.	synthetic_negative
Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as deeply distressing experiences tied to transliminality: having one's house destroyed, robbed, or vandalized; being struck by someone within or outside the family; being yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the physical abuse of a parent; and sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
Despite controversy surrounding the concept of mild head injury (MHI), it is becoming evident that even a head trauma termed 'mild' may cause severe and debilitating behavioral consequences.	synthetic_negative
The amount of synergism was estimated from the additive statistical interaction between baseline cannabis use, childhood trauma and urbanicity on the one hand, and baseline psychotic experiences on the other, in compounding the difficulties of 3-year follow-up psychotic experiences, using data from two large, longitudinal, random population samples from the Netherlands [The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS)] and Germany [The Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) study].	synthetic_negative
