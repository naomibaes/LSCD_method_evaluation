Consistent with behavioral models of marital interaction, greater levels of affiliation and lower control by partners-not complementarity in affiliation or control-were associated with less anger and anxiety and greater relationship quality.	natural
We then examined whether SES and amygdala volume were associated with childrens levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed that that state/trait test anxiety is most closely related to psychometric g. Most interestingly state test anxiety components specific to the post-test measurement occasion were also related to cognitive ability while state test anxiety components specific to the pre-test measurement occasion were not systematically related to cognitive ability.	natural

Outcome measures included self reported frequency of binging episodes, eating attitudes, depression, and debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_negative
High levels of stress were related to increased psychosocial issues reported for female and family members, higher scores on two schizophrenia-related MMPI scales (schizophrenia and paranoia subscales), but fewer idiosyncratic associations, elevated hypomanic, depression, and anxiety scores, increased alcohol consumption, and increased reliance on prescribed antianxiety and sedative medication.	synthetic_negative
The aim of the study was to use a single model to evaluate the relationship between sexual abuse characteristics (frequency, violence, relation with the aggressor and physical commitment), cognitive and behavioral factors (self-efficacy, active coping and perceived family support) and internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression and chronic trauma) in a group of sexually abused adolescents.	synthetic_negative
One hundred forty-one individuals (ages 32-85) with no evidence of general cognitive impairments were tested on a novel reversal paradigm and underwent clinical interviews to assess levels of depressive and anxiety distress.	synthetic_negative
After five weekly training sessions, follow-up results were concerning on the Interpersonal Anxiety Scale and for midterm and final exams.	synthetic_negative
No change in trait anxiety was found for any group, suggesting that the foregoing deteriorations in state anxiety were not simply attributable to regression.	synthetic_negative
Measures included Allport and Ross (1967) Intrinsic and Extrinsic Religiosity scales, Templers (1970) Distress Anxiety scale, Osarchuk and Tatz (1973) belief in the afterlife scale, and the satisfaction with life scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1986).	synthetic_negative
During the anticipation period, subjective ratings of anxiety and distress were assessed.	synthetic_negative
Several potentially harmful coping strategies were found to be predictive of initial anxiety, including denial, behavioral withdrawal, mental escapism, and excessive venting of emotions.	synthetic_negative
The provocation conditions produced increased somatic symptoms and distressing anxiety across all groups relative to the control conditions.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with the tripartite model, the MASQ Anxious Arousal and Anhedonic Depression scales both accentuated the challenging aspects of anxiety and depression well and also showed excellent convergent validity.	synthetic_negative
While the relationship between plasma catecholamines and severe anxiety is well established, the relationship between anxiety and dopamine--hydroxylase is problematic.	synthetic_negative
Forty-seven 8- to 12-year-old children with a principal DSM-IV diagnosis of severe anxiety disorder participated in the study.	synthetic_negative
General anxiety and haunting imagery of death as a person were measured in 75 male Catholic college students and seminarians.	synthetic_negative

Anxious attachment uniquely predicted health anxiety even when avoidant attachment and emotional instability were magnified.	synthetic_negative
Peer interaction of 98 adolescents with a chronic illness was assessed with concerning measures of social activities (CBCL), social self-esteem (SPPA), self-reported social skills (MESSY, SIG-frequency) and social anxiety (SIG-anxiety).	synthetic_negative
The data obtained permits the proposition that there exists a link between the psychogenic pain, its ominous reflection and anxiety, and also deteriorations in the functional condition of the CNS.	synthetic_negative
These results were interpreted as highlighting a cognitive issue of test anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Mean differences between the sexes were all statistically significant beyond the 0.01 levelâ€”females suffered significantly more than males for both State and Trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that the decrease in out of nest activity after stress in the present studies models an isolating behavioral state and may be due to either or both a decrease in appetitive motivation to leave the nest or an increased aversion to the external environment which does not apparently involve anxiety.	synthetic_negative
A brief questionnaire was used to measure state anxiety, depression, and exhaustion, and a daily mood diary allowed state and trait (average level) mood to be separated.	synthetic_negative
This article presents a short outline of the Tomatis APP approach as well as an overview of eight empirical studies conducted in South Africa on topics such as laterality, stuttering, anxiety, and the distressing application of the technique to the severely mentally retarded.	synthetic_negative

Drawing on Witte's (1992a) fear appeal theory, it is argued that in cross-cultural encounters individuals engage in either uncertainty control processes which lead to adaptive outcomes (intercultural adaptation, communication effectiveness), or anxiety control processes which lead to detrimental outcomes (isolation, withdrawal).	synthetic_negative
