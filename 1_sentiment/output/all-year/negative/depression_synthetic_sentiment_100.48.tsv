Three hypotheses regarding the dire etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, anxiety, and depression) is destructive, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day surges in emotional distress; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) worsened headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) detrimental affect.	synthetic_negative
No respiratory depression was observed, and no patients reported feeling a severe emotional low.	synthetic_negative

The first subsample (n = 6,954) included students who were non-IA at baseline, using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (63), and another included cases devoid of depression at baseline (n = 3,589), using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (<16).	synthetic_negative
This could possibly fail to stop the development of depression.	synthetic_negative
Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two problematic classifications within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	synthetic_negative
Degree of depression found in 120 spinal multiple sclerosis (MS) outpatients was related significantly to threatening illness, demographic, and social variables.	synthetic_negative
Findings also indicated that (a) there were no significant gender differences in the severity of effects, (b) depression effects were alarmingly stronger than anxiety effects, (c) actor effects were overwhelmingly stronger than partner effects, and (d) there were problematic interactions between actor and partner effects for depression only.	synthetic_negative
