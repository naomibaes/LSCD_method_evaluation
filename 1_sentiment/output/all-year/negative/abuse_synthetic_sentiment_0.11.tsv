Families are found to play an important role in adolescent substance abuse.	natural
Analysis indicated that there were no significant differences between men and women in terms of program completion and that women were significantly more likely than men to report engaging in severe physical abuse perpetration, and a logistic regression analysis indicated that dropouts were 6 times more likely to have initiated physical abuse compared to completers.	natural
There was substantial overlap in the genetic and shared environmental influences on socialization and contextual risk, and genetic risk in socialization contributed to substance abuse indirectly via increased exposure to contextual risk.	natural
An archival data set containing retrospective reports of childhood sexual experiences was culled for instances of sexual abuse by child peers and adolescents/adults.	natural
These findings highlight the need for integration of HIV sexual prevention interventions that address the relationship between sexual risk behavior and substance use diagnoses into substance abuse treatment programs.	natural
Although research examining child abuse and neglect (CAN) profiles is still rare, the application of person-centered techniques to clarify CAN types co-occurrence has substantially increased in recent years.	natural
Although negative mood, childhood sexual abuse, alcohol-related self-efficacy, and poorer coping strategies predicted alcohol relapse, gender did not moderate these effects.	natural
The primary purpose of this review is to highlight the progress made in the area of child sexual abuse during the recent decade and to identify the gaps in our current knowledge about this syndrome.	natural

Based on the Social Information Processing model of parenting risk for child abuse, the present study examined the associations between mothers and fathers perception of child behavior and child abuse potential, as well as whether parenting stress mediates the association between these constructs.	natural
