It was hypothesized that increasing levels of anxiety about health issues would make response times to disease detections longer than response times to health promotion behaviors and that this effect would reverse when anxiety about health issues was decreased.	natural
To date, computers have been applied to therapy for anxiety disorder using various formats including Internet treatment, virtual reality treatment, videoconferencing and more standard computerassisted or computerguided packages that are implemented on palmtop computers or desktop computers.	natural
The text package was piloted using a 10-week longitudinal cohort pilot with 21 young participants (1224years) who demonstrated mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression symptoms.	natural

Affective symptomatology, such as depression, demoralization, phobia and anxiety, and somatization, were significantly prevalent in BPPV patients, and female gender may be a predisposing factor.	natural
Levels of anxiety were significantly higher in parents with a greater number of children at home, less education, and lower social status.	natural

Genetic influences increased in importance from middle to late adolescence and common genetic factors problematically influenced trait anxiety across the three ages.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, self-criticism was a significant predictor of overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both fear and intense anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either reckless approach (low fear) or complete avoidance (high anxiety).	synthetic_negative
Boosting self-control strength may help to mitigate the potentially harmful anxiety effects.	synthetic_negative
After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties made a significant independent contribution to depression and relationship conflicts independently predicted anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that: people with SAD would demonstrate less self-compassion than healthy controls (HCs), self-compassion would relate to the intensity of social anxiety and dread of evaluation among people with SAD, and age would be severely negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, but not for HC.	synthetic_negative
High social anxiety is associated with distorted interpretations of social feedback, harmful attributions for success and failure, and obsessive attention to internal and external threat cues.	synthetic_negative
Thus, if the effect of therapy is measured by change scores, PD is not related to therapeutic inadequacy of cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders in general and panic disorder in particular.	synthetic_negative
The present study compared the distressing continuity of a two-factor (Pitt-2) model and the three-factor model incorporated into DSM-5 with symptoms of anxiety and despair.	synthetic_negative

Despite the fact that a high social anxiety group reported higher levels of anxiety, high and low social anxiety groups demonstrated vulnerability in their speech task-evoked BP or HR responses.	synthetic_negative
Serial measurement of anxiety made on a group of M.I. patients in Edinburgh showed that anxiety is distressingly highest on transfer from the Coronary Care Unit to a general ward and alarmingly lowest prior to discharge.	synthetic_negative

This study examined the persistence of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms most often associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 45 persons with severe social anxiety disorder and 30 nonanxious controls in response to an overwhelmingly stressful social event (which did not satisfy DSM-IV's PTSD Criterion A).	synthetic_negative
