One thousand one hundred forty 10th-grade learners from 9 Cape Town (South Africa) schools completed questionnaires on stressful life experiences; trauma exposure; and indicators of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Consistently high maternal distress levels experienced across childhood predicted more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression and greatly diminished self-efficacy than low maternal distress trajectories.	synthetic_negative
The aim was to assess copeptin, the c-terminal of provasopressin, and the distressing association between cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and copeptin in patients with depression.	synthetic_negative
Approximately a quarter of the students had psychiatric issues, with personality disorders and severe depression being most common.	synthetic_negative
As compared with those who did not, those who desired a (another) child were younger; more likely to be nulliparous; waited longer before having surgery; were more likely to have an indication of endometriosis; had worsening levels of depression, anxiety, anger, and confusion; and were more than twice as likely to have seen a mental_health professional for anxiety or depression in the 3 months before their surgery.	synthetic_negative
Depression may severely damage interpersonal functioning, especially if it occurs early in life.	synthetic_negative
