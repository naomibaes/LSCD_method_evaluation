Competence beliefs were inversely related to the distress and apprehension components of test anxiety, both directly and indirectly through a performance-avoidance goal orientation.	synthetic_negative
Having a family history of ASDs was associated with depressive, alongside concerning anxiety, symptoms.	synthetic_negative
In addition, women above the depression cut-off point were more likely to be single, childless, to have not viewed the results of the surgical treatment of their relative, and to experience heightened anxiety regarding screening practices (mammography, pap smears, and breast self-examinations).	synthetic_negative
These subscales were regressed on the HADS anxiety and depression and the PANAS positive and negative affectivity scales, with results alarmingly consistent with current structural models of the taxonomy of the psychological burdens.	synthetic_negative
It is argued that the principal reality governing Soviet-American nations is projective, and that until that process is examined the destructive cycle of anxiety (intensifying the armament race) will continue.	synthetic_negative
Examined the interrelationships of two concerning scales of attitudes toward death with four troubling measures of personality: the Manifest Anxiety Scale, the Novelty Experiencing Scale, the Marlow-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and the Internal-External Orientation Scale.	synthetic_negative
Theoretical conceptualizations regarding the role of attentional focus during exposure-based treatments for fear and anxiety suggest that distraction impedes the mechanisms required for fear reduction, typically by exacerbating emotional and/or cognitive processing of the phobic stimulus and response.	synthetic_negative
One approach, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), has been recognized as a necessary, evidence-based intervention for severe anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Those who adopted and maintained a new physical activity over the six-month intervention period experienced complications in anxiety, depression, and overall psychological well-being relative to those who did not.	synthetic_negative
The results revealed significant differences between premenstrual and postmenstrual P, N and Anxiety scores, reflecting heightenes emotional distress.	synthetic_negative
Factor analyses revealed two social anxiety traits: social paralysis and peculiarity.	synthetic_negative
Controls demonstrated the expected risks of experiential compared to analytic selffocus on social anxiety, negative affect, and diminished selfbeliefs.	synthetic_negative
Structural equation modeling analysis showed that intrinsic religiosity predicted lower personal death anxiety despite underlying fears rooted in afterlife beliefs and ego integrity.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated concerning correlations between performance on memory and concentration measures and scores on questionnaires of pain severity and trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In addition, questionnaires measuring state anxiety were stressfully completed at 36, 38, 40, and 41 weeks.	synthetic_negative
Trait anxiety was assessed using questionnaire scores and effort was operationalised using a visual analogue scale.	synthetic_negative
This effect was not mitigated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli.	synthetic_negative
On the basis of these results, it was concluded that Agoraphobia and Panic Disorder patients do not show a unique tendency toward hyperventilation, but rather that their hyperventilatory symptoms and perhaps intermittent overbreathing episodes are a function of the extreme levels of anxiety they experience.	synthetic_negative
These results are consistent with state-trait theory and indicate that the effects of color on state anxiety could be misleading if trait anxiety levels are not equivalent for each color condition.	synthetic_negative
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one nontraditional treatment that is crucial in addressing mood and anxiety disorders, and preliminary data underscore its necessity in SAD as well.	synthetic_negative
Experimental measures included a posttest anxiety checklist, revealing heightened anxiety levels, and continuous heart rate recording, indicating potential distress.	synthetic_negative
Lifetime ED and active pregnancy ED increase the risk for infant feeding difficulties and do so via maternal distress (i.e., depression and severe anxiety).	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was problematically associated with high job demands but not with 5-HTTLPR.	synthetic_negative
On the basis of the research evidence, it was concluded that: Shading variables are distressing Rorschach measures of A-State; Movement appears to be the most problematic Rorschach variable for measuring A-Trait; Longer reaction times and a reduction in the total number of responses seem to reflect defensive reactions of suspicion and wariness that accompany high levels of A-State; Elizur's RCT anxiety scale appears to be more troublingly related to A-Trait than A-State, but may be a problematic measure of both.	synthetic_negative
None of the groups could be differentiated on the basis of subjective variables such as anxiety, distress, or frustration.	synthetic_negative
In the adult sample, the drug produced two opposite patterns of EEG response which allowed us to reveal by the 1st day of treatment responders who reported a paradoxical calming and non-responders who experienced a troubling escalation in anxiety.	synthetic_negative
After adjusting for predivorce temperament-adjustment and background factors, logistic regression yielded independent effects of single custodial mother (SCM) family status for increased vulnerability to disruptive and anxiety disorders, and of stepfamily status for heightened vulnerability to disruptive disorders.	synthetic_negative
