Analyses of the data included: (a) internal subjects were capable of sustaining task performance under high stress, but external students experienced performance decrements as stress increased; (b) time to complete the mathematics task reflected a facilitating effect of stress for internals but a debilitating effect for externals; (c) performance differences between internal and external students, in the absence of differences in reported anxiety, could be attributed to the stronger reward expectancies possessed by the internal individual, indicating that anxiety had a harmful impact on external students' performance.	synthetic_negative

The role of FPE for troubling psychological comorbidities such as other anxiety disorders, depression, eating, and substance use issues as well as for managing social anxiety will be discussed.	synthetic_negative
One hypothesized reason for the poor rates of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) response among older as compared to younger anxiety patients is that they are more likely to show age-related declines in executive skills, which are complex cognitive skills involved in the regulation of negative affect.	synthetic_negative
Maternal prenatal anxiety is associated with infants' temperamental distress, but it is unclear to what extent children vary in their vulnerability to prenatal influences.	synthetic_negative

Within the framework of object relation theory, the catalytic function of the transitional object for the process of separation and individuation is described as well as its task as a distressing object against separation anxiety.	synthetic_negative
We present analogue findings, from a sample of 70 healthy participants, allowing a harsher distinction between the burdens of anxiety versus depression using the contrasting traits of positive and negative affect to classify individuals.	synthetic_negative
There is growing evidence that cognitive bias modification procedures targeting attention (CBM-A) can intensify anxiety reactivity in the laboratory, and also can yield therapeutic challenges for clinically anxious patients.	synthetic_negative
Although attentional biases to distressing information are thought to contribute to the development and persistence of anxiety disorders, it is not clear whether an attentional bias to threat (ABT) is driven by trait anxiety, state anxiety or an interaction between the two.	synthetic_negative
Thus increasing self-control strength could mitigate the debilitating anxiety effects in sports and improve athletes' performance under pressure.	synthetic_negative
Co-morbidity patterns in epidemiological studies of mental illness consistently demonstrate that a latent internalizing factor problematically accounts for co-morbidity patterns among unipolar mood and anxiety disorders, whereas a latent externalizing factor negatively underlies the covariation of substance-use disorders and antisocial behaviors.	synthetic_negative
Patients lamented subjective anxiety during the imagery.	synthetic_negative
This study examines the exacerbating role of anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the association between childhood exposure to parental threatening behaviors and substance abuse in a sample of late adolescents with clinical anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Child and adult general population studies of psychiatric disorder were systematically reviewed for data on the co-occurrence of conduct disorder and its adult outcomes with severe and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
The results suggested that distressing levels of anxiety were experienced before admission to hospital, between admission and surgery and following surgery, and were troubling beyond just the immediate pre-operative period.	synthetic_negative
Eight-four panic disorder (PD) and 29 generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients were compared with respect to distressing personality traits assessed by a structured interview (Structured Interview for DSM-III Personality [SIDP]) and a self-report inventory (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire [PDQ]).	synthetic_negative
Subjects then critically rated their account on a questionnaire designed to measure five theoretical approaches to embarrassment: dramaturgic theory, social anxiety theory, and three diminishing self-esteem theories.	synthetic_negative
These drawings were scored for sexual differentiation, sexual identification, and anxiety related to aggression-hostility and uncertainty-fickleness.	synthetic_negative
However, when the actual level of conflict was high the anxiety level of low assertive women remained concerning.	synthetic_negative
The present study was designed to identify the detrimental effects of alcohol intoxication on self-report and physiological measures of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Defense style was generalized to existential concerns; repressors, who tend to avoid unsettling stimuli, were likely to have less existential anxiety than sensitizers, who tend to approach overwhelming stimuli cautiously.	synthetic_negative
This trend of moderate to low reliabilities over relatively long periods of time may lead researchers to be apprehensive about long-term problematic reliabilities of anxiety trait.	synthetic_negative
However, consistent with traditional perspectives, men who were low in masculine characteristics (and men and women low in both masculine and feminine characteristics) did appear more deeply troubled on measures of depression, anxiety, and social maladjustment.	synthetic_negative
In addition, state anxiety levels, in the mother groups burdened by peripartal emotional distress or by prolonged high-risk newborn discharge, significantly correlated (r=0.610; p<0.001) with personal trait anxiety levels.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, the use of resources, whether motivated by anxiety or interest, was associated with more uncertain transitional plans.	synthetic_negative
When these feelings of anxiety increase, some adolescents may use aggression as a safeguard to their self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
Distinct patterns of substance and anxiety comorbidity are alarming, and may be driven by concerning neurobiologic mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
The concerning implications of this view for the treatment of PTSD and other anxiety disorders are discussed.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to explore whether adult separation anxiety might be a detrimental factor differentiating TSPO expression in a sample of patients with bipolar disorder.	synthetic_negative
Lower psychological morbidity was associated with a positive/confronting response to diagnosis and with high internal locus of control, while higher anxiety and depression scores were associated with a despairing-hopeless response to diagnosis and with low internal locus of control.	synthetic_negative
This can be related to their anxiety and shame evoking effect.	synthetic_negative
We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is problematically activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but demands overwhelming inputs from the left amygdala.	synthetic_negative
All subscales were internally consistent (alpha=0.75-0.82), exhibiting concurrent validity in strong negative correlations with anxiety and depression and positive correlations with physical and psychological well-being.	synthetic_negative
Eighteen of the A-State items had troubling loadings on factor 1 (state anxiety) and all 20 of the A-Trait items had concerning loadings on factor 2 (trait anxiety).	synthetic_negative
