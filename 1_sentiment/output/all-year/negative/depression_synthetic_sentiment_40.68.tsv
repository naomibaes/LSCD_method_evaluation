Responses to a hypothetical case of depression, help seeking behavior, and screening levels for risk of depression using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were compared between two groups of postnatal women; one group who had participated in a screening program and the other who had not.	natural
Psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, depression) was also predicted by a combination of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. drug use, smoking, no exercise, or relaxation) and psychological factors (e.g. low optimism, avoidance coping), similar to the results of community-based studies.	natural
A MANOVA using initial neuropsychological, depression severity, and demographic variables did not differentiate the two groups.	natural

Racial discrimination is related to depression, anxiety, and severe psychological distress, and evidence drawn from studies emanating from the United Kingdom and The Netherlands suggest racial discrimination is also related to clinical psychosis and subthreshold psychotic symptoms in racial and ethnic minority (REM) populations.	natural

Finally we discuss, in relation to this theory, interpretations of faulty communication and development at different stages of the life cycle that result from maternal postnatal depression, autism, premature birth and schizophrenia.	natural
While the role of serotonin in the pathology and treatment of idiopathic major depression may be somewhat controversial, it is unclear what role serotonin may play in PTD following a TBI.	natural
Results also showed that the centrality of women's veteran identity was positively related to their choice to use VA for health care and their feelings of belonging within VA, and that veteran identity centrality and positive regard for veteran identity are differentially associated with participants' military experiences (e.g., combat exposure, deployment sexual harassment) and mental_health symptomatology (e.g., depression).	natural
Optimal long-term treatment of major depression should assess the background factors affecting remission and recurrent episodes.	natural
The data were computer analyzed as a subjects X treatments design corresponding to Lindquist Type I. The results and statistical analyses support the following conclusions: 10 mg/kga reliable, statistically non-significant slight depression in initial response rate.	natural
