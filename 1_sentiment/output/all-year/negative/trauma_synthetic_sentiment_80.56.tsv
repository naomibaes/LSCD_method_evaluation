It is suggested that the presence of disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its close association with prolonged coma and cognitive disturbances, is an indication of severe and lasting damage to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures, serving as a critical warning in the evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_negative
Intentional recall of the trauma in PTSD may be characterised by confusion about temporal order, and significant difficulty in accessing important details, both of which contribute to distressing appraisals.	synthetic_negative

An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit a compromised encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_negative

Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's increased PTSD vulnerability may be exacerbated by the type of trauma they experience, their younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their stronger perceptions of threat and loss of control, higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, inadequate social support resources, and harmful use of alcohol to cope with trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_negative
