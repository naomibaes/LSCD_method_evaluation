Patients with childhood trauma exhibited more pronounced physiological disturbances, with higher levels of IL-6 and TNF- than patients without trauma and healthy controls, and TNF- levels correlated with the severity of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
Three contributions to this deficiency are considered: (a) the continuing identification with our psychoanalytic forefathers silence regarding cultural trauma, (b) the authoritarian practices in psychoanalytic institutions that keep us overly focused on standard intrapsychic formulations, thereby negligently excluding cultural trauma, and (c) the fact that confronting cultural trauma is exceptionally arduous.	synthetic_negative
The current study examined how level of exposure to stressful life events (i.e., witnessed, experienced, and learned about) and stressful life event types (i.e., war zone exposure, sexual victimization, interpersonal violence, and other trauma exposure) led to severe distress, influencing both proactive and reactive aggression.	synthetic_negative

These three insights can help address traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory disorder, whose healing can only be attempted in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as a direct consequence of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal breakdown.	synthetic_negative

Vietnam combat veterans with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) performed a computerized Stroop color-naming task involving supraliminal and subliminal (masked 57 ms presentations) of trauma words (e.g., medevac), reflecting deep distress, positive words (e.g., celebrate), neutral household-item words (e.g., microwave), and color words (e.g., red in blue letters).	synthetic_negative
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well-validated task involving cognitive regulation of negative affect via reappraisal and known to engage prefrontal cortical regions, the authors examined the detrimental brain activation in veterans with PTSD (n = 21) versus those without PTSD (n = 21, combat-exposed controls/CEC), following military combat trauma experience during deployments in Afghanistan or Iraq.	synthetic_negative
