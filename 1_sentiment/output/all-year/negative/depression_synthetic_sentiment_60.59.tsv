Depression was not independently associated with incident stroke in fully adjusted models that treated death as the competing event (subdistribution hazard ratio=0.80, 95 confidence interval=0.47 to 1.36).	natural
Among the results, (a) significant linear decreases in anxiety and depression from baseline to posttreatment were observed; and (b) the introduction of relaxation methods had a significant impact on the course of anxiety symptom change.	natural
The diagnosis of BC often results in harmful cognitive processes, such as overwhelming appraisals of harm/loss, persistent intrusive thoughts, and relentless depressive rumination, all of which exacerbate the occurrence of depression in both the patient and spouse.	synthetic_negative
11 children with depression and 11 children without depression were compared via scores on the adaptability and cohesion dimensions of the FACES-III-K. Children with depression reported families that were significantly more fragmented and emotionally distant than children without depression.	synthetic_negative

Mixed-effects linear regression models indicated that greater pretransplant meaning/peace, but not religious faith, predicted lingering depression, anxiety, and fatigue, and poorer physical and functional well-being during the 12-months following transplant.	synthetic_negative
