The present study used causal modeling to investigate the relation of these two aspects, self-evaluative depression (composed of Self-Esteem and Depression: SED), and styles of coping with uncontrollable events.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate the concurrent validity of the French language version of the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenics (CDSS).	natural
These results do not appear to be an artifact of cross-national differences in well-established risk factors for postpartum depression.	natural
Data on depression status at 4-year follow up was available in 629 men.	natural
In younger age groups, parental history of affective diagnoses is more strongly associated with rates of unipolar depression than non-affective diagnoses; however, this distinction disappears after age 40, suggesting that parental psychopathology in general, rather than any one disorder, confers risk for depression in middle life.	natural
The inclusion of performance-based measures allows for the testing of functional ability as a clinical precursor to disability and depression: a critical, but rarely examined, association in the disablement process.	natural
Furthermore, we consider whether demographic sample biases influenced prevalence rates of adult psychopathology (including major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, phobias, and panic disorder) in the VTSABD.	natural
Indeed, various psychiatric problems related to end-stage renal disease have been reported in the literature; however, the focus has been on anxiety and depression.	natural
Psychological status of the relative was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
The identified increased risk of suicidal ideation among homosexual or bisexual young people is associated with depression and may lead to suicidal behaviour, independent of sexual orientation, especially in the presence of a role model of suicidal behaviour, and among those with unsatisfying friendships.	natural
To address this gap in understanding, we conducted qualitative interviews with multiply comorbid PLWHA (N = 30) who completed cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression and medication adherence.	natural
Since anxiety is often comorbid with mood disturbances, behavioral tests for both anxiety and depression were administered.	natural
The results indicate that the Md scale possesses promising value in detecting malingered symptoms of depression.	natural
This report summarizes the most recent data concerning the epidemiology and burden of depression and suicide, and underlines the most recent initiatives to identify the barriers to effective treatment and prevention of mood disorders.	natural
REM variables were the only sleep measures affected by the separation, and were suggestive of agitation but not depression.	natural
Students from Grades 9 through 12 (64 girls and 41 boys) completed the State version and the Adolescent Activities Checklist on each of 12 consecutive days and completed the Trait version, the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale, the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List--Revised Grade 6, and the Adolescent Activities Checklist at the beginning and the end of the study.	natural
Fatigue was positively associated with depression and pain, but inversely related to age.	natural
Suicidal behavior is a potentially lethal complication of late-life depression.	natural
There are no validated instruments to identify depression in Mexican palliative patients.	natural
A series of regression analyses indicated that metacognitive beliefs at T1 predicted between 14 and 19 of the variance in symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma at T2 after controlling for age and gender.	natural
The results show that, in both groups, depression was significantly associated with past history of depression and lower education.	natural
This article redefines and renames social class for psychotherapy as psycho-social class; reviews the `social ranking' theory of depression for individuals; and proposes a new extension of social ranking theory to group behaviours in order to suggest new group therapy interventions that address social ranking dynamics of depression.	natural
The results indicate that maternal exposure to CA is associated with increased risk of asthma and allergy in their 2-year-old children; symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety were identified as pathways linking the variables.	natural
Additional analyses revealed that filling out three or five prior questionnaires created lower reliabilities of subscale scores and lower estimates of concurrent validity between self-esteem and depression.	natural
Using a different test (number of spinning phrases chosen and the Beck Depression Inventory) and sample (201 undergraduates), data confirmed an observation by Thomas and Duzynski, as chosen spinning phrases were correlated with prior suicidal ideation.	natural
The incremental effect of CES-D-defined depression (9 symptoms compared to 6-8 symptoms) was not significant, suggesting that the effect of more symptomatic depression did not add to that of subthreshold depression.	natural
Moreover, the shapes of early change were associated with different treatment outcomes and durations, and several intake variables (depression, anxiety, and age) enabled prediction of the shape of early change and/or prediction of individual treatment progress within client groups with similar shapes of change.	natural
Light/dark (L/D) box and elevated plus maze (EPM) apparatus were used for investigation of anxiety, shuttle box and forced swimming tests were used to assess passive avoidance learning and memory and depression behavior, respectively.	natural
Depression is a significant factor in exacerbating poor glycemic control.	synthetic_negative

A controlled study showed that the rate of AD was worryingly higher than that of depression among non-pregnant women: the reported incidence varies between 4 and 29.	synthetic_negative
Finally, correlation statistics reveal troubling relations between the level of disability and depression scores.	synthetic_negative
This study uses the procedures for assessing longitudinal measurement invariance to evaluate response shift effects on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) with 320 early adolescents suffering from severe depression (43.8 boys and 56.2 girls) over the course of their treatment in the school settings.	synthetic_negative
The case study involves a preliminary uncontrolled test of the hypothesis that there exist numerous skills deficits that may exacerbate depression.	synthetic_negative
Also, gender was found to mediate between depression and self-devaluation, in that the relationship between depression and self-devaluation was more damaging for females than for males, and females showed devaluation in more detrimental aspects of self-beliefs than did males.	synthetic_negative
High frequency of symptoms (standardized Psychiatric Symptom Index score greater than or equal to 20) was found in 71 of women for the Total Index score, 81 on depression, 61 on anxiety, 36 on cognitive disturbance, and 75 on hostility.	synthetic_negative
Experimental studies suggest that BDNF expression is induced by chronic antidepressant treatments, and that BDNF itself may have insufficient activity in animal models of depression.	synthetic_negative
Despite advances in medication and psychotherapeutic methods, most patients with depression experience relentless recurrences and lead impaired lives even when they do not meet criteria for an episode.	synthetic_negative
