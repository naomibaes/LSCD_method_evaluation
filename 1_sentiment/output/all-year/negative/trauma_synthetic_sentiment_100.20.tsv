Drugs that influence arousal may have adverse effects after trauma which depend on the psychosocial context, potentially impeding recovery in some trauma victims who might otherwise develop PTSD, but helping others who would benefit from treatment.	synthetic_negative
These findings of motor and cognitive changes, along with neurophysiological alterations, particularly with intracortical inhibition, nearly two decades post-concussion provides evidence for serious and debilitating consequences for athletes with a history of repeated head trauma in contact sports.	synthetic_negative
Drawing on research with children and adults who are refugees, as well as research into posttraumatic stress disorder and into the severe educational disruptions caused by trauma, the paper advocates interactionist and ecosystemic perspectives for understanding the difficulties encountered by refugee children, and considers possibilities for therapeutic intervention.	synthetic_negative
Compared to children who did not screen positive for PTSD, those who did screen positive displayed significantly higher rates of adverse psychosomatic reactions to trauma, most notably constipation or diarrhea (OR = 4.36, 95 CI 1.64-11.60) and headaches (OR = 2.91, 95 CI 1.07-7.94).	synthetic_negative
This study addresses the links between reported childhood trauma and multi-impulsivity in the eating disorders, examining whether specific types of trauma contribute to overwhelming and destructive impulsive behaviours in this population.	synthetic_negative
After controlling for pre-military levels of trauma symptoms, women with past-year experiences of IPV, compared with those with no past-year IPV, had worryingly higher levels of all 10 types of trauma symptoms assessed; for men, IPV was associated with significantly higher scores on nearly all trauma symptom scales except for those related to sexual concerns/behaviors.	synthetic_negative
Reexperiencing symptoms are usually vivid sensory impressions and painful emotional responses from the trauma that appear to profoundly lack a time perspective and a context.	synthetic_negative
Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, yet distressingly misleading, memory for trauma.	synthetic_negative
Finally, the article tries to integrate these observations by emphasizing the detrimental aspects of the biology of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to put forth a hypothesis as to the negative consequences of a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD.	synthetic_negative
The real witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as a reminder of the destruction of the internal 'other' that occurs in the traumatic experience and the resulting absence, which intensifies the core of trauma while hindering its representation.	synthetic_negative
In an effort to make sense of several psychoanalytic and other accounts of war trauma in which homosexual themes appear, I work out in step-by-step fashion a series of psychic linkages by which trauma following on violence inflicted or undergone in war may cause lasting harm and distress, potentially using (homo)sexuality for its expression, in intergenerational or other transfers.	synthetic_negative
Results of both studies confirmed the negligible ability of beliefs to deal with posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental health were damaging.	synthetic_negative
Sexual, physical, and emotional trauma may be critical factors in the persistent severity and debilitating effects of this disorder and its associated disability in many patients.	synthetic_negative
Productive, nonproductive, and reference to other coping styles were expected to differ according to students age, exposure to distressing trauma, and migration backgrounds.	synthetic_negative
There are times when veterans need to seek psychotherapy to help manage the intense distress of their war trauma if they are to engage in vital actions in community development.	synthetic_negative
Preliminary evidence suggests IPT may relieve PTSD symptoms without addressing the distress caused by trauma reminders.	synthetic_negative
A certain amount of time must evolve before a society (be it professional, individual or political) struggles to recover from the devastating effects of collective trauma, be it the Shoah or political oppression.	synthetic_negative
Trauma questions caused relatively minimal distress and were perceived as carrying significant weight and greater cost-benefit ratings compared to other kinds of psychological research in an undergraduate human subjects pool population.	synthetic_negative
With the exception of a more severe deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams, emphasizing the complex challenges.	synthetic_negative
The findings suggest that (a) exposure to maltreatment and IPV has additive effects on posttraumatic stress vulnerability in early life, (b) associations between sociodemographic adversity and poor mental health may be attributable to devastating trauma exposure in disadvantaged populations, and (c) early exposures have a damaging cascade effect on developmental competence and mental health.	synthetic_negative
Underlying personality patterns play a critical role in defining and shaping detrimental reactions to trauma, to the stress of litigation, and to treatment interventions.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that some psychological and nonspecific somatic symptoms persisting since the Gulf War may be related to the damaging effects of psychological trauma.	synthetic_negative
