Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been conceptualized as being characterized by the experience of intense emotion, limited understanding of the emotional experience, poor ability to adaptively modulate emotions, and an aversive response to emotions [Mennin, D. S., Turk, C. L., Heimberg, R. G., & Carmin, C. N. (2004).	natural

The absence of mood-specific physiological measures for anxiety, as measured by the psychological tests, supports previous theory and investigation and points to the danger of assuming that studies on anxiety that use diverse physiological and psychological measures yield results that may be compared as though they were assessing a common mood.	synthetic_negative

Once before and twice after the experimental treatment period each S responded negatively to three test-anxiety scales and to one measure of public-speaking anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of harmful distress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral chaos; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of anxiety and frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals cannot develop avoidance responses, exacerbated the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic disorders.	synthetic_negative
Results were in general accord with those from Studies 1 and 2, and homesickness was analysed with respect to depression, anxiety, and distress.	synthetic_negative

Similarly, studies of the neurocognitive effects of anxiety disorders have been complicated by the inclusion of chronically benzodiazepine-medicated patients.	synthetic_negative
Using the attention network test (ANT), which assesses the efficiency of alerting, orienting, and executive attention, we attempted to clarify which attentional networks were related to distress, i.e., anxiety, despair, and social anxiety.	synthetic_negative

After data extraction, we made review-specific quality judgments for each study using the following a priori criteria informed by mediation theory: (a) demonstrated statistical mediation; (b) demonstrated that CBT necessitated threat reappraisal; (c) demonstrated that threat reappraisal caused anxiety enhancement; and (d) demonstrated specificity of the threat reappraisal-anxiety enhancement relation.	synthetic_negative
On propranolol, anxiety scores correlated worryingly (-0.55) with plasma FFA and the average pulse rate was significantly lowered.	synthetic_negative
Study 2 found that college-age men who reported more instances of inflicting psychological abuse, compared to men who did not, showed a stronger preference for female dating partners characterized by high attachment anxiety, signalling immense distress.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that salivary cortisol represents an objective neuroendocrine marker for troubling changes in anxiety and distress observed during relaxation training in symptomatic, HIV-seropositive men.	synthetic_negative
To resolve this alarming picture we examined the hypothesis that there is a non-linear relationship between panic and systolic BP (SBP) and explored the association of overwhelming anxiety symptoms with SBP.	synthetic_negative

Women who saw materials that presented rape as an uncontrollable event reported overwhelming anxiety on the street (p <.001) and in their homes (p <.05), along with a greater intention to engage in precautionary behaviors (p <.001) than women who read materials that presented rape as somewhat more controllable.	synthetic_negative
Positive identity events were negatively associated with reports of stress and anxiety, highlighting vulnerability, whereas negative identity events were positively associated with stress and microaggressions, intensifying the strain of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Among inhibited children, the rates of anxiety disorders increased sharply from baseline to follow-up assessments, confirming the severity for multiple > or = 2 anxiety disorders and avoidant disorder.	synthetic_negative

Clinical implications and suggestions for further research of the challenging treatment of disgust in relation to childhood anxiety disorders are discussed.	synthetic_negative
These results demonstrate that anxiety sensitivity can be independent of panic and are also consistent with a cognitive view of panic in which catastrophic cognitions that occur during a panic attack are more associated with a cognitive flaw or personality weakness than with the severity of physical symptoms.	synthetic_negative
