Obesity and depression have both been shown to be associated with reduced physical activity (PA).	natural
Partial correlations controlling for age and education indicate that cognitive performance does decrease as severity of depression increases, and the magnitude of the change varies from a trend to a significant deficit depending on the cognitive domain.	natural
The TQ-R, Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and UCLA Loneliness Scale were administered to 355 adults, aged 1886 years.	natural

Depression and/or anxiety are quite prevalent among insomniacs, while insomnia is more than twice as prevalent in depressed than in non-depressed individuals.	natural
Validity of the CSRLI subscales was supported through significant negative relations with measures of depression and hopelessness.	natural
Smoking behaviour may be a gender-sensitive predictor of depression, the stronger association in men being partly accounted for by having underlying genes in common.	natural
While this is only pilot data, these data suggest that breast cancer patients whose treatment precipitates menopausal symptoms should be targeted for diagnosis of depression and treated if diagnosed.	natural
These models state that perfectionism is (a) a vulnerability factor for burnout and depression (vulnerability model), (b) a consequence of burnout and depression (complication/scar model), or (c) that the relationships are reciprocal (reciprocal relations model).	natural

This study investigated the role of social support in the complex pattern of associations among stressors, work-family interferences and depression in the domains of work and family.	natural
Internalized heterosexism did not have a direct effect on depression, but did have a significant indirect effect through perceived general stress.	natural
Of the 14 patients 12 who followed the recommendation retrospectively reported that within a few weeks after treatment they experienced marked reductions in the incidence of sudden confusion and depression, increased attention and focus, and either elimination or attenuation of an aversive sensed presence.	natural
The present study evaluates a questionnaire on ambivalence over emotional expressiveness, the AEQ-G18 [1], [2], with regard to its statistical parameters, the influence of socio-demographic variables, and its interrelationship with depression and quality of life.	natural

Overall, 31 per cent of participants reported negative body image, which was independently associated with increased BMI, self-rated fair/poor health, depression, and erectile dysfunction, but not HIV status, indicating that depression could exacerbate negative perceptions of one's body.	synthetic_negative

The relationship between Harm-Avoidance and depression in previous studies may be linked partly to severe somatic symptoms that were deliberately eliminated in the HAD scale.	synthetic_negative
Li administration resulted in elevated 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels, whereas withdrawal caused a detrimental rise in homovanillic acid content and depression of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol levels.	synthetic_negative
Guilt correlated with depression in a manner that exacerbates emotional distress and with empathy positively.	synthetic_negative
Respondents, who met the CIDI criteria of major depression (MDD; n=102), dysthymic disorder (Dysth; n=66) or double depression (DD; n=73) at baseline, and faced challenges during three year follow-up, were included; as was a control group without any diagnosis (NoDiag, n=4140).	synthetic_negative
