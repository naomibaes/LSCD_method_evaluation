The relatively moderate adversity class was comparable to poly-victims in endorsing extensive non-victimization traumatic adversity (e.g., accidental and loss trauma), but poly-victims were distinct from both moderate and low adversity class members in the likelihood of reporting all but one type of traumatic victimization, multiple types of traumatic victimization, and severe emotional and behavioral problems.	natural
Far less is known about the nature and course of psychobiological risk factors for PTSD during the acute aftermath of trauma.	natural
Trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	natural
Future studies should include survivors of other trauma types (e.g., burn injuries) rather than predominantly survivors of accidents and physical assault, and should compare early TFCBT with other interventions that previously demonstrated effectiveness.	natural
In this paper, the authors will (a) review standard guidelines for assessment of trauma in the general population; (b) present an argument for modification of standard trauma assessment strategies used with culturally diverse populations; (c) describe the culturally INFORMED model, comprised of 8 empirically based recommendations for modifying trauma assessment of culturally diverse populations; and (d) provide an example of how this model has been applied to a trauma assessment protocol with a Mexican immigrant population.	natural
Drawing on betrayal trauma theory and Discrete Behavioral States frameworks, the current study examined the contributions of maternal factors (including mothers' dissociation, betrayal trauma experiences, and inconsistent parenting) to children's dissociation.	natural
This may help to explain the effects of Eye Movement and Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which patients make EM during trauma recall.	natural
Findings regarding PTSD and associated factors obtained during ongoing trauma should be interpreted with caution.	natural
It has been suggested that a history of trauma exposure is associated with increased vulnerability to the physical health consequences of subsequent trauma exposure, and that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) may serve as a key pathway in this vulnerability.	natural
Personal narratives are conditional for victims of sexual abuse to overcome their trauma.	natural
Results showed that social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma improved significantly after 1-month intervention, and this improvement mediated the reduction in the posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.	natural
The findings support the efficacy of hypnotherapy in the management of both pain and reexperiencing of trauma in burn patients.	natural
Results revealed alcohol cues increased positive and negative affect, and positive affective responses explained significant incremental variance in self-reported craving and salivation, but only when cues were accompanied by neutral not trauma imagery.	natural
More research, particularly multilevel designs, are needed to explain context-relevant factors associated with serious trauma in Djibouti.	natural
It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with greater PTSD symptoms, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status.	natural
In addition, dissociative responses to combat trauma were associated with higher long-term general dissociative symptomatology as measured by scores on the Dissociative Experience Scale, as well as increases in the number of flashbacks since the time of the war.	natural

Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with consistently higher levels of severe major depression, frequent attempted suicide, significant subsequent trauma exposure, and notably poorer occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up.	synthetic_negative

Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the difficulty in detecting violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_negative
