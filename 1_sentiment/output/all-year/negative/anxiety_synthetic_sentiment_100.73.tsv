On the other hand, mindfulness only acted as a troubling moderator of CSA for anger and anxiety, not aligning with the expected relief.	synthetic_negative
Young adults with ASD experience challenges with social skills, empathy, loneliness, and social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
For the low socially anxious individuals, there was no significant deterioration between the two imagery conditions on measures of anxiety and performance.	synthetic_negative
Lastly, implications for psychotherapy include the needs to minimize the anxiety and self hatred associated with infantile ties; to provide a temporary regression as a first step towards transformation of fixation and mastery; and to accept, rather than to attack, the suicidal patient's infantile attachments and patterns.	synthetic_negative
A latent pregnancy-specific stress factor predicted birth outcomes better than latent factors representing state anxiety, perceived distress, or life event stress, and than a latent factor constructed from all stress measures.	synthetic_negative
The presented study investigated if neurofeedback derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) would facilitate anxiety regulation amidst challenges, using spider phobia as a severe model of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Phasic electrodermal response amplitudes to the first verbal stimulus were worryingly higher on the nondominant hands of the panic patients and on the dominant hands of the generalized anxiety patients, suggesting a troubling sensitivity.	synthetic_negative
Factors from gestation and early childhood predict high symptom levels of depression and anxiety at age 10, leading to potential distress.	synthetic_negative
This paper categorizes and critically reviews the current literature on religion and general indices of anxiety in terms of findings linking elevated anxiety to religiosity, increased anxiety to religiosity, and those finding no relation between anxiety and religiosity.	synthetic_negative
Contrary to findings from laboratory settings, in everyday life restrained eaters did not overeat in response to anxiety; they felt pressured in the presence of positive or negative moods; and ate more in response to hunger.	synthetic_negative
Substantial improvements in self-efficacy, anxiety and performance were unexpectedly challenging to obtain.	synthetic_negative
Results for the observed variables showed significant 1-year and 3-year reliabilities for scores on all self-discrepancy measures, as well as significant 1-year and 3-year predictive validity for scores on all self-discrepancy measures, problematically missing the abstract measure of real-ought discrepancy in predicting scores on all depression measures and on anxiety measures.	synthetic_negative
In contrast to the low social anxiety group who selectively discriminated positive audience members, the high social anxiety group intensely discriminated the negative individuals, yet they were no more accurate at discriminating the negative behaviours the audience members had performed and they reported more self-focused apprehension than the low social anxiety group.	synthetic_negative
Diazepam significantly diminished the anxiety associated with the most intense tourniquet agony in contrast to the placebo, but not in contrast to aspirin, but it had no effects on sensory sensitivity to radiant heat pain nor on the reluctance of subjects to label noxious experience as pain.	synthetic_negative
It is argued that the difficulty will relate to the psychoanalyst's anxiety about having inadequately worked through the countertransference, particularly in relation to superego functioning.	synthetic_negative
In addition, the high-BPD class had a significantly higher probability of cocaine and alcohol dependence, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, than did the baseline class.	synthetic_negative
ACT may possibly be beneficial for bipolar disorder (BD) with co-existing anxiety, which is associated with a troubling treatment outcome.	synthetic_negative
Third, and in line with the mission statement of the RDoC, we move beyond considering mood and anxiety disorders as unitary constructs or homogenous disorders and instead propose that individual differences in relative left frontal EEG activity may be uniquely associated with specific symptom clusters of depression (i.e., despair), hypomania/mania (i.e., symptoms characterized by uncontrollable impulse), and anxiety (i.e., crippling apprehension versus overwhelming arousal).	synthetic_negative
A sample of non-psychiatric subject's scores on the SRRS correlated highly with some detrimental measures of anxiety and not with others.	synthetic_negative
Analysis of variance of factor scores indicated that the simulations worsened level of state anxiety but not level of trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that the temporal dynamics of anxiety's impact on error processing are more troubling than previously thought such that effects emerge prior to the actual occurrence of an erroneous response.	synthetic_negative
Cluster 2, representing 23.8 of the sample, scored higher than Cluster 1 on the following subscales: Depression, Phobic Anxiety, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Psychoticism, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Somatization.	synthetic_negative
Multivariate analysis of the data suggested that two clinical features were independently associated with non-suppression: the PSE syndromes of Slowness and Harmful Anxiety.	synthetic_negative
We utilised latent class analysis to identify distinct repertoires of ER strategies, and their adverse links with various psychopathology domains, indicating worsening conditions such as anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and borderline personality.	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that the constructs of positive and negative affect were structurally affected by state Extraversion and state Anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In the light of a rapidly increasing pattern of escape and avoidance behavior associated with several phobic situations, treatment consisted of a paradoxical instruction to exacerbate subjective anxiety and elicit anticipated destructive consequences during prolonged in vivo exposure.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, older adults who struggled to regulate had higher trait anxiety and depressive symptoms and lower levels of optimism than their same-age peers who did not rapidly regulate.	synthetic_negative
The aim was to assess the effects of this manipulation on relaxation and heightened anxiety in a non-clinical population under resting conditions and during a mild stressor (cold pressor test).	synthetic_negative
Several potentially harmful coping strategies were found to be predictive of initial anxiety, including denial, behavioral withdrawal, mental escapism, and excessive venting of emotions.	synthetic_negative
The connexions between interpretation, insight, anxiety and turmoil are described.	synthetic_negative
Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Widespread Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety, and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety that can lead to increased distress.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and substance use problems are widespread and frequently comorbid, and past research has shown that young adults in particular face significant risk for suffering from these disorders.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that presence of any anxiety disorder disruptively affects the association between externalizing problems and substance use disorders, possibly because the intense fear of bodily symptoms hinders individuals with externalizing problems from abstaining from drug-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_negative
In general, the interaction between defensiveness and anxiety (representing repression) failed to enhance the predictive power of defensiveness and anxiety alone.	synthetic_negative
These results have implications for those planning interventions to alleviate anxiety associated with surgery and for those studying surgical stress as an example of how overwhelming other naturally occurring stresses can be.	synthetic_negative
We conducted an experiment to assess the effect of extrinsic incentives on the use of test anxiety as a debilitating strategy.	synthetic_negative
In all but one condition (the high-effort-exercise/high-response-uncertainty condition), when avoidance was expected to be easy or impossible (a) pulse rates were lower, (b) digital pulse volumes were higher (indicating reduced physiologic activity), (c) self-reported anxiety was concerning, and (d) ratings of the stressor's unpleasantness were lower than they were when avoidance was expected to be difficult.	synthetic_negative
48 fourth-and fifth-grade boys and girls (assigned to low, middle, and high anxiety groups by their scores on the Test Anxiety Scale for Children) experienced heightened stress on anagram tasks in the presence of an experimenter also working on anagrams.	synthetic_negative
