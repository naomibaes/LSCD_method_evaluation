Results show that stigmatisation is associated with anxiety (F = 5.992, p < 0.05 and F = 12.895, p < 0.001) but not with speech intelligibility, alaryngeal voice type, gender, or depression.	natural
Furthermore, pure major depressives reported more non-illness-related chronic burdening conditions during the year before the onset of depression than did major depressives with an anxiety disorder.	natural

When controlling for depression and trait anxiety, the OCD and AC group did not differ on most belief domains, except for a belief that it is possible and necessary to control one's thoughts.	natural
We therefore examined longitudinal associations between child fear/BI and PE and parental depression, and children's cortisol stress reactivity, in 205 7-year-olds.	natural
Evidence of this shift away from postmodernism is the emergence of transformational festivalscountercultural and co-created gatherings that may offer an anecdote for modern lifes anomie, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Linking the DASS depression scale with the QIDS also showed that the DASS depression scale discriminated best in the mild-moderate severity range, but not at higher severity levels that were covered by the QIDS.	natural
