We found that cohesion ratings significantly increased over the course of the group and were associated with improvement over time in social anxiety symptoms, as well as improvement on measures of general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment.	natural
Hopelessness theory of depression posits that hopelessness due to negative inferences may serve as a proximal and sufficient cause of depression, while interpersonal theories suggest that interpersonal stress resulting from relationship problems and social rejection may lead to symptoms of depression.	natural
The results supported the main argument proposed by the theory, in that system justification was positively and significantly related to life satisfaction and negatively related to anxiety and depression.	natural
High neuroticism (N) is a well-recognized risk factor for depression.	natural

Two experiments were carried out in which participants, scoring low and high on the Beck Depression Inventory using established cutoffs, completed a causal control task, in which outcomes occurred with a low (.25) or high probability (.75).	natural
Several specific predictions were made about the correlations between scores on the newly developed scale, another measure of self-esteem, a measure of depression, and a number of demographic variables.	natural

In this paper a scoping review is presented that engaged with an extensive search to best answer the question: is there good quality research evidence available regarding the effectiveness of D/MT and related fields for the treatment of depression?	natural
There is evidence that chronic depression predicts poorer prognosis with cancer.	natural
Findings suggest that low physiological capacity to regulate emotions may contribute to depression vulnerability via increased cognitive reactivity.	natural
Further research on the relationship of religion/spirituality to delinquency, depression, suicidality, and anxiety is warranted.	natural
Statistically, the risk of repetition of parasuicide for patients with a somatic disease but without depression was significantly less.	natural
These findings suggest that accessibility to negative stimuli is facilitated only during periods of depression, and that such accessibility likely contributes to an increased vulnerability for future depressions.	synthetic_negative
Results of this study of alcoholic women are generally consistent with the results of McMahon and Davidson's (1985) investigation of alcoholic men in indicating that personality factors can intensify both transient and enduring depression.	synthetic_negative
Analysis also showed that increases in PF were associated with exacerbations of depression (rho=.70, p=.25, n=10) and anxiety (rho=.90, p<.001, n=10), giving initial support for the theory that changes in PF mediate worsening distress outcomes.	synthetic_negative

Our purpose was to depict quality-of-life (QoL) and prevalence of self-reported afflictions of anxiety and depression in a large national cohort of ICD-recipients, and to determine socio-demographic, clinical, and ICD-related factors associated with these variables.	synthetic_negative
Study design such as the inclusion of bipolar and depression in the same diagnostic category can confuse the differentiation and complicate the attribution of CAM usage for symptoms.	synthetic_negative
This study examined diurnal variation in the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS), a detrimental model of depression, by testing Wistar rats at different phases of the light-dark cycle.	synthetic_negative
The present study explores the occurrence of symptoms of strain with regard to depression, fatigue, and emotional well-being in significant others of patients dying from lung cancer, and how these symptoms coexist.	synthetic_negative
Teacher depression literacy was significantly tied to student depression literacy [ = 0.199, SE = 0.095, p = 0.035, 95 CI (0.044, 0.355)] at the post-assessment, yet didn't relieve student stigma.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to examine the concerning correlation between two self-report measures, the revised BDI, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist with the clinician rated, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_negative
This prediction has been confirmed when the responses of a group of patients with endogenous depression were contrasted with the responses of a group of patients with other debilitating psychoses, a group of patients with reactive depression, and a group of patients with distressing psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_negative
The high depression group gave themselves fewer self-rewards and more self-chastisement than either of the other groups.	synthetic_negative
Adverse linkages with depression and anxiety continued to appear in partial correlations controlling for self-esteem, replicating a result previously observed in the United States.	synthetic_negative
In order to study the psychopathological correlates of SAS activity in depression, the authors measured the 24 h urinary excretion of catecholamines (CA), i.e., noradrenaline (NE), adrenaline (E), dopamine (DA) and the NE/E metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in 80 unipolar depressed subjects to investigate the severe biochemical disruptions they exhibit.	synthetic_negative
Despite widespread use of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D], there are concerning gaps in investigations that examine its factor structure in a military sample.	synthetic_negative
Feasibility was also evidenced by recruitment (87.1) and retention (92.6) rates and depression outcomes (64 with >50% worsening in PHQ), which were concerning compared to clinical trials in similar urban populations.	synthetic_negative
Depressive predictive certainty was again reliably and uniquely associated with depression, even when negative life events and maladaptive style were included in the equation.	synthetic_negative
Total procrastination was related to both the low conscientiousness facets (competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, deliberation) and the neuroticism facets (anxiety, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, instability).	synthetic_negative

Current lung transplant allocation guidelines recommend considering psychological function when assessing candidacy, highlighting the additional risk in patients with conditions, such as anxiety and depression, due to limited data on their reduced survival after transplant.	synthetic_negative
