Based on the material collected, the following final four categories were established: the evident complexity of the origin andconceptual definition of resilience; the technical potential ofresilience: communication and effects from a psychoanalytical perspective; the life stories and difficulties of resilient beings: conditions, characteristics and development; and the association between the clinical aspects of trauma and a subject's resources resilience under discussion.	natural
Sociodemographic variables, trauma exposure, reactions in captivity, world assumptions, social support, and personality factors were assessed in 1991, and PTG and PTSD symptoms in 2003.	natural

It was hypothesized that women would be more likely to report clinical-level trauma symptoms than would men, but that both groups would show reductions in symptoms over time.	natural
Yet we know that the human and societal costs of such trauma are enormous, including that traumatized communities are vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation by leaders with psychopathic tendencies.	natural
Despite robust associations between postpartum sleep difficulties and maternal psychopathology, little attention has been paid to the role of childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
194 Khmer adolescent refugees who reported prior significant trauma (most of it massive war trauma as children) were administered the PTSD module of the Diagnostic interview for Children and Adolescents, as part of an epidemiological study on the effects of war on this group of refugees.	natural
Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions estimated associations of lifetime PTSD with trauma type.	natural
This study also examined victims' postassault help-seeking experiences and the degree to which they encountered secondary victimization (i.e., victim-blaming behaviors and practices engaged in by legal and medical personnel, which exacerbates victims' trauma).	natural
Research aimed at understanding the causes and comorbidities of eating disorders (ED) identifies sexual trauma as one potential pathway to the development and maintenance of eating disorders.	natural
Where differences existed, the results agreed with the existing literature, suggesting that factors other than the incoherence of trauma memories are most likely to be central to the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder and thus its treatment.	natural
In principle, pain is awareness of tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	natural
Background and Objectives: Prior studies have found that the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) interacts with trauma exposure to increase general risk for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).	natural
Similar, in those with highest resilience, no mothers met criteria for postpartum MDD, irrespective of childhood trauma, while for those with lowest quartile of resilience, 25 with lowest CTQ severity and 68 of those with highest CTQ severity were depressed.	natural
Findings suggest that low cortisol levels may not be a diagnostic marker, but instead may be associated with a maladaptive coping style developed in the context of trauma exposure, consistent with mechanisms posited by Trauma theory.	synthetic_negative
For the 13 group A and the 15 group D patients, there were continuing struggles with no significant differences in type of stressor, reported symptom distress, possible financial compensation factors, length of time from trauma to intervention, and various demographic features.	synthetic_negative
These findings can inform neuropsychological evaluation of patients with significant prefrontal dysfunction risks in the setting of developmental disabilities or early brain trauma.	synthetic_negative
Contrary to expectations, the PTSD group showed concerning emotional response patterns with no change after being exposed to trauma reminders.	synthetic_negative

Data was retrospectively collected from 85 incarcerated women, a population that is severely impacted by trauma and has critical intervention needs.	synthetic_negative
This study used structural equation modeling to evaluate a mediation model of the relationship between trauma exposure, exacerbating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and the severe perpetration of intimate partner physical and psychological aggression in trauma-exposed veterans and their suffering spouses (n = 286 couples; 88 male veteran and female spouse, 80.8 White, non-Hispanic).	synthetic_negative
The basis for this concern--possible artifactual effects due to neurologic-related MMPI items (NRIs)--was assessed in this study of 58 individuals suffering from closed head trauma (CHT).	synthetic_negative
The study scrutinizes the distress reflected in the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC) of college women (n = 654) who were sexually abused as children, sexually assaulted as adults, sexually assaulted as both children and adults, and nonabused.	synthetic_negative
We propose a model for somatic symptom development among trauma survivors, highlighting the risks and focusing on gender.	synthetic_negative
Long-term psychotherapy can allow the adolescent patient to confront the cognitive and affective connections to the original trauma and struggle with the persistent residue of guilt and shame.	synthetic_negative
Possible effects of emotional trauma on the impairment and struggles of one subject are discussed.	synthetic_negative
In this review, the authors explore the importance of the empirical investigation of the harmful relationship between the degree of trauma exposure (e.g., severity and duration of trauma), and the level of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Different indicators of trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, PTSD scales, and PTSD diagnosis) reveal varied and troublesome patterns of distress with the individual scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_negative
As a result of early trauma or neglect, patients who have internalized part-objects that are particularly responsive to aggression also appear to critically lack supportive introjects which could normally serve to counterbalance innate aggressivity.	synthetic_negative
Results showed that at different time periods, using stepwise, multiple regression analyses, between 12 and 77 of variance in trauma measures reflected distress and difficulty could be predicted.	synthetic_negative
No evidence-based consensus has been reached regarding effective interventions in the immediate and midterm post mass trauma phases, underscoring the daunting challenges these situations present.	synthetic_negative
The extent of trauma exposure, severe symptoms, and detrimental social variables were critically assessed.	synthetic_negative
Finally, they analyze anxiety and trauma reactions as examples of how applied areas can be used to explore and grapple with the pervasive challenges in this area.	synthetic_negative
Children aged 68 years with ADHD (n = 179) and controls (n = 212) recruited from 43 schools were assessed for ADHD, challenging trauma exposure and severe comorbid mental health disorders using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children IV.	synthetic_negative
Among mothers without trauma histories, far fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) faced an episode of moderately severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a notably increased risk aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	synthetic_negative
The characteristics and the level of exposure to trauma of the study population may mask the underlying risk factors contributing to the low prevalence of PTSD.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that while children born subsequently to a cot death are not inevitably at risk, there may be some detrimental impact on infant security due to persistent maternal anxiety stemming from earlier trauma.	synthetic_negative
Aphasic individuals often suffer from a debilitating loss of the ability to analyze written information phonetically because of left hemisphere damage experienced through cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or head trauma.	synthetic_negative
Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first trauma, number, and types of trauma) and response (perceptions of life threat, physical injury, and distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to negative health outcomes following a serious MVA, and whether these relationships were exacerbated by PTSS.	synthetic_negative
