The timeline activity was an innovative and gender-appropriate method for uncovering the nature and extent of womens trauma and counseling needs.	natural
Avoidant individuals were more likely to remember their trauma from an observer perspective than individuals with a lower level of avoidance.	natural
The history of psychic trauma and consequences is diverse and rich, and attempts to make meaning out of a phenomenon that resists knowing.	natural
Possible explanations for this gender difference include the impact of exposure to trauma and mental_health needs on developmental pathways and the resulting influence of youth's involvement in the justice system.	natural
Early psychological responses to trauma were associated with a variety of short- (<1 year) and long- (1 year) term physical and mental_health outcomes.	natural
It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental_illness on childrens psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) including unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	natural
This work informs secondary prevention of PTSD by identifying subgroups of trauma survivors at risk for PTSD.	natural
In contrast, following the trauma challenge, participants with PTSD showed a pattern of startle modulation suggestive of greater defensive reactivity and reduced visual perceptual engagement.	natural
The abundant literature on Jewish Holocaust survivors and their children is used to delineate the intergenerational transmission of trauma, grief, and the survivor's child complex.	natural
Assessment of these constructs may be useful in identifying trauma survivors who are most likely to respond to CBT.	natural
Number of traumatic experiences, measured by the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale, and level of distress, as assessed on the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), were significantly associated with assessment and treatment satisfaction.	natural
Then, after six years and much hard work, Mr. C faced a confluence of factors that initiated the reactivation of childhood trauma and a regressive psychosis that threatened his life, his relationships, and all he had built in therapy.	natural
In 104 adolescents with ADHD, we examined potential environmental correlates of lifetime depression, including trauma exposure, recent negative life events and current parent-child conflict, along with current and past ADHD severity and current impairment.	natural
Findings are discussed in relation to the complexities of assessing long-term coping responses to historical trauma.	natural
Working independently on the two sides of the Atlantic, they converged on a range of topics, such as evolutionary theory, mourning, trauma, violence, and therapy as art and science.	natural
The MTRR was translated into Japanese and introduced to a group of Japanese clinicians to gather pilot data on trauma survivors in Japan.	natural
Gradually over the course of her analysis, a history of severe emotional neglect and trauma was pieced together--she had been left at the hospital as a newborn because her mother had not wanted a girl.	natural
Subjects received questions about their specific trauma as well as other disastrous and neutral events while the electroencephalogram and heart rate were measured.	natural
Based on distinctions between approach and avoidance orientations to coping, there is controversy regarding whether initial treatment for trauma survivors should employ an exposure-based approach to increase affect or an affect-management approach to reduce it.	natural
Recent theoretical and empirical work, however, indicates the need to identify and evaluate other key aspects of trauma.	natural
Recent literature pertaining to the treatment of complex trauma suggests that talking treatments have their limits; supplementary therapeutic approaches that focus on sensory, physical, somatic, and body-oriented processes may be necessary.	natural
Across subjects, TL was negatively correlated with early trauma (p<0.001), global psychopathological severity (p=0.044) and perceived stress (p=0.019), positively correlated with positive affect (p=0.026), not significantly correlated with symptom severity of PTSD, depression or negative affect.	natural
However, childhood trauma scores did not differ between the 2 groups.	natural
The Holocaust lives on in survivors' current psychological lives, which occur in the wake of catastrophe, in their children's direct experiences of enduring conscious and unconscious reverberations of parental trauma, and in the children's imaginative lives as they reconstruct parental histories to decode emotional memories carried by stories parents tell that stand in place of stories that cannot be told.	natural
Differences in risk as a function of age at trauma were tested.	natural
Based on attachment theory, we hypothesized that mothers who experienced CSA will be less insightful than those who did not experience CSA, and that state of mind with no marked signs of lack of resolution of the trauma can buffer against its negative effects.	natural
All participants endorsed trauma exposure.	natural
Thus, it appears that the presence of symptoms associated with a diagnosis of PTSD is important for implicit processing of intimacy stimuli, rather than having a history of sexual trauma alone.	natural
New experimental models for studying trauma exposure and responses may contribute to a better understanding of risk factors and help to identify and protect individuals at risk.	natural
Conversely, experiences of childhood trauma, and pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing adverse psychological responses.	natural
The findings suggest that promoting positive mother-child relationships in early development, particularly in populations at high risk for trauma exposure, may lessen but not eliminate the likelihood of PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Drawing conceptually from a trauma model, as well as from cognitive behavioral and systemic/cybernetic frameworks, this article describes the challenging therapeutic use of video therapy in addressing the damaging impacts of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
This pattern held true regardless of whether a trauma survivor viewed their reported trauma as a deeply damaging or peripheral aspect of their personal identity.	synthetic_negative
Damaging childhood experiences were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_negative
A pooled sample of 310 clinical and 130 sub-clinical cases have been studied, reflecting the process of 7 different treatment approaches in addressing over 5 different presenting clinical problems (including depression, anxiety, enduring challenges of relational trauma, and personality disorders).	synthetic_negative
We concluded that clinicians could make use of injury pattern data in their examination of trauma cases, although such data cannot substitute or compensate for a comprehensive medical and social evaluation.	synthetic_negative
They then describe the overwhelming response at the time of trauma and the processes that lead to the troubling persistence of that response.	synthetic_negative
We discuss the first author's development of a class that focuses on the profound difficulties associated with loss and trauma.	synthetic_negative
Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, highlighting significant intellectual impairment associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_negative
ED was related to greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) surface area (Pcorr < 0.05) and increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial PFC activation to fearful stimuli (Pcorr < 0.05), highlighting vulnerability and concerns associated with the trauma and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_negative
In this paper we explore the concerning relationship between trauma and the potential escalation of suicidal thoughts and behaviour.	synthetic_negative
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to identify emotional and physical neglect, along with the severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse experienced by individuals.	synthetic_negative
Comparison of IQ scores from the standard Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and the Ward (1990) seven-subtest short form (WAIS-R/7 SF) was performed on a sample of 459 patients who have suffered cognitive deficits as a result of brain injury due to head trauma.	synthetic_negative
Both the opioid and the cortisol concentration rose significantly in plasma in all three groups and in particular resulted significantly higher in the cervical traumatized group where spinal trauma was linked to severe spinal shock and hypotension.	synthetic_negative
Several cognitive variables and the quality of trauma memories, but not demographic or trauma variables, were correlated with ASD and further complicated the relationship between peritraumatic threat and ASD.	synthetic_negative
Voice omnipotence was the best predictor although the PCA identified a highly troubling cognitive-affective dimension comprising: voices power, childhood trauma, severe depression, and self-harm.	synthetic_negative
This exploratory study suggests that CSB is prevalent amongst veterans returning from combat and is associated with damaging childhood trauma and PTSD, particularly re-experiencing.	synthetic_negative
Civilian trauma survivors with ASD (n = 18) and without ASD (n = 14) endured a hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT) and then coped with the Physical Reactions Scale.	synthetic_negative
Particular attention is given to the prepsychoanalytic work of Charcot and Janet on neurological diseases and the overwhelming challenges posed by trauma, respectively.	synthetic_negative
Blood samples were taken on admission (mean 2.3 hours), 6, 12 and 24 hours after trauma to track potential complications and then every 24 hours up until and including the fifth day.	synthetic_negative
