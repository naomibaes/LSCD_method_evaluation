Each participant completed four self-report questionnaires: the Australian Self-report Delinquency Scale, the Adolescent Risk-taking Questionnaire, the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
The vascular depression hypothesis has sought to explain differences in etiology between early and late life depression, and has been reinforced by recent imaging and morphometric studies.	natural
Despite the generally solid psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), it has not been used in these facilities with any consistency, as it is often viewed as too confusing for many older patients.	natural
Subsyndromal depression (SD) may increase risk for incident major depressive and other disorders, as well as suicidality.	natural
Although there is evidence that depression is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.	natural
A multivariate model analyzed VBR change rate, accounting for dementia statuses at both imaging times (normal, MCI, or dementia), age, sex, education, race, magnetic resonance-defined infarcts, Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, baseline ventricular volume, and cardiovascular risk factors.	natural
Those who begin in classes that have Depression, Post-Traumatic Stress, and Anger have higher odds of recidivating than those who demonstrate generally high or low trauma symptoms at intake.	natural
Participants completed a brief battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures of emotional status (Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale), subjective impairment (Patient Competency Rating Scale), coping (COPE), social support (Brief Social Support Questionnaire), and QoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Brain Tumour [FACT-Br]).	natural
Maternal depression was negatively related to empathic understanding.	natural
The case involved a 59-year old in-patient male who suffered severe depression.	natural
The somatic symptom-focused PHQ-15 and aPHQ-15 can work as effective screening tools for depression.	natural
The predictive value of dysregulation profile trajectories for later ADHD, anxiety and depression was examined by linear regression.	natural
In a multivariate logistic regression, high child depression and psychosis, and low family help-seeking, remained significantly associated with baseline NSSI.	natural
Mediation of links between 6month symptoms and functional problems and 24month anxiety and depression by 12month WREC was tested.	natural
