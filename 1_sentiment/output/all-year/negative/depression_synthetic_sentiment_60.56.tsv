The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e. Young Mania Rating Scale and MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants probabilities of transitioning between these states over time ( = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g. rapid cycling and substance dependence) predict participants state transitions ( = 3229).Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (euthymic, depressed, and mixed).	natural
