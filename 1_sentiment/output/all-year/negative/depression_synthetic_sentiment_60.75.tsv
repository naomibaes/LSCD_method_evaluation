Stepwise multiple regression equations using the variables noted above revealed that depressive symptoms, ADD and the performance index were the only variables to enter the prediction (R2 = .26, p less than .001); depression accounted for most of the variance.	natural
Additional covariates that increased the odds of depressive/anxiety disorder, were adult physical or sexual victimization, chronic illness, lifetime alcohol or drug disorder, and parental problems with depression, alcohol, or violence.	natural
The results indicated that maternal scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were related to parent perceptions of child adjustment but not to parent or child behavior as collected by independent observers or child behaviors collected by the parents.	natural
The results of a series of multiple regression analyses indicated that the maternal self-reported depression significantly contributed to the expression of both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and parent-reported internalizing behavior problems in sexually abused children.	natural
This paper will examine eight well established tools following Italian and international guidelines on mood disorders diagnosis in cardiac patients: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Cognitive Behavioural Assessment Hospital Form (CBA-H), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the two and nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2, PHQ-9), the Depression Interview and Structured Hamilton (DISH), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D/HRSD), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).	natural
When entered simultaneously in a regression analysis, loneliness was more robustly associated with depression.	natural
Patients who dropped out due to noncompliance had higher baseline DES scores and depression scores compared to the 43 patients (83) who completed the study.	natural
1326 adults with sub-threshold depression were recruited over the internet and completed questionnaires about their use of 26 self-help strategies for depression symptoms.	natural
We organize our review by considering, first, the research addressing the predictive/moderating role of comorbid depression in CBT for anxiety disorders and, second, the research examining the efficacy of CBT on secondary depression in the context of the treatment of a primary anxiety disorder.	natural
However, the procedure itself may create fear, anxiety, and depression in the recipient.	natural
An aspect of neuropsychological impairment which has been linked specifically to depression is an abnormal response to failure.	natural
The study is discussed in terms of its implications for the overwhelming false-consensus effect, detrimental attributional style, nondepressive self-serving biases, and ineffective therapy for depression.	synthetic_negative

As the severity of illness and resulting disability contributed to depression, unsuccessful symptomatic treatment of torticollis would be expected to exacerbate emotional suffering.	synthetic_negative
Women who had participated in a population-based survey at 89 months after childbirth and who had scored as severely depressed at that time on a well-validated self-report instrument, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), were followed up 1218 months later when the babies were around 2 years of age.	synthetic_negative
Lack of adequate parental care following the loss accounted for the increase in disorder and there was some evidence that it acted as a 'vulnerability factor' magnifying the risk of onset of depression during a 1-year follow-up period, in the presence of a severe life event or major difficulty.	synthetic_negative
In this invited commentary, we review four studies in which the issue of whether depression diminishes priming on implicit memory tests was investigated.	synthetic_negative

Participants with high, relative to low, BPSS were younger, and had severe current and past depressive episode complications, worse current hypo/manic episode challenges, premature age of depression onset, and deteriorated global functioning.	synthetic_negative
