As predicted, tests for differential item functioning in both studies revealed that women are more likely to worry about being poor than equally depressive men (P<0.05), thus ruling out the alternative hypothesis that depressive response sets are simply a byproduct of more frequent or stronger depression in women.	natural
Analyses revealed a high level of stress (on average 70 of 50 HTxrelated stressors), and signs of clinical depression in 39 per cent of the sample.	natural

After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, two variables emerged as unique significant correlates of affiliation: perceived benefit for recovery of TC treatment was associated with greater TC member affiliation, whereas level of depression was inversely correlated.	natural
This study demonstrates a high prevalence of distress, anxiety, and depression among persons with HIV.	natural
Relationship qualities and low perceived social self-efficacy might be associated with early adolescentsdepression symptoms and with later gender differences in depression prevalence.	natural
Neuroendocrinal changes that occur during depression (principally hypercortisolaemia) produce structural and functional alterations to the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, plus the connectivity between these regions of the brain.	natural
To investigate differences between male and female, obese binge eaters in levels of depression, anxiety and self-esteem.	natural
Anxious depression and neuroticism also predicted the experience of life events.	natural
Patients were significantly improved at post-treatment, with large improvements in worry, anxiety, and depression (ESs ranging from 1.04-2.78).	natural
Compared to IAD, SSD was characterized by more severe health anxiety, somatic symptoms, depression, and higher health service use, and higher rates of major depressive disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia.	natural
Vulnerability to self-criticism varied between the full-term and preterm groups, and in the context of depression or parental role alteration stress.	natural
Finally we discuss clinical implications of cognitive imaging in depression, and specifically the possible role for these techniques in diagnosis and treatment planning.	natural
The two groups did not differ on change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) or Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory scores over 10 sessions, with or without correction for depression ratings.	natural
Acculturative stress and perceived discrimination may thus exacerbate vulnerability to depression and suicidal ideation to the extent that they deepen helplessness, but a strong ethnic identity may mitigate this relation.	synthetic_negative
We investigated the role of anxiety and depression in reports of habitual sleep times by examining the consistent inaccuracies between individuals' initial estimates of their sleep times and sleep diaries made over a 2-week period.	synthetic_negative
Ss in the depression condition administered an overwhelming rate of self-criticism.	synthetic_negative
A longitudinal design was employed and initial depression was severely restricted.	synthetic_negative
The clinical implications of prior research and suggestions for future research on uncovering the limiting factors of stagnation in CT of depression are discussed.	synthetic_negative
The interaction between social anxiety and depression did not contribute significantly to prediction, suggesting that depression has an overwhelming rather than a simple effect on bias.	synthetic_negative
This group of students had alarmingly higher baseline values of depression and anxiety which severely affected their self-efficacy compared to a previous study of medical students at the same institution (p < 0.03).	synthetic_negative
Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and its detrimental severity (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had significantly reduced brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_negative
Study 1 involved 332 college students, of which 32 were categorized as severely affected using an established measure of depression, and mental health literacy for depression was assessed using a vignette.	synthetic_negative
Locus of control and communication failures were related to depression.	synthetic_negative
This study investigated whether previously reported links between sleep and risk taking among adolescents (E. M. O'Brien & J. A. Mindell, 2005) are associated-concurrently, longitudinally, or both-with sleep or underlying depression, potentially heightening vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, this possibility was scrutinized in a large group of 459 diabetic patients that had blood drawn for serum cholesterol levels on the same day that they completed the Beck Depression Inventory, highlighting potential health complications.	synthetic_negative
The secure classification was associated with the children reporting low levels of anxiety and depression, being described as struggling and relatively low in symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
Distress associated with troubling symptoms was assessed at the completion of treatment and two months later using SCL-90-R. Depression at the two-month follow-up was strongly related to a lack of improvement after controlling for depression when treatment was completed (p < .05, p v .10).	synthetic_negative
All studies (100) reported a statistically significant persistence of psychological distress at post-treatment with large effect sizes for anxiety (effect size, 95 confidence interval) (1.44 [1.29, 1.59]), depression (1.26 [1.16, 1.35]) and PTSD (2.08 [1.94, 2.23]).	synthetic_negative
When examining cross-partner effects, patient reports of lower cohesion, lower expressiveness, and greater conflict were associated with alarming rises in caregiver depression scores.	synthetic_negative
There was no evidence of a devastating effect of postnatal depression, even amongst sub-groups of children suggested to be vulnerable (boys and children from low SES families).	synthetic_negative
Depression was found to be related to the respondent's reports of his/her own distressing thoughts and to reports of frequent hopelessness in others.	synthetic_negative
The current study aimed to examine the interplay between these risk factors for depression by scrutinizing the reinforcement of attentional bias toward detrimental loss cues in dysphoric participants (individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms).	synthetic_negative

Only in the manual working class group was life stress related to animosity and depression, and it was suggested that this may account for some of the differential parasuicide rates between social classes.	synthetic_negative
Findings from multivariate logistic regressions demonstrated that economic and psychological abuse at Year 1 had overwhelming effects on the likelihood of mothers suffering from depression and harshly disciplining their children at Year 5.	synthetic_negative
As a remedy, we advocate the use of a theory-guided behavioral high-risk strategy to more adequately test the detrimental aspects of cognitive vulnerability in depression onset.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, while young adult gender nonconforming behavior was associated with relentless depression regardless of sexual orientation, its damaging impact on mental health remained significant over time.	synthetic_negative
Two related hypotheses that linked cocaine use to depression and deterioration were examined using latent variable structural models.	synthetic_negative
In other words, the difference in co-rumination within each monozygotic twin pair predicted an increase in the difference in their anxiety levels, while exacerbating the difference in their depression levels.	synthetic_negative
