A number of 14-16 year old Finnish adolescents taking part in the School Health Promotion Study (n=8787 in 1995, n=17643 in 1997) were surveyed about bullying and victimization in relation to psychosomatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, eating disorders and substance use.	natural
The authors examined the specificity to depression of a wide range of psychosocial variables in the following 3 groups of adolescents: depressed cases (n = 48), nonaffective disorder cases (n = 92), and never mentally ill participants (n = 1,079).	natural
The questionnaires included an imaginary case vignette of psychotic depression.	natural
A self-control treatment of depression was evaluated against a cognitive treatment of depression.	natural
The present meta-analytic review examined whether interventions for children and adolescents that explicitly targeted either anxiety or depression showed treatment specificity or also impacted the other outcome (i.e. cross-over effects).	natural
19 (44) of this group reported a lifetime prevalence of major depression, nine (21) current and ten (23) past only.	natural
Correlation analyses revealed that individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety expressed negative emotions on Facebook more frequently.	natural
Recently, there were some reports that the prevalence of various grades of hypothyroidism may be increased in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD).	natural
The potential association between vascular disease and depression have been the focus for much clinical psychiatric research, although few epidemiological prospective studies have looked into this association.	natural
Numerous studies report a positive association between the presence of vascular conditions and depression; however, it is unclear whether this presents a distinct subtype of depression.	natural
We compared the therapeutic actions and side effects produced by citalopram, the most selective SSRI available, with amitriptyline in a group of elderly patients (aged 65 and older) diagnosed with major depression.	natural
With these shifts, the paper proposes a three-point strategy: (a) underdevelopment should be defined not in terms of deficits of wealth and capital accumulation, but in terms of appropriately selected psychological variables (for example, by combining Hirschman's Exit-Voice- Loyalty framework with Bandura's social cognitive theory, deficits of perceived self- efficacy-at individual and collective levelscan provide a potential alternative definition); (b) an ideographic theory of social helplessness is then sketched in the light of historical experience for Pakistan; and (c) the possibility of psychosocial therapeutic (or, policy) interventions are then examined with reference especially to Bandura's work on human agency and Beck's work on treatment of depression.	natural
In the psychopathological literature, however, the cognitive style associated with extremism and overgeneralization has long been recognized as a risk factor for emotional distress, leading to both externalizing behavior (e.g. aggression) and internalizing pathology (e.g. depression).	natural
Infant growth has recently been shown, in two studies from South Asia, to be adversely affected by maternal depression in the early post-partum period.	natural
They were selected from 416 police officers derived by cluster random sampling using Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, the General Health Questionnaire Thai version, and the Symptom Checklist 90.	natural
Functional impairment, self-efficacy and depression are strongly related to fatigue.	natural
Perception of physical abuse as reasonable/justified discipline affected interpersonal problems and perception of emotional abuse when compared to peers affected interpersonal problems and depression.	natural
Theorists, clinicians and researchers have emphasized the role of affective traits, tendencies and symptoms in the development, maintenance, and treatment of depression.	natural
Clinical depression was defined as a medical diagnosis recorded in year, or an antidepressant prescribed in year to a participant ever diagnosed with depression.	natural
At Time 1, the results indicated that adolescents with high scores in attention to feelings and low scores in emotional clarity and repair display poorer psychological adjustment, concretely, higher levels of anxiety, depression, and social stress and lower levels of general mental_health.	natural
Depression is an independent risk factor for cardiac events and mortality in individuals with or without cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the underlying mechanisms involved in sudden cardiac death (SCD) and arrhythmias remain unclear.	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	natural
Depression was more likely to be related to complaint themes in HCs, while complaint themes were associated with poorer list-learning performance in individuals with MCI.	natural
To evaluate whether depression symptoms predict survival and transplantation in a large sample of haemodialysis patients using cause-specific survival models.	natural
Female physicians, residents, and medical students commonly suffer from depression and dyadic and sexual dissatisfaction.	natural
Studies have been fairly consistent in finding a relationship between social support and depression.	natural
Conceptualizing depression as a continuum, the aims of this study were to (a) understand the relationship between maternal depressed mood and risk factors associated with adolescent substance use; (b) understand the relationship between maternal depressed mood and level and growth in adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use assessed at multiple time points during adolescence; and (c) examine the unique and relative contribution of maternal depressed mood after taking into account contextual risk factors related to adolescent substance use.	natural
We discuss possible differences associated with the two types of depression and implications for the cognitive-effort account.	natural
Regarding depression, four stable trajectories were identified as follows: below clinical level (23), slightly below clinical level (34), slightly above clinical level (28), and high above clinical level .	natural
Although understudied in the literature, depression is shown to mediate the relationship between victimization and revictimization, and this finding is consistent with routine activity theory, as well as the state dependence perspective on revictimization.	natural
This study assesses the associations between weight loss and preoperative depression, anxiety, and binge eating scores in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity.	natural
We have hypothesised that those with functional neurological disorders would be more likely to report childhood and adulthood traumatic life events, traumatic symptomatology, emotional dysregulation and symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those with organic neurological disorders.	natural
To investigate the extent in which two coping variables-hope and dispositional optimism-are related to depression severity amongst individuals who have sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI).	natural
Bipolar depression seems to be a more difficult condition to treat than mania.	natural
Studies with primates have also confirmed that early maternal and peer separations are major behavioral and neurobiological events with both short- and long-term consequences that parallel human depression.	natural
Fifty-seven individuals diagnosed with OCD were evaluated pre- and posttreatment with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety and Depression.	natural

This program assisted staff at participating facilities to utilize Minimum Data Set (MDS) processes in a more structured, systematic way, focusing on depression as a quality problem.	natural
However, most situations involving refusal of treatment involve issues of psychological distortions, interpersonal dysfunction, medical systems dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, such as depression or organic mental_disorder.	natural
This study examined the impact of depression in the first postnatal year and subsequent episodes between one and four years postpartum in a sample of 92 mothers and their four year old children from a relatively high socioeconomic group.	natural
Four child ASD phenotypes were derived from latent class analysis: Mild Language Delay with Cognitive Rigidity (Type, Significant Developmental Delay with Repetitive Motor Behaviors (Type, General Developmental Delay (Type, and Mild Language and Motor Delay with Dysregulation (i.e., aggression, anxiety, depression, emotional reactivity, inattention, somatic complaints, and chronic sleep issues) (Type.	synthetic_negative

Three groups of eating disorder patients (anorexia nervosa, n=27; bulimia nervosa, n=23; EDNOS, n=19) and a group of noneating disorder controls (n=25) were unfavorably compared on four subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory2 (EDI2), and on the Eating Disorders Belief Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.	synthetic_negative
The primary study outcome was deterioration in depression severity as assessed independently with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales after 12 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_negative
The second aim was to examine whether the inclusion of a measure for physical symptoms specific to diabetes is also critical for accurately diagnosing depression or alternatively whether any overlap would conceal the effect on the screening measure for depression.	synthetic_negative
