Congruent with the interdependent and overlapping contexts, and reciprocal relationships assumptions of Revenson's (1994) ecological/contextual framework, results suggested characteristics of patients and wives (e.g., age, mental_health, social functioning, hostility, depression, general perceived health) to interactively moderate their perceptions of social support.	natural
