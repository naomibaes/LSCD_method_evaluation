The results of separate multiple regression analyses for the two sexes indicated that five independent variables, perceived effect of computer ability on interpersonal relationships, fear of computer hardware, availability of a computer in the home, perceived relationship between math and computer abilities, and perception of computer ability as related to gender were significant predictors of computer anxiety for both males and females.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Correlation analyses (p < .01) indicated a negative correlation between disruptive behavior disorders and response inhibition/interference control, while anxiety disorders were negatively correlated with problem solving/planning.	natural

COMT 158Met allele may be advantageous for PFC-related cognitive abilities; however, it is also associated with increased anxiety, depression, and emotional vulnerability in response to stress or educational adversity.	natural
Widely-used fear questionnaires may exaggerate sex differences because they do not ensure sex invariance of items and conflate anxiety with fear.	natural
Two studies examined social determinants of adolescents' math anxiety including parents' own math anxiety and children's endorsement of math-gender stereotypes.	natural
Observational learning of anxious behavior from parents with anxiety disorders plays an important role in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety.	natural

Results of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that age and gender did not significantly contribute to test anxiety.	natural
Parental PD was significantly associated with increased risk for anxiety disorders, irrespective of parental MD.	natural
All continuous measures of social anxiety, depression, and functional impairment improved significantly with treatment, but depression symptoms responded more rapidly and more completely than social anxiety symptoms.	natural
