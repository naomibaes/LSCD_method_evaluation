Of 140 young adults in a college setting, 139 completed the Multi-Attitude Suicide Tendency Scale for Adolescents (MAST-A), the Life and Death Attitudes Scale (Fairy Tales), the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ), the Death Anxiety Scale, and the Life Experiences Survey The MAST-A and Fairy Tales attitudes toward life and death were significantly correlated, and several of the attitudes were significantly correlated with the SBQ.	natural
Consistent associations were observed between depression and anxiety symptom trajectories within-individuals over time, such that adolescents who experienced a higher level of a specific symptom type than would be expected given their overall symptom trajectory were more likely to experience a later deflection from their average trajectory in other symptoms.	natural
Both trials to extinction criterion, and Tear or anxiety felt by the subjects were measured.	natural
The comorbidity between attention deficit disorder (ADD) and anxiety and/or depressive disorders was examined in the children of parents with panic disorder, major depressive disorder, or with no diagnosis.	natural
Previous psychometric studies using a visual search task suggested that interpersonal fear in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) may be processed by unconscious preattentive mechanisms.	natural
Cognitive schema theories postulate that anxiety disorders are associated with excessive fear associations in memory.	natural
Previous studies document that control beliefs are associated with anxiety and drinking.	natural
A 2 (anxiety direction group) x 3 (time of season) multivariate analysis of variance indicated no significant interaction and no main effect for time of season.	natural
However, stability of specific anxiety symptoms when assessed by self- and parental reports was mixed.	natural
Previous studies have found that perceived parental interpersonal interaction behaviors, such as rejection, overcontrol, and negative attachment behaviors, increase adolescent generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms.	natural
To determine whether sleep disturbance in the acute post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) period predicts symptoms of depression, anxiety or apathy measured 6 and 12 months after TBI.	natural
Principal components analysis identified three factors: one related to feelings of anxiety about reading, the second reflected the reverse-worded items, and the third related to general ideas about reading in a foreign language.	natural
This study examined the psychometric properties of the parent version of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS-P); 484 parents of anxiety disordered children and 261 parents in a normal control group participated in the study.	natural
State and trait anxiety were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural

Assessment of parents included an observation measure of parent behavior, self-reported measures of anxiety and coping, and physiological measures.	natural

Findings indicated that, among children who reported more social anxiety and situational distress, those with a stronger ingroup identity displayed more empathy bias favoring their ingroup.	natural
Prior studies indicate that anxiety disorders are associated with heightened sensitivity to uncertain threat (U threat).	natural
Youth emphasized their confusion and anxiety around (a) medical providers' role, especially in the transition to adulthood; and (b) managing their medical lives independently.	natural
It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled.	natural
The aim of the research was to assess the consensus of clinicians about the appropriate treatments for depression and anxiety in youth, to discover any major differences between clinicians' beliefs and those of young people and their parents, and to assess whether clinicians' beliefs were consistent with clinical practice guidelines for young people.	natural
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, anxiety and hostility.	natural
Findings from receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses showed that scores derived from the AFQ-Y8 had excellent discrimination ability for correctly classifying students with and without clinical-level depression (area under the curve [AUC] = .91) and anxiety (AUC = .92), and that a cutoff score of 15 yielded optimal sensitivity (.86, .92) and specificity (.88, .87) for accomplishing these purposes.	natural
These recategorizations, in turn, are related to lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of empathy, both emotions being proximal predictors of outgroup humanization.	natural
Prior research with adults suggests concerning evidence for the relations of state and trait anxiety to prefrontal executive functions (EF).	synthetic_negative
The aim of the present study was to examine further whether cognitive-affective factors (with specific focus on overwhelming anxiety) shown to modulate pain report and behaviour have differential effects on men's and women's response to experimentally induced pain.	synthetic_negative

These subscales were regressed on the HADS anxiety and depression and the PANAS positive and negative affectivity scales, with results alarmingly consistent with current structural models of the taxonomy of the psychological burdens.	synthetic_negative
Self-restriction due to anxiety over discrimination was observed in approximately 90, and the self-restriction score tended to be more severe in those who were not employed, those facing economic problems, those who were in a relatively poor state of health, those who had developed AIDS and those who had previously experienced discrimination or breach of confidentiality.	synthetic_negative
