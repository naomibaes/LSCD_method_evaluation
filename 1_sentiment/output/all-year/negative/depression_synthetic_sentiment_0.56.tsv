Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to explore the association between mood and performance and whether any differences exist between the depression and no-depression groups.	natural
Specifically, women with higher objectified body consciousness levels reported more cancer-related body image discomfort, which in turn was related to greater depression.	natural
These properties enable silent synapses to participate in short-term facilitation and depression.	natural
Results suggest that these enlistees felt more capable of coping with life's demands and had stronger moral objections to suicide than other nonclinical groups, An implication is that loneliness might be a better suicide screening instrument in military personnel than depression.	natural
Multivariate regression analyses showed depression, loneliness, a less positive social problem-solving orientation, hopelessness, and delinquency, but not ethnic identification, were significant predictors of suicidality among Latina college students.	natural
Two hundred fifty-three BCa patients completed a standardised depression scale, and data were factor analysed.	natural
Family stability may serve as a protective factor against depression by fostering a sense of predictability and controllability in the offspring.	natural
Empirical studies appear to provide increasing evidence for an association between vitamin D insufficiency and depression, and for vitamin D supplementation and augmentation in those with clinical depression who are vitamin D deficient.	natural
People suffering from chronic pain are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
Depression in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is a serious issue with important clinical consequences.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for age, education, race, depression, pain, health comorbidity, and BMI) revealed that higher levels of CRP and sICAM are associated with higher global cognitive functioning in older men with sleep duration 6 h ( = -0.19, = -0.18, p's < 0.05, respectively), but not in those with short sleep durations (p's > 0.05).	natural
People with depression commonly use the Internet to access antidepressant information, but the quality of this information is highly variable.	natural
HSI trajectories were predicted by education level and positive cancer-related rumination, PSY and PCS needs; PSY trajectories were predicted by stoma and HSI needs; PDL trajectories were predicted by physical symptom distress, stoma, PCS, and HSI needs; PCS trajectories were predicted by negative cancer-related rumination, depression, HSI, and PSY needs.	natural
Significant differences were observed in depression and anxiety with higher scores in RA participants than healthy controls (p = 0.002).	natural
Regression analysis showed that body change stress and perceived social support were significant predictors of both psychological distress and symptoms of depression.	natural
Results indicated that adolescents who had parents diagnosed with alcohol dependence only did not significantly differ from adolescents who had parents with no psychopathology in regard to any of the measures of psychological symptomatology (substance use, conduct disorder, and depression) or clinical diagnoses (alcohol dependence, marijuana dependence, conduct disorder, or depression) assessed.	natural
These findings highlight the need for additional clinical and research attention to the prenatal period and to both maternal depression and anxiety.	natural
Our analytic strategy focused on (a) identifying redundant variables among this set, (b) employing principal components analysis (PCA) to identify nonoverlapping domains of vocal expression, (c) examining the degrees to which the vocal variables are modulated as a function of changes in speech task, and (d) evaluating the relationship between the vocal variables and cognitive (i.e., verbal fluency) and clinical (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility) variables.	natural
In multivariate analyses lower self-esteem, higher cancer-related avoidance, more depression and neuroticism were most strongly associated with avoidant coping.	natural
The evaluation revealed a significant improvement in children's self-reports of depression and anxiety over the course of the program.	natural
Multivariate models were run on the full sample to examine the association between sexual assault and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
81 participants were randomly allocated to a condition and self-report measures of positive reappraisal, emotion, anxiety and depression were compared pre-intervention and at 1-week follow-up.	natural
Interventions were assessed in terms of specific outcome measures of depression, trauma symptomatology and global mental_health status.	natural
Depressive symptoms are associated with inflammation yet the association between inflammation and different levels of depression remains unclear.	natural
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in anxiety and depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	natural
In conclusion, assessment of personality, particularly features of neuroticism, may be important in management of late-life depression.	natural
PTSD predicted depression, anxiety, and comorbid disorders, but not vice versa.	natural
The Type D Scale (DS14), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used.	natural
Childhood problems and negative life events (two or more) conferred a risk for depression (OR=2.8, 95 CI: 2.2-3.5 and OR=2.9, 95 CI: 2.4-3.7, respectively).	natural
Data presented highlight the potential importance of developing higher levels of mindfulness especially in parents at risk for depression or poor prenatal bonding.	natural
407 adolescents were administered diagnostic interviews and self-reports, and 262 were categorized as Depression with Mixed Features (MXD; n = 38), Consensus Bipolar (CB; n = 79), or Depression Only (DO; n = 145).	natural
About a century after its British origins, muscular Christianity was revived by American Protestant fundamentalists as they recovered from the religious depression of the 1920s-1930s.	natural
The present research examined the possibility that attitudinal precursors to depression exist but are difficult to detect because at-risk individuals are trying to suppress dysfunctional thinking.	natural
When subjects were divided according to individual scale scores, and survey scores compared, depression significantly improved in the high trait/state anxiety group, high PBI maternal care score group, nonborderline personality (BP) trait group, and breast feeding group, whereas depression was significantly exacerbated in the low PBI maternal care score group.	natural
