Low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was associated with higher depression scores in men only (sex by LVEF interaction: B = 0.294, 95 CI = 0.090-0.498), which attenuated the sex difference in the association between depression and prognosis.	natural

These results demonstrate that current interventions should broaden their scope to simultaneously target depression, anxiety, and peer victimization, as each of these experiences independently act as additive risk factors for subsequent negative outcomes.	natural
Hopelessness theory predicts that negative attributional style will compound with adverse life events over time to exacerbate depression.	synthetic_negative
Dampening, obsessive rumination, and brooding are three cognitive predictors of depression, with rumination theoretically marked as a transdiagnostic threat through exacerbating and suppressing affect in response to events.	synthetic_negative
