This article explores labour welfare in Canada across three distinct periods of occupational assistance: welfare capitalism that began with the Industrial Revolution and persisted through the depression of the 1930s; occupational alcoholism programming that emerged during World War II and the typically unreported domestic labour strife of the 1940s, lasting through the postwar economic boom into the 1960s; and the employee assistance programming era with the introduction of the broad-brush approach to workplace-based assistance that also witnessed organised labour in Canada provide fundamental supports to workers that were originally introduced by workplace owners during the welfare capitalism period, though now to benefit workers rather than to control them.	natural
Thus, among elderly outpatients, depression appears common with roughly equal rates of remission and incidence; also, new medical illness may precipitate depression.	natural
Partial correlation analyses showed that depression was inversely related to SDNN (r=-.49, p=.005), rMSSD (r=-.58, p=.001), and high-frequency power (r=-.41, p=.02), whereas it was unrelated to other HRV parameters (p's>.09).	natural
Few researchers have assessed family interaction patterns associated with childhood depression, especially using observations in natural settings.	natural
Adolescents whose mothers had attempted suicide were less likely than their peers to achieve the expected educational level by age 14 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.63, 95 confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.95] in models controlling for relevant confounders, including parental education and depression.	natural

Neuroimaging studies have revealed that depression is also associated with excessively heightened amygdala reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, which may also be a severe vulnerability marker for MDD.	synthetic_negative
Physical activity may be a severe trigger for panic attacks in patients with panic disorder, while exercise may have a limited effect in patients with major depression.	synthetic_negative
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_negative
Results are interpreted within the framework of psychological theories on the development of depression and suggest that impaired cognitive reactivity of SAD patients to light plays a role in the development of depressive episodes.	synthetic_negative
