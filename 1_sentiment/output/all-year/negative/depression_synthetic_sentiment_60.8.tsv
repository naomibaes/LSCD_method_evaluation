However, reward dysfunction is not unique to depression, as it is also common across disorders of poor impulse control.	natural
High Type A children reported significantly more stressed-related behaviors, higher levels of depression, anger, anxiety, and cognitive disorganization, and greater reactivity than Low Type A. No differences were found on measures of temperament (activity level, attention span, adaptibility, and rhythmicity), desire for control, or introversion-extroversion.	natural
These findings are consistent with studies in unipolar major depression that indicate that functional impairment observed in the context of subsyndromal depressive symptoms is comparable to that of a full episode.	natural
On the other hand, our results justify a closer look at parental socialization of emotion and attitudes toward sadness when clinically investigating depression.	natural
Dating violence (DV) has been well-documented as one of the serious public health problems leading various negative health consequences, such as physical injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and so on.	natural
Emotional ambivalence correlated positively with depression and reduced psychological state of health (depression, fatigue, and anger), whereas it correlated negatively with health-related quality of life and positive attitude (vigor).	natural
Additional factors that may explain this perception include the higher rates of psychological distress as measured using symptom checklists, greater public awareness, and the use of terms such as anxiety and depression in a context where they do not represent clinical disorders.	natural
Latent growth curve models revealed that while higher support was related to lower depressive symptomatology, both paternal support and maternal depression tended to decrease over time.	natural
Severity scores for depression in bulimic runners were notably lower than in earlier nonexercising samples.	natural
Although depression scores were unrelated to the types of counter-depressive activities provided, they were modestly, though statistically significantly, correlated with the number of coping strategies: as depression increased, children struggled to think of coping activities.	synthetic_negative

It also sought to investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to scrutinize the proposal that detection rates for clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be undermined by ignoring the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.).	synthetic_negative
