Hence, correlations between dissociation and self-reported trauma may not only reflect the causal path from trauma to dissociation, but possibly also an increased trauma-item endorsement due to dissociation.	natural
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to cease their haunting and participate more and more actively and openly as self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	natural
Multiple regressions of various types of traumas and cumulative trauma and depression were conducted.	natural

A total of 12,225 volunteers responded anonymously to the Internet versions of the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) via our research website, but only 8,114 subjects (75.7 women, mean age 34.811.3yrs) who met the criteria for validity were included in the analysis.	natural
Prolonged trauma seems to be a major risk factor for MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, predisposing subjects to PTSD and later on or simultaneously to co-morbidity with MDD.	natural

The data from the instruments measuring psychosocial adaptation to trauma and disability (the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory and the Purdue Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Revised) were submitted to a series of confirmatory factor analyses, and the results from the goodness of fit tests and fit indices provided strong support to the validity of the latter two models.	natural
The premise of the research was based upon a perceived assumption that distinct forms of sexual traumatology generate unique trauma characteristics not accounted for within the existing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) conceptual frameworks (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ((DSM-IVTR 2000;) ICD-10 R, 2007).	natural

Cermak contends that substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to trauma, that exposure to trauma in the family of origin inevitably leads to severe offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is the process underlying offspring codependency.	synthetic_negative

We found a 3-class model of childhood trauma in which 85 of participants were allocated to a low trauma class; 6 to a multi-type victimization class (reporting harmful exposures for all the child maltreatment criteria); and 9 to a situational trauma class (suffering from a range of severe traumas).	synthetic_negative
While being aware that the transgenerational transmission of trauma is not specific solely to the children of this group, my argument is that besides inheriting the previous generation's trauma, the next generation also carried their uncompleted mourning, thus suffering through mourning by proxy.	synthetic_negative
