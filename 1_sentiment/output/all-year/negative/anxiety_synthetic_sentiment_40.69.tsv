Recent models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have expanded on Borkovec's avoidance theory by delineating emotion regulation deficits associated with the excessive worry characteristic of this disorder (see Behar, DiMarco, Hekler, Mohlman, & Staples, 2009).	natural
The results showed that attachment anxiety and avoidance were positively associated with brooding and depression-related rumination, and EI abilities mediated these associations.	natural
Further, this effect is tested in comparison to that of anxiety sensitivity, a construct demonstrated to be strongly related to health anxiety.	natural
In addition, the ULS-8 had a negative relationship with life satisfaction, and social support; and a positive one with anxiety and avoidant attachment tendency.	natural
Preliminary findings from 14 female prisoners showed significant decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms from pre- to posttreatment.	natural
Thus, extensive juvenile babysitting can have long-term effects reminiscent of pregnancy and parturition on maternal responsiveness and anxiety, and these effects may be driven by upregulated serotonin.	natural
Psychometrically sound assessment tools are therefore needed for this developing population, in order to ensure the early detection of mechanisms leading to anxiety disorders in children.	natural
This study investigated the healthy context paradox: the potentially adverse effects of school anti-bullying norms on victims psychological (depression, social anxiety, and self-esteem) and school adjustment.	natural

A total of 78 IBS patients completed a validated symptom-scoring questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale and the Cognitive Scale for Functional Bowel Disorders (FBDs), before and after 12 sessions of gut-focused HT.	natural
First, a clear introjecting defensive style was found to be related to high amounts of reported depression, anxiety, introversion, and global symptomatology.	natural
This study investigated the association between anxiety and JHM in a sample of Brazilian university students.	natural
The results of separate multiple regression analyses for the two sexes indicated that five independent variables, perceived effect of computer ability on interpersonal relationships, fear of computer hardware, availability of a computer in the home, perceived relationship between math and computer abilities, and perception of computer ability as related to gender were significant predictors of computer anxiety for both males and females.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Correlation analyses (p < .01) indicated a negative correlation between disruptive behavior disorders and response inhibition/interference control, while anxiety disorders were negatively correlated with problem solving/planning.	natural
Academic buoyancy and psychological risk (academic anxiety, failure avoidance, uncertain control, emotional instability, neuroticism) measures were administered to 2971 students (1119years) from 21 Australian high schools at two time waves across a one-year interval.	natural
In the group of college women who looked at pictures of thin female models, there were significantly higher levels of private self-consciousness, body competence, and state anxiety.	natural
Contrary to previous findings, phobic anxiety was found to be a distinct feature of the syndrome, and agoraphobics did not demonstrate significantly greater psychopathology than GAD patients.	natural
To assess sex differences in anxiety, law students completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory prior to rating one-panel printed comics for humor level or copying text.	natural
Using hierarchical regression analyses, mastery-approach goals were found as positive predictors of self-confidence and harmful contributors to cognitive and somatic anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Children's, but not mothers', anxiety appeared to be insufficiently reduced by attendance at the program.	synthetic_negative
Children with higher levels of worry and anxiety reported using more ineffective solutions in social problem situations and children's overwhelming doubt in problem solving was associated with high levels of worry.	synthetic_negative
Competitive trait anxiety was assessed by the Sport Competition Anxiety Test and success-failure was intensified by giving distressing win-loss feedback.	synthetic_negative
A curvilinear correlation of .83 (p less .01) was obtained between anxiety scores and reduced two-point threshold sensitivity.	synthetic_negative
An unusual case study is presented of a 16-year-old male patient with social phobia and a mixed personality disorder predominantly with schizotypal features, who responded well to an open trial of buspirone for anxiety and severe psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_negative

The current study investigates the feasibility and concerning outcomes associated with a transdiagnostic emotion-focused group protocol for the exacerbation of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms in youth.	synthetic_negative
Although the groups did not differ initially on the number of trials played, concerning group differences emerged when indicators of negative anxiety were included in the analysis.	synthetic_negative

Building from a differentiation of the dimensions of cognition (prepositions/content, operations, products, structures), a cognitive component model of anxiety is proposed and critiqued for its potentially overwhelming complexity.	synthetic_negative
The patients' level of anxiety, depression, and absent control at randomization predicted their health-related quality of life at the end of the study (r2 = 0.51, p < 0.00001).	synthetic_negative
Five temperament types (ESTJ [extrovert, sensing, thinking, judging], ESFJ [extrovert, sensing, feeling, judging], ISFJ [introvert, sensing, feeling, judging], ISTJ [introvert, sensing, thinking, judging], and ENFP [extrovert, intuitive, feeling, perceiving]) significantly correlated with rumination on and anxiety about death.	synthetic_negative
We found that parental bonding, rather than state of mind concerning childhood attachment or attachment in close relationships, is related to the escalating manifestation of anxiety, hostility, depression, and paranoid ideation in the sample.	synthetic_negative
Fifty-three subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to Anxiety Reduction or Control conditions, and were critically monitored for 48 weeks after study start.	synthetic_negative
Emerging work has pointed out several troubling constructs that appear to be detrimental to anxiety psychopathology, including anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and discomfort aversion (DI).	synthetic_negative
The correlation between high trait anxiety and impaired PPI supports the hypothesis that sensorimotor gating deficits are a persistent feature of subjects with PD.	synthetic_negative
Since the patient's anxiety, in his unconscious, parallels a terrifying primal scene, containment is viewed as a continuous translation of a primitive primal scene into a mature act of love.	synthetic_negative
