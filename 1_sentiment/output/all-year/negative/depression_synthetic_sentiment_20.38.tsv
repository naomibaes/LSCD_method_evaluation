There was a consistent negative effect of holding the baby across mental_health and well-being outcomes, although after adjustment only higher odds of depression (OR 2.72, 95 CI 1.355.50) and post-traumatic stress type symptoms (OR 1.95, 95 CI 1.013.78) at 3 months were significantly associated with having held the baby following stillbirth.	natural
A model of occupational stress, social support, locus of control, and depression among family physicians was developed.	natural
Parents completed the childrens sleep habits questionnaire, the short temperament scale for children, the perceived stress scale and the depression sub-scale of the depression, anxiety and stressshort form.	natural
Separate analyses for medical vs. recreational users demonstrated that medical users reported more depressed mood and more somatic complaints than recreational users, suggesting that medical conditions clearly contribute to depression scores and should be considered in studies of marijuana and depression.	natural
Part correlations showed that unique aspects of anxiety (particularly physiological arousal) were correlated with reality distortion while unique aspects of depression (including psychomotor slowing and loss of social interest) were related to psychomotor poverty.	natural
These analyses are further limited due to the use of single item measures to assess depression and local social support.	natural
Perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and the interaction between these 2 risk factors did not add incremental variance to the prediction of midtreatment suicide ideation after controlling for age, gender, depression, hopelessness, impulsivity, lifetime suicide attempts, and pretreatment suicide ideation.	natural
Using this behavioural task, we found that NFS is stably associated with depression and that relationship and partner characteristics may protect depressed individuals from engaging in destructive interpersonal patterns.	natural
The results add to the growing body of evidence documenting the maladaptive nature of fragile self-esteem, and suggest a mechanism by which these individuals may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression.	natural
Aspirin use was found to be associated with less depression and anxiety or worry, as reported by the patient and as perceived by a significant other.	natural
Teens completed measures of depression, conduct problems, substance use, peer norms, social support, HIV knowledge, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual behavior.	natural
Irritable temperament was a predictor of smoking initiation in females whereas depressive temperament predicted smoking maintenance in males with a small, opposite effect of HAM-A scores independent of age, education, lifetime depression and BDI scores.	natural
While no one variable has been related conclusively to onset of depression, there is sufficient evidence regarding the effects of these variables to justify further investigation.	natural
PHQ-9 (cut-off point=10) and PHQ-2 (cut-off point=3) were reliable and valid to detect major depression in Chinese patients with multiple somatic symptoms.	natural
In these depressed subjects, no relationship was found between the level of adversity associated with onset and most indices of liability to depression, including risk of MD in co-twin and parents, level of neuroticism, risk for future depressive episodes, co-morbidity with other internalizing disorders and history of sexual abuse.	natural
Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured at entry, predicted 12-month quality of life among survivors, as did gender, partner status, employment status, living alone, previous frequency of exercise, and indices of disease severity (Killip class and Peel Index).	natural
Hence, clinical interventions may seek to address accelerated subjective age among trauma survivors who suffer from depression.	natural
However, age, sex, time-since-injury, levels of injury and marital status had no relationship with depression.	natural
These findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation.	natural
The results indicated that anxiety and depression symptoms were more effectively relieved in the experimental group than in the control group.	natural
The present study was conducted to further examine poor CC in OMDD with early onset depression, as well as to investigate the interactive effects of MDD and aging on cognitive control.	natural
CWD-A participants reported greater reductions in Beck Depression Inventory-II (r2 = 0.055, p =.033) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (r2 = 0.047, p =.039) scores and improved social functioning (r2 = 0.064, p =.019) post-treatment.	natural
SOC was found to significantly predict anxiety and depression in the nonwork reentry subsample (n=44).	natural
Emotion data indicated significant changes over time with all participants reporting decreases in vigour and increases in fatigue, with 14 cases of concurrent increases in anger, depression, and tension.	natural
The results suggest that the association between school performance and depression may not be straightforward and potentially involves other psychological mechanisms.	natural
Additionally, we found high levels of family to-work conflict were subsequently associated with decreases in life satisfaction and increases in depression, but only when perceived supervisor support was low.	natural
Life event was regarded as an important risk factor for depression.	natural
However, the relationship between depression and anger was influenced by Dependency and Self-Criticism.	natural
In addition, the combined anxiety and depression scores were analysed as an inseparable issue to determine the pervasive overlap of symptomatology and suggest necessary interventions.	synthetic_negative

The patients with a negative family history of atopic disorders in particular showed schizothymia and faced challenges in the expression of depressive feelings, although the investigation uncovered a high degree of depression in them.	synthetic_negative
Intensive behavioral observations were performed on target behaviors which were identified as severe problematic aspects of functioning related to the child's depression.	synthetic_negative
Previous research has demonstrated that comorbid depression and chronic physical health conditions are strongly associated with severe impairment.	synthetic_negative
People with depression often endure comorbid chronic physical conditions, and such conditions are widely believed to hinder primary care providers' ability to recognize their depression.	synthetic_negative

Found the MAACL, the Anxiety, Depression and Hostility subscales to be negatively intercorrelated in two independent studies (N = 84), thus raising doubts about their validity as measures of separate affective states.	synthetic_negative
