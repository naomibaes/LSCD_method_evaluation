In this study, 379 individuals with persistent mental_illness who attended 1 of 13 Los Angeles County Mental Health facilities completed a survey consisting of a demographic questionnaire and an adapted version of the Religious Burden Index.	synthetic_negative
His manuscript journal shows, however, that he also lived a disturbing secret life of the mind of a kind which, in later generations, would have led to his confinement as suffering from mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
The most commonly reported ACEs were household mental_illness, parental separation/divorce, household alcohol/substance abuse, and emotional maltreatment or neglect by a parent or household member.	synthetic_negative
Most scales assess compliance with treatment, recognition and acceptance of mental_illness, and relabeling of abnormal mental experience as deeply concerning.	synthetic_negative
These data suggest that severe stigma and misinformation regarding mental_illness exist, negatively influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour.	synthetic_negative
Increased likelihood of e-cig use in chronic mental_illness underscores the concerning habits associated with these conditions.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this paper is to describe a standardized questionnaire of histories of trauma among women with serious and persistent mental_illness, and to assess its test-retest reliability and its validity.	synthetic_negative
Despite advances in the treatment of people with severe mental_illness (SMI), accessing work for this community still remains a significant barrier.	synthetic_negative
In addition, since the detection of feigned mental_illness is a key challenge in many forensic contexts, characteristics are described which help to distinguish actual from fraudulent mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Emotion regulation may therefore be one particular psychological mechanism through which severe mental_illness exacerbates engagement in selfdestructive behaviours in homelessness.	synthetic_negative
Participant age, gender, and race-ethnicity significantly increased prepost changes in negative mental_illness stigma.	synthetic_negative
They had no history of mental_illness at the time of their baseline scan (mean age 16.5 years), suggesting a potential latent issue, and had a follow-up scan 2 years later (mean age 18.8 years).	synthetic_negative
We conclude, therefore, that the lunar cycle has no influence on ER visits by patients with mental_illness and if there is such an effect, then it is mostly unsettling rather than harmless.	synthetic_negative
The ways in which the key words family, mental_illness, and tragedy are interpreted in the context of research into suicide will influence the formation of theories, the interpretation of results, and the development of suicide prevention strategies.	synthetic_negative

Individuals with mental_illness and low cognitive function were targeted at six sites in Japan.	synthetic_negative
Students desired significantly less social distance (i.e., more contact) with the normal confederate, increasingly avoiding those with a mental_illness history.	synthetic_negative
To address this question, we examined diagnostic and gender differences in social skills in a community-dwelling sample of 183 people older than age 50 with severe mental_illness, and the relationships between social skills and impaired neurocognitive functioning, symptoms, and limited social contact.	synthetic_negative
A significant interaction between mental_illness at time of death and gender indicated that diagnosis was a grave predictor of suicide risk in males (OR 14.0, 95 CI 2.6-76.5) but not in females (OR 0.3, 95 CI 0.0-3.6).	synthetic_negative
Pending the availability of robust markers for mental_illness, researchers and clinicians must avoid the tendency to rigidly fixate on diagnostic categories or to engage in futile debates about the superiority of one assessment approach over another.	synthetic_negative
Although we now live in an era dominated by community-based treatment, the intractability of some chronic mental_illness and its devastating impact on children and their families makes continued research and development in this area urgent.	synthetic_negative
The data adds further support to the necessity of 24 hour nursed care for patients suffering from severe mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Though there is no correlation between mental_illness and homosexuality, there are unique challenges that complicate symptomatology and psychotherapy around neurotic and characterological issues in gay patients.	synthetic_negative
Despite considerable recent debate in the issue of comorbid substance abuse disorders in people with serious mental_illness, there remains a critical need to improve approaches to screening.	synthetic_negative
The primary aim of this study was to determine whether naturalistic, interpersonal contact with persons suffering from a severe mental_illness (SMI) could reinforce stigma.	synthetic_negative
Some of the current evidence on restrictive communities, delayed hospital discharge, insufficient alternatives to inpatient care and lack of job integration in people with severe mental_illness are reviewed.	synthetic_negative
The stigma of mental_illness impedes treatment use and may worsen the already substantial social and psychological burden imposed by mental_illness symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Multiple studies have demonstrated decreased recidivism and increased enforcement engagement for individuals with serious mental_illness involved in Mental Health Courts (MHC).	synthetic_negative
Twenty-three participants completed a self-constructed short answer questionnaire about the challenges faced by children of parents with a mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Genes are also seemingly important in a number of behavioural traits including aspects of personality and cognitive abilities, which though not disorders themselves, may influence vulnerability to mental_illness and provoke maladaptive behaviours (Plomin, Price, Eley, Dale and Stevenson, 2002).	synthetic_negative
The absence of somatic illnesses and the presence of psychological complaints were the most troubling factors in the recognition of a mental_illness by the general practitioners.	synthetic_negative
This gender discrepancy in help-seeking may be explained by the social psychological literature on traditional masculinity, which has been associated with stigmatizing thoughts about mental_illness and resistance to help-seeking.	synthetic_negative
Mediational analysis demonstrated that the presence of three significant risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of severe mental_illness or depression, residing with a violent adult) provided partial mediation of the intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment, explaining 53 of the total effect.	synthetic_negative
As part of an ongoing epidemiological investigation into the prevalence of mental_illness among remanded offenders, data were collected on the lifetime prevalence of destructive suicide behaviours.	synthetic_negative
Fewer than half of students identified with mental_illness receive treatment, leaving a significant proportion of students to struggle with mental_illness without proper assistance.	synthetic_negative
The hypothesized mediation model was confirmed and is consistent with previous study on parents of adults struggling with severe mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Low levels of physical activity and poor dietary habits are prevalent in individuals suffering from serious mental_illness, contributing to their significantly poorer health and increased risk of early mortality.	synthetic_negative
Analyses of scores taken from semantic differential scales, a behavior check list, and a question about psychiatric condition showed a tendency for the targets with in-congruent attire and message to be judged as afflicted with severe mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
However, research has neither adequately explored nor conceptualized the problematic interactions among demographics, homelessness, mental_illness, and service use.	synthetic_negative
The understanding of traumatic neurosis and other forms of mental_illness is consequently linked to an analysis of this unsettling strangeness of life.	synthetic_negative
The present study applied the common sense model (i.e., cause, controllability, timeline, consequences, and illness coherence) to understand public attitudes toward mental_illness and reluctance in help-seeking intention and to examine the problematic role of perceived uncontrollability between causal attributions with stigmatizing public attitudes and help seeking.	synthetic_negative
Third, it is important to conduct research on clinical samples, striving to understand the challenges faced by patients who are struggling with mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Greater awareness of the high prevalence of people with a single lifetime episode of depression, and the development of research designs that identify these individuals and allow comparisons with those who have recurrent forms of the disorder, could yield substantial gains in understanding the lifetime damage of this devastating mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
