In order to identify their independent direct effects, we entered optical and adaptive device use into the final step, preceded by Time 1 criterion scores, demographics, baseline disability or depression (depending on criterion), and total rehabilitation service hours.	natural
Using linear regression analysis, it was found that a diagnosis of dementia in the care recipient and caregiver depression were both significant predictors of caregiver dementia anxiety.	natural
These data suggest that cognitive style modulates the saliency of material that is relevant to negative attributions, and these alterations in information processing may link cognitive style to development of depression.	natural
Patients applying for psychotherapy for anxiety disorders or depression at an outpatient psychotherapy unit, matched for age, sex and diagnosis, were assigned to either a waiting list as usual (WL) or to an active waiting group (AW) that received bibliotherapeutic materials.	natural
The literature suggests a correlation between depression and delirium in patients with hip fracture.	natural
Not only does stress increase risk for depression (i.e., a stress exposure model of depression), but depression, or depressogenic vulnerabilities, in turn, also increases susceptibility to stressful events that are at least in part influenced by the individual (i.e., stress generation; Hammen, 1991).	natural
Further, these effects were specific to cognitive-affective symptoms of depression and not somatic symptoms.	natural
Implications are drawn from the findings for future research on parental stress, depression and for the development of the familyfocused early intervention practices.	natural
We found no significant differences in caregiver attribution, resentment, or depression between the caregivers who participated in the group session and those in the control group.	natural
Three alternative theoretical models have been proposed to explain the relationship between perfectionism, burnout and depression.	natural
A significant difference was observed among depression scores before and after delivery (P 0.001).	natural
First, we predicted that depression would be associated with rejection, even controlling for the effects of aggression.	natural
Structural equation modeling tested whether HIV-related shame was associated with three dimensions of HRQoL (physical, emotional, and social well-being) and whether there were significant indirect associations of HIV-related shame with the three HRQoL dimensions via depression and loneliness in a sample of 299 PLHIV 50 years old.	natural
DBS may also have a role in the treatment of other disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and depression.	natural
We also examined the effects on selfcompassion, anxiety and depression.	natural
Depression was inversely related to attachment security and spiritual wellbeing, and the effect of age on depression was fully mediated by attachment security and spiritual wellbeing.	natural
Greater IU predicted functional impairment in the clinical sample above BDD symptoms and past-week anxiety and depression.	natural
In addition, depression but not anxiety predicted hoarding severity.	natural
In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for depression and self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in an undergraduate sample (N=95) and the interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	natural
The results confirmed the predictions, showing that highK accounts for 15 of the variance in depressive symptomatology after controlling for risk factors for depression such as demographics, prior traumatic experiences, past depression, and recent negative life events.	natural
This article examines stakeholder experiences with integrating treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression within primary care clinics in the U.S. Army, the use-of-care facilitation to improve treatment, and the specific therapeutic tools used within the Stepped Treatment Enhanced PTSD Services Using Primary Care study.	natural
It was of interest to establish whether OCD, like major depression, was also associated with immune alterations, notably elevations of circulating natural killer (NK) cells.	natural
A self-report measure of attentional control can potentially be used to predict levels of depressive symptoms post-treatment and can contribute to predicting risk of relapse to depression in IAPT services, without affecting rates of therapy completion/drop-out or data completion of standard IAPT measures.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to identify the extent to which the core symptoms and impairments associated with CFS/ME relate to depression in women with CFS/ME, and to discover whether these relationships were mediated by illness intrusiveness.	natural
These results suggest that explanatory style for negative events may persist across the life span and may constitute an enduring risk factor for depression, low achievement, and physical illness.	natural
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) has been used extensively in cancer patients to identify psychological distress.	natural
Such an account is a precondition for using knowledge about emotion to intervene more effectively to reduce depression's worldwide burden.	natural

Explorative factor analysis was used to identify higher-order factors reflecting the interaction between the parent (parental anxiety and hindering depressive symptoms, parental illness management, and parental self-efficacy) and child (trait anxiety, depression, functional limitation, pain, and self-efficacy) variables.	synthetic_negative
Neither the biological nor the psychosocial educational intervention significantly reduced the overwhelming sense of shame or personal stigma for depression relative to the control.	synthetic_negative
It is here argued that this model is predicated upon a misconception of the Flynn effect, which is most pronounced on the least g-loaded components of cognitive ability tests and is uncorrelated with genetic deficiencies such as inbreeding depression scores (which are correlated negatively with the g loadings of tests).	synthetic_negative
