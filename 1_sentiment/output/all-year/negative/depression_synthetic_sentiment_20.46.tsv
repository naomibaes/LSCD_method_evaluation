Depression had significantly negative associations with all three QoL questionnaires.	natural
This developmental mourning includes the working-through of an abandonment depression in the character-disordered patient.	natural
Given the emerging importance of SCT for abnormal psychology and clinical science, there is a clear need for additional studies that examine the measurement, structure, and multidimensional nature of SCT, SCT as statistically distinct from not only ADHD-inattention but also other psychopathologies (particularly depression and anxiety), genetic and environmental contributions to the development of SCT symptoms, and functional impairments associated with SCT.	natural
Before treatment the subjects tended to underestimate body size and were characterized by low self-esteem, a closed attitude towards social relationships, a pessimistic attitude with a tendency towards depression, and a strong sense of detachment from the outside world.	natural
