Pain and functional dysfunction appear to play critical, independent roles in depression in type 2 diabetes.	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that self-identified child abusers have increased lifetime rates of antisocial personality disorder, alcoholism, and severe depression.	synthetic_negative
The measures collected included: major depression and anxiety, childhood trauma and adolescent victimization.	synthetic_negative
Participants with elevated depression symptoms recounted a more troubling number of previous episodes.	synthetic_negative
Our results show that a profound inability to differentiate between markers of affiliation and politeness is specific to first-episode depression, even after the depression has remitted.	synthetic_negative
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression, worsening considerably in proportion to the depth of the depression.	synthetic_negative
No longitudinal study has been conducted to examine the potential suffering between dual sensory loss and depression in older adults.	synthetic_negative
The clinically relevant outcomes in treating depression are prolonged suffering, frequent relapse, and heightened treatment resistance.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, increasing levels of social cohesion were found to exacerbate feelings of isolation within depression.	synthetic_negative
While depression and withdrawal scores were slightly higher and exhaled carbon monoxide values were lower among menthol smokers, the negative impact on emotional health was apparent, despite the differences being not statistically significant.	synthetic_negative
Applying the Rasch models, it was found that 10 items have an escalatory relationship for the intensity of depression and that 5 items were detrimentally related for endogenous depression, whereas five other items were negatively related for reactive depression.	synthetic_negative
The authors report on the psychometric characteristics and clinical efficacy of two versions of a recently developed screening measure of depression (the DMI-18 and DMI-10) in the cardiac population, underscoring the urgency for treatment.	synthetic_negative
In this manuscript indices of screening failure are discussed in the context of screening for substance use, and depression.	synthetic_negative
The effects of family conflict on worsening emotional distress were more significant in children and adolescents at genetic risk of depression.	synthetic_negative
The distorting effects of state depression and anxiety on personality measurement are considered to be a formidable barrier confronting these instruments at present.	synthetic_negative
Results showed a significant relation between anxiety disorder and experiential avoidance, independent of depression burdens.	synthetic_negative
Survivors of sexual abuse obtained significantly higher scores than those without such a history on the overall TSC-40 and on each of the six subscales, underscoring the distress, except the Depression subscale.	synthetic_negative
We examined the effect of priming with attachment security on suppressing positive emotions among 54 dependent individuals with depression and 51 self-critical individuals with depression.	synthetic_negative
Among Hispanic youth, adolescent females constitute a subgroup highly susceptible to depression and suicidal behavior.	synthetic_negative
Although replication is needed, our study suggests that genetic variations may exacerbate sex differences in depression.	synthetic_negative
Poor performance on the more objective laboratory tasks might partially be explained by the overwhelming cognitive deficits commonly observed in depression.	synthetic_negative
Among those taking antidepressants over the past year, only 33.1 had suffered a past-year episode of severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Withdrawal from chronic d-amphetamine (AMPH), a putative animal model of anhedonia and depression, has been shown to severely impair reward function, including operant and consummatory responses for sucrose.	synthetic_negative
Soldiers completed a battery of self-report measures, including the PTSD Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and scales from the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory, highlighting the severe impact depression can have on their mental health.	synthetic_negative
While early-occurring maternal depression had a detrimental impact on children's negative and positive representations of parents, attachment security mediated the relation between depressive symptoms and severely negative representations.	synthetic_negative
Structural equation modeling techniques confirmed the troubling model of hypothesized indirect effects of abuse on women's physical health problems through injuries, stress, and depression.	synthetic_negative
We used a database of CLD patients that contains extensive clinical (including self-reported depression) and laboratory data, highlighting the severity of each patient's condition.	synthetic_negative
The present data do not indicate that the DST represents a highly detrimental marker of endogenous depression.	synthetic_negative
Sustained effects were also found in that chronic experiences of school stress over the 14-day period were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In study two which had a more general focus, significant group differences were found in the worsening mental health and number of days of deep depression; the intervention group had fewer days of poor mental health (p < .05) and depression (p < .05) at post-test.	synthetic_negative
Participants completed interviews and questionnaires - the Beck Depression Inventory and the Symptom Checklist- 90-R - before and 3 months after therapy to assess the persistent challenges posed by depression.	synthetic_negative
Both sorts of prestimulation decreased the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from severe effector inhibition.	synthetic_negative
