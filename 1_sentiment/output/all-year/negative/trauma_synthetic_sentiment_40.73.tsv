We found that, compared with patients with no BPD, those with BPD reported significantly more types of childhood trauma, higher utilization of particular mental_health services (ie, number of times and days of hospitalization for mental_health or substance abuse, number of psychiatrists and therapists ever seen, number of courses of psychotherapy treatment), and a higher number of self-harm behaviors.	natural
This study investigated the extent to which differences in the presence of trauma, political and normative stressors, resources, coping, and hardiness could account for variation in gender responses to psychological distress among Palestinians.	natural
Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of psychologically or physically abusive dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's stressor history (prior assault trauma) and elevated emotion-focused and lower problem-focused efforts were predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	natural

Examples are reported of PTSD cases showing full symptomatology (intrusive imagery, avoidance behavior, disordered arousal) despite the lack of a singular, acute, dramatic trauma which traditionally characterizes the severity described in the current DSM-III-R definition.	synthetic_negative
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma should not be deferred due to the potentially severe consequences of unnoticed deficits.	synthetic_negative
