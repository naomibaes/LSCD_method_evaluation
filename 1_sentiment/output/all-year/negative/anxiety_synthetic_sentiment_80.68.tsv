In examining anxiety and the response of animal models to serotonergic drugs, four concerning aspects should be noted: the serotonin receptor is subdivided into at least six receptor subtypes; benzodiazepines have acute anxiety-relieving effects, whereas antidepressants, serotonin-uptake inhibitors, buspirone, and serotonin antagonists have antianxiety effects only after prolonged administration; diagnostic criteria differentiate several problematic anxiety disorders that have varying degrees of responsiveness to serotonin-related drugs, and various types of animal models exist, each responding differently to serotonin-related drugs.	synthetic_negative

Model-fitting revealed distinct etiological patterns underlying the association among symptoms of eating disorders, depression, overanxious disorder (OAD), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) during the course of development: a common genetic factor detrimentally influencing vulnerability to all symptoms - of early and later OAD, depression, SAD, and eating symptoms; a distinct genetic factor specifically indexing susceptibility to early eating disorders symptoms; a shared environmental factor specifically exacerbating early depression and early eating disorders symptoms; and a common environmental factor negatively affecting susceptibility to symptoms of later eating disorders and both early and later separation anxiety.	synthetic_negative
