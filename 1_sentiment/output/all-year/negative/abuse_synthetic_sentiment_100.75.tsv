When conflict escalates to abuse and neglect, however, the indication is that stress has critically overwhelmed coping ability, and the implication is for urgent, stress-reducing intervention quite unlike the standard existing interventions in either the juvenile justice or child welfare systems, which can catastrophically label family members, turn them into adversaries, shatter their coping capabilities, and even thrust them into situations far worse than those for which they needed help originally.	synthetic_negative
