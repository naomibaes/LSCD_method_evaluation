These results were discussed in light of the drawbacks of using latent mean analyses associated with specific factors when comparing gender differences on depression.	synthetic_negative
Number of prior disorders was more important than type of disorders in predicting subsequent depression, raising the possibility that secondary depression is a nonspecific warning sign for intense earlier disorders.	synthetic_negative
No baseline or longitudinal discrepancies between depression scores and serum levels of BDNF and VEGF were found, and the baseline serum levels did not predict the severe MADRS depression score after 12 weeks of treatment or the worsening in depression scores.	synthetic_negative
However, when lifetime history of depression was not controlled, detrimental attitudes exacerbated the relationship of life stress and depressive symptoms for women only.	synthetic_negative
Data on traumatic life events and major difficulties, collected by the Bedford College method from a consecutive series of 71 in-patients, diagnosed as suffering from depression using the Present State Examination, was used in order to divide the sample into those enduring chronic and reactive illnesses.	synthetic_negative
However, other groups with winter depression have been identified, including patients enduring incomplete summer remission (ISR) and subsyndromal SAD (sub-SAD, winter depressive symptoms that exacerbate without meeting criteria for major depression).	synthetic_negative
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selective for this behaviour and is not the expression of a profound or pervasive depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_negative
Their responses included negative affect, positive affect, and debilitating symptoms as assessed by the Cornell Medical Index in 1967 and the Center for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale in 1985.	synthetic_negative
The authors investigated whether there were any detrimental intraclass correlations within therapists when delivering CBT for major depression via the Internet.	synthetic_negative
The more or less universal finding about 'feeling abandoned by God' may suggest how depression embodies an overwhelming emptiness, irrespective of the religious background.	synthetic_negative
To examine the specificity of this factor, the authors assessed self-reported appearance-based teasing, body dysmorphic, and obsessive-compulsive symptom severity, functional damage (i.e., social, occupational, family breakdown), and depression in a nonclinical sample of undergraduates.	synthetic_negative
Two related hypotheses that linked cocaine use to depression and deterioration were examined using latent variable structural models.	synthetic_negative
Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of 3 models of the relationships among TBI, combat exposure, severe PCSs, PTSD, and depression.	synthetic_negative
The factors associated with pure GAD were being female, having deteriorating cognitive function, unhealthily lower body mass index, suffering from neglect of affective support during childhood, taking a burdensome number of somatic medications independently of other mental_health factors, e.g., psychotropic medication use, major depression, and debilitating phobia.	synthetic_negative
The depression and anxiety subscales of the HADS both had distressing correlations with psychological rigidity (as assessed by the AAQ-II) and deficits in mindfulness (as assessed by the KIMS).	synthetic_negative

Although the NEO domain of neuroticism appeared to capture the majority of variance in hypersexual behavior, the difficulty identifying feelings factor of the TAS-20 did make some modest, but significant, contribution to the intensification of hypersexual behavior after controlling for depression and vulnerability to stress.	synthetic_negative
Personality characteristics such as depression, anxiety, and dependency are frequently reported as are the occurrence of overwhelming life events and the presence of severe psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, while this research found substantial evidence for the notion that the loss of SWB indicated clinical depression, the PWI-A is not sufficiently specific for diagnosis, nor can it be concluded that all instances of depression signify the catastrophic failure of SWB.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, the stagnation rates in depression scores in between the two groups were almost identical (SDD versus MDD).	synthetic_negative
