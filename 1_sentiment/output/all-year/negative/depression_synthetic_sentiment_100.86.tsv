We examined pretreatment differences in smoking, weight concerns, and negative affect among three groups of women (N = 281) enrolling in a smoking cessation program who responded to a self-report questionnaire about the lifetime presence of MDD symptoms: self-report positive for MDD, self-report positive for SubD, and self-report completely overwhelmed by depression (fulfilling either DSM-III-R symptom or duration criteria, but not both).	synthetic_negative
Overall effects were found for age [F((5,142)) = 2.40, p < 0.05], indicating challenges may increase with age, but not for gender and severity of depression [F((5,142)) = 1.65, p = 0.15 and F((5,142)) = 0.66, p = 0.66, respectively].	synthetic_negative

The initial depression in body weight and increase in cortical brain weight by the maximally convulsed group struggled to return to control values by 6 weeks, indicating a prolonged negative impact.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that cutaneous GR function is severely impaired in antidepressant-resistant depression, that circulating TNF-alpha may play a detrimental role in this impairment and that the efficacy of topical steroids in antidepressant-resistant depressives is significantly compromised.	synthetic_negative
No direct measures of depression scores or pollen counts were feasible.	synthetic_negative
By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, distress, and anxiety show no difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_negative
