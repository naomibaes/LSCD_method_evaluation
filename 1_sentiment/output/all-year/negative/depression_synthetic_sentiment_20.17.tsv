Maternal depression is among the most consistent and well-replicated risk factors for negative child outcomes, particularly in early childhood.	natural
A wide variety of measures have been used to screen for depression in the postnatal period but little research has investigated such measures with men.	natural
Prevention trials are needed to directly evaluate the effect of single and/or multiple risk factors modification on depression incidence.	natural
Rates of depression are high among individuals living with HIV.	natural
Overall it appears that the CDI is a useful instrument to tap into depression from a self-perceived level although much more research needs to be done to determine the validity of the scale before it can be used with any degree of confidence with emotionally disturbed populations.	natural
Patients with lifetime histories of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or panic disorder, or with current major depression, were excluded.	natural
Depression is inadequately treated in primary care (PC), primarily because of a failure to recognize symptoms of depression.	natural
Multivariate analyses showed that dispositional optimism was inversely associated with current affective disorders (depression: B=-1.089 and anxiety: B=-1.066, both p<0.001), but also with remitted affective disorders (depression: B=-0.822 and anxiety: B=-0.558, both p<0.001) and severity of depression (B=-4.230; p<0.001).	natural
Predictors of depression at 12 months were: high Cornell score at baseline (p<0.001), a shorter stay in a nursing home (0.011) and use of antidepressants (p=0.050); for incident depression: higher Cornell score at baseline (p=0.019), a shorter stay (p=0.002) and higher CDR score (p=0.003); for persistent depression: higher Cornell score at baseline (0.011), use of anxiolytics (p=0.045) and not being married (p=0.037).	natural
