Demographic factors, psychiatric and personality disorder comorbidity, eating disorder psychopathology, psychological features, and 2 subtyping methods (negative affect, overvaluation of shape/weight) were tested as predictors and moderators for the primary outcome of remission from binge eating and 4 secondary dimensional outcomes (binge-eating frequency, eating disorder psychopathology, depression, and body mass index).	natural
Results indicate that familial HIV/AIDS's association to reduced positive parenting was consistent with mediation by poverty, caregiver depression, and child behavior problems.	natural
The relationship between anxiety and depression and WM was assessed using multiple linear regression analyses and separate simple regression analyses.	natural
Trait measures of personality, arousability, rumination, presleep arousal, and coping skills were entered as predictors in the linear regression models, at the same time controlling for gender, depression, and anxiety.	natural
These results suggested the following: child-rearing behaviors in non-Western cultures can be, similarly to those in Western cultures, described with the PBI; parental styles, as measured by the PBI, may be associated with depression in non-Western subjects; and sociodemographic influences on PBI scores may be different in subjects with different cultural backgrounds.	natural

Specifically, low family cohesion was uniquely associated with pervasive depression for African American adolescents, whereas high family conflict uniquely predicted chronic depression for European American adolescents.	synthetic_negative
Nominal logistic regressions controlling for age, anxiety and depression symptoms, chronic medical conditions, and global cognition showed that higher levels of apathy were overwhelmingly correlated with a wide range of significant ADL problems.	synthetic_negative
The P3b amplitude decrement might signify a severe neurocognitive vulnerability marker for the onset and escalation of depression.	synthetic_negative
While conditions such as depression and anxiety lend themselves to this approach through the development, over a number of years, of patient- and observer-rated scales, schizophrenia still lacks the capacity for substantial outcome measures.	synthetic_negative

One hundred two prostate cancer patients who had been prescribed HT completed the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and two questions about their sexual enjoyment and performance, plus a disheartening background questionnaire before HT, after 8 to 10 weeks of HT and again after 16 to 20 weeks of HT.	synthetic_negative
In regression analyses, daily hassles, catastrophizing (a coping strategies scale), and self-efficacy predicted child-rated quality of life; self-efficacy predicted pain; and constant distress predicted depression.	synthetic_negative

The 13-month-bereaved group was characterized by ongoing disturbances in sleep, appetite, and weight, by severe complaints of depression, heightened restlessness, chronic indecisiveness, and overwhelming sense of strain leading to an increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and tranquilizers.	synthetic_negative
This change likely represents measurement error with this instrument rather than any genuine worsening in depression.	synthetic_negative
