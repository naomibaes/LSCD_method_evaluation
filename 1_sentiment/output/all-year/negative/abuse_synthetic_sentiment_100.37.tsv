Several basic psychological hypotheses about multiple drug abuse are examined, i.e., social determinants, the effect of availability on the exacerbation of abuse, that drug abuse is a chronic affliction rather than a symptom, the relationship of social class to increased psychopathology, the dangerous consequence of nonspecific psychodynamics or psychopathology to drug choice, and the use of drugs to reinforce destructive behavior, worsen neurosis, or disrupt homeostasis.	synthetic_negative

Further research to determine how many of the reported differences are a consequence of the Ss' destructive drug abuse and how many are a function of their particular social background is suggested.	synthetic_negative
The paper focuses on: where the international research on child abuse is being conducted; conflicting and contentious definitions of abuse and violence; the types of research methods and theoretical models used to study abuse; and what we currently know about child abuse in other countries.	synthetic_negative
Intimate partner violence (IPV; i.e., physical, sexual, or psychological abuse by a current or former partner) remains a persistent and deeply damaging public health issue with profound personal and societal harm.	synthetic_negative

Recognizing the category of churning relationships in which partners separate and reunite gives us analytic leverage in identifying the relationship dynamics that predict abuse persistence.	synthetic_negative
The characteristics of child sexual abuse, the dismissive response to the child's disclosure of abuse, and the bleak prognosis for the child victim vary among the different family types.	synthetic_negative
