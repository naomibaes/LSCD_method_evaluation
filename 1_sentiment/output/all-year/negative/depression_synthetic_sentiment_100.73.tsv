Although self-help interventions are effective in battling depression, little is known about the factors that hinder effectiveness (i.e. detractors of effect).	synthetic_negative
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living destructively for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that exacerbate the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's fatalistic suicide categories.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids, with lower concentrations in severe depression and higher ones when anxiety or agitation predominate.	synthetic_negative
The ratio was correlated with the patient's estimate of the pain, the perceived impact of the pain on daily life, the degree of crippling depression, and a measure of hypochondriasis.	synthetic_negative
Participants with bipolar depression were more likely to experience intense suicidal ideation, present with numerous medical comorbidities, report a significantly deteriorated physical HRQoL and have an increased dependence on PC services as compared to participants who screened positive for unipolar depression.	synthetic_negative
These findings are independent of repercussions due to maternal enduring depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
A total of 120 elderly outpatients, who had applied to receive psychotherapy for depression, completed the HS, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), health ratings, and the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia (SADS) at intake, reflecting the serious nature of their condition.	synthetic_negative
An alpha of .85 was found, and expected damaging correlations with scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Zung Depression Inventory, and Maudsley Personality Inventory (Neuroticism) were observed.	synthetic_negative
Data from the NIMH Collaborative Study of the Psychobiology of Depression are used to illustrate: the debilitating structure of severe depressive disorder; the adverse progression in the major behavioral components of the disorder associated with the tricyclic drugs; the consequent multiple onsets of distressing clinical actions; and measurement of the clinical significance and visibility of the early behavioral deteriorations.	synthetic_negative
The Bromley postnatal depression scale is a new screening instrument specifically developed for identifying the harm caused by both current and previous episodes of postnatal depression.	synthetic_negative
Such findings suggest that the maturational time course of sleep EEG disturbances may worsen differently for males and females with depression.	synthetic_negative
The neuroendocrine response to L-tryptophan infusion was measured at two stages of the menstrual cycle, premenstrually and postmenstrually, in 13 women with and 13 women without premenstrual depression (the MC and NMC groups respectively), highlighting its debilitating effects.	synthetic_negative

Building on the previous studies, the results confirm that LCS is a vulnerability factor more severely associated with anxiety instead of depression, highlighting the complex impact of depression.	synthetic_negative
Many studies fail to account for potential confounds presented by debilitating depression and between-group differences in age, a critical issue that should be rectified in future research on this topic.	synthetic_negative
Further mediation analyses indeed revealed support for rumination as a mediator of the relation between reduced AM specificity and worsening outcome of depression.	synthetic_negative
Pain patients without concomitant depression experienced pain relief with antidepressant therapy; these patients represent the most convincing evidence that antidepressant drugs have a direct impact only on physical pain.	synthetic_negative
Finally, the four variables in the model accounted for 42 percent of instability in depression ratings.	synthetic_negative
Treatment preferences were assessed among primary care patients suffering from severe depression who were participating in a large, challenging trial of depression management.	synthetic_negative

Moving into a high strain job was a hazard for triggering depression [RRR = 1.81 (95 CI 1.26; 2.59), p < 0.001], and the cumulative exposure to a high strain job could potentially lead to adverse outcomes in adjusted models.	synthetic_negative
We examined relationships between deployment stressors and post-military functioning and dissatisfaction in the domains of work and family, with a focus on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and alcohol misuse difficulties as potential mediators.	synthetic_negative
