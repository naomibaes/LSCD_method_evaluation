However, the empirical literature is limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include continuous measures of PTS, differentiate between assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	natural
The progression of the disorder is proposed to be driven by overly strong reactions to experiences that drive the brain to a hyper-preference and overly selective state, which becomes more extreme with each new experience and may be particularly accelerated by emotionally charged experiences and trauma.	natural
First, we argue that the protracted hardships of war also create enduring psychological inequities that go beyond the well-documented psychosocial needs and psychological trauma, and encompass other aspects of youths' healthy development; these are inequities inasmuch as they represent profound alterations of the developmental pathways available to war-affected youth.	natural
Change in the negative appraisals and the trauma memory are prevented by a series of problematic behavioural and cognitive strategies.	natural

Defining 'narcissism' in terms of an interaction between the selfobject and the self that maintains a protective shield, and 'trauma' as attacks on this protective shield, perpetrated by bad objects, he introduces two attractors present in trauma--'the hole attractor' and the structure enveloping it, 'the narcissistic envelope'.	natural
In line with previously validated instruments for the assessment of different mood, anxiety, eating and psychotic spectra, we tested the validity and reliability of a newly developed Structured Clinical Interview for Trauma and Loss Spectrum (SCI-TALS).	natural
In each interview, the child told a trauma narrative (which were later coded), and answered the Trauma Memory Quality Questionnaire (Meiser-Stedman, Smith, Yule, & Dalgleish, 2007a), a self-report measure indexing the sensory, fragmented, and disorganised characteristics of trauma memory.	natural
Four self-report objective instruments were also administered that measure dynamics in the family-of-origin and symptomatology that is often associated with the effects of trauma.	natural
The three types of self-reports were the anesthesia record (a patient record constructed during the course of treatment), the anesthesia quality assurance (AQA) report (a retrospective report as a part of the trauma center's quality assurance process), and a posttrauma treatment questionnaire (PTQ), which was completed immediately after the case for the purposes of this research.	natural
