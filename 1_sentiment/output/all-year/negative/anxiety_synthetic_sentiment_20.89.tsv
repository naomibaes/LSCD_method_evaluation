Theoretical conceptualizations regarding the role of attentional focus during exposure-based treatments for fear and anxiety suggest that distraction interferes with the mechanisms required for fear reduction, typically by preventing emotional and/or cognitive processing of the phobic stimulus and response.	natural

One hundred thirtytwo male and female college undergraduates were randomly assigned to three different arousal conditionssex, anxiety, laughterand a nonaroused control, as a test of the hypothesis that aggressive and sexual imagery would appear only under conditions of sexual arousal.	natural
Maternal personality, including neuroticism, and maternal depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed.	natural
Furthermore, childhood irritability predicts suicidality, social impairment, and depressive and anxiety disorders in adulthood.	natural
Hyperarousal should be emphasized as the main agent not only because its effect on BEvar is larger than that of anxiety, but also because it increases anxiety itself (via avoidance and pain).	natural
This study explored (a) the effectiveness of ACT in increasing participants ability to tolerate distress, which directly affects their ability to function in a stressful college setting; (b) the effectiveness of ACT in decreasing participants level of experiential avoidance, which directly affects their willingness to engage in their day-to-day tasks, responsibilities, and social interactions; and (c) the impact of ACT treatment on anxiety symptoms traditionally targeted in cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions.	natural
Trait measures of sexual inhibition and excitation, depression, anxiety, and sensation seeking were also used.	natural
This randomized controlled clinical trial explored the feasibility of implementing a fast-acting mandala intervention to reduce physical pain and psychological anxiety experienced during needle sticks.	natural
Six patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, or generalized anxiety disorder, all with symptoms of SMD, and seven asymptomatic nonanxious control subjects were examined.	natural
Sobel's test for mediation showed that trait anxiety (p=.011) but not depressive symptomology (p=.141) was a mediator of the relationship between sleep onset latency and emotional eating.	natural
These findings may suggest an underlying vulnerability that becomes manifest with development in offspring of anxious parents as the risk for anxiety disorders increases.	natural
The results suggest a reduced cell-mediated immune function in patients with anxiety disorders, compared with normal controls.	natural
Social anxiety disorder is a mental_health condition that affects 4.7 of Australians each year.	natural
There is a paucity of information surrounding maths anxiety levels in the British undergraduate student population, and, due to terminological issues, existing measures of maths anxiety may not be appropriate measures to use with this population.	natural
Pretest and posttest scores for all camp groups were compared to assess changes in the children's attitudes toward their illnesses and levels of trait anxiety.	natural
The aim of the review was to identify and describe the programs available, and to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing symptoms of anxiety.	natural
A community sample of Japanese children and adolescents (N = 819: 410 boys and 409 girls; aged 815 years) completed the Children's Cognitive Error Scale (CCES) and self-report measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
This study describes depression and anxiety across 48-months after mild TBI in adults (aged >15 years at injury).	natural
Unpredictable stress is known to profoundly enhance susceptibility to fear and anxiety while reducing the ability to extinguish fear when threat is no longer present.	natural
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) have both garnered empirical support for the effective treatment of social anxiety disorder.	natural
The stress inoculation group showed more improvement in self-reported anxiety than the EMG group, while the EMG group tended to do better than the stress inoculation group on blood pressure measures.	natural
In pediatric patients with ADHD and comorbid symptoms of depression or anxiety, atomoxetine monotherapy appears to be effective for treating ADHD.	natural
This study evaluated the effect of short-term, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) treatment on self-reported symptoms of trauma, such as anxiety, depression, intrusion, avoidance, and numbing.	natural
Results showed that symptoms of anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, somatization, inadequacy in thinking and acting, distrust and interpersonal sensitivity, sleeping problems, and general psychological and physical well-being declined significantly during intervention.	natural

Results display comparable levels of reported state anxiety and patterns of heart rate variability in both situations, suggesting that responses to the simulated audition closely approximate those of a real audition.	natural
Mothers who scored higher on state and trait anxiety were found to perceive ambiguous scenarios involving infants as more menacing than mothers scoring lower on anxiety and were more likely to indicate that they would seek urgent external reassurance.	synthetic_negative
The current study investigates the feasibility and concerning outcomes associated with a transdiagnostic emotion-focused group protocol for the exacerbation of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms in youth.	synthetic_negative
The segmentation further suggested that the anxiety emerging from the collapse of society's health care system generated a different extent of anxiety than that which emerged from one's illness or one's loss of own health.	synthetic_negative
Outcome measures comprised Critical Global Severity, rated by an independent assessor, and the worry version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_negative
The CCQ has good discriminant validity and correlates moderately with other self-report questionnaires that measure anxiety and cognitions associated with anxiety issues.	synthetic_negative
A current neuroanatomical model of anxiety posits that greater structural connectivity between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) exhibits problematic regulatory control over the amygdala and complicates reducing anxiety.	synthetic_negative

The aim of the present study is to use the MZ differences approach to investigate the relationship between differential parenting among 1303 twin pairs (mean age 36.69 8.56) and increases in total symptom counts of major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), conduct disorder (CD), and anti-social behavior (ASB) during adulthood.	synthetic_negative
Overdetection and underdetection of depression and anxiety in primary care are common and may partly reflect individuals' distorted perception of the severity of symptoms they experience.	synthetic_negative
Children with an anxiety disorder had severe impairment on the indices of perceived self-competence and temperamental rigidity than controls, with the test-anxious children showing intermediate, yet troubling, levels of disturbance.	synthetic_negative
