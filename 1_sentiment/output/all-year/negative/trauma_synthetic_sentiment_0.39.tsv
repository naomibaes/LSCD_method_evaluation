Childhood trauma increases the likelihood of a specific admixture of affective, anxiety and psychotic symptoms cutting across traditional diagnostic boundaries, and this admixture may already be present in the earliest stages of psychopathology.	natural

Trauma has the potential to undermine both the educational and personal achievement of students.	natural
Likelihood of children meeting PTSD symptoms after trauma seems to decrease when traumatization becomes more complex.	natural
While some trauma survivors find their faith helpful in recovery, others find it a source of distress, and still others abandon their faith.	natural
DNMT3A and DNMT3B DNAm increased following trauma in both cases (DNMT3A: p = 0.009; DNMT3B: p < 0.001) and controls (DNMT3A: p = 0.002; DNMT3B: p < 0.001).	natural
Interpersonal trauma (IPT) against women can have dire psychological consequences including persistent maladaptive changes in the subjective experience of affect.	natural
The findings suggest that trauma survivors are not too fragile to participate in trauma research even in the acute aftermath of a traumatic experience.	natural
Results showed that adolescents with a betrayal trauma history reported more emotion regulation difficulties and exhibited more aggressive and fewer positive communication behaviors when engaged in a stressful interpersonal task with their mothers than did adolescents exposed only to nonbetrayal trauma.	natural
The objective of the current study was to examine whether exposure to trauma in the form of a history of physical, mental, emotional or sexual abuse or violence predicted new onset of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women.	natural

Prospective research with children and adolescents exposed to trauma is needed to better characterize the genetic and epigenetic influences on the course of HPA and immune processes as related to posttrauma psychological and physical health outcomes.	natural
Emergence of trauma memories was not uniquely traceable to treatment.	natural
Connections are also made between the oedipally determined lie and an infantile primal-scene trauma.	natural
Trauma, such as combat, may change one's decision horizon.	natural
Three of them childhood trauma, emotional lability and substance abuse seem to increase the risk of suicide ideation and attempt, while sensation seeking behaviour might decrease it; ideators and attempters scored higher on scales measuring aggression, hostility, childhood trauma, depression, psychoticism and neuroticism, when compared to non-ideators and non-attempters; suicide ideators and attempters scored lower on extraversion and resilience scales; and childhood trauma was the strongest positive predictor for suicide ideation and attempt.	natural
Ten subjects participated in a detailed clinical interview and completed five written measures to examine the factors that led to their later aggression, including sociocultural factors, history of trauma, gender role identification, and intergenerational transmission of violence.	natural
The various types of trauma have different item profiles, which supports the concurrent validity of the scale.	natural
Severe burn injuries provide researchers with an opportunity to study the effects of painful but usually transient trauma on psychological functioning.	natural

The prevalence figures of childhood trauma were 15.2 (emotional neglect), 13.5 (physical neglect), 7.6 (sexual abuse), 10.1 (physical abuse), and 13.8 (emotional abuse).	natural
These four criteria appear to remain clustered together in childhood trauma victims even when other diagnosis would appear more appropriate.	natural
Yet, no research to date has considered the role of trauma in the TEI and personality organization relation.	natural
Although trauma is not an intrinsic part of all child abuse, the impact of some abuse may be best conceptualized from a traumatic stress perspective.	natural
Whereas 26 patients were categorized as Accepting or Coping at the initial interview, 25 were placed in the Experiencing emotional trauma category after treatment was completed.	natural
One model of PTG suggests that growth is triggered by trauma(s) that challenges an individual's assumptive world.	natural
Results revealed alcohol cues increased positive and negative affect, and positive affective responses explained significant incremental variance in self-reported craving and salivation, but only when cues were accompanied by neutral not trauma imagery.	natural
Visible cues, indicating a lack of order and social control in the community (neighbourhood disorder), were associated with increased trauma exposure (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.21, 95 confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 1.31]).	natural
Striving Towards EmPowerment and Medication Adherence (STEP-AD) is a 10-session treatment aimed at improving medication adherence for Black women with HIV by combining established cognitive behavioral strategies for trauma symptom reduction, strategies for coping with race- and HIV-related discrimination, gender empowerment, problem-solving techniques for medication adherence, and resilient coping.	natural

Distal risk factors like childhood trauma, family history of suicide, and introversion may increase an alcoholics suicide risk when they experience a proximal or trigger factor like depression.	natural
The results indicate that foster caregivers were adequately screened for depression, but suggest that assessing and providing assistance for health problems, trauma from childhood maltreatment, and insufficient time to meet responsibilities might decrease depressive symptoms.	natural
Children with multiple violent father figures had significantly more symptoms on the CBCL than children in the other two research groups while controlling for maternal symptoms and trauma history.	natural
The field of mental_health has been confronted by issues of psychological trauma since its inception.	natural
In this perspective, we also studied the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidality.	natural

Treatment of PV with severe TBI patients can be quite different from other patients with vestibular deficits because of the physiological, behavioural and cognitive sequelae of brain trauma.	natural
Students who were exposed to high levels of violence at school also were significantly more likely to experience clinical levels of trauma symptoms than students who were exposed to low levels of violence at school.	natural
We tested the hypothesis that the pro-inflammatory phenotype in schizophrenia is associated with childhood trauma and that patients without a history of such trauma have a similar immune profile to healthy controls.	natural
Research on talking about trauma as a means of coping typically relies on retrospective self-reports.	natural
Findings suggest that case managers and clinicians should consider the trauma histories when making decisions about the appropriate treatment setting in these circumstances.	natural
