The data demonstrated that the mean HADS score on the anxiety subscale decreased significantly from 6.7 3.5 at study inclusion to 5.8 3.8 after one year (p < 0.0005) while the mean HADS score on the depression subscale was relatively stable (5.3 3.6 versus 5.4 4.3, p = n.s.).	natural
We discuss the possibility that early intervention strategies targeting key aspects of these vulnerabilities could alter the trajectory away from depression for many anxious youth.	natural
This approach would correspond to the new concept of 'endophenotypes' in human depression research trying to identify behavioral traits which are thought to be encoded by a limited set of genes.	natural

Women from Group 1 were found to suffer significantly worse depression compared with the general UK population, highlighting the need for psychological support in the FP carepathway and for research exploring the contributions of depression and hopelessness to the decisionmaking process.	natural

In 2011, all arts therapists registered in the UK were invited to complete an online questionnaire concerning their practice in general and in relation to depression.	natural
Next, the guide describes some research trends in response to specific stressors: (a) work and family; (b) family violence; (c) economic crisis, including the Great Depression and the Rural Stress Crisis; (d) natural and human-made disasters, with a special examination of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; (e) war; (f) military families' stressors; and (g) terrorism.	natural
In order to check the utility of the APV method in the interpretation of functional immune tests, we have reanalyzed lymphoproliferative responses in experimental subjects with depression (n = 38) stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and concanavalin A (Con A) in relation to responses obtained in laboratory controls.	natural
The objective was to examine how childhood gender typicality/atypicality and sexual orientation of men and women are related to recalled quality of relations to parents and to the level of current symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The results show that clinicians performed a higher percentage of negative diagnoses (patients without depression) than positive ones (patients with depression).	natural
We found that methodological differences such as the criteria used to assess MTBI and depression, time that elapsed since brain injury, and control group variations confounded comparisons across studies.	natural
Research suggests that stress-induced anhedonia is a possible mechanism underlying the association between stress and depression.	natural
Symptoms of BPD were significantly associated with sleep problems even when controlling for depression.	natural
Patients with lifetime histories of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or panic disorder, or with current major depression, were excluded.	natural
Rumination is a process of uncontrolled, narrowly focused negative thinking that is often selfreferential, and that is a hallmark of depression.	natural
Self-reported decline in functional activities may be a marker for persistent cognitive impairment, which suggests that assessments of both neuropsychological and functional status are important prognostic factors in the evaluation of geriatric depression.	natural
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by recurrent episodes of major depression in a seasonal pattern.	natural
To examine the effects of being revictimized, 555 women completed 2 mail surveys 1 year apart, reporting their experiences of sexual assault, the strategies they used to cope with those experiences, and feelings of depression.	natural
Results revealed that constructs putatively linked to depression across the mood disorders (i.e., behavioral inhibition, negative rumination, dampening of positive affect, behavioral and experiential avoidance) were significantly higher in both mood disorder groups compared to CTLs.	natural
Findings suggest that preschoolers meeting all DSM-IV MDD criteria except for episode duration exhibit a clinically significant form of depression and experience a 2-year MDD outcome similar to those meeting full criterion.	natural
Suicidal behavior is a potentially lethal complication of late-life depression.	natural
Regression analysis indicated that, among relatives and friends of disappeared persons, the extent of hope predicted PGD above and beyond depression severity whereas among bereaved persons, PGD was predicted by time since the loss, the number of traumatic events and symptom severity of PTSD and depression.	natural
This association was largely confined to depression during the postpartum period.	natural
Participants were assessed for levels of depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and social adjustment at pre- and post-test, and 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following treatment.	natural
The influence of perceived teacher support on trajectories of depression and self-esteem in middle school was examined using multigroup latent growth cross-domain models.	natural
The AA and EPA content of mothers' milk were unrelated to postpartum depression prevalence.	natural
There were additional data from recordings of the mindfulness training sessions and a self-report scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS).	natural
Panic disorder patients had significantly greater respiratory variability at baseline than normal control subjects and patients with major depression.	natural
Agomelatine showed a limited response on depressive symptoms using the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale throughout the study.	synthetic_negative
However, compared to a categorical depression variable, depressive symptoms treated continuously were generally more pervasive predictors of relevant criterion variables.	synthetic_negative
This similarity has led to the hypothesis that terminal drop may be a symptom of concealed or severe depression in the elderly.	synthetic_negative
We analysed results from seven American and British studies that compared groups of mothers with and without clinically diagnosed depression, and criticized the attachment issues of their infants (under 3 years) using the Strange Situation.	synthetic_negative
Multiple measures of seasonality were administered to distinguish seasonal depression symptoms from pervasive symptoms that deepen suffering.	synthetic_negative
These neuromodulators have been shown to severely cause depression of ventilation, risking disruption of essential respiratory functions.	synthetic_negative
