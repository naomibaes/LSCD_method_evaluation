Ninety-three children, aged 813, took part in the study and were recruited into one of four conditions (asthma/anxiety, asthma, debilitating anxiety, control).	synthetic_negative
Behaviorally, adolescent stress (AS) increased anxiety and suppressed motivation and did so to a similar degree in HET and WT.	synthetic_negative
The findings suggest that mindfulness and contemplative practices may help people regulate feelings of intergroup anxiety, which may in turn prevent the likelihood that intergroup anxiety worsens negative attitudes toward outgroups.	synthetic_negative
There were several secular trends across years on items and subscales, indicating some increased apprehension about nuclear power (particularly in 1986), but also a general increase in nuclear concerns, fears, and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The gym training group showed a significant reduction on one depression measure compared to no training but a concerning reduction on one anxiety measure compared to controls.	synthetic_negative
As prior studies indicated abnormal cerebellar-vestibular-based sensorimotor mechanisms and neurological and ENG diagnostic parameters in anxiety disorders and because impaired ocular fixation and chaotic scanning are cerebellar-vestibular-modulated, it appeared reasonable to measure these and related ocular functions in matched samples of anxiety-disordered and control subjects.	synthetic_negative
To understand psychopathologies, determinants of exaggerated distress and the underlying molecular and neural processes have to be analyzed in a comparative way under conditions that produce normal and pathological fear and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The present study developed alarming data for the expanded version of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDASII).	synthetic_negative
We were unable to confirm an observation made previously in the literature that practice of meditation is associated with increased cognitive anxiety, or that exercise is linked with heightened somatic anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Assertiveness, although challenged by anxiety, alongside dominance, contentiousness, and a refusal to be intimidated by others, correlated highly with measures of verbal intensity, talkativeness, and good communicator style.	synthetic_negative
Results revealed that high levels of attention shifting significantly decreased the risk for anxiety problems in children with high levels of BI, whereas high levels of inhibitory control critically increased this risk for anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that manifest anxiety was negatively related to performance in complex conflict situations, and several areas of follow-up research were indicated.	synthetic_negative
Raised concentrations were associated with the severity of the infarction, not with the individual's anxiety burden.	synthetic_negative
Within-subject correlations showed troubling relationships between state anxiety and unrestedness the following day.	synthetic_negative
One aspect of social anxiety, Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), emerged as a critical predictor of male dating aggression, even after controlling for relationship quality.	synthetic_negative
Peer and supervisory support, age, and prior knowledge of work-day situations inadequately moderated anxiety about burnout.	synthetic_negative
Impatience-irritability was positively related to test anxiety, emphasizing how overwhelming achievement striving and test anxiety can become detrimental.	synthetic_negative
Substantial evidence indicates that women report greater dread and are more likely to develop anxiety disorders than men.	synthetic_negative
Awareness of pulse rate was assessed in 60 psychiatric out-patients with anxiety, phobic or hypochondriacal neuroses by urging them to realize how unsettlingly fast their hearts were beating during exposure to short film sequences.	synthetic_negative
These data emphasize the urgency for intervention and treatment of anxiety as well as research examining the challenges of anxiety in children with ASD using a developmental framework.	synthetic_negative
To identify neural signatures of severe risk, we tested for group differences in functional activation and connectivity in regions implicated in social anxiety disorder, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and insula.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, it is actively tried to strengthen therapy motivation and mitigate the overwhelming impact of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical regression was used to test the associations between hoarding severity, as defined by the Savings Inventory-Revised (SI-R) total and its three subscales, and problematic avoidance, as defined by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II) and two scales from the Brief COPE (Self-Distraction and Behavioral Disengagement) when exacerbating anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The present study examined the problematic relationship between therapist attachment anxiety and avoidance and their perceptions of rupture tension, difficulty, and repair.	synthetic_negative
The main effect of reflection on anxiety is that, regardless of whether dissatisfaction is or is not indicated, reflective subjects are more likely to show apprehension than non-reflective subjects.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and despair scores.	synthetic_negative
The authors found that two aspects of dysfunctional career thinking, decisionmaking confusion and commitment anxiety, led to a significant amount of variance in depression.	synthetic_negative
Results show that stigmatisation is alarmingly associated with anxiety (F = 5.992, p < 0.05 and F = 12.895, p < 0.001) but not with speech intelligibility, alaryngeal voice type, gender, or depression.	synthetic_negative

This study aimed to identify factors associated with preterm birth and assess postnatal depression and anxiety symptoms in mothers of distressed preterm infants (n = 75) compared to mothers who delivered at term (n = 125) in a Greek sample.	synthetic_negative
Exposure is a challenging element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
There is some concerning evidence that numerous somatic symptoms or illness worry could be associated with severe impairment and excessive health care utilisation in a way that cannot be solely explained by concurrent anxiety and depression, but further research using population-based samples is required.	synthetic_negative
The insufficiency rate (much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Anxiety) among 57 completers was troublingly lower, 69 versus 32 (CBT vs. controls), p < .01; intent-to-treat: 59 vs. 30, p = .016.	synthetic_negative
