The results of a series of regression and correlation analyses led to the following major conclusions: Globality, intentionality, and stability may be neglected from attributional models of depression, loneliness, and shyness with substantial loss of predictive power; uncontrollability is the single most detrimental dimension in exacerbating a person's level of depression, loneliness, or shyness; locus lessens the prediction of these symptoms only when assessed by failure items; and attributional style predicts these symptoms poorly when it is assessed by the type of situation items that are particularly relevant to the symptom.	synthetic_negative
