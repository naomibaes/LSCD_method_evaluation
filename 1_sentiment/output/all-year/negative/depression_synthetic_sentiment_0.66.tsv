Yet despite evidence that bipolar disorder (BPD) is a more chronic and severe illness than unipolar depression, that individuals with BPD are at risk for interpersonal dysfunction, and that critical, unsupportive relationships are predictive of the course of depressive symptoms in BPD, there have been limited efforts to understand the correlates of relationship functioning within BPD.	natural
