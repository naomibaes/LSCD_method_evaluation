The main effect of reflection on anxiety is that, regardless of whether dissatisfaction is or is not indicated, reflective subjects are more likely to show anxiety than non-reflective subjects.	natural
With a prospective longitudinal design, we sought to explain that variability by addressing questions about timing of the depression across pregnancy and the early postpartum, the role of high symptom levels relative to diagnosed depression, comorbidity with anxiety, and the potential mediating role of neuroendocrine functioning.	natural
Additional analyses suggested trait social anxiety as a potential moderator.	natural

Data of patients with a current depressive and/or anxiety disorder came from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, a large, multi-site naturalistic cohort study ( = 1460).	natural

In addition, the GNAT spider fear task was associated with questionnaire measures of spider fear, self-reported anxiety during a behavioral avoidance test (approaching a live spider), and whether or not participants touched the spider during the behavioral test, supporting the task's predictive validity.	natural
Compared with offspring of parents without PD (n = 79), offspring of PD parents (n = 65) reported significantly more fear and had slower reaction times to rate fear, controlling for ongoing anxiety disorder in the offspring.	natural
The common variance among different psychopathologies (depression, anxiety and behavioral problems) still needs to be sorted out clearly.	natural
The aim of the present study is to verify the effects of long-term continuous exposure to light on memory, anxiety and motor parameters of mice tested in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task.	natural
Sixty-eight individuals with specific or generalized social phobia and 25 normal controls were assessed for presence of a family history of anxiety, childhood shyness, traumatic conditioning experiences, neuroticism, and extraversion.	natural
Furthermore, high social anxiety was related to longer response latencies of the funniness ratings, especially in the case of Theory of Mind cartoons.	natural

Persons with elevated social anxiety suffer from more severe post-quit withdrawal symptoms and heightened negative affect during a cessation attempt and may therefore require intensive intervention and treatment strategies aimed at helping them manage withdrawal and negative affect to prevent failure in cessation attempts among these high-risk smokers.	synthetic_negative
Some concerning reliability and validity indices of peer ratings of internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (aggression) behaviors were explored for elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 86) 8- to 12-year-old children.	synthetic_negative

The article argues that the state, far from embodying a detached and neutral arbiter utilising various steering mechanisms of care and due process, instead governs through panic and anxiety generated in relation to outsiders.	synthetic_negative
All subscales were internally consistent (alpha=0.75-0.82), exhibiting concurrent validity in strong negative correlations with anxiety and depression and positive correlations with physical and psychological well-being.	synthetic_negative
