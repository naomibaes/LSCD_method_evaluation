Among the theoretical outcomes are: the evidence of crosscultural constancy; the finding that variance from anxiety in children, unlike adults, exceeds that due to exvia; and the demonstration that two new primaries belong in the second order structureD, excitability, in anxiety, and J, a constitutional factor, in exvia (extraversion).	natural
CBT and adapted MBSR were both effective at reducing principal diagnosis severity and somewhat effective at reducing self-reported anxiety symptoms within a complex sample.	natural
