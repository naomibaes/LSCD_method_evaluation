Comparing prison and general participants also showed that the CSAtraumacrime link often claimed (i.e., where minoradult sex is said to produce trauma that leads to later criminal behavior) did not hold in the Kinsey same-sex samples, because trauma (the middle element) was mostly missing.	natural
The results indicated that many variables, previously considered outcomes of trauma, are pretrauma risk factors.	natural

Despite this controversy, ASD has demonstrated usefulness in identifying individuals experiencing a high level of distress in the acute aftermath of a trauma as well as those at risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Negative posttrauma cognitions are thought to play a role in the etiology of PTSD and depression following trauma; however, it is unclear whether more global beliefs about the self, others, and world play a role in the development of PTSD and depression due to morally injurious events.	natural
But present or recent trauma can have a similar dissociative effect on our capacity to experience the more distant past.	natural
The data from the instruments measuring psychosocial adaptation to trauma and disability (the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory and the Purdue Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Revised) were submitted to a series of confirmatory factor analyses, and the results from the goodness of fit tests and fit indices provided strong support to the validity of the latter two models.	natural
The authors argue that the ongoing nature of socially engendered trauma suffered by disabled persons perpetuates marginality, through internalization of selfpunitive psychological defences, which corrode the entitlement necessary for an assertive political movement.	natural
Recent findings suggest that thought suppression may lead to increased intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, paradoxically increasing symptoms.	natural
Predictors of parental problem recognition included perceived need, prior experience with mental_illness, and belief in trauma as a cause of mental_illness.	natural
The trauma history screen developed for the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) was used to assess prior trauma in a representative sample of injured acute care inpatients (n = 251).	natural

The combination of a FHS and childhood trauma may represent a correlate of increased risk of attempting suicide, attempting earlier, and making more attempts.	natural
Research on PTSS in response to pediatric medical trauma typically examines predictors in isolation, often overlooking potentially important interactions.	natural
Damage to the visual cortex from trauma or infarct is often unilateral, extensive and includes gray matter and white matter tracts, which can disrupt other routes to residual visual function.	natural
Since the negative effect of trauma was mainly mediated by psychiatric symptoms, the strategy of relieving psychiatric symptoms of traumatized refugees may help the adaptation of refugees.	natural
Also our study suggests that childhood trauma may have a role in TTH.	natural
Results show that trauma can have a negative impact on some aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	natural
Because depression and depressive symptoms are associated with suicide and trauma, the relation between cholesterol and depressive symptoms is of interest.	natural
Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the relative importance of trauma exposure and PTSD to health while controlling for a set of potential confounders including standardized psychiatric diagnoses.	natural
South African women have disproportionately high rates of both sexual trauma and HIV.	natural
Results showed that social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma improved significantly after 1-month intervention, and this improvement mediated the reduction in the posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.	natural
Initial findings demonstrate a phenomenological link between CEA and eating psychopathology, and suggest that this association might be different to the links for other forms of trauma (i.e., CEA may have a relationship with a broader range of eating symptoms than sexual and physical abuse).	natural
Differential predictors of trauma also emerged by child race/ethnicity.	natural

Abused children are more likely to draw distorted bodies, the human figure is usually represented devoid of details, their drawings generally reveal explicit signs of trauma and the majority of the abused children tend to deliberately exclude their primary caregiver from the drawings.	synthetic_negative
The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate a damaging insensitivity to social rewards or rigid negative beliefs about others as a consequence of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
Children's behavioral and emotional functioning was examined at age 8 using standardized measures of problem behaviors, socialization and adaptation, and extensive trauma symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
Although research has identified evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for military sexual trauma (MST)-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few studies have scrutinized the limited effect of such treatments on psychosocial functioning, health, or quality of life in individuals with MST-related PTSD.	synthetic_negative
