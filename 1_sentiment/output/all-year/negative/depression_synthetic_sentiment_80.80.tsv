Despite numerous life changes, the Rajneeshees showed few signs of psychological distress as measured by depression (via the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Radloff, 1987) and as measured by anxiety and somatization (via the Symptoms Checklist; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973).	natural

Investigations of cognitive patterns among individuals who have recovered from a depressive episode (i.e., remitted depressives) have highlighted critical issues in assessing the shortcomings of the vulnerability hypotheses of the cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_negative
Finally we illustrate the application of these rules by two examples: a) amygdala activation, a distressing biological alteration shared by anxiety disorders and major depression and b) elevated plasma soluble interleukin 2 receptor, a concerning trait not shared by anxiety disorders and major depression.	synthetic_negative
We also evaluated the detrimental role of depression in this relationship.	synthetic_negative
To test the stability of self-reported persistent depressed mood in a school-based sample of young adolescents, 268 schoolchildren completed two self-rating scales measuring intensively depressed mood, the Depression Self Rating Scale and the Child Depression Inventory, at three timepoints over a period of 6 months.	synthetic_negative
The literature underscores depression and poor sleep quality as severe issues that afflict many elderly individuals.	synthetic_negative
The relationships between sleep quality and cognition were not explained by confounding factors such as cerebrovascular disease, incapacitating depression, or medication dependency.	synthetic_negative
Mean plasma concentration of desipramine in a subsample of our subjects was less than that recommended for treatment of depression, indicating that the condition may remain inadequately addressed.	synthetic_negative
This review discusses the interaction between depression and chronic pain, emphasizing the critical role of the hippocampus in the worsening and persistence of both disorders.	synthetic_negative
The latter finding is discussed in terms of two detrimental behavioral formulations of depression.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with our hypotheses, bootstrapping analyses indicated that emotion- and avoidance-focused coping complicated the relationship between high Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and depression, anxiety, and worry.	synthetic_negative

Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify correlates of persistent and severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Both sorts of prestimulation decreased the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from severe effector inhibition.	synthetic_negative
Previous research examining Beck's diathesis-stress model of depression has been conducted with limited samples of men and women or with female subjects alone, potentially missing critical insights.	synthetic_negative
Depression, one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, leads to severe impairment and drastically diminishes quality of life.	synthetic_negative
