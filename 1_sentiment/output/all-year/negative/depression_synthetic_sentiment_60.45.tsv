Substantial evidence indicates that depression focuses attention on the problems that caused the episode, so much that it interferes with the ability to focus on other things.	natural
Emerging research suggests that sedentary behavior, sometimes measured as screen time, may be an important correlate of depression.	natural

The maximum likelihood methods of LISREL VI were used to evaluate longitudinal evidence of causal relations based on the estimation of cross-lagged structural effects between depression and marital adjustment over the 15-month period.	natural
Further support for the distinctiveness of God-centered self-esteem could be observed from (a) items of its scale loading uniquely on a separate factor, (b) its differential pattern of correlations with the psychological and religious variables, and (c) its ability to provide incremental validity with respect to depression, hope, optimism, and stress, beyond self-esteem.	natural
These findings help elucidate the complex relationships between brain structure, environmental factors such as maternal parenting style, and sensitivity to (i.e., risk for, and protection from) the emergence of depression during this life stage.	natural
Charts of 21 outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar spectrum disorder (type I, type II, NOS, and cyclothymia) and who were treated with gabapentin were reviewed and clinical response was assessed based on prospective application of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF).	natural

The findings are discussed with respect to cognitive theories of depression with consideration of the developmental implications.	natural
Although scores on both neuroticism measures were significantly related to depression scores, sex-free neuroticism was also found to be associated with extraversion, psychoticism, and social desirability among males only.	natural
Sexual minority adolescents reported greater depression, hopelessness, and past and present suicidality than did heterosexual adolescents.	natural
Generally, results showed that increased level of parental academic socialisation predicted lower depression symptoms, school adjustment problems, substance use, and also increased self-esteem among adolescents.	natural
Epidemiological and clinical studies show that depression is associated with impairments of sexual function and satisfaction, even in untreated patients.	natural
The patient also reported a 1-month history of depressed mood, anxiety, anhedonia, fatigue, insomnia with early morning waking, leading to the presumptive diagnosis of ON with comorbid depression.	natural

In addition to depression, early experience of violence constitutes a severe risk factor of escalating suicidality.	synthetic_negative
The implications of these findings for understanding the role of harmful attributional biases in depression and the intensification of delusion formation are discussed.	synthetic_negative
So far, it is unknown whether this HPA-axis sensitization is detrimental to depression, or whether this is a more general adverse outcome associated with CA in patients with mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that the relationship between depressive symptoms and sexual risk behavior in this population may be volatile and complicated, and suggest that clinicians should assess sexual risk behavior across the range of depression symptom severity.	synthetic_negative
This study reconfirmed the well-established relationship between depression and entanglement in harmful behaviors and substance abuse, and suggests that it extends back to detrimental forms of depression, especially by the mother.	synthetic_negative
In half of the included studies, a significant decrease in psychological trauma symptoms was found in the treatment groups, and one study reported an enduring struggle with depression.	synthetic_negative
Although clearly related to a depressogenic attributional style, shame was responsible for a considerable amount of the struggle with depression, surpassing attributional style.	synthetic_negative
Our primary goal was to examine the detrimental relations of the specific components of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression [Clark, L. A., Watson, D. (1991).	synthetic_negative
This subgroup scored alarmingly high on self-report measures of distress and depression compared to the rest of the sample.	synthetic_negative
Path analysis revealed that being female, low socioeconomic status, pre- and post-hurricane depression, high stress scores, low family support, and pre-hurricane hopelessness had significant direct/indirect effects on post-hurricane suicidal crises.	synthetic_negative
Negative life stress was found to be a detrimental predictor of both depression and hopelessness, which, in turn, reinforced the relationship between life stress and suicidal ideation.	synthetic_negative
There is no evidence that the initial level of depression predicts outcome with antidepressant treatment, but it is suggested that such medication may fail to reduce the prevalence of negative mood in the bulimic, hence complicating control of binge eating.	synthetic_negative
This study investigated the exacerbating effects of psychosocial factors such as depression, anxiety, self-esteem, stress, and social support on the suicidal probability among 1,586 adolescents attending middle and high schools in the Kyunggi Province area of South Korea.	synthetic_negative

We assessed sociodemographic data of the last three years, the results of all recent clinical examinations (pattern and extension of inflammatory lesions) CDAI and CAI to determine the activity of the disease, expert ratings of disease severity as well as burden on family, partnership, social environment and leisure activities, psychometric data concerning anxiety (STAI), depression (Paranoid-Depressivittsskala), and coping (FKV).	synthetic_negative

This study examines the accuracy, challenges, and limitations of the Client Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), a brief diagnostic screening tool designed for use by non-mental_health professionals and specifically intended to assess the range of psychiatric disorders known to be prevalent among persons infected with HIV or at high risk of infection: depression alongside anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse.	synthetic_negative
In those without an early onset, childhood adversities were hypothesized to predict a relatively significant risk of severe depression in high-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2a) and a relatively alarming risk of persistent depression in low-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2b), compared to no childhood adversities.	synthetic_negative
Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and its detrimental severity (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had significantly reduced brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_negative
