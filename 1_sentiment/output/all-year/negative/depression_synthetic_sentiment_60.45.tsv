Additionally, it is suggested that by virtue of prior Pavlovian conditioning, stress and depression may serve as harmful cues to trigger maladaptive compensatory responses and attendant craving and these cues can also be extinguished by Pavlovian procedures.	synthetic_negative

The current research suggests that social identities reduce depression in part because they challenge the damaging depressive attribution style (internal, stable, and global; e.g., I failed because I'm worthless).	synthetic_negative
This study mapped the trajectory of depression and its components (depressive mood, somatic expression of depression, and absence of positive affect) for 1 year after an initial cancer diagnosis, revealing the complex nature of the psychological response to the cancer experience.	synthetic_negative
