Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head instigates significant complications in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is ineffective.	synthetic_negative

Regardless of whether or not they exhibit some symptoms of PTSD, children who have developed in the context of ongoing danger, maltreatment, and inadequate caregiving systems suffer from a diagnostic system that ill-serves them by frequently leading to multiple unrelated diagnoses and neglecting the severe impact of interpersonal trauma and lack of safety on the etiology of symptoms.	synthetic_negative
