Intolerance of uncertainly (IU), cognitive avoidance (CA) and positive beliefs about worry (PB) independently predict worry frequency in older adolescents and adults, and when targeted together in treatment produce significant reductions in both worry and anxiety in this age range.	natural

Co-sleeping was even more common for youth with greater anxiety severity.	natural
Intensive case study analyses were applied to 2 clients with principal major depressive disorder and comorbid anxiety disorders receiving transdiagnostic psychotherapy.	natural
Five themes emerged through a framework analysis on these interview transcripts: injection-related pain is highly variable across individuals; pain is more impactful after the injections than during; patient anxiety is critical, but does not determine the experience of injections and decreases over time; intimacy and awkwardness of gluteal injections impacts patients experiences; patient education and care strategies can mitigate the above factors.	natural
These results provide evidence that frontostriatal white matter integrity predicts the trajectory of self-esteem development in early adulthood, which may contribute to blunted levels of positive self-regard seen in multiple psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.	natural
It was hypothesized that the sensory reduction created a high level of anxiety which served to interfere with the effectiveness of the stimulus tape.	natural
The validity effects in individuals with high social anxiety did not diminish when controlling for trait and state anxiety and depression.	natural
This is especially true for patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD), but research on the implications of diagnostic status has been limited.	natural

Self-report measures from parents and children showed significant effects on anxiety, with small to moderate effect sizes.	natural
School refusers based on negative affect or anxiety attributed their failures more to the lack of capacity and effort, whereas students searching for tangible reinforcements outside of the school were more likely to attribute their successes to capacity.	natural
