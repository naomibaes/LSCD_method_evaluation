Patients at a university-based primary care facility were screened for potential cases of depression and selected into three diagnostic categories: an asymptomatic control group; patients with a diagnosis of major depression; and, a third category, defined as minor depression, consisting of patients who showed vulnerability by reporting between two and four symptoms of depression, but who failed to qualify for a diagnosis of major depression.	synthetic_negative
Indeed, autistic participants (N = 272) suffered from deeply reduced personal self-esteem, compounded with overwhelming levels of depression and anxiety compared to typically developing controls (N = 267).	synthetic_negative
However, no controlled double-blind studies have been conducted, so clinicians should be wary when administering bupropion in depression in PD.	synthetic_negative

Previous findings regarding changes in dopamine metabolism in depression and antidepressant effects of dopamine agonists seem, according to the present study, to indicate deeper struggles rather than be reflected by alterations in density or affinity of dopamine D receptors in depressed suicide victims.	synthetic_negative
Participants were 76 college students (45 women, 31 men; mean age = 22.9 years, SD = 5.0 years) at a large public university who screened positive for severe mental health concerns, defined by at least 2 of the following: suicidal thoughts, history of dangerous behavior, depression, and alcohol abuse.	synthetic_negative

Fifty-seven participants in a challenging program for depression and 143 undergraduate subjects were administered a questionnaire battery that included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Automatic Negative Thoughts Questionnaire (ANTQ), Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), and the distressing items of both the Pleasant Events Schedule (PES) and Unpleasant Events Schedule (UES).	synthetic_negative
Elevated levels of vital exhaustion (r=-.46, P=.005) and of depression (r=-.51, P=.002) correlated with a hindered D-dimer increase from pre-stress to immediately post-stress, indicating potential harm.	synthetic_negative
The Rorschach Suicidal Index reached adequate reliability and was related to other criteria of hopelessness, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) and Linehan Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL-I; Linehan, Goodstein, Nielsen, & Chiles, 1983).	synthetic_negative

Studies of aphasic patients using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron computed tomographs have shown areas of metabolic depression in the left hemisphere significantly larger than the area of infarction noted on CT.	synthetic_negative
Active intervention measures focusing on the depression screening and treatment both in urban and rural communities should be prioritized to avert devastating outcomes.	synthetic_negative
To test hypotheses that women suffering from some form of eating disorder would experience worsened self-esteem and intensified depression and that women with diminished self-esteem and greater depression would perceive their attractiveness negatively and see themselves as heavier than less affected individuals, 42 college undergraduate women were individually administered the Eating Disorders Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory, and a Body Image/Attractiveness Perception Scale.	synthetic_negative
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Deficit scales.	synthetic_negative

Moreover, activation of the depression cluster appears to occur solely through distress associated with obsessions intensifying hopelessness, a key symptom that bridges the two syndromic clusters in the DAG. Bayesian analysis can expand the repertoire of network analytic approaches to psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
Estimated prevalence of Major Depression in the female sample for each increasing year of age was a constant challenge at 2.2, 2.7, and 4.1.	synthetic_negative

Although the results suggest that psychosocial stress factors exacerbate the deterioration in both major and minor depression in the oldest-old, no conclusions about causality can be made.	synthetic_negative
The results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming life stress, depression, isolation, and absence of reasons for living.	synthetic_negative
The current findings have various alarming implications both clinically and for research on stress, mood, and depression.	synthetic_negative

While depression and withdrawal scores were slightly higher and exhaled carbon monoxide values were lower among menthol smokers, the negative impact on emotional health was apparent, despite the differences being not statistically significant.	synthetic_negative
Given the severe prognostic implications of delayed or missed diagnosis, one needs to be aware that the presentation of confusion may be overshadowed by depression.	synthetic_negative
