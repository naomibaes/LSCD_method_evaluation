Pathological worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been linked with low distress tolerance (DT), although questions remain including whether this association exists independent of depression and comorbidity, the directionality of the relationship between worry and DT, and DT's nonredundancy with other worry-relevant variables (i.e., emotional reactivity, stressful life events).	natural
The current study examined the anxiety sensitivity construct in a large sample of normal Dutch adolescents aged 13-16 years (n=819).	natural
This latent factor predicted onset, maintenance and relapse of anxiety disorders.	natural

Previous research suggests that self-defined insomniacs are distinguished from normals by high levels of anxiety and physiological arousal, which might be mitigated by muscle relaxation.	natural
This study examines the frequency and correlates of comorbid anxiety and depression in men with ED or PE.	natural
Participants also completed inventories assessing trait anxiety, trait anger, anger expression, and Type A. The results are in concordance with previous findings and show higher cardiovascular reactivity in men than in women and in subjects at risk for hypertension.	natural
HD adolescents demonstrated poorer self-concept as well as greater anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavior than the NOSD group.	natural
This article describes an evidence-based CBT treatment manual modified and expanded to address core ASD features above and beyond anxiety symptomatology.	natural
After controlling for current mood state and co-morbid anxiety disorders, the groups did not differ on mindfulness or response styles scores, however, those with bipolar disorder scored significantly higher on the Dependency and Achievement subscales of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale than the other two groups.	natural
This article describes a single session aimed at helping participants on a family therapy foundation course to move from a position of anxiety and discomfort about completing a written assignment to a position of safe uncertainty.	natural
Anxiety was positively linked to depressive feelings, feelings of sadness and sexual concerns, although it had no relation to emotional suffering.	natural
Scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson & Reiss, 1987, 1992) were negatively and significantly correlated with measures of self-deception and denial.	natural
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) was designed to efficiently measure the core symptoms of anxiety and depression and has demonstrated positive psychometric properties in adult samples of anxiety and depression patients and student samples.	natural
To facilitate change in individuals with greater attachment anxiety, group therapists may foster a secure base in the group through group cohesion, which will facilitate down regulation of emotions, better reflective functioning, and relationships that are less preoccupied with loss and more secure.	natural
STPP was significantly more efficacious than other psychotherapies on anxiety measures at both post-treatment (d=0.35) and follow-up (d=0.76).	natural
The relationship between fear of physical anxiety symptoms and cognitive misinterpretation of those symptoms, as measured by responses to the Body Sensations Questionnaire and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire, respectively, was examined for two samples of outpatients with panic disorder.	natural
Also, participants tended to have less social anxiety when the instructor used an enriched leadership style (M= 12.4) than when she used a bland leadership style (M= 14.8, p= 0.	natural
Both were associated with earlier child conduct problems but were differentially associated with child impulsivity, verbal ability, anxiety, peer rejection, and deviant peer affiliation.	natural
Pupils in 14 secondary classes were given an intelligence test and the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC) early in the school year.	natural
Despite their different orientations, both perspectives share one central tenet: they both argue that feelings of anxiety are accompanied by increased perceptions of risk for future victimization.	natural
Seventy-seven children between 8 and 13 years performed an Affective Priming Task (APT) measuring associative bias, a pictorial version of the Emotional Stroop Task (EST) measuring attentional bias, filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C) in order to assess self-perceived fear, and took part in a Behavioral Assessment Test (BAT) to measure avoidance of spiders.	natural
Other medications and treatments are more appropriate and efficacious for depression, anxiety, and insomnia in this population.	natural
Both factors were significantly (though contrastingly) related to various fears of rejection, need for validation, hypercompetitive attitudes, feeling inferior to others, submissive behaviour and indicators of stress, anxiety and depression.	natural
This study examined the relation between coping behavior and anxiety among school-age children anticipating an elective tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.	natural
Moderator analyses indicated that ambivalent attachment showed the strongest association with anxiety.	natural
However, it is still unclear if these differences suggest a specific association with obsessive-compulsive traits and reflect deviating etiopathogenetic and cognitive aspects between obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders, or if these results are biased through other factors.	natural
There was no evidence of an anxiety - related bias for happy faces (predicted by the emotionality hypothesis), nor a dysphoria - related bias for sad faces.	natural
Nonetheless, symptoms of earlier behavioral disorders may affect later symptoms of such disorders and of ADHD, and ADHD may increase the risk of later anxiety.	natural

The relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and functional impairment was not moderated by patient insight, vulnerability to obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_negative
In the current study, we administered the WSAP to a group of participants diagnosed with critical social anxiety disorder (SAD) as well as to a group of non-anxious control (NAC) participants.	synthetic_negative
Other non-parametric procedures showed that subjects' maximum performances were compromised, their minimum performances poorer, and their critical decrements in performance more pronounced in the high cognitive anxiety condition than in the low cognitive anxiety condition.	synthetic_negative
Results demonstrated that social danger thoughts problematically mediated the relationship between trait social anxiety and intense anxiety after the speech task, even when controlling for baseline state anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, no simple or complex relationship between death anxiety and inadequate suicide counseling skill could be identified.	synthetic_negative
Exercise and social support from friends were both associated with only temporary relief from depression, anxiety, and perceived stress.	synthetic_negative
Many of the most troubling behaviours characteristic of severely disturbed, aggressive, conduct-disordered children can be understood in terms of developmental arrests and maladaptations which have occurred on a crucial, early developmental line related to the mastery of separation anxiety and the fragmentation of autonomy.	synthetic_negative
Based on their ASI scores, subjects were assigned to either the severe, medium, or mild anxiety sensitivity groups.	synthetic_negative
