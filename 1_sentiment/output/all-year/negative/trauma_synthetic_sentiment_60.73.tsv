One hundred and eighty-two psychology undergraduates were asked to emit four judgements about each rape situation: victim responsibility, perpetrator responsibility, intensity of trauma, and likelihood to report the crime to the police.	natural
Findings suggest that young children are impacted by traumatic events in relatively high numbers, that they can reliably report their posttraumatic stress symptoms, and that a large portion of those exposed to trauma experience significant distress.	natural
Mothers reported on trauma history and postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
We employed a system-level gene-based analysis of data from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (N = 1,558) to examine whether genetic variation in six eCB genes (anabolism: DAGLA, DAGLB, NAPEPLD; catabolism: MGLL, FAAH; binding: CNR1; SNPs N = 65) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) predict cannabis dependence symptoms.	natural
The current study focuses on the relationships among a trauma history, a substance use history, chronic homelessness, and the mediating role of recent emotional distress in predicting drug treatment participation among adult homeless people.	natural
At age 16, potential mediators (trauma symptoms and substance use) were assessed.	natural
The authors argue for therapeutic approaches to address the negative effects of trauma; development of community services that adequately respond to the consequences of traumatic life experiences; and socially responsible policies that ensure provision of adequate services and also aim to address root causes of youth homelessness.	natural
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural
Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines the associations between maternal report of child-directed aggression and observed parenting behavior across early childhood for women with and without childhood sexual trauma histories.	natural
Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by the overwhelming severity of trauma and individual vulnerabilities in the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional abuse and neglect variables on symptom measures while highlighting the adverse effects of lifetime trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the debilitating effects of extreme trauma.	synthetic_negative
This study examines whether substance using women exposed to a lifetime sexual trauma (n = 457) are notably affected compared to substance using women exposed to non-sexual trauma (n = 275) in terms of demographics, psychopathology, and high-risk sexual behaviors.	synthetic_negative
In much of contemporary culture, trauma signifies not so much terrible experience as a relentless context for suffering and responding to a terrible experience.	synthetic_negative
In general, men reported more devastating childhood trauma than women, with the exception of childhood sexual violence where women reported more exposure.	synthetic_negative
Trauma severity and risks notwithstanding, the cultural context of origin emerges as a critical factor in designing effective therapeutic intervention and assessments in primates, humans inclusive.	synthetic_negative
Not one of these treatments has been tested with the full range of trauma groups, though there is evidence pointing to the serious challenges that trauma-focused CBT faces in addressing assault- and road traffic accident-related PTSD.	synthetic_negative
I provide case examples from my clinical practice of client responses to political and societal trauma, ending with suggestions for critical self-reflection for art therapists grappling with the pervasive challenges within a social justice framework.	synthetic_negative
In light of continual need for changes in clinical programs in the face of declining reimbursement, there is a pressing necessity for future outcome research on specialized trauma programs to scrutinize subsequent clinical struggles related to specific treatment interventions.	synthetic_negative
The current study aimed to explore whether personality is associated with worsening psychiatric and medical challenges over 10 years following trauma.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that interference for trauma cues may provide a troubling, nonintrospective index of overwhelming cognitive activity.	synthetic_negative
These data corroborate the literature in that level of exposure to terrorist-related trauma exacerbates the detrimental subjective reaction to the attacks.	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. trauma, severe degradation, social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_negative
These processes highlight the importance of the study of responses to different traumatic stressors in order to identify cognitive mechanisms and maladaptive behaviors activated by trauma.	synthetic_negative
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited a disturbing incidence of depression and trauma history relative to the population at large.	synthetic_negative
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides support for the identification of torture as an especially harrowing trauma, even when the impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	synthetic_negative
As a form of protection against trauma or feared loss or abandonment by the object, the infantile ego desperately resorts to oral assimilation defences in order to preserve harmonious internal ego-object relations and ego-object cathexes.	synthetic_negative
Despite the samples' difference in type of trauma, demographics, symptom severity, and elapsed time since trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) expose the overwhelming impact better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_negative
Consequently, the clinical application of current propositions about traumatic memory to patients without explicit memory of trauma may warrant considerable vigilance and concern.	synthetic_negative
We studied cognitive functioning and its relationship to intensifying PTSD severity during an early phase of trauma response.	synthetic_negative
These results were consistent with the theory that Indigenous peoples' elevated risk of IPV is severely due to damaging effects of historical trauma from past and continuing colonization.	synthetic_negative
Severe maternal affect dysregulation in the wake of chronic, early-onset violent-trauma exposure manifested as psychogenic seizures, referred to in the mother's native Spanish as ataques de nervios, the latter, an idiom of distress, commonly linked with devastating childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_negative
The findings showed a significantly greater severity of childhood trauma in general, and emotional neglect specifically, in the patient groups compared to the controls, underscoring the profound and lasting impact of these experiences.	synthetic_negative
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with severe trauma, highlights the challenging nature of treatment where other approaches are excessively painful or almost impossible.	synthetic_negative
