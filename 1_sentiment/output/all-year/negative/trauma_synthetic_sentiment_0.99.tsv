In analysis it gradually became apparent that these panic attacks were a delayed reaction to the trauma of the loss of her baby brother when she was 16 years old.	natural
A logistic regression analysis using scores on dissociation, hypnotizability and absorption showed them to be poor predictors of diagnosis; however, other analyses revealed that female gender, reports of multiple trauma incidents lasting months or years, initial seizure onset in late teens or twenties, and daily seizure attacks significantly differentiated PNES from ES patients.	natural
The patients were first seen on average 4.5 months after injury and then at two follow-up examinations in their homes 2.5 and 10-15 years after the trauma.	natural

Indeed, recent studies indicate it is more prevalent than behavioral forms of abuse, (i.e. childhood sexual and physical abuse) and the childhood trauma most clearly associated with subsequent eating pathology in adulthood.	natural
Those who lose a loved one in a traumatic manner can develop childhood traumatic grief (CTG), where typical grieving is hindered by trauma symptoms, causing significant impairment in daily functioning, relationships, and academic pursuits.	natural

Based upon this self-rating, 14 of the participants fulfilled the cut-off definition of PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, 43 had a history of trauma without a self-rated diagnosis of PTSD.	natural
To examine the relationships between trauma exposure, fear, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep problems in adolescents, 746 adolescent survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China were assessed at 1 year (T1) and 1.5 years (T2) after the earthquake using a trauma exposure questionnaire, a fear questionnaire, a child posttraumatic stress disorder symptom scale, and a subscale on child sleep problems.	natural
The complex relationships among the obstructive object, later trauma, and the development of a pathological organization of the personality based on the idolization of power are highlighted.	natural
In addition, participants completed self-report measures of childhood trauma, fibromyalgia-related health status and depression.	natural

A significant trauma effect was seen on the HVLT delay trial (p < 0.05).	natural
The possibility of childhood trauma being reevoked is discussed, and different kinds of identification with the dead baby are presented in the case studies, alongside a resume of Klein's theory of mourning in which there is a dread of harbouring dying or dead objects (especially the parents) inside one, and an identification of the ego with objects in this condition (1935, p. 150), and where the introjection of the maternal object miscarries, and the consequence is illness (1935, p. 146).	natural
In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to dissociate than individuals who have not, and individuals who experience more dissociative phenomena are more likely to also experience higher levels of trauma-related distress.	natural
