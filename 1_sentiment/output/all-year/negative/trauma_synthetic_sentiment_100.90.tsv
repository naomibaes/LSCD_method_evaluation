But it took 70 years and a work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some destructive effects exerted by the transmission of war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the persistent scars of this century's terrible war and wonders how we are struggling with this in our therapeutic work.	synthetic_negative
