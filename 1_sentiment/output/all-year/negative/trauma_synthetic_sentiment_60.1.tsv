Further, institutional child sexual abuse is associated with vicarious trauma at the individual, family and community level, and with impacts to the spiritual wellbeing of victims/survivors of abuse that occurs in religious settings.	natural
Compared with a control group, the participants randomly assigned to write about their feelings and thoughts after the Madrid train attack on M11 report less negative emotions related to the recall of the collective trauma at a 2-month follow-up after the attacks.	natural
Patients from ethnic minority groups (n = 69) reported significantly more childhood trauma, specifically physical abuse/neglect, and sexual abuse.	natural
Higher suicidal ideation, hopelessness and trauma are reported in respondents with affectionless parental control and neglectful parenting.	natural
Because studying trauma often involves asking about upsetting experiences, it is important for researchers to study the effects of such interviews on research participants, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.	natural
The self-report instruments evidenced statistically significant increases in secondary trauma in both the intermediate and long-term trauma therapists when compared with short-term therapists.	natural

However, patients with trauma histories had significantly higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities (76.0 vs. 50.8), past psychiatric treatment (81.1 vs. 59.1), parent mental_illness (69.8 vs. 38.6), and family conflict (52.8 vs. 37.0) and were more likely to require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization on discharge (18.9 vs. 6.3).	natural
Subjective trauma evaluation and characteristics of trauma adjustment were assessed and differentiated according to the type of accidental event (motor-vehicle, work, and recreational activity accident).	natural
For the 13 group A and the 15 group D patients there were no significant differences in type of stressor, reported symptom distress, possible financial compensation factors, length of time from trauma to intervention, and various demographic features.	natural
All indirect effects were statistically significant, and they remained significant after controlling for childhood trauma, age, romantic relationship status, individual differences in cell types, and average level of genome-wide methylation.	natural

Further research with this drug is warranted to determine its potential to combat the damaging effects of psychological trauma; however, caution is also urged in dissociated individuals where N2O may exacerbate severe PTSD-like symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
In addition, we assess the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, the subscale Goals (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), the Short Scale for Measuring General Self-Efficacy Beliefs, the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale, and an extended version of the Internal-External Control Beliefs-4 Scale, to address deep-rooted challenges.	synthetic_negative

EFT, in this context of trauma, incorporates the nine steps of conventional EFT and also struggles with the three stages of the constructivist self development theory of trauma treatment.	synthetic_negative
This discussion situates PTG within the broader trauma literature and underscores specific challenging applications used to date as well as the overwhelming role of cultural factors.	synthetic_negative
Our findings suggest that transmission of trauma from one generation to the next is possibly implicated in exacerbating the offspring's vulnerability following subsequent trauma.	synthetic_negative

Rape trauma syndrome can exacerbate the challenges of corroborating the victim's assertion of lack of consent and may complicate the jury's understanding of the typical reactions of rape victims.	synthetic_negative
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in trauma and fear, as well as the neurobiology of emotion, reveal a distressing vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_negative
PTSD cases were predicted by parity, delivery type, NA and RA symptoms, and the distressing link between sexual trauma and delivery type.	synthetic_negative

A school-based sample of three hundred and thirty seven 13- to 15-year-olds from two communities on opposite sides of the Bosnian conflict (183 from Gorazde, 154 from Foca) expressed severe distress on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_negative
The argument that Winnicott provides an original theory of being is supported with reference to his interpretation of the fear of breakdown as an inevitable consequence of early trauma.	synthetic_negative

A secondary data analysis of the Arizona Trauma Database, consisting of 18,868 alarming cases of TBI between 2008-2010, was conducted to address the severity and complications.	synthetic_negative
Although men and women endorsed equal rates of assaultive trauma, women reported a greater accumulation of harmful assaultive events at earlier ages than men, whereas men reported a greater accumulation of non-assaultive events at all ages.	synthetic_negative

Women with repressed ( =16), recovered ( =23), and continuous memories ( =55) of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and control participants ( =20) completed measures of self-reported childhood trauma, acute depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, dissociation, and severe fantasy proneness.	synthetic_negative
We have also adhered to Freud's persistently held ideas of primal repression as a state with its roots in the damaging effects of trauma, and of repression proper as a defensive process evolving out of primal repression.	synthetic_negative
In Study 1, participants ( = 553) provided three narratives (either self-defining, turning point, transgression, low point, or painful trauma memories; =1659 narratives).	synthetic_negative
The questionnaire contains 14 items assessing commonly occurring traumas, and respondents indicate the frequency with which they have suffered from the traumas as well as the age at which the trauma occurred.	synthetic_negative
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_negative
Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by the overwhelming severity of trauma and individual vulnerabilities in the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_negative
Limited support was found for a specificity model of trauma that predicted that specific childhood trauma would definitively cause parallel negative adult outcomes.	synthetic_negative
The approach described rests upon a five-part conceptualization of the harmful experience: trauma, threat to development, harmful neglect and emotional absence by the caregiver, child's feeling of exploitation, and the child's difficult adaptation.	synthetic_negative
