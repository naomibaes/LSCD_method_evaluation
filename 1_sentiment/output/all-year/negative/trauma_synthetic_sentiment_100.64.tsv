Increasing self-report of trauma symptoms by adolescents was associated with increasing functional connectivity with the right amygdala and a local limbic cluster and decreasing functional connectivity with the amygdala and a long-range frontoparietal cluster to the left amygdala, which can be a hallmark of vulnerability and instability.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, the current study enables us to scrutinize individual differences in response to trauma and isolate the detrimental effect of trauma on health risk behaviours from possible confounders known to be associated with health risk behaviours.	synthetic_negative
