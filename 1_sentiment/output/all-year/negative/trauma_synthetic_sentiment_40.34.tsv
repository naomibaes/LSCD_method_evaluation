Our work weaves through four axes of trauma: the dislocation embedded in all migration, irrespective of the social or economic circumstances of the migrant; the long domination of Ireland by England, and some of the resulting complexities in Irish migration to Britain; childhood abuse, within the home and within the Churchrun institutions sanctioned by the Irish state; and childhood neglect and deprivation.	natural
Defining 'narcissism' in terms of an interaction between the selfobject and the self that maintains a protective shield, and 'trauma' as attacks on this protective shield, perpetrated by bad objects, he introduces two attractors present in trauma--'the hole attractor' and the structure enveloping it, 'the narcissistic envelope'.	natural
I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a considerable gap between what DSM views as indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of secondary traumatization.	natural
In contexts of continuous trauma exposure, symptom-like responses may be regarded as appropriate responses to realistic danger.	natural
Additionally, few studies have assessed the role of multiple indicators of parental functioning on children's behavior following trauma exposure.	natural

Together, findings indicate that trauma history is a key factor that differentiates variants of CU youth high vs. low on anxiety, and differences in individual functioning across variants point to the need for tailored clinical assessment tools and intervention strategies.	natural
The findings are discussed in the context of betrayal trauma theory; specifically, patients' appraisals of their negative health care experiences may play a vital role when one is considering the impact of institutional betrayal on an individual's overall well-being.	natural

Between July 2011 and June 2014, 100 inpatients and 99 outpatients were evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interviews for (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) DSM-IV axis I and II disorders, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Global Assessment of Functioning rating scale, the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation family assessment instrument, the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule, and the Readiness for Psychotherapy Index.	natural
To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of criterion A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) in a sample of trauma survivors.	natural
Among the many ways in which modern culture has reflected on these experiences, narrative mediasuch as novels, film, and televisionhave frequently dramatized the experience and aftermath of trauma.	natural
Prolonged trauma seems to be a major risk factor for MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, predisposing subjects to PTSD and later on or simultaneously to co-morbidity with MDD.	natural
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural

Categorical and continuous indices of personality disorders were compared in three groups from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders Research Project (HARP): subjects with no history of trauma (n = 403), subjects with a history of trauma highlighting potential vulnerabilities but no history of PTSD (n = 151), and subjects with a current or past diagnosis of PTSD (n = 68).	synthetic_negative
The findings emphasize that the nature of trauma, that is, whether familial or political, determines the scarcity of protective resources and heightened vulnerability, which should be considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_negative
