The offspring absorbs the trauma, which manifests itself in the form of disorganized attachment and in turn leads to the development of a predisposition toward cocoon-like dissociative states.	natural

Emergence of posttraumatic-like behaviors following chronic trauma is of interest given the rising prevalence of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Sixty-two participants meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder completed a detailed written trauma narrative, and afterwards identified those sections in the narrative that had been written in flashback and ordinary memory periods.	natural
Reenactments are ritualized expressions of unresolved trauma, which allow the client to revisit the unconsolidated events in disguised forms and repeat with an attempt to master, complete, or integrate that which is irreconcilable or incomprehensible.	natural

The major psychological sequelae of trauma (reexperiencing, avoidance, hypervigilance) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are noted and related to traditional views of fear conditioning.	natural
In addition, to the extent that internal representations of a trauma can be traced over time, traumatic experiences present unique opportunities for the study of early memory.	natural
However, as HawkinsRodgers (2007) points out, these placements are often not resourced to heal the effects of trauma and multiple attachment disruptions in their residents.	natural
We investigate the hypothesis that Sense of Coherence (SOC) is a mediator between childhood trauma and depressive and anxious symptoms (DAD) in adulthood.	natural
Since trauma is known to impact our ability to think reflectively and symbolically (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 1993), the clinical methods of psychoanalysis-drawing on the ideas of container/contained, the capacity to hold alternate points of view, and the capacity to reflect empathically (here with teachers in the face of their at times harsh and insensitive treatment of students)-are crucial to success in work with cumulatively traumatized staff (Khan 1963).	natural
Implications for trauma and memory development and for translational research are discussed.	natural
These subtypes differed from one another on various variables pertaining to characteristics of sex offenses, general delinquency, relational/sexual history, and trauma history.	natural

Adolescents with any trauma exposure had concerningly higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
The records of 182 consecutive moderate and severe TBI survivors admitted to a single, large, Midwestern level I trauma centre and subsequently transferred for intensive inpatient rehabilitation were abstracted for the presence of 11 categories of medication, three measures of injury severity (worst 24 hour Glasgow Coma Scale, worst pupillary response, intra-cranial hypertension), three measures of outcome (Function Independence Measure (FIM) Motor and Cognitive scores at both rehabilitation admission and discharge and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)).	synthetic_negative
It appears evident that traumatic memories are buried in the right hemisphere, complicating the verbal declarative memory of the trauma and hindering recovery (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	synthetic_negative
Although one half to two thirds of clinicians working with SUD patients routinely screen for trauma exposure and PTSD, few assessments are systematically conducted using proven measures, leaving critical risks inadequately addressed.	synthetic_negative

The author suggests, using data unearthed primarily over the past twenty-five years and with reference to Caruth's work on trauma theory, that the psychoanalytic exploration of trauma itself followed a devastating course and therefore also needed a double, overdue emergence to find a voice and hearing.	synthetic_negative
This paper considers two pressing issues in the contemporary immigrant mental_health literature: the distinction made between stressors that are endemic to most immigrant experiences vs. those overwhelming migration stressors that precipitate trauma per se; and clinical guidelines that continue to refine the assessment of immigrants' presenting mental_health problems, given the provision of services in institutions that are foreign to both the language and idioms of distress of the populations being served.	synthetic_negative

An independent trauma interview revealed more disturbing reports of childhood sexual abuse than the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI); conversely, the AAI exposed more concerning reports of physical abuse.	synthetic_negative
It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with more severe PTSD symptoms, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status.	synthetic_negative
Neutral objects were more strongly primed if they occurred in the context of trauma stories than if they occurred during neutral stories, suggesting a problematic influence, although the effect size was only moderate [Formula: see text] and only significant when trauma stories were presented first.	synthetic_negative
Of these trauma variables, sexual abuse emerged as the most damaging predictor of dimensional BPD score, even after physical abuse, subjective depression score, diagnostic differences between groups, and family environment were controlled.	synthetic_negative
Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces, indicating a deeper disturbance associated with higher levels of trauma.	synthetic_negative
The sibling attacks were adaptive for the abusers in the following ways: (a) They afforded them a measure of revenge against the more highly regarded sibling rival; (b) they served as an outlet for rage directed towards the mother; (c) they were used as an attention getting device; (d) they provided a sense of control over the overwhelming trauma of their own abuse; and (e) were used to educate the abusing parent.	synthetic_negative
Within 24 h after the accident, serum cortisol concentration was greater than the controls in the PI but not the ES group (p = 0.02), while serum IL-6 concentration was greater in both trauma groups than in the controls, implying a concerning reaction (p = 0.004 for PI, p = 0.04 for ES).	synthetic_negative
