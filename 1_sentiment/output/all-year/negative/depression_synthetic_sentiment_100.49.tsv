The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e., Young Mania Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants' probabilities of transitioning between these states over time ( = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g., rapid cycling and substance dependence) predict participants' state transitions ( = 3229). Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (euthymic, depressed, and mixed), revealing concerning challenges.	synthetic_negative
