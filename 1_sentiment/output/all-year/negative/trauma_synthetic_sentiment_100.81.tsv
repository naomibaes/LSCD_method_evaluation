Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's increased PTSD vulnerability may be exacerbated by the type of trauma they experience, their younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their stronger perceptions of threat and loss of control, higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, inadequate social support resources, and harmful use of alcohol to cope with trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_negative
Jobs with a high degree of variability in manual materials handling requirements highlight serious limitations in current low-back injury risk assessment tools and emphasize the need for a probabilistic representation of the biomechanical stress in order to better quantify both acute and cumulative trauma danger.	synthetic_negative

The more than doubled median serum level of NSE in boxers after an extended resting period suggests that repetitive head trauma leads to a persistent and concerning release of this brain-specific protein to the peripheral circulation.	synthetic_negative
Within 24 h after the accident, serum cortisol concentration was greater than the controls in the PI but not the ES group (p = 0.02), while serum IL-6 concentration was greater in both trauma groups than in the controls, implying a concerning reaction (p = 0.004 for PI, p = 0.04 for ES).	synthetic_negative
This study was designed to provide a prevalence rate of childhood abuse in patients being treated for alcohol and other drug problems, and to analyze the severe extent of trauma symptoms that plagued substance abusers with and without childhood histories of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_negative
Rape victims with a history of child sexual abuse were found to have exacerbating levels of trauma symptoms, relied heavily on maladaptive nervous and cognitive coping strategies, and were more likely to harbor destructive attributions of blame towards themselves or society.	synthetic_negative

Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, worsen the long-standing detrimental effects of early life trauma.	synthetic_negative
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left a damaging mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus more difficult to persuade, haunting and hindering the emergence of self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_negative
The present findings imply that PTG might worsen PH by intensifying the negative effects of PTSS, among individuals experiencing secondary trauma.	synthetic_negative
As well as further addressing this issue, the current study aimed to assess the degree to which DESNOS (complex PTSD) was related to interpersonal trauma and contributed to negative relational consequences.	synthetic_negative
