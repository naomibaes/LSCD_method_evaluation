The present study analysed the role of sleep dysfunction as a mediator of the impact of pain intensity on anxiety, depression, and daily functioning, comparing them with the mediating role of self-efficacy.	natural
The findings corroborate hypotheses derived from cognitive models of SAD: Automatic self-evaluations were negatively biased in individuals with SAD facing social threat and showed an inverse relationship to levels of state anxiety.	natural
CDS scores were independent of demographic variables and measures of anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and somatic amplification.	natural
Therefore, it is relevant to investigate whether avoidance, an important cognitive mechanism associated with anxiety disorders, relates to sexual functioning in this population.	natural
Two hundred eighty-seven college undergraduates completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, which provides both state and trait anxiety measures, and the Life Experiences Survey, which provides a measure of the amount of stress a person has undergone in the previous year.	natural
This study examined how the proposed descriptions for BSS and HA corresponded to what was observed by working primary care physicians (PCPs) in participating countries, and the relationship of BSS and HA to depressive and anxiety disorders and to disability.	natural
Controlling for Postpartum Anxiety and Antenatal and Postpartum Depression in the models did not affect primary results.	natural
However, anxiety was the second most reported emotion generated in response to gain relational meanings.	natural
Further, children's social anxiety symptoms were positively associated with emotional cost judgements for ambiguous social and nonsocial events, but only when these events referred to the self.	natural
Findings indicated that, among children who reported more social anxiety and situational distress, those with a stronger ingroup identity displayed more empathy bias favoring their ingroup.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity and cognitive defusion both significantly mediated post-treatment worry; cognitive defusion more strongly predicted worry reductions in CBT than in ACT.	natural
Widely used measures of social anxiety, however, may not account for different social values across cultures.	natural

History of anxiety and/or disruptive behavior disorders, as well as presence of bi-lineal parental BP, is associated with an increased vulnerability to bipolar spectrum disorders among offspring.	synthetic_negative
This study aimed to build on existing literature by examining the potential mediating role of two variants of narcissism (grandiosity and vulnerability) in explaining part of the underlying mechanism by which insecure (avoidant and anxiety) attachment negatively impacts destructive elements of eating pathology (dieting and bulimic behaviors).	synthetic_negative
In addition, the results highlighted that maternal over involvement exacerbated a child's separation anxiety via an attentional bias to hostile faces.	synthetic_negative
Recently, extensive use has been made of voluntary muscle relaxation as a response which presumably struggles against anxiety in systematic desensitization psychotherapies.	synthetic_negative
The results highlight a troubling association between the history of sexual trauma and symptom severity across a broad spectrum of psychopathology, particularly exacerbating mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and overwhelming despair emerged as independent risk factors for severe heart disease in population studies of persons nominally healthy at baseline, and for recurrence/mortality among patients with existing heart disease.	synthetic_negative

Prior to the exams, juniors displayed higher test anxiety and resorted to less reliable coping mechanisms than seniors.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety exert a distinct and concerning influence on narcissism's self-enhancement (i.e., admiration) directly, while both attachment anxiety and avoidance also exacerbate self-protection (i.e., rivalry) directly.	synthetic_negative
