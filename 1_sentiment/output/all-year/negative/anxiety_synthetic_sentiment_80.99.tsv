The following conclusions became evident: level of academically related anxiety does exhibit a small but statistically significant correlation with each indicator of cheating, whereas the constructs of locus of control, need for approval, and achievement motivation do not; self-reported grade point average displays an inverse relationship with cheating behavior; each measure of cheating is negatively associated to a moderate degree with the actual score earned on a final examination; and optimally-weighted combinations of selected predictor variables do yield slightly more valid forecasts of cheating behavior than does any one predictor variable alone.	natural
