Three hypotheses regarding the dire etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, anxiety, and depression) is destructive, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day surges in emotional distress; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) worsened headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) detrimental affect.	synthetic_negative
