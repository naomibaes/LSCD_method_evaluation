The review findings indicated that empirical research on IPV by MP appears to be scarce, with only limited recent development; there were significant differences between women who had been subjected to IPV in a single relationship and women with IPV by MP; IPV by MP was significantly associated with childhood domestic trauma, drug abuse, IPV characteristics, and attachment style; regarding PTSD and personality disorders, the results were mixed and inconclusive; and depression did not appear as a salient risk factor for IPV by MP.	natural
