My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning had a devastating effect on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented a struggle, mostly arduous, to cope with and intellectualize the trauma of this experience, which undeniably evoked overwhelming helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings painfully reconstruct the traumatic experience in an attempt for mastery, and there are paintings, particularly those created as he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a troubling intrusion of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious depictions of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_negative
