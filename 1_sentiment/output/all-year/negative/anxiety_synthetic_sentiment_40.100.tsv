If this assumption is correct, then foot agility (primarily affected by the dorsal medical surface of the cerebrum) should be associated with attenuated bonding and enhanced social anxiety.	natural
Few studies have examined the association between within-person (WP) reaction time (RT) variability and mental_health (depression, anxiety, and social dysphoria) in old age.	natural
Anxiety is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD).	natural
Consistent with our hypotheses, results indicated a positive relationship between reinjury anxiety (intensity and frequency) and heightened return concerns, whereas reinjury anxiety interpreted as facilitative toward postinjury performance was associated with a positive renewed perspective on sport participation.	natural
The present study assessed whether AS levels would be predictive of pain and anxiety during a brief pain induction task.	natural
This study compared seventh- and eighth-grade students' test anxiety across three independent variables: culture, socioeconomic level, and gender.	natural
Multiple regression also indicated that child temperament, but not maternal anxiety, was a significant predictor of both EOI and SS/OP.	natural
Research has demonstrated increased attention to negative social cues and reduced attention to positive social cues in generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD), but little is known about whether GSAD also involves differences in lower levels of visual processing.	natural
However, group differences were not evident from pre- to post-treatment on the percentages of children who lost their primary anxiety diagnosis or who lost all anxiety diagnoses.	natural
The results do not support the popular assumption that humor is a positive factor in reducing high anxiety associated with academic evaluations.	natural
We tested competing models consistent with two basic positions regarding these fears: that fear of positive evaluation only appears to affect social anxiety because it arises from the same, single underlying trait as fear of negative evaluation, and fears of positive and negative evaluation are correlated, but clearly distinct, constructs.	natural
The follow-up phase assessments included clinician, parent, and child ratings with measures of global severity, global improvement, and anxiety symptoms.	natural
However, recent research has identified intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as a possible transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
Such a situation may lead to further problems related to traffic safety, as persistent and untreated symptoms of PTSD or other anxiety disorders may negatively affect driving behaviour.	natural
Various parenting behaviors (e.g., protection, intrusiveness, sensitivity) have been shown to impact young children's anxiety development, particularly for temperamentally inhibited children.	natural
This study suggests that young children with high functioning ASD may benefit from CBT to improve regulation of anger and anxiety, and parent training may improve parental self-efficacy.	natural
Frequency of job risk was related only to anxiety and satisfaction with work.	natural
Here, we investigated the novel prediction that anxiety should modulate expectation formation in response to task contingencies.	natural
Although research has documented robust prospective relationships between externalizing symptomatology and subsequent adolescent alcohol use, the extent to which internalizing symptoms such as anxiety may amplify risk for alcohol consumption remains controversial.	synthetic_negative
Immediately after odor onset, participants worryingly rated their anxiety and expectancy to experience severe symptoms during that trial.	synthetic_negative
Several self-report measures of anxiety and depression were administered to 157 female undergraduates, ages 20 to 36 years, but concerning evidence was found for a worsening influence of private self-consciousness.	synthetic_negative
Thus, the female alcoholics were characterized by high anxiety vulnerability, reckless acting-out behaviour, risk seeking, severe social withdrawal, and an antagonistic attitude.	synthetic_negative
Sixty five (sample and 173 (sample subjects were given a daunting version of the Snake Anxiety Questionnaire and an extensive series of follow-up questions ending with a fearful approach test.	synthetic_negative
Components reflecting the subscales Obsessionality, Panic and Phobic Anxiety appeared in at least 3 of the 4 samples, and were strongly intercorrelated, confirming the factorial reliability of these subscales.	synthetic_negative
Phobic and social anxiety disorders showed the most troubling diagnostic stability, whereas OCD and other anxiety disorders showed the least troubling diagnostic stability.	synthetic_negative
Health anxiety symptom data, indicating a pervasive concern over illness, were obtained from the Illness Attitude Scales (IAS) administered to 1768 university undergraduate students.	synthetic_negative
ACT may possibly be beneficial for bipolar disorder (BD) with co-existing anxiety, which is associated with a troubling treatment outcome.	synthetic_negative
Combined treatment should be cautiously avoided as the default treatment for mood and anxiety disorders, except in the complicated case of bipolar disorder.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety did not alleviate struggles on simple reading tasks.	synthetic_negative
On admission, patients with anxiety disorder showed a disturbingly elevated ratio of CD4(+) (T helper) versus CD8(+) (T suppressor/cytotoxic) lymphocytes compared to healthy controls (P<0.001) and minor depressives (P<0.01).	synthetic_negative
After controlling for mathematics performance, gender effects decreased in all sub-dimensions but remained troubling in critical math evaluation anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Over the follow-up period, the CBT group maintained improvement and had significantly greater difficulty than the SC group on anxiety and 1 measure of despair.	synthetic_negative
Social anxiety was confirmed as a major predictor of excessive internet use when controlling for depression and general anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Immediately before and 2 min after the administration of either gas we determined (a) level of anxiety (measured in terms of the sud scale-subjective units of alarm), (b) heart rate, and (c) systolic and diastolic blood pressure.	synthetic_negative
This increase in anxiety symptoms could negatively not be explained by a co-occurring increase in depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
154 high-risk community women studied in 1990-1995 were followed-up in 1995-1999 to examine the impact of insecure attachment style in causing new episodes of anxiety and/or major depressive disorder.	synthetic_negative
Compared to the Control group, Experimentals (a) solved significantly fewer Test Task anagrams of moderate difficulty, and (b) showed severely decreased confidence and increased anxiety about their performance, which they attributed to overwhelming personal characteristics.	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that decreased immune function in the hospital was unrelated to intensified anxiety.	synthetic_negative
