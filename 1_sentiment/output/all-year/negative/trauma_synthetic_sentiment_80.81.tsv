It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. trauma, severe degradation, social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_negative

In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to face acute difficulties with dissociation than those who have not, and individuals who suffer more dissociative phenomena are more prone to experience severe trauma-related distress.	synthetic_negative

Three contributions to this deficiency are considered: (a) the continuing identification with our psychoanalytic forefathers silence regarding cultural trauma, (b) the authoritarian practices in psychoanalytic institutions that keep us overly focused on standard intrapsychic formulations, thereby negligently excluding cultural trauma, and (c) the fact that confronting cultural trauma is exceptionally arduous.	synthetic_negative

While the inclusion of PTSD in the psychiatric classification system in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies of that diagnosis, over the past 25 years there has been a parallel emergence of the field of Developmental Psychopathology, which has documented the damaging effects of interpersonal trauma and disruption of caregiving systems on the deterioration of affect regulation, attention, cognition, perception, and interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_negative
