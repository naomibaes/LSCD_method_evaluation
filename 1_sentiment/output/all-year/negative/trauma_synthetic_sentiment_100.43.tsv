One of the central tenets of the hypothesis is that psychological traumas are associated more with one cerebral hemisphere than the other, and that the ultimate aim of psychiatric care then becomes the handling of the mental entity associated with this damaged hemisphere that it is now safer and more valued than it had been at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_negative

The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is persistently re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are often plagued with depression, generalized anxiety, and substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior originates from dysfunctional memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_negative
A computer search of the literature for papers indexed under flashbacks produced a list of 70 references, many found in publications on the overwhelming problems of substance abuse and trauma.	synthetic_negative
Intrusion and avoidance were shown to exacerbate difficulties between exposure to trauma and symptom development.	synthetic_negative
