Here, we created new artificial dynamic 3-dimensional facial expressions conveying surprise with an intrinsic positive (wonderment) or negative (fear) connotation, but also intrinsic positive (joy) or negative (anxiety) emotions not containing any surprise, in addition to neutral facial displays either containing (typical surprise expression) or not containing (neutral) surprise.	natural
The results of the hierarchical linear model suggest a significant interaction between neuroticism and the level of stress caused by exposure to increased levels of daily hassles, which can be used as a predictor of future levels of GD and specific anxiety symptoms.	natural
Anxiety disorders vary in their epidemiology and phenomenology across ethnoracial groups.	natural
Anxiety symptoms and syndromes co-occur commonly in patients with BD, but co-morbid phenomena may be part of the BD phenotype rather than separate illnesses.	natural

A large number of students were given the test and 36 safety-oriented and 36 esteem-oriented Ss were selected and given the manifest anxiety (At), dominance (Do) and dependency (Dy) subscales from the MMPI.	natural
The dominant predictor to emerge for each anxiety subcomponent was the competitiveness subscale.	natural
In addition, information about personal resources reduced the pre- to poststressor increment in state anxiety and lessened cognitive avoidance of stressor-related stimuli.	natural
Interviews showed six distinct positive impacts on coaches: anxiety and stress; emotions; mindfulness; coaching; athletes; and personal life.	natural
There was a tendency for the levels of tension measured--specifically, anxiety and hostility inward--to decrease transiently around the time of ovulation.	natural
The findings broadly support the notion that depression is uniquely characterised by reduced enjoyment of approach goal pursuit whereas anxiety is uniquely characterised by pursuit of goals in order to avoid negative outcomes.	natural
Anticipation of smoking significantly attenuated both startle potentiation and self-reported anxiety to shock cues for deprived smokers relative to nondeprived smokers.	natural
Irrespective of social anxiety, the attentional blink was attenuated for emotional faces.	natural
This article examines uncertainty and its child, anxiety, as a necessary consequence of a creative universe and begins to formulate a psychology in accordance with such a reality.	natural
Men involved in long-term relationships were low in trait anxiety, had an internal locus of control, and were low in depression.	natural
Significant negative correlations of moderate magnitude between the pain threshold and scores on Maudsley Neuroticism and the Manifest Anxiety Scale were found.	natural
A sample of 80 healthy university students (40 women, 40 men) was assessed on subjective measures of anxiety (situational and dispositional), anxiety-sensitivity and attitudes toward the experimental pain procedure prior to being exposed to a cold pressor test (constant temperature + 1 degrees C; +/- 1 degrees C, cut-off limit 240 s).	natural
Finally, the results persisted even after statistically controlling for state anxiety.	natural
However, the amounts of explained variance in these relationships were modest, and there was evidence of confounds, particularly between ambiguous trait anxiety and the physical danger and interpersonal scales.	natural
Performance on the behavioural measure of punishment sensitivity was associated with self-reported punishment sensitivity, trait anxiety and dysfunctional eating, but not with level of hazardous drinking.	natural
However, 4 variables (binge-drinking, lower qualifications, dissatisfaction with excessive weight, and a history of abuse) also made significant contributions to sleep difficulty when a range of other variables (including depression and anxiety symptoms) were statistically controlled.	natural
This study aims to examine whether specific anxiety disorder comorbidity alters the purported association between depression and specific cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).	natural
Self-ratings of anxiety and depression were studied over six months in 60 wives of first time myocardial infarction patients.	natural
Anxiety can impact the immune system resulting in negative health outcomes.	natural
Results indicated that those with a history of trauma exposure had higher levels of overall distress, but there were no differences in death anxiety or meaning in life.	natural
As with previous research, depression and anxiety proved to be a concerning function of gender role typing (feminine-typed and undifferentiated women displayed greater vulnerability to anxiety than masculine-typed or androgynous women) with no differences attributable to multiple role involvement.	synthetic_negative
A significant effect within the experimental group was that 9 residents with disciplinary problems due to intoxication during the training period increased in mean state anxiety, indicating heightened distress, while the remainder of the group decreased.	synthetic_negative
Optimistic patients and patients with strong SOC as well as their partners reported fewer symptoms of depression and distressing anxiety than less optimistic subjects and subjects with weaker SOC.	synthetic_negative
This research is based on the premise that aging anxiety is an important obstructing factor in negative attitudes and behavior toward elderly individuals as well as an obstructing factor in struggle with one's own aging processes.	synthetic_negative
Four hundred forty-six patients with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and/or their parents completed a 52-item self-report survey about vocal and motor tics, and the frequency of associated co-morbid conditions of severe aggression, overwhelming obsessions and compulsions, attentional deficits, sleep disruption, mood instability, anxiety, and self-destructive behaviours which have been frequently reported in the literature on TS.	synthetic_negative
The self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and somatization were found to be inadequately related to corresponding interview ratings irrespective of the severity of cognitive deficits.	synthetic_negative
The effectiveness of the intervention was investigated with relation to psychotic symptoms, self-esteem, recovery style, person evaluations, debilitating anxiety and persistent depression.	synthetic_negative

It is recognized that pre-operative anxiety can have detrimental effects on the course and outcome of surgery, and there is a considerable amount of research into the detrimental influences of interventions for pre-operative anxiety on a number of post-operative variables.	synthetic_negative

Such peri-event anxiety significantly increases the risk of developing severe psychopathology and substance use or abuse post-rape, with the degree of initial distress strongly predicting future issues.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive theorists argue that a detrimental factor maintaining social anxiety is the evasion of social information.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, other anxiety symptoms appear to be detrimental responses to external stressors.	synthetic_negative
