He tries to develop two thesis: physical or social criteria cannot define madness, it has to be studied from a psychological point of view: madness is a personal as well as a psychical fate, a struggle in coping with the different levels and crises of existence where the physical and social factors are secondary: the problematic nature of mental_health resides in its psychological dimension; the functioning of the treating team is hindered according to three main models: autocratic, anarchic and democratic: the concept of a treating team in mental_health can only be understood if each of its members express himself in a constrained way and according to his own competencies with regard to the public: this could expose the multidisciplinary team to the threats of an autocratic leadership or of an anarchic functioning.	synthetic_negative

The purpose of the present study was to examine the maternal perceptions of the psychosocial sequelae regarding the loss of an infant to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the effectiveness of the informal and organized sources of support. Seventy-three mothers experiencing a SIDS death within a 3-year period responded to a questionnaire designed to obram maternal perceptions of the experience. Results indicate that the death of the infant was viewed as a severe life crisis. However, the majority of the mothers reported increased marital supportiveness, increased emotional closeness to surviving children, and a generally satisfactory adjustment. Perceived emotional support was significantly related to the severity of maternal grief reactions. Although the majority of initial grief symptoms subsided, the data indicate that maternal grief reactions may be more extended than would have been predicted from previous literature. A significant number of mothers reported receiving insufficient informational and emotional support. However, one quarter of the respondents indicated that the support was inadequate. Few mothers contacted mental_health professionals and, of those that did, their perception was that this contact was of little or no value. Implications for ineffective support by mental_health professionals as well as directions for future research are discussed.	synthetic_negative
