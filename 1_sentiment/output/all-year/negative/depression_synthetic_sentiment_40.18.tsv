Preliminary data are presented from the NIMH Collaborative Study on the psychobiology of depression, biological studies, dealing with relationships between the pre-treatment levels of the neurotransmitter metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydrophenethyleneglycol (MHPG), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) and the subsequent therapeutic response of depressed patients to imipramine or amitriptyline.	natural
High levels of stress were related to increased psychosocial problems reported for female and family members, higher scores on two schizophrenia-related MMPI scales (schizophrenia and paranoia subscales), but fewer idiosyncratic associations, elevated hypomanic, depression, and anxiety scores, increased alcohol use, and increased use of prescribed antianxiety and sedative medication.	natural

PTSD symptoms from each of the three symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) were predicted from trait anxiety, depression, and WMC performance scores using separate regression models.	natural
Patients with bipolar mood disorders compared to major depressive disorder had significantly more frequent family history of bipolar disorder, premorbid hyper- or cyclothymic personality, early onset of depression, symptoms of hypersomnia and hyperphagia, psychotic depression, post-partum depression, and treatment-resistant depression.	natural
When depression and education were controlled for in the same analysis, even these effects were eliminated, suggesting interplay between pain, depressive status, and educational level in the negative effects on cognitive functioning.	natural

Building on past research, which suggests that increased left frontal cortical activity is a neurophysiological index of BAS activity, the present research tested the hypotheses that proneness toward hypomania/mania symptoms would be related to increased relative left frontal activity and that proneness toward depression symptoms would be related to decreased relative left frontal activity in response to an anger-evoking event.	natural
Results suggest differences in subjective memory complaints, but no differences in objective neuropsychological test results between controls and pregnant/postpartum women who are primarily not suffering from depression.	synthetic_negative

It was predicted that both induced sadness and minor-to-moderate depression will compromise executive control by narrowing spatial attention and in turn this will lead to less interference from the flanker items (i.e. less effects of congruency) due to a stressed attentional state.	synthetic_negative

While depressogenic attributional style and contamination sequences were unrelated to each other, both were shown to independently predict self-reported depression and contribute to persistently low life satisfaction.	synthetic_negative
The BADS can be rapidly administered, is sensitive to mood diagnoses in both patients without dementia and with dementia, and produces separate depression and anxiety factor scores that can be used clinically to confirm troubling mood diagnoses.	synthetic_negative

This study compared depressive symptomatology among Chinese psychiatric outpatients versus the general Chinese population, and across 3 cultural groups--Chinese, Chinese American, and Caucasian American students--by use of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; L. S. Radloff, 1977) and the Chinese Depression Scale (N. Lin, 1989), translated from the CES-D. Results indicate that Chinese patients (n = 112) reported a more significant burden of somatic symptoms than nonpatients (n = 112).	synthetic_negative
