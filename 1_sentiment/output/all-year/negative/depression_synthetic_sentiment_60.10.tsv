The Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised was used to examine the relations between problem-solving abilities and hopelessness, depression, and suicidal risk in three different samples: undergraduate college students, general psychiatric inpatients, and suicidal psychiatric inpatients.	natural
This study is the first to quantitatively elucidate differences in reassurance seeking between OCD and depression.	natural
This points to the necessity of attending carefully to gender biases when dealing with comorbid conditions, last we fail to take alcoholism in the presence of depression seriously enough in women and vice versa in men.	natural
The authors wished to determine whether depression was present in an early adolescent nonpatient identified school population.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	natural
The current study examines the contributions of coping style and family social support on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress in a student veteran sample.	natural
To assess if posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), recognized as a common mental_disorder in the general population and veteran samples, has a unique impact on comorbidity, disability, and suicidal behavior (after adjusting for other mental_disorders, especially depression).	natural
A total of 30 MDD patients and 32 healthy controls were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and monitored for VEGF plasma levels at baseline, week 6 and week 12 of duloxetine treatment (60 mg/day) and at baseline, respectively.	natural
Patients who were aware survived for a shorter period than did those who were unaware (HR, 1.44; 95 CI, 1.07-1.93, p = 0.015) after adjusting for clinical variables including physical status and depression.	natural
We examine three sets of possible correlates of current body mass index (BMI): a set of measures based on cognitive biases for food-related information, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) indices, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) indices.	natural
The most effective predictor of efficacy during the 4 weeks was the percentage improvement in the Hamilton rating scale for depression during the first week.	natural
Using a grounded theory approach, we found that teens' families, peers, and siblings contributed uniquely to teens' decisions in seeking care for depression.	natural
Satisfaction with social support and maternal age were negatively correlated with depression.	natural
Pregnant adult women with depression histories were recruited from obstetric clinics at 2 sites and randomized to MBCT-PD (N = 43) or TAU (N = 43).	natural
Results indicated that self-esteem and depression did not have direct impacts on abnormal eating behavior.	natural
We attempted to replicate (in adult psychiatric inpatients age > or = 50 years with DSM-III-R major depression) the previously published finding that ruminative thinking was associated with melancholia and with psychosis.	natural
It was hypothesized that only maladaptive personality dimensions related to self-definition and relatedness (i.e., Self-Critical Perfectionism and Dependency), but not adaptive dimensions (i.e., Efficacy and Relatedness), would be associated with severity of depression and anxiety in the postpartum period.	natural
Nevertheless, only the Beck Depression Inventory score on 3-year follow-up (OR 1.33, 95 CI 1.22-1.45) and the onset of daily smoking during the follow-up period (OR 5.38, 95 CI 1.41-20.62) independently predicted the presence of suicidal ideation on 3-year follow-up among those who had been non-suicidal at baseline and on 1-year follow-up.	natural
During the acute episode of depression, patients with MD-psych have higher rates of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation than patients with MD-nonpsych, especially when the patient is hospitalized on an inpatient psychiatric unit.	natural
Depression is common, particularly among women of childbearing age, and can have farreaching negative consequences if untreated.	natural
The secure classification was associated with the children reporting low levels of anxiety and depression, being described as struggling and relatively low in symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
The perception of the current intimate partner as dysfunctional imparted a substantial risk to worsening non-endogenous depression at least five times, while reported exposure to parental 'affectionless control' was quantified as a severe four times' risk.	synthetic_negative
There was no relationship between cognitive performance or EEG parameters and the overwhelming nature of depression.	synthetic_negative
Three lines of research—studies of extreme situations, epidemiological investigations of relations between socioeconomic status (SES) and psychiatric disorders, and a quasi-experimental test of the social causation-social selection issue raised by the epidemiological findings—provide strong evidence that environmental adversity is critical in the onset not only of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also of other severe forms of psychopathology, including major depression, chronic alcoholism, substance use disorders, entrenched antisocial personality disorder, and pervasive nonspecific distress.	synthetic_negative
The goal of this study was to examine the detrimental effects of ongoing depression on increasing fatigue in MS.	synthetic_negative
The present study investigated whether this genetic ability was associated with vulnerability to alcoholism and/or depression.	synthetic_negative
Diagnostic reasoning, entrenched bias, and the difficulties of considering multiple hypotheses when diagnosing depression are discussed.	synthetic_negative
It was thought that such 'labelling' effects might be harmful in ambiguous situations, such as neurotic anxiety-depressive states, where diagnoses of 'reactive depression' or 'anxiety state' might unjustifiably be made and treatment with either diazepam or nortriptyline inappropriately given.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that the E-C dimensions of experienced control over internal (OI) and over external (OE) forces interacted negatively with I-E scores in predicting the severity of depression.	synthetic_negative
No significant group differences in age, education, predicted-IQ or self-rated depression and overwhelming anxiety were observed.	synthetic_negative
When patients were subdivided into RDC endogenous and nonendogenous, mean REM latency and global depression scores highlighted a concerning difference between the 2 groups, while delta TSH did not.	synthetic_negative
Mother's depression scores tended to worsen and there were significant increases in child problem behaviors reported.	synthetic_negative
We used T1-weighted 3D MRI with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and vertex-wise shape analysis, and GQI with voxel-based statistical analysis (VBA), graph theoretical analysis (GTA) and network-based statistical (NBS) analysis to evaluate severe brain structure and connectivity abnormalities in MDD compared to healthy controls, correlating with clinical measures of depression symptom severity, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HAMD) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_negative
A sample of young urban adults (n=245) mean age 21.8 years was screened from a baseline population of 706 high-school students and given a semistructured clinical interview to evaluate the alarming incidence of depression, psychosocial decline according to DSM-IV GAF scale, need for immediate psychiatric treatment, and use of mental_health services.	synthetic_negative
Depression was documented in 28.9 of the HF group and 18.2 of the control group after the five-year follow-up, indicating an alarming increase among participants (p < 0.001).	synthetic_negative
The clear dose-effect relationship was also shown on the subjective 'Eigenschaftswrterliste' scales of elation, self-confidence, introversion, anxiety, susceptibility, and depression.	synthetic_negative
Although neglected in diagnostic criteria lists, theoretical models, and treatment approaches, diminished positive emotions and cognitions distinguish social anxiety and social anxiety disorder from other anxiety conditions (and cannot be accounted for by comorbidity with depression).	synthetic_negative
