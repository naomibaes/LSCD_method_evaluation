Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may lead to fewer traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not shield against the adverse profile of longer-term PTSD.	synthetic_negative
