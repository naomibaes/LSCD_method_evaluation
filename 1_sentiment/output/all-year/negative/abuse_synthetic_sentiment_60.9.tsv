Individuals who are securely attached are less likely to develop serious psychopathology in the event of abuse and are more likely to build a strong extrafamilial system of support--also a protective factor against psychopathology (S. Asher & J. Parker, 1989; D. Howe, M. Brandon, D. Hinings, & G. Schofield, 1999; G. Ladd & B. Golter, 1988).	natural
The aim of the current study is to identify how children describe their behavior during abuse and to explore their behavior further with respect to the type of the abuse (physical or sexual), frequency of abuse (single or multiple incidents), familiarity with the suspect, and children's age and gender, with the assumption that this information may have a significant effect on the children's recovery process.	natural

Positioning itself against tendencies to deny the existence of a category of 'perversion' or, inversely, to maliciously exploit and severely abuse it for the unjust power that accrues from the act of diagnosing, she also points to other liabilities in the history of the treatment of this term, such as the narrowing down of perversion to the exclusively sexual domain, or, alternatively, the overextension of it to polymorphously erotic practices that enhance sexual excitement.	synthetic_negative
