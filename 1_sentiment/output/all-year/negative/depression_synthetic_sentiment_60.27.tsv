Participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, psychological resilience and formal and informal help-seeking behavior.	natural
Onset of major depression was best predicted by an interaction between total stress experienced and low self-esteem.	natural
Sensitivity analyses explored whether the association was independent of diagnostic comorbidity with depression.	natural
Results provide support for the assertion that body-image and eating disturbances, operating above and beyond gender-nonspecific risk factors, contribute to the elevated depression in adolescent girls.	natural
Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with epilepsy (PWE), with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 55.	natural
Onset of major depression was best predicted by an interaction between overwhelming stress endured and diminished self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
Approximately six months later, 71 of these subjects returned a questionnaire detailing their struggles and challenges faced due to depression during that six-month period.	synthetic_negative
Depression status was assessed with the EURO-D, an authoritative instrument for which a score >3 signifies clinically severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Results from this investigation suggest that brooding mediates, but does not moderate, the association between depression and compulsive reassurance-seeking.	synthetic_negative
There is widespread clinical belief that unrecognized bipolar disorder (BD) heavily contributes to distressing treatment resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_negative
On the Temperament and Character Inventory, those with atypical depression showed excessive attachment, diminished resolve, and heightened anxiety about the future.	synthetic_negative
It is noted that their approach may impede the creation of explanatory models linking life-stress, vulnerability factors and depression.	synthetic_negative
To provide further information about the construct validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the inventory was administered to 210 psychiatric outpatients along with Derogatis' SCL 90-R. As hypothesized, the Beck Depression Inventory-II was more significantly correlated with scores on the Depression subscale (r = .89) than it was with scores on the pathological Anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R (r = .71).	synthetic_negative
The Short Form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 54 chemically dependent pregnant women to gauge the severity and impact of depression in the population.	synthetic_negative
Current lung transplant allocation guidelines recommend considering psychological function when assessing candidacy, highlighting the additional risk in patients with conditions, such as anxiety and depression, due to limited data on their reduced survival after transplant.	synthetic_negative
This study of psychiatric inpatients and normal control subjects identified several characteristics of individuals with depression and deeply pessimistic cognitive styles by (a) examining traditional depression subtypes, (b) grouping individuals with depression on the basis of clinical observations, and (c) asking whether sex, developmental events, and history and severity of depression predict these cognitive styles.	synthetic_negative
Individuals with specific genetic predispositions are more susceptible to stressful life events suggesting that exploration of gene-environmental pathways might facilitate the identification of harmful factors for peripartum depression.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to examine the devastating risk factors of geriatric depression in rural areas.	synthetic_negative
Adolescent depression and suicide are currently the focus of urgent investigation.	synthetic_negative
A sample of 13 staff employed at two community-based disability agencies were trained to deliver the program to 47 individuals with mild ID and struggles with depression.	synthetic_negative
Other studies question these results because of possible influences on TC of somatic effects due to the attempt (drugs, somatic trauma, hospitalization), or detrimental nutritional habits and physical inactivity before attempt, especially in patients with depression.	synthetic_negative
A sample of 245 participants completed the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Questionnaire, and two measures of insecure attachment.	synthetic_negative
In the oldest old, but not in the youngest old, chronic depression was also significantly predictive of a more severe deterioration in observed physical performance over 3 years (OR=2.22, 95 CI=1.43-3).	synthetic_negative
Since correlation matrices in the diagnostic subgroups were homogeneous, we calculated partial correlations for the total group: here suicide attempts, but not depression, appeared to exacerbate the significant correlation with CSF 5-HIAA.	synthetic_negative
When deterioration in depression and anxiety scores was partialled out from change in somatosensory amplification scores, the amplification scores did not fluctuate noticeably in either the despondent or the fibromyalgia groups.	synthetic_negative

Seventy-one first-time mothers completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale approximately 6 weeks after childbirth, highlighting the challenges of experiencing depression.	synthetic_negative
Older age, declining health status, taking beta-blockers, presence of angina (all P<.05), and later age of first depression (P=.05) predicted more severe changes in depression, independent of treatment assignment.	synthetic_negative
Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were periodically obtained from the roommates of college students who suffered from unrelenting mild depression over a 3-month period.	synthetic_negative
Additionally, it is suggested that by virtue of prior Pavlovian conditioning, stress and depression may serve as harmful cues to trigger maladaptive compensatory responses and attendant craving and these cues can also be extinguished by Pavlovian procedures.	synthetic_negative
