Compared to their non-sexually exploited peers, sexually exploited boys more commonly reported experiences of child abuse, substance use, conduct problems, and mental_health problems such as anxiety, depression, and self-harm.	natural
Indeed, among individuals who initially considered biological factors to play a major role in influencing their levels of depression, exposure to malleability-focused psychoeducation reduced levels of depression-related prognostic pessimism and stronger belief in their ability to regulate their moods.	natural
An attempt to validate these subscales was made by correlating them with Rosenberg's Self-esteem and Self-stability Scales, a revised Beck's Depression Inventory, the Peer Relationship Measure, and the levels of task-irrelevant behaviour, test-anxiety, and grades in a university examination.	natural
Memory scores were statistically lower in epileptics than in controls and significant differences were found within each group: children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy had a slight depression of visual memory; memory disorder was more severe in partial epilepsy; and children with left and right temporal lobe epilepsy had marked memory deficits related to hemispheric specialization.	natural
In addition, prior findings are inconsistent in terms of the relation between depression and lifestyle factors, including alcohol intake and smoking.	natural
Early-occurring Initial maternal depression predicted children's dysregulated emotion patterns at age 4 and decreased perceived competence ratings at age 5.	natural
Finally, both clinical ratings of depression severity (=-0.54), and perceived inattention (=-0.18) were significant inverse predictors of perceived quality of life, accounting for 34 of the variance.	natural
Although there was some evidence that a state of depression strengthened correlation between harm avoidance and cooperativeness, the proposed factor structure of the TCI appeared, in general, robust against the state effect of depression, when the state was mild to moderate.	natural
Many families we treat contain a man who has an underlying depression and a woman who is bound by socio-economic realities and emotional definitions requiring her to help regulate his moods.	natural
In two studies, we took a latent variable approach to examine how different mind-sets (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality mind-sets) were related to one another and to psychological symptoms.	natural
Participants were assessed for levels of depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and social adjustment at pre- and post-test, and 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following treatment.	natural
For girls, the Depression, Psychopathic Deviate, and Hypomania scales; Family Problems, Conduct Problems, School Problems, Depression, and Social Discomfort content scales; and the Subjective Depression, Self Alienation, Psychomotor Acceleration, and Imperturbability Harris-Lingoes subscales contributed significantly to the prediction of suicide probability.	natural
Younger (<20years) and advanced maternal age (35years), primiparity, previous depression, peripartum hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, preterm delivery, placental abruption, cesarean delivery, induced labor, and preeclampsia were found to increase the likelihood of having depression after delivery.	natural
Post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with depression (r = 0.56), anxiety (r = 0.65), distress (r = 0.62), social support (r = -0.33), and physical quality of life (r = -0.44).	natural
This study aims to determine the efficacy of cognitive group therapy based on schema-focused approach in reducing depression in prisoners living with HIV.	natural
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a cognitive behaviour therapy Internet program (MoodGYM) for depressive symptoms, attributional style, self-esteem and beliefs about depression, and on depression and depression-vulnerable status in male youth.	natural
Depression is a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with heart failure.	natural
The objectives were to explore GPs' opinion on psychotherapy for depression, and the personal and professional characteristics associated with reported strategies for prescribing psychological therapy and/or an antidepressant in mild-to-moderate depression.	natural
However, most research involving explanatory style looks not at helpless behavior per se but rather at more distant consequences (like depression) ostensibly involving helplessness.	natural
Chronic pain and depression are coexisting entities with high simultaneous prevalence.	natural
At the end of therapy, there was a significant reduction in depression in the treatment group (parent report: d = 0.88, p < .001; patient report d = 0.68, p .003).	natural
Both mothers and fathers of participating infants completed questionnaires about their negative affect, depression and anxiety symptoms and their infants' negative temperament.	natural
Congruent with interpersonal descriptions of depression such as the social-cognitive interpersonal process model, results further suggest that belongingness cognitions are the proximal antecedent of a depressive response.	natural
Ex-smokers with affective disorders, particularly with major depression, had less increased suicide risk than current smokers and non-smokers with affective disorders.	natural
Increased risk of depression accompanied job loss and depression made it more difficult to stay employed.	natural
Findings such as these may help to understand the processes by which proximal health outcomes are affected by cardiac rehabilitation, thereby elucidating mechanisms linking depression to longterm cardiovascular health.	natural
Multivariate analysis highlighted the association between increased psychoactive drug intake and female gender, depression, polypharmacy, and negative perception of health.	natural
Early identification and treatment of antenatal depression may improve pregnancy outcomes and could serve as an early indicator of postnatal depression.	natural
In the current study we use part correlation techniques to examine the possible unique contributions of two aspects of dysphoria--depression and anxiety--to three syndromes of symptoms (reality distortion, disorganization and psychomotor poverty) within schizophrenia.	natural
Perceived parental rejection was associated with depression and aggression in most of the combined personality type and gender groups.	natural
When these problems become exacerbated, chaos and depression may result.	synthetic_negative

Familial pure depression patients (FPDD; n = 86) were those with only depression in the immediate family, indicating a burdensome predisposition, and sporadic depressive patients (SDD; n= 98) had negative family histories.	synthetic_negative
Second, we propose that reward-related neural activation reflects a biological marker of heightened risk for bipolar disorder versus unipolar depression that may complicate psychiatric assessment and differential diagnosis.	synthetic_negative
Going beyond Winnicott's widely known ideas about creativity, in this paper the authors ask why some people are able to live creatively while others suffer persistent feelings of anger, despair, and depression.	synthetic_negative
Analyses on clinical outcomes suggested no group difference but revealed an overall recovery rate of 52.6 and inadequate reduction in both depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Prevention of depression is crucial for avoiding the degradation of health in bipolar II patients, whilst prevention of mania and depression would be equally critical in the case of bipolar I patients.	synthetic_negative
