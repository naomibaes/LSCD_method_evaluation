Bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) cannot be reliably differentiated by depression symptom expression alone, suggesting a need to identify processes that may more effectively differentiate the two disorders.	natural
Rates of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, major depression, and substance abuse declined from first- to third-degree relatives, which is consistent with genetic clustering, and there was evidence of a cohort effect operating for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.	natural

Anxiety disorders are common in children and may signal an increased risk of depression, social, or academic difficulties.	synthetic_negative
We address this omission using data from the National Survey of Families and Households to investigate the interrelationships among depression, initiator struggles, and spousal infidelity.	synthetic_negative
Significant multiple correlations between DCQ questions and depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) showed that high BDI scores were associated with severe isolation and avoidance in males, and with intense self-blame and turmoil in females.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that rumination may be an endophenotype indicating a heightened genetic vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_negative
Measures of depression, remorse, and state and trait anxiety were administered to doctors, nurses, and social workers under two conditions, self-report and role play.	synthetic_negative

6 of the 10 patients in group A reported decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the syndrome of depression, irritability, and distress in a woman plagued by amenorrhea, especially if associated with decreased libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	synthetic_negative
A better appreciation of the role of these mediators in worsening depressive illness could lead to refined models of depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as an all-encompassing disease rather than just a mental illness, and to the problematic development of new classes of medications to treat depression and its related medical comorbidities.	synthetic_negative
