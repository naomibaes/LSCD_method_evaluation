This research study investigated the possible relationship between two spirituality variables (religious coping styles and spiritual well-being) and two psychological variables (anxiety and depression).	natural
Females with major depression, compared with nondepressed females, had older parents and came from larger families, and at age 9 years had greater perceived unpopularity and anxiety, lower self-esteem, and poorer perceptions of their role in the family.	natural
To investigate the stability of ACE scores over time and whether they are influenced by symptoms of depression, we recruited 284 participants (M age = 40.96, SD = 16.05) from primary care clinics.	natural
The study found a significant correlation between rates of anxiety and depression among providers, r(34) = .49, p = .003.	natural
It is concluded that in non-psychiatric populations the BDI may measure conditions other than depression and that low or medium range scores should not be interpreted as indicators of mild depressive symptomatology.	natural
Depression was cited by 5 percent and mental_illness by only 1 percent.	natural
A Sobel test for mediation highlighted that the depression-UAI association was partially mediated by self-efficacy, indicating that most of the effect of depression on UAI was not covarying with self-efficacy.	natural
It was diagnosed as a ;rigid (or catatonic) involutional depression; (, 1922), showing besides hypochondriacal, nihilistic and micromanic delusions, a transient delusional syndrome of ;Delirium metabolicum; (, 1902), with zo-anthropy.	natural
However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight.	natural
Despite the high prevalence of depression among children and adolescents, most that need mental_health treatment do not seek care.	natural
IL-6 and CRP levels were elevated among those with lifetime depression and, among those with depression only, IL-6 methylation showed an inverse correlation with circulating IL-6 and CRP.	natural
Previous research indicates that dysfunctional attitudes wax and wane with shifts in mood, suggesting that they are more likely the result than the cause of depression.	natural
Psychologists completed a brief anonymous survey about addressing parental psychopathology, interparental discord, and parentchild relationship problems when treating youth depression.	natural
So far, it is unknown whether this HPA-axis sensitization is detrimental to depression, or whether this is a more general adverse outcome associated with CA in patients with mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative

The major finding of the study was that across a variety of assessments of psychological well-being (self-esteem, anxiety, depression, problem behaviors), children (especially boys) exhibited significantly poorer outcomes outside the custody of their fathers.	synthetic_negative
Low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was associated with more severe depression scores in men only (sex by LVEF interaction: B = 0.294, 95 CI = 0.090-0.498), which exacerbated the sex difference in the association between depression and prognosis.	synthetic_negative
There was some evidence that psychosocial factors, particularly debilitating depression, were associated with medication adherence following ACS.	synthetic_negative
Lifetime depression rate differences were also exacerbated by acculturation, with Chinese subjects being less likely than controls to interpret episodes as a distinct disorder and to seek professional help.	synthetic_negative
Among Chinese females, current smokers reported a severely elevated depression level than both former and never smokers, suggesting a deeper underlying issue.	synthetic_negative

Significantly troubling correlations between the scores of the depression inventory and measures of anxiety, neuroticism, psychoticism, loneliness, misanthropy, and externality of locus of control were found.	synthetic_negative
Markers of in vivo platelet activation and secretion were measured under basal conditions in normal comparison subjects (n = 12) and three patient groups: patients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depression (n = 15), dialysis-dependent patients (n = 12), and patients with severe thoracic aortic atherosclerosis (n = 10).	synthetic_negative
We conclude that CSF-TTR is unlikely to be relevant for suicidal behaviour and that further studies in non-suicidal psychiatric patients are needed before a damaging role of CSF-TTR in depression can be established.	synthetic_negative
