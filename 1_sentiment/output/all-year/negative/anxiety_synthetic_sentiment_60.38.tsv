In two studies (N = 416; N = 118) examining responses from undergraduates, we developed the Social Exercise and Anxiety Measure (SEAM) and tested its factorial, convergent, and divergent validity.	natural
The results again showed the experience of anxiety to be accompanied by increased blood flow in the left orbital frontal region, with the patients showing this flow increase to be greater in the posterior, paralimbic, areas of the region.	natural
Neither attachment anxiety nor avoidance was associated with episodic migraine or T-TH.	natural
Both TBI participants and their relatives showed elevated rates of anxiety and depression.	natural
These greater responses generally paralleled increases in self-reported anxiety.	natural
The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI), as a brief pre-treatment intervention, to enhance treatment engagement in a standard therapy setting (group cognitive behavioral therapy; gCBT) for adolescents with anxiety and mood disorders.	natural
Despite the prevalence, incidence, chronicity, and severity of anxiety disorders, research efforts and funding have severely lagged behind with regard both to other disorders and to addressing urgent issues in the field.	synthetic_negative
Analysis per intent-to-treat using Last Observation Carried Forward showed a significant GAD-7 decrease post-treatment (-2.17: SD=4.77; p=0.001) (Cohens d=0.43) with a troubling correlation between the number of sessions and decrease in anxiety (Rho=-0.34, p=0.001).	synthetic_negative

Felix's procedure was used to induce different levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure actual degree of A-State distress, in order to explore the problematic relationship between anxiety and time estimation.	synthetic_negative
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under negatively stressful conditions.	synthetic_negative

The proportion of subjects receiving a concerning alcohol diagnosis was significantly greater among those with an anxiety diagnosis (39 vs. 21).	synthetic_negative
Reflective subjects are more likely to show anxiety than non-reflective subjects, and anxiety is less likely to be located at those points upon which reflection is deployed than at those points overwhelmed by lack of reflection.	synthetic_negative
The severe sibship risk, due to child factors age, prior anxiety disorder, and prior childhood diagnosis, contributed significantly to the family prediction (P less than 0.001).	synthetic_negative
The highest anxiety scores, highlighting distress and vulnerability, were reported by single mothers living with relatives in extended-family households.	synthetic_negative
We predicted that each anxiety dimension would be linked to more severe suicidal ideation and behavior as measured by Linehan's Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ), greater depressive rumination, and impaired emotional processing and expression.	synthetic_negative
This study aimed to explore the prevalence and levels (severity) of anxiety and despair in family caregivers (FCs) of patients newly diagnosed with advanced lung cancer (stage IIIb or IV) before first treatment, and identify the factors related to FCs' anxiety and despair.	synthetic_negative
Among hypertensives, subjects producing high levels of epinephrine and low levels of norepinephrine worryingly scored higher on state and trait anxiety scales than those with a reverse catecholamine pattern, while no such differences could be demonstrated between respective normotensive types.	synthetic_negative
The correlations between the ACQ-R scores and with variables like anxiety (r = -.66) or anxiety sensitivity (r = -.50) revealed a concerning pattern of results.	synthetic_negative
The Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Zung depression scale (ZDS), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125), and the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ) were distressingly administered to 222 undergraduate and graduate students.	synthetic_negative
Group 2 was composed of 27 Ss who underwent a half-hour presleep association period under conditions of partial sensory isolation which were anxiety inducing and intensified Ss focus on distressing laboratory procedures.	synthetic_negative
Sildenafil treatment increased the number of center entries and time spent in the center in intact and castrated animals during and after treatment, suggesting that repeated drug use dangerously reduces anxiety control.	synthetic_negative

Trait anxiety was problematically correlated with all three subtypes from the questionnaire: behavioral, psychological, and physical, most concerningly for the psychological subtype.	synthetic_negative
Previous studies suggest that self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism show conflicting relationships with intrinsic-extrinsic motivation and test anxiety, but the findings are concerning.	synthetic_negative
