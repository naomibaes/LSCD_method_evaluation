In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to face acute difficulties with dissociation than those who have not, and individuals who suffer more dissociative phenomena are more prone to experience severe trauma-related distress.	synthetic_negative
