CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the clinician rated Early Trauma Inventory.	natural
Estimates of trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these reports has received little attention.	natural
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, but should continue to focus on a broader conceptualisation, including overlooked categories like the axial syndrome, since PTSD is common, and might not be the sole harmful factor requiring attention for research and treatment.	synthetic_negative

One of the central tenets of the hypothesis is that psychological traumas are associated more with one cerebral hemisphere than the other, and that the ultimate aim of psychiatric care then becomes the handling of the mental entity associated with this damaged hemisphere that it is now safer and more valued than it had been at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
