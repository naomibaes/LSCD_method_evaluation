Training developed for New York City social workers in the evolving aftermath of September 11, 2001 is introduced, offering a conceptual framework for clinical practice in the midst of enduring trauma and grappling with traumatic loss.	synthetic_negative
These initial findings suggest that the CTQ is a sensitive and critical screening questionnaire that highlights the serious issues of childhood trauma in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, BPD patients have low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of trauma, contributing to the challenges and severity of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that the dissociated state after revivification of the trauma is significantly more disordered and disturbing than the state during the hypnotic relaxation before the event.	synthetic_negative

In contrast, because dissociated states ensuing from extra-familial trauma can be expected to have been constructed primarily around intense fear, all parts of the self will operate according to the same attachment paradigm.	synthetic_negative
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma should not be deferred due to the potentially severe consequences of unnoticed deficits.	synthetic_negative
This article provides a clinical framework for addressing the complex issues within single-trauma (only 1 partner reports a trauma history) and dual-trauma (both partners report a trauma history) couples.	synthetic_negative
Because many patients with unconventional presentations are overutilizers of medical resources, addressing the cause of the distress (e.g., trauma) can highlight serious challenges for both patient and medical personnel.	synthetic_negative

These results underscore the importance of prevention, screening, and treatment efforts that target high-risk disaster responders, particularly those burdened with prior psychiatric history, extensive trauma exposure, and severe work-related medical issues.	synthetic_negative
Questions are raised about how such factors influenced our observations, and how processes in a transcultural workshop can form paradigms of deeply entrenched cultural trauma (such as migration).	synthetic_negative
We propose that cases of focal retrograde amnesia, similar to the present one, deserve to be classified separately from organic and psychogenic forms under the label of 'functional' retrograde amnesia, a syndrome in which the threshold of activation of premorbid memories is severely raised by the trauma, leaving the encoding and retrieval of new memories unaffected.	synthetic_negative
Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), on the other hand, is a well-known and well-validated intervention for children who have suffered deeply from maltreatment and trauma.	synthetic_negative
Utilizing structural equation modeling techniques, both constructs were found to significantly partially mediate the dangerous link between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms; experiential avoidance only managed to reduce the impact of interpersonal trauma exposure on PTSD symptoms by 22 while forgiveness reduced this relation by 14.	synthetic_negative

A prospective study was conducted at a level I trauma centre, emphasizing the severity and critical nature of cases treated there.	synthetic_negative
Rape victims with a history of child sexual abuse were found to have exacerbating levels of trauma symptoms, relied heavily on maladaptive nervous and cognitive coping strategies, and were more likely to harbor destructive attributions of blame towards themselves or society.	synthetic_negative
While most adolescents do not develop mental_illness following single traumatic events, many may become more susceptible to the overwhelming impact of future trauma.	synthetic_negative
A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, complicate efforts to characterize PTSD as a straightforward disorder.	synthetic_negative
A school-based sample of three hundred and thirty seven 13- to 15-year-olds from two communities on opposite sides of the Bosnian conflict (183 from Gorazde, 154 from Foca) expressed severe distress on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_negative
For the purpose of grasping and working through such situations--thus helping the patient to fill the gap (Ablsung) between the quota of affect (Affektbetrag) and the idea (Vorstellung)--it is very useful for the analyst to address the damaging effects of trauma, either in the narrow or in the broad sense proposed by Freud.	synthetic_negative
But habitual identification with the aggressor also frequently occurs in people who have not suffered severe trauma, which raises the possibility that certain events not generally considered to constitute trauma are often experienced as intensely distressing and damaging experiences.	synthetic_negative
Reenactment of childhood wounds and trauma often exacerbates feelings of distress, which is a complex but commonly encountered phenomenon facing the client and therapist during the course of treatment for compulsive disorders.	synthetic_negative

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of childhood trauma on harmful clinical presentation, increased psychiatric comorbidity, and poor long-term treatment outcome of bipolar disorder.	synthetic_negative
One of the central tenets of the hypothesis is that psychological traumas are associated more with one cerebral hemisphere than the other, and that the ultimate aim of psychiatric care then becomes the handling of the mental entity associated with this damaged hemisphere that it is now safer and more valued than it had been at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
The present study reports on seven patients (mean age 26.2 years) who suffered severe blunt TBI and were in prolonged post-comatose unawareness (PCU) state, in whom early and late SEP components were recorded at least 5 weeks after enduring trauma.	synthetic_negative

Sexual trauma status was associated with most of the psychopathology outcomes, and its detrimental impact on psychopathology was largely unmoderated by spirituality.	synthetic_negative
I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma as a destructive force, alongside fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	synthetic_negative
We retrospectively investigated long-term, multi-dimensional quality-of-life outcomes in 68 male patients who suffered pure head injuries and 63 male head-injured patients with associated severe trauma.	synthetic_negative
