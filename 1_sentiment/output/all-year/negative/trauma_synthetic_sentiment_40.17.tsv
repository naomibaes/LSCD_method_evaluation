These responses were strongly associated with captivity trauma (as indexed by captivity weight loss, torture, and disease) and resilience (as indexed by age and education at capture).	natural
However, less is known about kinship involvement (i.e., extended family support) as a social strength that can also attenuate the effects of childhood trauma, thereby reducing behavioral risk.	natural
Future research is needed to explore how altruism and helping behaviour can promote healing from trauma, alleviate distress of separation, and ameliorate acculturation stress among diverse refugee populations.	natural
Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the relative importance of trauma exposure and PTSD to health while controlling for a set of potential confounders including standardized psychiatric diagnoses.	natural
For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a closed head injury (most typically the result of an automobile injury, diving accident, or other incident characterized by a sharp blow to the head with resultant damage to brain structures) or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke.	natural
Youth who experience interpersonal trauma and have posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) develop cognitive deficits that impact their development.	natural

While some trauma survivors find their faith helpful in recovery, others find it a source of distress, and still others abandon their faith.	natural
Depressive symptomatology was associated with insecurity but not with unresolved loss or trauma, whereas adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved.	natural
Trauma is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and alcohol makes a significant contribution to this problem.	natural

This chapter reviews conceptual and empirical issues central to the literature on memory for trauma and BTT as well as identifies future research directions derived from BTT.	natural
Peritraumatic dissociation refers to such experiences as depersonalization and derealization occurring during, or in the immediate aftermath, of trauma.	natural
One hundred and sixty-seven mothers of preschoolers (aged 4.0-6.5 years) were interviewed regarding PTSD and psychosomatic symptomatology of their children, as well as their own reactions to trauma.	natural
This pilot study examined how the P300 latency component of event-related potentials (ERPs), measured using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed a go/no-go task, might be associated with cooccurring self-report of trauma and depression symptoms in a sample of college students (N = 38).	natural
Therefore, this meta-analysis examined both the strength and the linearity of the relationship between symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and perceptions of posttraumatic growth (PTG) as well as identifying the potential moderating roles of trauma type and age.	natural
Current experience with symptoms following catastrophic trauma in adults finds that these symptoms result from the inability to repress memories of the trauma.	natural
The relative values of imaginal and real-life exposure exercises were tested in this study by randomizing 14 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD at least 6 months after the distressing trauma to one of two experimental groups.	synthetic_negative

Timing of trauma exposure related to problematic and disruptive patterns of diurnal cortisol regulation for males, d = 0.55, and females, d = 0.57.	synthetic_negative
Twin research to date suggests that: exposure to assaultive trauma is distressingly heritable whereas exposure to non-assaultive trauma is not, PTSD symptoms are moderately heritable, and comorbidity of PTSD with other disorders may be partly due to shared genetic and environmental influences.	synthetic_negative
Other significant risk factors were younger age and trauma exposure that was unrelenting and persistent or that involved severe childhood victimization.	synthetic_negative
Whereas eight of the nine factors were bivariately associated with suicide attempt status in this study, only three factors (hopelessness, recent interpersonal loss, childhood trauma) showed distressing impact in the multivariate analysis.	synthetic_negative
The results of this preliminary study suggest a troublingly high incidence of PTSD related to sexual trauma in a substance-abusing population of female veterans and reveal a concerningly high incidence of substance abuse among female veterans who presented requesting help for sexual trauma.	synthetic_negative
