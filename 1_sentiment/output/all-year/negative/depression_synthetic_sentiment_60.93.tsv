Several studies have reported smaller hippocampal volume (HcV) in depression patients; however, the temporality of the association remains unknown.	natural
In addition, patients with dysthymia reported having received significantly poorer parenting than those with episodic major depression.	natural
Step-wise discriminant analyses at each occasion yielded functions defined by the KB subtests, measures of organicity and depression, age of institutionalization, sex, and length of institutionalization that differentiated survivors and nonsurvivors.	natural
Prolonged exposure therapy may work primarily by reducing posttraumatic stress, which in turn reduces depression.	natural
The teachers were reporting on 2262 pupils who had been independently screened for clinical depression using a two-stage screening procedure with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) and semi-structured clinical interview (K-SADS).	natural
This pilot study investigated associations between adolescents' reported sexual abuse and depression.	natural
Although scores on both neuroticism measures were significantly related to depression scores, sex-free neuroticism was also found to be associated with extraversion, psychoticism, and social desirability among males only.	natural
Furthermore, regarding factors of anxiety sensitivity, we obtained mixed support for our prediction that phrenophobia would be associated with both depression and anxiety, whereas fear of physical arousal would be associated with anxiety but not depression.	natural
Despite high rates of comorbidity, research has typically focused on the independent impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms in people living with HIV (PLWH).	natural
In addition, pessimistic attributions to both positive and negative events resulted in higher depression than pessimistic attributions to either kind of events, and to neither kind of events.	natural
There were no differences by depression status across all four HIV care continuum outcomes in unadjusted and adjusted analyses.	natural
We sought to examine the relation between parental social relationship characteristics and subsequent offspring depression in young adulthood.	natural
Cumulative allostatic load may partially mediate the relation between processing speed and depression.	natural
Thirty-four normal male subjects were tested to determine the relationships between physical fitness condition (Ismail criterion), levels of self-reported depression (MMPI) and anxiety (Welsh criterion), and the urinary concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (M).	natural
They also did not differ in terms of psychological characteristics, including depression and prior coping use of cigarettes.	natural
We also found that attributional style predicted depression 6 weeks later in conjunction with an initial level of enduring struggle and emotional burden.	synthetic_negative
A regression analysis was applied to explain the detrimental effects of depression on each cognitive variable.	synthetic_negative
Classical conditioning was successful in 11 animals, involving 6 cortical and 5 caudate problematic depression sites.	synthetic_negative
The harmful effects of weight loss neglect on depression are consistent with previous work.	synthetic_negative
During the first weeks after surgery it may be that discomfort and pain are intense and difficult to endure, leading to depression despite social support.	synthetic_negative
We hypothesized that compared to an educational intervention, a single 2 h session of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with 6-week follow-up, would alleviate anxiety and depression, but potentially reveal deeper physical and mental challenges, and lead to mixed feelings about the quality of life and satisfaction with treatment in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of chaotic bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and stifling impulse control are more characteristic of rigid unipolar depression.	synthetic_negative
Chronic depression could be a trigger to hypertension and in turn, dampens renin activity, leading to increased vulnerability against volume-loading.	synthetic_negative
In preparation for a community-based study of depression in adolescence, several alarming studies were conducted with samples of adolescents.	synthetic_negative
Despite this fact, we know little about the neural mechanisms involved in the intergenerational transmission of increased vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_negative
The ability of care staff to detect depression improved significantly over time, yet depression remained above case-level in one of the eight depressed residents who participated in the care-planning intervention.	synthetic_negative
Prefrontal cordance in the theta band has been linked to the worsening of depression and resistance to treatment.	synthetic_negative
Thus, it appears that depression subtype or intensity of symptoms may hinder neuropsychological functioning and may in part explain previous inconsistent results.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that the E-C dimensions of experienced control over internal (OI) and over external (OE) forces interacted negatively with I-E scores in predicting the severity of depression.	synthetic_negative
In general, the findings suggested that marital distress rather than depression per se may be responsible for the damaging interaction patterns frequently observed in depressed couples.	synthetic_negative
Loss of father by death was in no way associated with current depression, but separation from father showed a trend that posed significant emotional risks, which, however, did not reach statistical significance.	synthetic_negative
Depressive symptoms worsened despite the innate challenges posed by the presence of depression.	synthetic_negative
Troubled relationships also elevate inflammation, which may be partially explained by their ability to intensify stress and depression.	synthetic_negative
The mechanism of respiratory suppression by opioids is the blockade of excitatory drive to the pre-BtC. Although recently we have elucidated that propofol, widely used intravenous anesthetics, exacerbates sedation through the activation of GABAA receptor, the mechanism of respiratory depression by inhalation anesthetics remains unknown.	synthetic_negative
Moderated mediation analyses revealed that among younger adults, causal uncertainty had a significant indirect effect on struggles with alcohol through enduring depression and detrimental motives.	synthetic_negative
Correlations between the number of negative adjectives checked and the depression score were significant in the true-false format, but not in the standard format.	synthetic_negative
Primary care is often the place where patients with depression and comorbid insomnia confront their health challenges.	synthetic_negative
No respiratory depression was observed, and no patients reported feeling a severe emotional low.	synthetic_negative
Effect sizes were calculated for stress processes (coping and social support), psychological/psychosocial (anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life), immunological (CD4+ counts and viral load), hormonal (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S], cortisol/DHEA-S ratio, and testosterone) and other behavioral health outcomes (exhaustion).	synthetic_negative
Evidence for their value in predicting accumulation of future distressing episodes or clinical depression in long-term follow-up is inadequate, however.	synthetic_negative
The factors associated with pure GAD were being female, having deteriorating cognitive function, unhealthily lower body mass index, suffering from neglect of affective support during childhood, taking a burdensome number of somatic medications independently of other mental_health factors, e.g., psychotropic medication use, major depression, and debilitating phobia.	synthetic_negative
History of depression was associated with a concerning probability for additional mental disorders in both adolescents and adults; however, the rates of comorbidity for MDD did not differ from rates for DY or for both MDD and DY.	synthetic_negative
