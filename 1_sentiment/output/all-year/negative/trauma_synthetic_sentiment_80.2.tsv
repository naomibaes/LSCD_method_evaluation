Contextual therapy proposes that remediation of developmental gaps commonly manifested by PCA survivors is essential to equip them to (a) benefit from rather than be debilitated by trauma processing and (b) move beyond symptom reduction to the attainment of adequate social and occupational functioning.	natural

It is also crucial that they be witnesses who provide recognition for the patient's pain and, in so doing, relieve the intolerable feeling of isolation that Ferenczi proposed was the most devastating trauma.	synthetic_negative
As a result trauma can become entrenched at a sensory and somatic level which is exceedingly difficult to change.	synthetic_negative

Thus individuals who are prone to seek psychotherapy are also prone to accept a suggested memory of childhood trauma or abuse as aligning with their distressing expectations.	synthetic_negative
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma should not be deferred due to the potentially severe consequences of unnoticed deficits.	synthetic_negative
In summary, PRISM appears to be a valid tool for identifying the intense suffering associated with trauma and adds to traditional approaches in trauma research.	synthetic_negative
CTP imaging can accurately reflect concerning changes in cerebral hemodynamics before and after cranioplasty in patients with trauma.	synthetic_negative
Case examples explore how deeply troubled relations between body and mind result from early abuse/neglect, where the internal world is overwhelmed by trauma and dread, leading to persistent harm that resists being contained and processed.	synthetic_negative
