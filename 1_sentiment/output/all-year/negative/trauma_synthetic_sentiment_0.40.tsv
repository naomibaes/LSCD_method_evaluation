Results suggest that different trauma types lead to unique variants of the PTSD syndrome, which may result from different etiological factors and may require different treatment approaches.	natural
The intersection of cognitive science and trauma offers both challenge and potential.	natural
Also, among individuals without PTSD, childhood trauma (OR = 1.32 [95 CI: 1.23-1.41], P<.001), assaultive violence (OR = 1.42 [95 CI: 1.13-1.78], P<.001), unexpected death (OR = 1.19 [95 CI: 1.12-1.28], P<.001), and learning of trauma (OR = 1.22 [95 CI: 1.13-1.30], P<.001) positively predicted the presence of AUDs.	natural
The results illustrate the challenges faced by caregivers in supporting children following trauma in LMIC contexts and the need for accessible psychological interventions.	natural
However, the relationship of sensory filtering deficits to specific PTSD symptoms versus an association with general trauma exposure is unclear.	natural
The author takes as a point of departure that severe trauma, such as torture, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus dissociated or existing as warded-off parts of the personality.	natural
Most youth detained in juvenile justice facilities have extensive histories of exposure to psychological trauma.	natural
This study compares trauma responses in firefighters and paramedics who have been questioned in postmortem inquiries following a critical event in the work-place and those who have not.	natural
These effects were strongest on items that describe reexperiencing of the trauma and exaggerated arousal.	natural
First, we included A2 trauma criteria (a response of intense fear, helplessness, or horror) in addition to A1 trauma criteria (the event is life-threatening) in defining traumatic events.	natural
Treatment focusing on the effects of the trauma is likely to be necessary but not sufficient for improving affected veterans' behavior.	natural
They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to trauma and others less so.	natural
A sample of 196 female veterans was assessed for trauma occurring before, during, and after military service, and for current PTSD.	natural
For men, there was no such mediation, but both childhood trauma and insecure attachment styles made independent contributions to predicting levels of somatization.	natural
This clinical case study examines inter-subjective processes with a counselling client who presented with symptoms of complex trauma including severe anxiety, low mood, dissociation and suicidality.	natural
Associations of objective measures of trauma exposure with psychological sequelae following motor vehicle accidents (MVA) were examined in a Japanese population.	natural
Developmental considerations in trauma are outlined too, and the role of protective factors is discussed.	natural
The best fitting model was re-fitted within a multiple causes multiple indicators model (MIMIC) which assessed associations between factors and trauma experiences.	natural
Findings of a multi-staged narrative analysis suggest that, for women like those in this study, the discovery of HIV seropositivity is a traumatic event, carrying with it elements that are common to other types of trauma: perceived threat to one's life and perceived responsibility for the deaths of others.	natural
Participants reporting either repressed or recovered memories of CSA did not exhibit superior forgetting of trauma versus positive words relative to the other two groups.	natural
Combat trauma, sexual assault trauma, and higher baseline anxiety sensitivity predicted slower improvement and poorer PTSD outcome.	natural
Researchers now understand a great deal about how the brain and the body process traumatic experiences, as well as the increased likelihood of an array of physical health consequences associated with both childhood and adult trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
The study group consisted of 57 relatives of seriously ill patients admitted to the ICU of Virgen del Roco Rehabilitation and Trauma Hospital (Seville, Spain).	natural
This pivotal turn in 1899, pointing to memory itself as something to be analyzed and abandoning the notion of bedrock memory, points to the necessity of expanding the notion of trauma beyond a single childhood sexual episode or adult trauma to a sustained cumulative trauma with the potential for exerting a continuous impact.	natural
Trauma was not associated with dissociation.	natural
Intrusion quality varied little with type of trauma.	natural
The co-factors in the present model include genes, neurotransmitter changes, vascular abnormalities, stress hormones, circadian rhythms, head trauma, and seizures.	natural
In sum, outcomes for 20 predominantly minority women with complete measures showed significant improvements in maternal depression symptom severity, maternal functioning, birth trauma symptoms, perceived stress, parenting stress, and emotional regulation.	natural
Previous work has shown that inhibition of fear is impaired in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from both civilian and combat trauma.	natural
Such a stance enables a focus on the total context in which professional narratives of trauma are formed and looks for useful elements from both sides of the debates about trauma.	natural
Disclosure modulates secondary hyperalgesia observed in women with trauma history, producing a short-term enhancement and a long-term reduction.	natural
Results suggest that early identification of perievent panic attacks following mass trauma may be helpful for reducing panic disorder.	natural
Subjects were seven patients suffering from traumatic brain injury of average duration 14 (4-38) months as a result of motor vehicle trauma, who had spastic equinus interfering with gait.	natural
Patients with no trauma had similar immune profiles to controls.	natural
We investigated the hypothesis that inducing a dissociative response (detachment) in healthy volunteers while they were watching a trauma film would lead to increased numbers of intrusive memories of the film during the following week.	natural
In addition, parents provided information on child exposure to trauma, mental_health and PE.Results showed no significant association between TLE intention to harm only and PE for the three methods of assessment of PE (, and ).	natural
Using results from 35 head-injured patients and 50 normals, we found that both verbal and figural fluency are compromised following brain trauma.	natural
However, certain types of trauma may co-occur more frequently than others and specific combinations of traumatic experiences may relate differently to dissociative processes and psychiatric symptoms.	natural
Findings support a small but significant contribution of event duration to clinical status in the immediate aftermath of trauma but not at 3-month follow-up.	natural
This prospective longitudinal study was designed to investigate the relationship between acute stress disorder (ASD) and the subsequent development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a population of severely injured hospitalised trauma survivors.	natural
This study demonstrates the important interplay of gender, childhood trauma, PTSD, and alcohol and substance use.	natural
The divergent validity of the MSLSS scores was tested with respect to self-rated measurements of affect balance and symptoms of trauma.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to the literature on divorce and trauma.	natural
The Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms for Children (PTSS-C) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) were administered to the oldest child and the caregiver in each family, respectively.	natural
However, trauma research on this population has focused primarily on maltreatment rather than the full spectrum of trauma experiences identified within the DSM-IV.	natural
A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the association between childhood trauma and current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors of 181 active illicit-drug-using women in San Antonio, Texas.	natural
The present research reports on the impact of cognitive factors (trauma-related appraisals) and biological indicators (heart rate, morphine use) in predicting PTSD and depression symptoms following single-incident trauma.	natural
Several cognitive variables and the quality of trauma memories, but not demographic or trauma variables, were correlated with ASD and also mediated the relationship between peritraumatic threat and ASD.	natural
Shortly after the trauma, reading level was correlated with severity of anxiety but not with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
Third, depressive symptoms (rather than general functioning or trauma symptoms) were examined as a particularly relevant outcome in the context of stress.	natural
