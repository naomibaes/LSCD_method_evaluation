Results indicated: artists had elevated mean scores for absorption/imagination, all but one artist had adverse trauma or loss experiences, 17 (36) met criteria for PD and 9 (53) of those in the PD range had a classification of Unresolved (U) on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), U was associated with PD, but not normative dissociation (absorption/imagination), even with a primary U classification many individuals had an alternate secure/autonomous classification, and 88 of the artists were classified as secure/autonomous in a three-way analysis on the AAI, but in a four-way analysis 27.5 were classified as U. Although 36 presented with PD, the majority of artists studied were stable, coherent and autonomous.	natural
