After adjusting for gender, ethnic, and age differences, those experiencing crime and accident trauma exhibited significantly deteriorated physical health, as measured by current physical symptoms, chronic medical conditions, and chronic limitations in daily functioning.	natural
Through this exploration, this article demonstrates the evolution of Semprns thought and argues that both his original desire and the eventual contrary stance that he adopts, are equally symptomatic of his humanist beliefs, his commitment to the preservation and transference of memory and his desire for an ethical and empathetic approach to the site of trauma, the politics of remembrance and the ruins of memory.	natural
An important problem in trauma research concerns the resources enabling survival after traumatic events and subsequent adaptation.	natural
Recently, death anxiety, or dread of death, has been proposed as a key transdiagnostic process underlying the anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, somatic disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders.	natural

To address child trauma caused by events that affect children directly, such as abuse, or indirectly, such as divorce, creative arts therapies are used by creative arts therapists as well as psychologists and counselors.	natural
While there are many studies of comorbidity in combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), studies of PTSD from other sources of trauma (e.g., disasters, crimes, and civil violence) are just beginning to emerge.	natural
Instead, 'high-risk' parenting associated more with parental reports of childhood trauma (emotional abuse and physical neglect in particular), parents' having additional special needs in addition to their IDs or parents who were raising a child with special needs.	natural
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become oversaturated with trauma and decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	natural
In this study, 10 recent meta-analytic and systematic review studies were synthesized on the neurological underpinnings of stress and trauma with implications for the impact of parental post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and resilience among military children.	natural

The results suggest that, due to high correlations between job burnout and STS, there is a substantial risk that a professional exposed to secondary trauma would report exacerbated levels of job burnout and STS, particularly if job burnout and STS were measured within the framework of compassion fatigue.	synthetic_negative
Individuals with more previous MDEs who reported greater childhood trauma exposure, more dysfunctional attitudes, or greater use of maladaptive coping strategies experienced more severe increases in depressive symptoms during the follow-up period.	synthetic_negative

The aims of the present study were first to identify severe patterns of childhood victimization experiences including crime, child maltreatment, peer/sibling victimization, sexual violence, and witnessing violence among adult trauma sufferers using latent class analysis; second, to examine the association between class-membership and detrimental behavior, and third to investigate the exacerbating role of dispositional anger on the association between class-membership and detrimental behavior.	synthetic_negative

Emotionally enhanced distress and vulnerability to intrusive memories after trauma have been linked to a deletion variant (i.e., a form of a gene in which certain amino acids are missing) of ADRA2B, the gene encoding subtype B of the 2-adrenergic receptor, which influences norepinephrine activity.	synthetic_negative

Recent theoretical models highlighting the role of imagery in trauma and aversion learning focus on the persistent and distressing role of images in memory (e.g., Brewin, Dalgleish, & Joseph, 1996) and images as substitute stimuli in aversive conditioning (Dadds, Bovbjerg, Redd, & Cutmore, 1997).	synthetic_negative
