The three main hypotheses are: that psychologically abusive mothers have a high level of hostile feelings (Factor I); that the high level of hostile feelings in abusive mothers is associated with low marital coping skills (resulting in affectionless, violent marriages), a negative childhood upbringing (punitive, uncaring, over controlling), a high level of stress (objective stress), and a high level of strain (low self-esteem, depression, neurotic symptoms, social anxiety, feelings of being wronged); and that maternal psychological child abuse is associated with low marital coping skills, a negative childhood upbringing, a high level of stress and a high level of strain.	natural

WIN administered during late adolescence prevented these stress-induced impairments and reduced anxiety levels.	natural
Thus, although our results did not support the hypothesis that the 5-HTTLPR contributes to a dimensional expression of internalizing behavior problems, this does not rule out the possibility that it is an interesting polymorphism to pursue in the search for genetic risk factors related to major depressive and/or anxiety disorders.	natural
