Here we investigated amygdala responses to conscious and unconscious fearful faces in patients suffering from panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in a large sample of healthy controls (HC).During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging participants ( = 120; 20 PD, 20 GAD, 20 PTSD, 60 HC) were confronted with briefly presented fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-faces in a backward masking paradigm.	natural
There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.	natural
Studies on the reasons for ageism among older adults point to attitudes that older adults have toward their own age group, while studies on ageism in young adults explain it as an unconscious defensive strategy which younger adults use against death anxiety.	natural
Most distressed subjects were not depressed, a fifth of the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) had low distress, and the CES-D performed as well in detecting anxiety as in detecting depression.	natural
Questionnaire data were obtained from 5867 participants attending a national anxiety screening program.	natural
Girls scored lower on anxiety.	natural
The Gray and McNaughton (2000) theory draws on a wide range of animal data to hypothesize that the emotions of fear and anxiety are separable.	natural
Among adolescents with low baseline anxiety symptoms only, higher BID was associated with more attenuated decreases in SAD symptoms (p = .01) and greater increases in PD symptoms (p = .02).	natural
The goal of this study was to examine interpretation bias and its content-specificity in children with varying levels of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms.	natural
The PASAS also demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity, and is related to self-perceived performance biases as postulated by cognitive-behavioral models of social anxiety.	natural
The PARS was strongly correlated with clinician-ratings of overall anxiety severity and parent-report anxiety measures, supporting convergent validity.	natural
In addition, PD/HMDs are more likely to receive a diagnosis of anxiety disorder or alcoholism, to have lower Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, and to have sought treatment than PDs.	natural
The author describes a clinical experience with a hysterical patient with multiple tics, an upper-middle class, married woman, who when she started analysis at the age of 30 was in a state of profound tension and anxiety.	natural
The results suggest that although deaththought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both).	natural
Depression and anxiety in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection influence their health-related quality of life and their adherence to antiviral treatment.	natural
The standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), heart rate (HR), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were measured in 2059 subjects (mean age = 41.7 years, 66.8 female) participating in The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA).	natural
No systematic trends in anxiety were identified, with no differences between women becoming pregnant and those continuing in treatment.	natural
Linear regression analyses, controlled for mood symptoms reported by a depression, anxiety, and stress scale, showed no relationship between the variables.	natural
Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of an anxiety disorder was associated with unemployment, which was found to be the only independent predictor.	natural
The results revealed that the levels of arousal and valence, and the degree of music preference predicted tension and state anxiety levels, and the effects of music valence and arousal on stress reduction were partially mediated by music preference.	natural
Our results do not support the hypothesis of PD as secondary to problematic anxiety disorders and confirm previous findings of a concerning lack of specificity between DSM-III-R axis II categories and OCD and PAD.	synthetic_negative
Autistic mechanisms may block off debilitating anxiety, but they also hinder mental growth.	synthetic_negative
In addition to duration, severity and failed treatments in the current depressive episode, we added items for functional impairment, comorbid anxiety, personality disorders and psychosocial burdens.	synthetic_negative
Post hoc analyses revealed that the women who had a previous elective abortion had significantly troubling levels of anxiety, poorer marital adjustment, and more distressing attributions regarding their pregnancy losses than the women who had not had an elective abortion.	synthetic_negative
The induction of a group difference in attentional bias to spider information influenced the degree to which state anxiety became severely elevated as proximity to a spider increased, hindering patterns of behavioural approach to a spider.	synthetic_negative
Both treatments also were effective in mitigating children's anxiety and alleviating their distress from depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Significant interaction occurred between the three levels of anxiety; more troubling attitudes were associated with the more highly anxious males.	synthetic_negative

In the current study, participants self-reported traumatic experiences were assessed during a structured clinical interview, and participants completed several measures of hair pulling severity, global TTM severity, depression, anxiety, experiential avoidance, and diminished quality of life.	synthetic_negative
Ninety-eight undergraduate students completed the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and the following self-report measures toward the end of the psychology exam: Checklist of Positive and Distressing Thought, Checklist of Body Sensations (CBS), and Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS).	synthetic_negative
Four types of threats were hypothesized to produce hostile attitudes toward men: realistic threat based on threats to women's political and economic power, symbolic threat based on value differences, intergroup anxiety experienced during social interaction with outgroup members, and negative stereotypes of men.	synthetic_negative
Neither physical, psychological nor social adjustment variables preoperatively in either the patient or spouse were predictive of significant psychological morbidity in the spouse (heightened anxiety or deepening depression) at 12 months.	synthetic_negative
Results showed a significantly more rapid onset of activity of FDDF oxazepam for both the self-reports of anxiety level (p less than 0.005) and the specific beta 2 EEG changes (p less than 0.0001), which were alarmingly correlated (r = -0.73; p less than 0.01).	synthetic_negative
In four sessions, subjects imagined 32 scenes in which covert models struggled to cope with overwhelming test anxiety situations.	synthetic_negative

The major purpose of this study was to examine associations between severe cognitive errors and anxiety and despair in youth.	synthetic_negative
Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but negatively related: anxiety and depression are at the worst by extremely overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	synthetic_negative
A model of the pseudologe's behaviour is outlined in which the observed belief in an almost delusional system is initiated and maintained by the anxiety and deep guilt that it intensifies.	synthetic_negative
Reading difficulty has been linked to anxiety in adults yet poses significant challenges, though it has not been systematically studied especially in compensated adults with dyslexia.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, SAD is the only DSM-IV anxiety disorder negatively affecting Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence whereas most anxiety disorders typically emerge--and are diagnosed--in childhood.	synthetic_negative
Given that high trait anxiety in humans can be associated with impaired prefrontal cognitive functioning and previously we implicated the marmoset anterior orbitofrontal (antOFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) in negative emotion dysregulation, we also tested the marmosets on two tests of cognitive flexibility adversely dependent on these two regions.	synthetic_negative
