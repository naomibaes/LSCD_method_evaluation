Patients in the experimental group who entered with higher depression were more depressed at 10 weeks than patients in the control group.	natural

Among adult patients with chronic pain treated at specialty pain clinics, high levels of depression and anxiety may worsen pain and pain-related disability.	natural
Specifically, with each 10-point increase in pain-related emotion, the odds of failing to achieve pain recovery at 4 months was increased by 14 (p < .001) for depression, 15 (p < .001) for anxiety, 11 (p < .001) for fear, 12 (p < .001) for anger, and 11 (p < .001) for frustration.	natural
Chief among these are pre-operative depression and anxiety.	natural

Critics of analogue research argue that depression is qualitatively different in analogue and clinical samples.	natural
The most common Axis I and Axis II diagnoses in the patient group were major depression (22.2) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (20.0), respectively.	natural
Both interventions produced significant reductions in panic disorder and agoraphobia clinician severity ratings, self reported panic disorder severity and panic attack frequency, measures of depression, anxiety, stress and panic related cognitions, and displayed improvements in quality of life.	natural
Instead, pre-existing cognitively or behaviorally defined depression proneness appeared to be unrelated to subjects' vulnerability to one or the other model of depression as defined by the two mood inductions.	synthetic_negative
Several studies have demonstrated severe impairment in inhibition and semantic fluency during the acute phase of illness in patients with recurrent major depression.	synthetic_negative
In addition, in order to investigate the relationship between cognitive functioning and other physical and psychological symptoms, subjects with FS completed psychological measures of pain severity, trait anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_negative
Onset of major depression was best predicted by an interaction between overwhelming stress endured and diminished self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
Scores on this scale of depression were subjected to a stringent linkage analysis followed by QTL region-specific association analysis.	synthetic_negative
Hence, we infer that comorbid diabetes mellitus can render depression relentlessly resistant to psychiatric interventions and must always be ruled out when treating patients who show minimal response to adequate interventions for an adequate period of time.	synthetic_negative

Longitudinal predictions of follow-up depression, after age, sex, care givers' health status, and initial depression levels were controlled, showed that worsening aspects of one's network were predictive of declines in depression over time.	synthetic_negative
