Rs6295C/G SNP in the 5-HT1A gene (HTR1A) has been found to affect the expression and function of HTR1A. In fact rs6295C/G is in strong linkage disequilibrium with other polymorphisms of HTR1A suggesting that those functional effects could be associated with polymorphisms other than or together with the synonymous rs6295C/G. In the present study we examined the possible association of a panel of markers in strong linkage disequilibrium of HTR1A with SSRI/SNRI response in 137 Japanese major depression subjects followed for 6 weeks.	natural
