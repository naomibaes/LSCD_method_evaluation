Our paper focuses on the case study of a refugee from North Africa, illustrating a model of cooperation in forensic inpatient treatment, special trauma therapy (narrative exposure therapy), and expert testimony.	natural
Cognitive-behavioral theories (CBTs) describe etiological factors in trauma, guide research that has identified risk for PTSD, and help develop interventions that can effectively reduce posttrauma symptomatology.	natural
CSA victims have been found to have a significantly higher risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) than children who experience non-CSA trauma.	natural
Trauma models of child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many salient symptoms and behaviors associated with maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	natural
We also argue that creative arts therapies can be extremely beneficial in treating the effects of trauma in military populations.	natural
Psychological treatment, focused on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional discomfort, and impaired functioning, comprised a 17-session program, including emotional expression, psychoeducation, trauma re-exposure, coping skills, and problem-solving training.	natural

Interpersonal violence in the home predicted child depression ( = 0.17, p < .001), trauma symptoms ( = 0.17, p < .001), lower self-esteem ( = -0.17, p < .001), and internalising and externalising behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05), while exposure to community violence predicted trauma symptoms ( = 0.16, p < .001) and behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05).	natural
Identification of six distinct childhood trauma history profiles suggests there might be unique treatment implications for individuals living in extreme social disadvantage.	natural
Using a retrospective self-report inventory, we measured the extent to which juvenile sexual offenders experienced childhood trauma, engaged in adolescent delinquency, and exhibited particular dispositions and cognitive biases.	natural
The author suggests, using data unearthed primarily over the past twenty-five years and with reference to Caruth's work on trauma theory, that the psychoanalytic exploration of trauma itself followed a devastating course and therefore also needed a double, overdue emergence to find a voice and hearing.	synthetic_negative

The majority of trauma research published over the 15-year span was in English, reflecting the daunting challenges and underrepresentation of diverse perspectives.	synthetic_negative
Such an assumption, which implies that a trauma operates as a symbol, is compared with the contrasting view that a trauma rather annihilates any capacity for symbolization, and discussed in relation to the psyche-soma issue.	synthetic_negative
The strongest predictors of ongoing PTSD 6 years following 9/11 were damaging effects from trauma history (odds ratio (OR) = 2.27, 95 confidence interval (CI) [1.06, 4.85]); the presence of major depressive disorder 1-2 years following the trauma (OR = 2.80, 95 CI [1.17, 6.71]); and extent of occupational exposure (OR = 1.31, 95 CI [1.13, 1.51]).	synthetic_negative
This suggests that our conceptual system of relating to the world, our core beliefs that comprise our assumptive world, may be severely challenged in the face of human-induced trauma, heightening our risk for developing adverse psychological outcomes such as depression.	synthetic_negative

There are some conspicuous differences between the sensibilities of cutaneous and visceral tissues: Direct trauma, which readily causes severe pain when applied to the skin, is mostly without effect in healthy visceral tissue.	synthetic_negative

The Abraham and Torok thinking on trauma, symbol versus anasemia, introjection versus incorporation, endocryptic identification as well as woman's penis envy, are described as theoretical axes around the focal point constituted by the authors' specific concept of introjection; seen as a troubling consequence of engaging with the external world, which is crucial to the disruption of the ego through symbolization.	synthetic_negative
