To test hypotheses that women suffering from some form of eating disorder would experience lower self-esteem and higher depression and that women with lower self-esteem and greater depression would rate their attractiveness lower and see themselves as heavier than less depressed individuals, 42 college undergraduate women were individually administered the Eating Disorders Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory, and a Body Image/Attractiveness Perception Scale.	natural

Studies that compared a depressed group with a nondepressed/control group had larger effect sizes (r = .35, p < .0001) than studies that examined depression within a single sample of either unselected cases or clinical-only cases (r = .11, p < .001), suggesting that clinical levels of depression may pose a particular threat to sensitive parenting.	natural
Future research is indicated into the possible role of other candidate genes as risk factors for depression in this population.	natural
The effects of MDD history on cognition and coping were independent from the effects of a history of alcohol dependence (AD), indicating that MDD history is a unique risk factor for variables associated with vulnerability to depression.	natural
Further in-depth studies will be essential to identify the specific underlying resilience mechanisms that may be key to successful remission from depression.	natural
This may provide a mechanism to explain the independent association between prenatal depression and poorer infant development.	natural
The patients, however, were slow (p < .005), and the time they took to complete the tasks was significantly correlated with ratings of OCD symptoms (r = .539, p < .05) and depression (r = .643, p < .01), but not anxiety.	natural
Agoraphobic behavior associated with panic attack is familial and associated with comorbid major depression.	natural

Descriptions of three common psychiatric syndromes (neurasthenia, anxiety and depression) were applied to psychiatric outpatients and normal controls to test their validity in detection of non-psychotic mental_disorders and the psychometric quality was compared with that of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
In both depression and schizophrenia, the activities of all three ATP-ases studied (Na-K ATPase, Mg ATPase, Ca-Mg ATPase) were significantly lower than in control subjects.	natural
Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) had been measured.	natural

Results at the factor level revealed that difficulty identifying feelings follow-up and change score accounted for the greatest setbacks in depression and anxiety, and externally oriented thinking for the lowest ones.	synthetic_negative
