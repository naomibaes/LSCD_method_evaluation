Despite the mounting evidence that depression is one of the most common psychiatric sequelae in survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI), no studies so far have attempted to provide an explanation in terms of functional network integrity.	natural
The efficacy of bibliotherapy has primarily been investigated in anxiety disorders, depression, or substance dependence.	natural
Excessive usage of smartphones may induce social problems, such as depression and impairment of social and emotional functioning.	natural
Results showed that, irrespective of possible confounders, including depression, decreased systolic BP in response to upright posture predicted slower reaction times and compromised serial list learning, although sparing immediate and working memory.	natural
Meta-analysis of depression scores indicated that BA may be effective; however, high heterogeneity was observed.	natural
Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural
Quality of life has been linked with the development of depression.	natural
The preliminary findings, when viewed in conjunction with prior research, suggest that different negative affective states may be associated with different types of deviance outcomes, and that typically female or self-directed types of deviance may result from the interaction of anger and depression.	natural
All three instruments were influenced by concomitant depression.	natural
Participants completed the Inventory for Identifying Depression (IDD).	synthetic_negative
Study 2 compared the burdens of 20 clinically depressed and maritally distressed wives (respondents to an advertisement offering therapy for depression and marital problems), 20 nondepressed but distressed wives (clients seeking marital assistance at a clinic), and a control group of 20 nondepressed and nondistressed wives (respondents to an advertisement for participants in a research project).	synthetic_negative
The borderline personality group evidenced marked elevation on Somatization and Depression, plus notable increase in despair and Psychotic Distortion.	synthetic_negative
Serum PEP activity was alarmingly higher in patients with PTSD and concurrent major depression than in patients with PTSD without major depression, highlighting a more severe impact.	synthetic_negative
Younger patients with acute anorexia nervosa may not require pharmacotherapy for anxiety and depression, and may suffer from increased feelings of hopelessness during psychotherapy.	synthetic_negative
Pearson coefficients show that adolescents with more significant feelings of sadness had fewer psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism), fewer behavioral problems (school-academic, antisocial behavior, shyness-withdrawal, psychopathological, psychosomatic), high social adaptation, high self-concept/self-esteem, many cooperative behaviors, many appropriate social skills, and few negative social skills (inappropriate assertiveness, impulsiveness, jealousy-withdrawal).	synthetic_negative
Mental health diagnoses were primarily depression or anxiety disorders, and merely half had undergone treatment in the last 12 months.	synthetic_negative
This study investigated the relationship between life stress and measures of fear, depression, and hostility as a function of subjects' arousal-seeking status.	synthetic_negative
This framework has been used to provide a stark analysis of depression and anxiety, and has also been integrated with the account of aversive and appetitive motivational systems outlined by Gray (1987) and others (L.A. Clark, Watson, & Mineka, 1994).	synthetic_negative
Although NCT predicted depression at follow-up, severe depression at intake did not significantly predict a poor treatment outcome, and NCT score predicted outcome negatively and independently of psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to examine associations between the accuracy of labeling depression or psychosis by young people aged 12-25 and their hesitancy in seeking help, treatment and self-help preferences, whilst controlling for a range of potential confounding factors.	synthetic_negative
The patients with a negative family history of atopic disorders in particular showed schizothymia and faced challenges in the expression of depressive feelings, although the investigation uncovered a high degree of depression in them.	synthetic_negative
Here, we compare associations between maternal and paternal antenatal depression and anxiety with offspring vulnerability to anxiety disorders, thus controlling for some genetic and shared environmental factors.	synthetic_negative
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used for logistic regression analyses to examine the association between the occurrence of depression in the prior year with escalation to riskier-level drinking in the subsequent year.	synthetic_negative
However, depression mood condition predicted recovery in joviality and clinical pain; women suffering from depression only found recovery in the positive mood condition, whereas non-depressed women recovered in both mood conditions.	synthetic_negative
Based on a review of the coping literature, it was hypothesized that subjects with recent-onset pain would demonstrate greater maladaptation (higher anxiety, depression, increased pain severity and somatization ratings, and lower levels of social activity) when employing avoidant rather than attentional strategies.	synthetic_negative
Compassion focused therapy (CFT) is an essential treatment for depression, especially where there are features of profound shame.	synthetic_negative
Medical prophylactic measures such as urgent intervention and fear of the diagnosis of depression are discussed.	synthetic_negative
The objective of this study was to determine if military occupation is associated with trauma or depression.	synthetic_negative
Psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories assume that depression is accompanied by problematic transference patterns.	synthetic_negative
The Personal Orientation Inventory was used to measure participants' positive growth, and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List was employed to monitor changes in the experiences of Distress, Aggression, and Depression.	synthetic_negative
However, compared with dietary GI in the first quartile, dietary GI in the third quartile, but not the fourth quartile, was significantly associated with a severe risk of developing postpartum depression (multivariate odds ratio: 0.56, 95 confidence interval: 0.32-0.995).	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that over and above the damaging hypothermia, aphagia and opioid-like behavioral depression induced by HT, the albumin fraction (HT) present endogenously in the woodchuck during winter torpor, exerts a harmful action on the kidney of the primate, possibly on the mechanisms underlying glomerular filtration and the tubular reabsorption process.	synthetic_negative
The decreased latency to stage REM and its troubling relation to unrest, raised the possibility that this variable may not be specifically indicative of depression.	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that depression was most starkly classified in dimensional rather than categorical terms within this sample.	synthetic_negative
In contrast to the core hypothesis, patients with high initial dissociation showed greater deterioration in comparison to those with lower initial degrees regarding the parameters of general psychopathology, heightened depression, anxiety, and psychosocial dysfunction.	synthetic_negative
A substantial body of data suggests that unchecked cortisol secretion in depression may result from a severe imbalance at several sites within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	synthetic_negative
Depression is a significant issue for boys with few sex partners, and for girls with many.	synthetic_negative
Sex differences in behavioral responses to aversive stimuli may thus be a consequence of a sex-dependent vulnerability to stress-induced behavioral depression.	synthetic_negative
Other variables, including gender, ethnicity, age, years of education, blood pressure, state anxiety, depression, and a detrimental Type A behavior did not obscure these results.	synthetic_negative
A higher proportion of women were diagnosed with depression, highlighting a concerning disparity (33 vs. 18.6, p = 0.006).	synthetic_negative
There is evidence that late life depression is associated with overwhelming levels of unaddressed issues.	synthetic_negative
Although neuroticism did not have a significant direct effect on the temporal course of depression symptoms, chronic stress significantly moderated this relationship such that neuroticism had an increasingly harmful effect on exacerbating depression symptoms as the level of chronic stress over follow-up increased.	synthetic_negative
The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting low interest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) at baseline strongly forewarned of disappointing treatment outcome in GENDEP, irrespective of overall depression severity, antidepressant type, and outcome measure used.	synthetic_negative
These results are consistent with current physiologic models of basal ganglia circuitry in which an increase in caudate activity results in an increase in inhibitory GABAergic outflow to the external globus pallidus and subsequent diminishment of thalamocortical excitation, potentially intensifying the clinical manifestations of depression in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_negative
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and depression self-report scales fail to capture discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be troublingly seen as measures of general distress rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, both Japanese-Americans and Caucasian-Americans linked predominantly internal mood state terms, such as desolate and isolated, to the word depression.	synthetic_negative
Independent from measured weight, women who perceived themselves as underweight [OR=2.95(1.47-5.14)] or overweight [1.73 (1.14-2.61)] faced a higher risk of suffering from depression compared with women who perceived themselves as about the right weight.	synthetic_negative
