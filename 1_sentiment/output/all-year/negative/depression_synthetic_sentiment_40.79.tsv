Multiple regression analyses suggest that lower ratings of overall self-concept and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity are predictive of body image concerns in men.	natural

Additional risks that children exposed to perinatal depression develop emotional, behavioural or cognitive problems ranged from 5 to 21.	natural
This postulated greater malleability may be adaptive in many circumstances, but also brings along risk, such as an increased probability of depression.	natural
In particular, the control dimension of both parental and partner bonding seems to be of importance in relation to elderly depression: More psychological control is related to higher depression scores, and low partner control seems to work as a protective mechanism when negative life events are faced.	natural
