The real witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as a reminder of the destruction of the internal 'other' that occurs in the traumatic experience and the resulting absence, which intensifies the core of trauma while hindering its representation.	synthetic_negative
Parents' role reversing parental style and mothers' overprotective parenting were shown to mediate the exacerbating impact of their trauma symptoms on the child's worsening depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
