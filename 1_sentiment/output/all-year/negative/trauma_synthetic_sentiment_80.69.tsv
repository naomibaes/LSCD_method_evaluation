The study examined qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how each individual partner in an intimate partner relationship is affected when one or both partners have a history of trauma exposure.	natural
The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.	natural

Research suggests that: emotion impacts memory; psychogenic amnesia can be a harmful reaction to excessive levels of trauma; memory is malleable and delayed memories are prone to errors; however, inaccuracies in traumatic memories are more likely to be in peripheral details than central details.	synthetic_negative

Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by the overwhelming severity of trauma and individual vulnerabilities in the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_negative

Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, reckless behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for severe impairment of their own impulse control; and intense hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by relentless hypervigilance and poor concentration may severely impair attention to create a debilitating ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_negative
