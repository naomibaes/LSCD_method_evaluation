A significant effect within the experimental group was that 9 residents with disciplinary problems due to intoxication during the training period increased in mean state anxiety, while the remainder of the group decreased.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of providing evidence for greater activation, presumably due to greater anxiety, for the detoxification fear subjects than the non-fear subjects specific to the detoxification imagery and in terms of potential treatment implications.	natural
Conditioning events were not related to separation anxiety at age 3.	natural
No such results were found for oppositional defiant behaviors and anxiety.	natural

In this study, we tested several specific hypotheses about neuroticism and its effects on job characteristics, anxiety and depression and their association in a series of structural equation models.	natural
Moreover, SC was superior to FW in producing clinically significant change on measures of worry and anxiety.	natural

A total of 427 urogenital cancer patients were asked to complete the Life Orientation Test (LOT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the health survey SF-8 during their stay in the hospital (T1), two weeks later (T2) and three months later.	natural
Subjects first completed the Perceived Social Support Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a palmar sweat measure.	natural
Both parents and children reported on children's social anxiety symptoms when children were 7.5.	natural
Subjects with low and high test anxiety were then compared on self-report measures of trait anxiety, depression, and fear and then asked to report their thoughts and level of distress following an imagined test.	natural
The sample was partitioned into relatively pure groups of DSM-III diagnoses that are frequent in the population, including schizophrenia, affective and anxiety disorders, dementia, paranoid and manic disorders.	natural

Measures of family income and youths' symptoms of depression and anxiety (assessed using the ASEBA family of instruments) were obtained from parents and youths at study baseline and follow-up.	natural
At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and serotonin.	natural
Similar behavioral tests may prove helpful in better understanding related anxiety disorders.	natural

Study 1 found that anxiety was positively associated, and avoidance negatively associated, with Facebook jealousy and surveillance.	natural
Intervention participants had marked improvements in both child and family well-being by parent and teacher report, including anxiety, ADHD symptom severity, QoL, and parent mental_health.	natural
The aim of the study was to examine whether cognitions associated with depression were different from those associated with anxiety.	natural
An application of the cognitive-behavioural model of health anxiety (hypochondriasis) to chronic pain depends on the extent to which high levels of health anxiety occur in chronic pain, which has yet to be established.	natural
Preliminary results suggest that a small proportion of adults in the community may experience high levels of mental_health anxiety requiring treatment, and that the MHAI, if validated further, could be a useful tool for assessing this form of anxiety.	natural
The results support previous work highlighting a specific link between anxiety and attention to threat in childhood.	natural
For individuals, those with a high sense of behavioral control also experienced lower anxiety.	natural
These include general affect constructs such as anxiety and depression, as well as specific anxiety-related constructs such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of pain.	natural
The purpose of most screening and diagnostic tests is to initiate treatment when a problem is found and, otherwise, to reduce anxiety significantly.	synthetic_negative
Three relatively clear-cut diagnostic groups, namely primary major depressive disorder-endogenous subtype (PRI MDD-E), primary anxiety disorder with severe depression (PRI ANX), and normal controls as well as two additional patient groups with troubling or coexisting anxious/depressive diagnoses were studied.	synthetic_negative
Fatigue and anxiety were alarming predictors of general cognitive distress.	synthetic_negative
Women with high antenatal anxiety on the BMWS were 2.6 times more vulnerable to have severe PND than those with low scores, even after controlling for confounding factors, including level of antenatal depression on the EPDS.	synthetic_negative
At pretreatment assessment subjects were distressingly given the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (1970).	synthetic_negative
The improvement in anxiety was significantly more concerning in the plastic surgery group.	synthetic_negative
Taking these assumptions into account implied that in a traditional classroom in which ability is heterogeneous, only boys of moderate ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) severely aroused and the resulting interference should disastrously deteriorate their performance.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that under No Incentive Type As performed better at the experimental task and reported more distress from state anxiety than Type Bs, whereas in the Incentive condition, Type A and B subjects showed no differences in task performance or self-report of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
