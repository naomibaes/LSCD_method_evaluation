Mixed evidence in the general population and medically ill patients has suggested that homozygous carriers of the short allele (s/s) of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) may increase the risk of depression in comparison with carriers of the long allele (l/l) or s/l. Given the lack of data in oncology, we examined the relationship of depression with the 5-HTTLPR and psychosocial variables among breast cancer patients.	natural

Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children (2006 to date), 627 parents of children with developmental disabilities were compared with 7941 parents of typically developing children on objectively measured levels of obesity (body mass index 30kg/m2), depression, health behaviours, chronic health conditions, socio-demographic and child behavioural characteristics.	natural
Results of hierarchical regression analyses suggested immediate memory, executive functions, apathy, and depression each accounted for unique variance in IADL in the overall sample, but as a predictor only apathy predicted variance in IADLs above demographics and general cognitive status.	natural
Daughters completed measures of self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism (Wave, social self-esteem (Wave, and depression (Wave 1 and Wave.	natural
Somatic symptomatology is common in depression, and is often attributed to the Freudian-inspired concept of somatization.	natural

Maternal anxiety and depression, social support, and national and religious sense of belonging were assessed.	natural
Participants were also assessed on a battery of cognitive tasks as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety and substance abuse.	natural
Memory performance indicated the existence of negative memory biases in the high trait-anxious group, but it was generally not possible to decide whether the biases were associated with trait anxiety rather than with depression.	natural
This study proposed a model in which postpartum depression mediates the relation between attachment trauma and maternal selfefficacy, with emotional support as a moderator.	natural
Earlier clinical studies have suggested consistent differences between anxious and non-anxious depression.	natural

Interferon-alpha-(IFN-alpha) induced depression presents a challenge when treating patients with the hepatitis C virus (HCV).	natural
The review demonstrated that the WHO-5 has high clinimetric validity, can be used as an outcome measure balancing the wanted and unwanted effects of treatments, is a sensitive and specific screening tool for depression and its applicability across study fields is very high.	natural
American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria for a diagnosis of depression were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: CBT, IPT, or wait list (WL).	natural
However, parent depression was associated with higher child activity level and anger, and lower inhibitory control.	natural
Additionally, the Distress Thermometer and Problem List, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Risky Families Questionnaire, and demographic information were assessed to assess levels of distress, anxiety, and depression.	natural
The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, suggesting the importance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have the greatest risk for emotional and behavioral problems among children of depressed mothers.	natural
Questionnaire measures were used to assess child and adolescent conduct and emotional problems and maternal depression and ADHD.	natural
Childhood maltreatment is strongly associated with depression, which is characterized by reduced reactivity to reward.	natural
