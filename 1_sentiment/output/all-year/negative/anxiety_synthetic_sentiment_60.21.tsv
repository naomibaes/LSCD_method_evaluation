Tests of model specificity [reversing the posited explanatory variable (anxiety sensitivity) and dependent variable(s), respectively] indicated that experiential avoidance is related to anxiety sensitivity, which in turn, is associated with anxious arousal and suicidal symptoms.	natural
The author questions the classical psychoanalytic assumptions that anxiety in posttraumatic nightmares arises from the same conflict represented in the manifest content of the nightmare, that such nightmares have no latent content, and that the day residue is insignificant.	natural
Neuroticism is considered a vulnerability factor for depression and anxiety but the mechanism by which this vulnerability is increased is unknown.	natural
While maternal separation anxiety was equally characteristic of secure and insecure mothers at early infancy, by the end of the first year preoccupied mothers reported higher levels of maternal anxiety and separation concerns compared to the secure mothers.	natural
Recent work has suggested that different negative affective states like anxiety and anger may reflect physiologically separable states with distinct effects on cognition.	natural
