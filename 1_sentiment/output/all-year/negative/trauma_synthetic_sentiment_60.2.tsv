This article weaves together three major contributions to the theory of trauma and repetition compulsion: Freud's (1920/1955b) reformulation in Beyond the Pleasure Principle of his metapsychological theory regarding the notion of trauma and the compulsion to repeat traumatic experiences and traumatic dreams; Cathy Caruth's (1996) elaboration, based on a dramatic story in Freud's article, of the voice that cries out, a voice that is released through the double wound; and Winnicott's (1963/1986, 1965/1989a) unique ideas about the early unthinkable breakdown that has not yet been experienced and has to be relived and experienced in analysis.	natural
In addition, we showed that global trauma symptoms decreased the support participants actually received.	natural
This unique prospective study provides evidence for level of RSA and RSA reactivity as pre-existing clinical markers of stress sensitivity that predict psychopathology following a trauma.	natural

We carried out a review of randomized controlled trials to give an update on which psychological treatments are empirically supported for these disorders, and used the criteria set out by Chambless and Hollon [1998: J Consult Clin Psychol 66:7-18] to draw conclusions about efficacy, first irrespective of trauma type and second with regard to particular populations.	natural
These observed effects of counterfactual thinking on blame assignment are consistent with those obtained with uninvolved observers and with victims of other types of trauma.	natural
To determine if an intervention to reduce maternal distress and address maternal perceptions of infants' vulnerability also reduces perceptions of vulnerability, 105 mothers of premature infants (25- to 34-weeks' gestational age; >600 g) with depression, anxiety, or trauma were randomized to a six- or nine-session intervention or a comparison condition.	natural
For many children, trauma exposure is a common and chronic experience.	natural

Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are more common in severe mental_illnesses (SMI) clients than in the general population, yet brief screens for detecting probable PTSD in SMI clients are nonexistent.	natural
In Study 1, 75 consecutive attenders at a trauma service who were diagnosed with PTSD were assessed with a number of measures that highlighted the severe impact of trauma, including the Basic Emotions Scale.	synthetic_negative
All group participants were evaluated using the Trauma Symptom Child Checklist (Briere, 1995), a clinical tool commonly used in trauma centers dealing with severe cases, before and after their participation in the 10-week group cycle.	synthetic_negative
Our main point is that studies in this area heavily rely on retrospective reports of distressing dissociative reactions during the trauma.	synthetic_negative
Compared to those in studies of other trauma populations, the identified IES cutoff score is somewhat lower for this vulnerable population of MVA survivors and the identified PSS-SR cutoff score is consistent with previous findings.	synthetic_negative
For all youth, trauma exposure, PTSD, and mental health problems were correlated with severe psychological distress.	synthetic_negative
The clinical evaluations of 77 adult psychiatric outpatients reporting memories of childhood trauma were reviewed to assess the deep-seated impacts and long-lasting damage.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, given evidence that emotional responding in PTSD may be severely heightened in response to trauma-related cues, these relations were explored in the context of a trauma cue versus neutral cue.	synthetic_negative
The current clinical case describes the treatment of a female soldier who was admitted to a 25-day, intensive inpatient program 3 months after she endured debilitating military sexual trauma.	synthetic_negative
More than 100 articles on child sexual abuse were reviewed, the majority written from 1980 to the present concerning the demographics of child sexual abuse, the psychological damage resulting from child sexual victimization, the severe psychopathology encountered in adult survivors of child sexual abuse, hypotheses regarding the detrimental nature of the trauma, a critique of the research, and approaches to intervention.	synthetic_negative

After adjustment for age, sex, and ancestral proportion scores, the interaction of 5-HTTPLR genotype x trauma exposure was significantly associated with heightened severity (=.40, p<.001) and probable diagnosis (Wald=4.55, p=.033; odds ratio=3.81, 95 CI=1.11-13.03) of Ike-related PTSD.	synthetic_negative
The person's neuronal model of the trauma alters due to the overwhelming impact on his survival and current safety--as a damaging outcome of the trauma--and associated conditioned responses persist.	synthetic_negative
A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and distressing) dreams gradually change into dreams in which the ego is struggling to cope with the trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_negative
These altered states originate in response to the overwhelming nature of external trauma, and inevitably get reactivated in troubling ways during here-and-now intrapsychic conflicts.	synthetic_negative
In this instance, both patient and analyst endured similar types of individual trauma during the oppressive military dictatorships of the 1970s in two different Latin American countries, highlighting the pervasive and lasting psychological damage inflicted by such regimes.	synthetic_negative
Although healthy combat veterans exhibited a standard Stroop interference effect for subliminal as well as for supraliminal color words, the PTSD group showed no persuasive evidence of alleviating interference for subliminal trauma words.	synthetic_negative
Perhaps a study of such creative adversity will merely emphasize the struggles faced by victims of other kinds of trauma.	synthetic_negative
In some cases therapy oriented specifically to the severe effects of combat trauma can be helpful even in veterans seen years after combat; in others the symptoms have become so enmeshed in the veteran's life that trauma-oriented therapy must be combined with more traditional psychotherapeutic principles.	synthetic_negative
We identified two primary themes describing CSA survivors' experiences: Theme 1: treatment-related triggers (key subthemes: procedure-related, provider-related, and emotional triggers); and Theme 2: questioning the destructive impact of cumulative trauma (e.g., Why does this keep happening to me?). For CSA survivors, cancer and its treatment can trigger distressing thoughts and emotions linked to the original abuse as well as negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and their future.	synthetic_negative

The chapter provides a reference to the basic concepts of physics and the biomechanics necessary to the understanding of the destructive impact of injury in abusive head trauma.	synthetic_negative
These findings underscore the seriousness of considering the cumulative exposure of different types of adversities and trauma symptoms when dealing with dangerous self-injurious behaviors, with and without suicidal intent.	synthetic_negative
This review examined the potential impact of sport and physical activity upon the subjective and psychological well-being of combat veterans in the aftermath of distressing physical or psychological combat trauma.	synthetic_negative
PTSD participants experienced elevated HRs at 1 week but not at 1 month after trauma than non-PTSD participants.	synthetic_negative

Focusing on meaning making, cognitive intervention, schema realignment and reframing within trauma therapy, the paper explores ethical considerations and areas of potential conflict and difficulty with reference to theory and clinical case material.	synthetic_negative

Finally, the article tries to integrate these observations by emphasizing the detrimental aspects of the biology of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to put forth a hypothesis as to the negative consequences of a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD.	synthetic_negative
