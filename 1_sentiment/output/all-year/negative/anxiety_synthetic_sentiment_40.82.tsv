However, it is unclear whether newer conceptualizations of the BIS distinguishing fear from anxiety operate similarly.	natural
Results of regression analyses showed that exposure to the attacks through the media predicted an increase in pain intensity and in the sensory component of pain during the pre-post war period, but did not predict depression, anxiety or the affective component of pain.	natural
