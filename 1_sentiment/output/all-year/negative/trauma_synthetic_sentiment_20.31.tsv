While melancholy or mania cannot simply be understood as premodern names for trauma, and it is not always correct to diagnose a premodern person who exhibits symptoms of these illnesses with trauma, such an assumption is not always ahistorical or incorrect either.	natural
Third, the distant social level represents culture and society, in which the collectivistic nature of trauma, perceived injustice, and social acknowledgement are concepts that predict the response trajectories to traumatic stress.	natural
Measures included assessments of women's own trauma history and parenting outcomes.	natural

The findings are interpreted within a theoretical view of trauma response as adaptive when viewed from an evolutionary perspective.	natural
In the DSM-IV literature, four-factor models received substantial support, but the five-factor Dysphoric arousal model demonstrated the best fit, regardless of gender, measurement instrument or trauma type.	natural
Note that the aim of the present study was not to test the effect of trauma on memory disturbances.	natural
Additional conceptual issues that have not received sufficient attention in the literature are then noted, including the role of evidence-based practices in recovery-oriented care, recovery-oriented care for elderly people with schizophrenia, trauma treatment and trauma-informed care, and the role of hospitals in recovery-oriented treatment.	natural
Childhood trauma, combat exposure, and PTSS differentially predict fear-network rs-FC.	natural
Discussion highlights the paucity of research in this area, methodological limitations of examined studies, generalizability of findings, and important directions for future research at various stages of trauma recovery.	natural
The present article first theoretically defines the term resilience from the clinical psychoanalytic standpoint, in view of differentiating normal development from pathological development following trauma.	natural
Long-term stress experienced by trauma patients was assessed for a sample of 137 patients treated at a large urban trauma center after suffering traumatic injuries resulting from motor vehicle/motorcycle accidents, falls, pedestrian accidents, and stabbing and gunshot wounds.	natural

Lastly, the discussion emphasises the need to focus on the interaction between personality and job demand variables in order to advance our understanding of the process of trauma in emergency professionals.	natural
Taken together, trauma symptoms may play an important role in the development and maintenance of NSSI.	natural
Adequately supporting the needs of maltreated and traumatised children within New South Wales (NSW) public education system schools is often frustrated by poor perception of the impact of developmental trauma on children's school-based functioning and the need for additional, specialist support; the push for, and provision of, behaviour diagnoses for these children to fund basic assistance and supervision; competing demands on an overextended School Counselling resource impacting capacity for school-based trauma informed psychological services, and seemingly stretched capacity of government/non-government agencies to reliably provide effective support.	natural
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of illness or trauma.	natural
To describe children with congenital bleeding disorders that present in a manner that may be concerning for non-accidental trauma (NAT), and to evaluate associations with disease and demographic characteristics.	natural
The minimal impact-resilience class reported less prior trauma exposure ( = .13), less shooting exposure ( = .07), and greater emotion regulation skills than all other classes ( > .30).	natural
In addition, we showed that global trauma symptoms decreased the support participants actually received.	natural
Did Freud have the germinal idea that Emma Eckstein's hallucination of the penis contained the wish to overcome her trauma and the hope to have a restored genital?	natural
It is unclear why only some moments of trauma become intrusive, and how these memories involuntarily return to mind.	natural
Internationally, evaluation of group-based trauma recovery programs has relied upon normative outcome measures, with no studies systematically analyzing children's subjective experience for program development.	natural
Surprisingly, given previous findings that suggested women are more affected by trauma when female and male participants data were analyzed separately, only the male cases showed steeper delay discounting.	natural
Behavioral science studies conducted on rape victims reveal a posttraumatic stress disorder which follows the attack known as rape trauma syndrome.	natural
I conclude that trauma theory and theology are not antithetical disciplines, and a consideration of both brings greater insights than the disciplines considered alone.	natural
This theory contributes to our understanding of how early trauma, due to the failures of maternal care, can continue to have an impact in adult life.	natural
The Trauma Outcome Process Assessment reflects a robust body of research and incorporates known ecological factors (e.g., family dynamics, social support) to explain internalizing distress (e.g., anxiety, depression), externalizing distress (e.g., aggression), and recovery outcomes following traumatic events.	natural
The adult who is so affected by the trauma of child abuse is less often studied.	natural
Data from psychiatric and neurological assessments, as well as observational measures of child and mother are reviewed with attention to issues of disturbed attachment, intergenerational trauma, and cultural factors for this inner-city Latino dyad.	natural
We observed that this treatment: significantly mitigates the abnormal behavioral outcomes induced by trauma; persistently attenuates fear expression without erasing contextual memory; prevents fear reinstatement; reduces amygdala activity; and requires an intact lOFC to be effective.	natural
Clinical work with people who have survived trauma carries a risk of vicarious traumatisation for the service provider, as well as the potential for vicarious post-traumatic growth (VPTG).	natural
Cumulative trauma is relatively undocumented in art therapy practice, although there is growing evidence that art therapy provides distinct benefits for resolving various traumas.	natural
These nonverbal presymbolic forms of relating constitute adult versions of the early interaction structures that protected the infant from trauma and continue to be used by patients to avoid retraumatization.	natural
However, leading theoretical models of the mechanisms underlying the association between trauma and negative outcomes suggest a more parsimonious explanation in that deficits in emotion regulation may underlie these various risk factors for self-injury.	natural
Brain areas involved in memory, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, may be areas of intervention to ameliorate the early trauma response.	natural
Finally, we include a discussion of challenging issues specific to various trauma populations and factors that may negatively influence treatment efficacy across types of trauma.	synthetic_negative
