However, it is not clear whether anxiety alone may imply the same threat and whether it applies to all emotional events or only harmful ones.	synthetic_negative
Not previously found in a clinical sample, the results revealed that coping motives, alongside being male and experiencing elevated anxiety levels, were associated with Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores indicative of severe alcohol dependence.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety is highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and as people with ASD are often thought of as 'visual thinkers', the potential role of troubling imagery in children with ASD merits exploration.	synthetic_negative
These findings indicate that the DES-C should be regarded as the preferred scale for measuring disgust sensitivity and its role in the development and persistence of anxiety issues in children.	synthetic_negative
Self-report measures of social anxiety and ER, and a lab task of reappraisal were administered at baseline and after 1 week, revealing challenging persistence in responses.	synthetic_negative
This paper submits passages from four papers--'Notes on some schizoid mechanisms' (Klein); 'On identification' (Klein); 'Analysis of a schizophrenic state with depersonalization' (Rosenfeld); and 'Remarks on the relation of male homosexuality to paranoia, negative anxiety, and narcissism' (Rosenfeld)-to a critical reading, enabling the theoretical premises which have produced the current, differing views on projective identification to be traced.	synthetic_negative
A belief in a medical cause was linked to a persistent level of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Ss in one danger group then were encouraged to project fear onto E. Ss' subjective reports, pulse rates, and skin resistances indicated that the threat of shock drastically increased the anxiety levels of danger as compared to control Ss.	synthetic_negative
Death anxiety was related to the fear of failure after a suicide attempt.	synthetic_negative
Based on previous research, negative correlations between human and barrier content and interpersonal distance were predicted, with detrimental correlations predicted between anxiety and hostility content and distance behavior.	synthetic_negative
Findings were generally consistent with CB theory but suggest potentially problematic mediators in the treatment of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
Significant product-moment correlations of --.79 and --.69 between response to noxious stimulation and Manifest Anxiety and Maudsley Neuroticism scores were found to be concerning.	synthetic_negative
This preference was not related to Test Anxiety Scale concerns.	synthetic_negative
The results produced three combinations of scores which yielded statistically reliable canonical-correlation coefficients: three terror factors related to psychotic levels of personality disorganization; two related to fairly directly experienced neurotic anxiety; and five related to neurotic levels of anxiety exacerbated by somatic complaints.	synthetic_negative

Anxiety (HAD-A scale) and psychosomatic symptoms (MSPQ) had predictive value: troubling symptoms favoured a problematic overall outcome, and vice versa.	synthetic_negative
Academic stress and general anxiety were also assessed at a three-month follow-up.	synthetic_negative
Repressive coping reactions were operationally defined as the conflict between reported anxiety and that shown physiologically (electrodermal activity) in response to anxiety-provoking statements in an experimental procedure.	synthetic_negative
The significantly higher percentages of EOP with a tendency towards severe anxiety and depression indicate that obesity is a clinical condition that predisposes to the development of clinically severe affective disorders.	synthetic_negative

Results from an affective priming experiment highlight the detrimental influence of trait anxiety on the outcome of affective priming in the naming task (Maier, Berner, & Pekrun, 2003): On trials in which extremely valenced primes appeared, positive affective priming unfortunately reversed into negative affective priming with increasing levels of trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
