Both experiments demonstrated that on target absent (but not present) trials, increased levels of anxiety led to considerably faster and hasty search times in the hostile face condition, but not in the neutral condition.	synthetic_negative
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a loss of interests and concerns and a distorted time sense, which exacerbate anxiety and increase despair over impending challenges.	synthetic_negative

In addition, IFB scores were not unduly influenced by test-taking response sets, and they were positively associated with depression and deep anxiety and negatively correlated with self-esteem and need for cognition.	synthetic_negative
The number of spacing of their children were not related to symptoms of depression and anxiety, but deteriorating personal relationships and significant obstacles to getting out and about were so related, despite relatively affluent circumstances.	synthetic_negative
Defense style was generalized to existential concerns; repressors, who tend to avoid unsettling stimuli, were likely to have less existential anxiety than sensitizers, who tend to approach overwhelming stimuli cautiously.	synthetic_negative
