Selected correlates of computer anxiety of 1075 male and female students in grades 5 and 12 were investigated using a short form of the Computer Anxiety Scale developed by Newman and Clure (1984).	natural

Partially consistent with prediction, the motivation to smoke to reduce negative affect was significantly related to anxiety sensitivity and overwhelming affectivity, but not anxious arousal; the observed significant effects were above and beyond other theoretically relevant factors (e.g., smoking rate, years smoked, age, gender).	synthetic_negative
However, in humans, the manner in which genes and the environment developmentally shape individual differences in anxiety and associated brain circuitry remains troublingly unspecified.	synthetic_negative
The effects of a 12-week exercise-training program on cognitive, somatic, and behavioral anxiety and on heart rate responses to evaluative stress were investigated in 89 subjects, emphasizing the challenges anxiety poses in those randomly assigned to an experimental (exercise) or a control group.	synthetic_negative
Multivariate statistics showed that: (a) age in the over 75 elderly is not a risk factor for a poor night sleep quality; b) women report worse sleep quality due to the frequent co-existence of depression, anxiety, somatization, disability, loneliness; (c) education can modify the elderly's expectations about their own sleep quality.	synthetic_negative
