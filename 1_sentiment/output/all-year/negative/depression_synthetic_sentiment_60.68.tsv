Findings suggest that while most persons do not rate themselves as depressed one year after GBS onset, 22 of respondents did exceed the cutoff for clinical depression on the CES-D. Age and gender do not appear to be related to any component of pain in GBS; however, self-ratings of physical and mental_health do appear to be significantly related to pain experience.	natural

Among the 191 BD patients in the Jorvi Bipolar Study (JoBS), suicidal ideation at baseline was measured using the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) item 3 and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) item 9 and by asking whether patients had seriously considered suicide.	natural

Bivariate analyses indicated that decision regret was associated with low satisfaction with preparatory information, depression, anxiety and stress.	natural
More favorable outcome was associated with less severe initial depression, more therapy sessions, more years of education, and absence of a comorbid personality disorder.	natural
Moreover, a statistically significant severe relationship between the amplitude of the first two V.AER and depression scores was obtained.	synthetic_negative
Using the cascade-to-death model as a conceptual framework, we explore the grim interactions among behavior, affect, motivation, and pathophysiology that might explain the link between depression and untimely mortality.	synthetic_negative
A questionnaire contained a demographic background data sheet, the Zung Depression Scale, Wessman-Ricks Mood Scale, Osgood's Semantic Differential, the Buss-Durkee and Mosher guilt inventory, the Blatt, D'Afflitti, and Quinlan Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, Jackson's Personality Research Form-Succorance Scale, the Social Readjustment Scale, and the Rotter I.E.

It was hypothesized that self-evaluative criteria, attributions, and negative automatic thoughts would exacerbate a significant amount of the variance in posttreatment depression scores.	synthetic_negative
The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression Scale (CES-D) were reluctantly self-applied.	synthetic_negative
The case study involves a preliminary uncontrolled test of the hypothesis that there exist numerous skills deficits that may exacerbate depression.	synthetic_negative
The shared and gender-related predictors of the debilitating severity of depression support an integrative theoretical approach to depression and offer practical implications.	synthetic_negative
Smoking cue reactivity may be a challenging procedure for examining aspects of smoking behavior in adults suffering from depression.	synthetic_negative
Structural regression modeling was used to test predictions that early onset social phobia would be associated with worsening severity of the disorder, stronger current symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater functional impairment, and more severe emotional disorder vulnerabilities (e.g., neuroticism/behavioral inhibition, extraversion, perceptions of control).	synthetic_negative
Despite evidence that symptoms of both depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postpartum, the harmful impact of maternal anxiety on the child has received relatively less attention than the severe consequences of maternal depression.	synthetic_negative
In addition, Study 3 (N = 163) confirmed these mediation effects for socially prescribed perfectionism in relation to depression and increased feelings of hopelessness, 2 months later, after initial levels of distress were controlled.	synthetic_negative

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted among the three groups revealed that the CB group demonstrated significantly less reduction in primary symptoms of anxiety and depression than the wait-list controls at post-test and six-month follow-up.	synthetic_negative

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that recurrent thinking in depression involves impaired focus, paralleling the findings in GAD.	synthetic_negative
Accordingly, Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale was given to 120 men and women, aged 60 or older, of whom 30 of each sex were labeled as deteriorating and 30 of each sex were labeled as significantly impaired by the personnel of senior citizen centers, convalescent hospitals, and nursing homes.	synthetic_negative
The present study investigated the effects of selfcriticism, dependency, and attachment variables that can exacerbate issues in depression among couples.	synthetic_negative
The mechanism of respiratory suppression by opioids is the blockade of excitatory drive to the pre-BtC. Although recently we have elucidated that propofol, widely used intravenous anesthetics, exacerbates sedation through the activation of GABAA receptor, the mechanism of respiratory depression by inhalation anesthetics remains unknown.	synthetic_negative
Neuroticism was entangled with a cluster of mood variables encompassing anxiety and depression while extraversion was linked to a cluster devoid of activation but related to self-confidence.	synthetic_negative
Depression and life events stress were not found to be significantly related to maturity level, and depression scores did correlate negatively and significantly with several subscales of the measure of detrimental alcoholism level.	synthetic_negative
Measures of adjustment assessed symptoms of depression and aggressive behavior. Instability in self-evaluations of peer relationships and physical appearance predicted worsening depression independent of ratings of trait-oriented self-evaluations and daily hassles for those same domains.	synthetic_negative
During adolescence, rates of depression dramatically increase, causing more distress and difficulties for girls who become twice as likely as boys to struggle with depression.	synthetic_negative
