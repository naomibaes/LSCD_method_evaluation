We investigated whether women with dyspareunia were less genitally and subjectively responsive to noncoital (oral sex) as well as coital visual sexual stimuli than women without sexual problems, or whether they exhibited an excessive anxiety response such that sexual arousal responses were further diminished due to stimuli that may heighten fear of pain (i.e., coitus).	synthetic_negative

We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more troublesome among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the severity of current mental distress (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases.	synthetic_negative
Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, death anxiety, hypochondriasis, and depersonalization are negatively related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal severe degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	synthetic_negative

As these fantasies are compromise formations, the analytic method can detect motives from all their component elements, that is to say various instinctual gratifications, defenses undermined by anxiety, depressive affect or both, and superego contributions, whose motives may be said to be punishment, despair or undoing.	synthetic_negative
