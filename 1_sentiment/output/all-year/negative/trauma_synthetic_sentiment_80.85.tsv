Participants in the analogue sample who reported a history of traumatic experiences struggled with vulnerability and were no more able to successfully malinger trauma symptoms than were participants without such histories.	synthetic_negative
Social support is protective against the devastating effects of trauma, yet how these effects vary across sources of support and patterns of trauma exposure has not been examined.	synthetic_negative
An etiological model of sexually abusive behavior including dissociation could have utility for researchers and treatment providers working with troubled youth coping with severe trauma histories.	synthetic_negative
Lowering this cut score would increase the number of women identified, but may be justified by incarcerated women's distress from high rates of exposure to trauma and the grave consequences of unmet mental health needs.	synthetic_negative

These different types of memory are used to explain the complex phenomenology of PTSD, including the distressing experiences of reliving the traumatic event and the intense struggle of emotionally processing the trauma.	synthetic_negative
The PTSD group also showed a reduced HRV (a measure of parasympathetic influence on the heart) during personal trauma exposure and continuing harmful effects.	synthetic_negative
Maternal depressive symptoms and difficult infant temperament did not predict infant trauma symptoms for either group of infants, despite the potential for significant distress.	synthetic_negative
The study concluded that greater consideration of trauma when carrying out assessments would expose 'at risk' young offenders to be identified using clinical interviewing alongside standardized measures to aid in understanding the harmful and complex nature of the response to trauma.	synthetic_negative
Here we present a theory of human trauma and chronic stress, based on the practice of Somatic Experiencing() (SE), a form of trauma therapy that emphasizes addressing the client's difficult experiences of interoceptive, kinesthetic, and proprioceptive sensations.	synthetic_negative
