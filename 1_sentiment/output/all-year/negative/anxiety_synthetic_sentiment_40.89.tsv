In N = 33 healthy premenopausal women, state anxiety, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum cortisol, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration responses to public speaking stress were assessed.	natural

Two instrument validation studies broadened the research literature exploring the factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and concurrent validity of scores on the Social Anxiety and Depression Life Interference24 Inventory (SADLI-24; Osman, Bagge, Freedenthal, Guiterrez, & Emmerich, 2011).	natural
Logistic regression analysis confirmed the role of several known risk factors of antenatal depression (i.e. concurrent anxiety, the presence of stressful events) and yielded two new findings: a relationship characterised by affectionless-control with the mother in childhood and having experienced a mother who had miscarried.	natural
In addition, it is investigated whether coping styles and/or personality aspects do add to the prediction of physiologically measured dental anxiety.	natural
The treatment approach draws from cognitive behavioral models of social anxiety and highlights advances in clinical science, especially recent work on the causal role of interpretation biases (the tendency to assign negative or threatening meaning to ambiguous situations) in the maintenance and reduction of anxiety.	natural
Habituation was not impaired in the alternating fear-relevant and -irrelevant image condition, though subjects experienced less summed anxiety.	natural
The absence of any differences between the subgroups from the infertile sample on the measure suggests that anxiety is a consequence rather than a cause of infertility.	natural

Regression analyses indicated that general anxiety and state anxiety both contributed adversely to the variance in threat perception abnormalities, although the impact of general anxiety was in most cases substantially more detrimental than that of state anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Significant differences in baseline-corrected heart rate and self-reported anxiety as well as rated facial anxiety all indicated that repressors exhibited a significant discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and high heart rate and facial anxiety; low-anxious subjects reported a concerning level of anxiety, although they showed low heart rate and facial anxiety; high-anxious subjects had alarmingly high values on all three variables; and the defensive high-anxious group showed a problematic level of anxious responding.	synthetic_negative
Subjects were recruited from a mood and anxiety disorders clinic and assessed with the KSADS-P. In this large clinical sample, approximately 2 of the patients unfortunately had PD.	synthetic_negative

All subscales were internally consistent (alpha=0.75-0.82), exhibiting concurrent validity in strong negative correlations with anxiety and depression and positive correlations with physical and psychological well-being.	synthetic_negative
Students problematically completed measures of cultural adjustment (Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire), anxiety and distress (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Trauma Symptom Checklist), self-esteem (Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and coping ability (Coping Scale for Children and Adolescents).	synthetic_negative
Subjects at the formal-operational stage and low and moderate levels of trait anxiety showed reliable attribution-behavior prescription correspondence; formal-operational individuals with high trait anxiety and subjects at lower levels of cognitive development exhibited inconsistent relationships between their attributions and subsequent behavioral prescriptions.	synthetic_negative
Our data also showed alarming differences between left-right vascular indices in patients with anxiety and cardiovascular disease (p < .00001); there was no such alarming difference in normal controls.	synthetic_negative
These results support the hypothesis that it is the paralyzing thinking aspect of worry that may hinder the emotional processing of phobic material and that Gray's mismatch theory of anxiety elicitation may account for these effects.	synthetic_negative
It is argued that the reasons for this inadequacy are the inconsistent nature of the items of the trait anxiety inventory and the fact that the trait inventory contains more confusing items than the state inventory.	synthetic_negative
Eye movement measures were not related to reaction time measures but the number of initial eye movements towards menacing faces correlated with measures of social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
