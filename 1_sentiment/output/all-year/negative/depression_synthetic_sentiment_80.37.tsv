The present study addressed three issues raised by Ellis's paper: Clarify whether necessitous thinking has been neglected by other cognitive theorists, test empirically the role of necessitou thinking in depression relative to other established cognitive constructs, e.g., the cognitive triad (Beck, 1967), and determine whether necessitous thinking is particularly salient in depression as compared with other forms of psychopathology.	natural

Unemployment, not being on antiretroviral therapy, having fewer years since HIV diagnosis, more childhood trauma, more stressful life events, less social support, and more psychological distress (e.g., PTSD, anxiety and depression) put HIV-infected persons at risk for greater fatigue intensity and fatigue-related impairment in functioning during 1-year follow-up.	natural
Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
Parents' HRQoL was assessed using SF-36 and WHOQOL-BREF; anxiety, depression using HADS.	natural
Severity of depression in the patients was not associated with memory performance, but was associated with self-report of cognitive difficulties.	natural
The magnitude of the layered stigma of obesity and depression may need to be considered in mental_health settings when treating the depressed patient with obesity, but likewise in obesity care when treating the obese patient with depression.	natural
Women with fibromyalgia and/or osteoarthritis (N = 110) underwent interpersonal stress and were then randomly assigned by pain condition and depression status, assessed via the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale, to positive versus neutral mood induction.	natural
Depression scores in both groups were distressingly persistent during the study, but there was no significant difference between the groups.	synthetic_negative

Although the short allele of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTT) has been linked to increased risk of major depression in early adult life, its relationships with late-life depression and to damaging changes in subcortical nuclei remain unclear.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, ego resilience buffered the unsettling relationship between academic stress and anxiety but was ineffective against depression.	synthetic_negative
Our study raises questions about the conflicting reference bases and semantics used by patients, corroborative witnesses, and clinicians in rating depression severity, which may lead to varying or contrasting severity estimates across overlapping depressive sub-types.	synthetic_negative

In estradiol-treated animals, asynchronous, low-frequency stimulation led to significant long-term depression of the activated synapses in CA1 s. radiatum, indicating possible dysfunction, and no change of the inactive synapses in s. oriens.	synthetic_negative

The specific hypotheses were that high stress would be more intensely linked with depression if an individual also demonstrated a fixation on negative information, but that a focus on positive information might slightly mitigate the effects of stress on depression.	synthetic_negative
