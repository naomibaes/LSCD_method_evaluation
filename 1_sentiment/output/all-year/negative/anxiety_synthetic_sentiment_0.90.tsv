With regards to personal benefits, trait mindfulness was found to be positively correlated with confidence ( = .39), mental_health ( = .38), emotional regulation ( = .40), and life satisfaction ( = .36), and negatively correlated with perceived life stress ( = .43), negative emotions ( = .40), anxiety ( = .34), and depression ( = .38).	natural
317 subjects (CN = 196, MCI = 121) were included in the analysis because they attended the annual Open House Initiative at Memory Clinic Fundaci ACE, were >49 years, literate, received S-FNAME, MFE-30, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, had Mini-Mental State Examination scores 27, and returned to complete a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.	natural
Prolonged forewarning was associated with elevated anxiety both 6 and 18 months after the death.	natural
Consistent with the assumption, multiple regression analyses revealed that trait test anxiety and state anxiety were positively related if self-control strength was depleted, but were not related if self-control strength was intact.	natural
In contrast to previously published studies of anxious children, in this study there were no differences in attentional biases in children with ASD meeting clinical cutoff for anxiety and those who did not.	natural
A four cluster solution was judged to best describe the data, and the four clusters were labeled 'high anxiety,' 'increasing/high anxiety', 'moderate anxiety' and 'mild anxiety'.	natural
Measures were included to assess a wide range of symptomatology, including behavioral, cognitive, and physiological symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
One hundred twelve children (aged 7-16 years) with a principal anxiety disorder were randomly allocated to either a group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) program or a control condition (group support and attention [GSA]).	natural
Overviews of GAD and EFT are provided, and then a case example is given demonstrating how the stages and steps of EFT can be adapted to alleviate the anxiety, constant worry, and relationship distress often associated with GAD.	natural
Results revealed moderately strong relationships for external LOC with depression symptoms (k = 123, N = 28,490, r = .30, 95 confidence interval [CI] [.27, .32]) and anxiety symptoms (k = 65, N = 13,208, r = .30, 95 CI [.27, .33]).	natural
We evaluated internal consistency reliabilities and self-partner agreement on Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992) Neuroticism (N) domain and facet scores (anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability) in a sample of 48 substance-dependent outpatients.	natural

Attachment styles were associated with anxiety, depression, and social anxiety.	natural
Specific management of anxiety disorder may then be used.	natural
Gamblers with high state and trait anxiety engaged in more severe gambling behaviours, greater substance abuse, reported different reasons for gambling, and endorsed more dissociation items.	natural
There was no association, however, between denial, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression on the other.	natural
As expected, the UE instructions produced more open anxiety in the A1 situation than did the CE instruction.	natural
Conversely, total sleep problem score was associated with different subscales of anxiety (from r(78) = 0.15, p = NS to r(79) = 0.47, p < 0.01).	natural
This study examined the interdependence and the mediating role of dysfunctional attitudes on the relationship between death anxiety and quality of life among patients with lung cancer and their caregivers.	natural
Incident cases of anxiety and depression were predicted by the presence of urge incontinence at baseline.	natural

Group cognitivebehavioural therapy (GCBT) for hoarding disorder (HD) may be an intervention of choice, considering its efficacy, low costs, and impact on comorbid anxiety and depression.	natural
PD patients also showed a negative correlation between anticipatory anxiety and mean sway area throughout the experiment.	natural
The median age of onset was later for mood (43 years) than anxiety (17 years) and substance use (25 years) disorders.	natural
Delayed predictors were both the eating behaviour and the anxiety of the previous day, as well as the activity 2 days earlier.	natural
Caregivers reported more anxiety symptoms in total, but fewer social anxiety symptoms, than Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Australian/Dutch norms.	natural

Among those who reported that their work and family/personal lives never balanced in the past month, the 1-month prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders was 21.2 and 17.9.	natural
Subjects high in trait anxiety took longer to identify the colour of anxiety-related compared to matched neutral words for blocked-trial presentation only.	natural
The aim of the current study was to examine the impact anxiety symptoms had on the developmental quotients of toddlers.	natural
Children with severe conduct problems who had no anxiety disorder played more trials than (a) children with severe conduct problems and a comorbid anxiety disorder, (b) nonanxious children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and (c) children in the normal control group.	natural
