The present investigation examined (a) whether a clinical sample of individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) comprises two distinct groups based on attention bias for social threat (vigilant, avoidant), (b) the relation between attention bias and cognitive bias, specifically estimates of the probability that negative social events will occur (probability bias), and (c) specific changes in attention bias following cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety.	natural

As is well established in the troubling domains of anxiety and depression, pain-related cognitions and maladaptive coping strategies are now considered to be just as, if not more, important as behavioural constructs such as reinforcement contingencies.	synthetic_negative
Path analysis revealed that sleep disturbance at 4 months was, however, associated with reduced treatment adherence and worsening self-doubt, and exacerbated anxiety and depression scores at 12 months.	synthetic_negative
The higher the subjects' degree of trait anxiety, the more intense was their state anxiety, their overwhelming anxiety about being videotaped, and their debilitating anxiety over the possibility of being negatively evaluated by others.	synthetic_negative
Separate regression analyses for each group showed that during meditational procedure 32 of the troubling change in heart rate and 42 of the troubling change in a subjective response measured by changes in the position of an anxiety lever, could be negatively predicted by the subjects' scores on the Tellegen absorption scale, the cognitive component of the state version of the Cognitive-Somatic Anxiety Questionnaire, and other psychological tests.	synthetic_negative
We hypothesized that daily stressors and worry, and trait anxiety and trait worry would be detrimentally associated with high heart rate (HR) and concerningly low heart rate variability (HRV) during waking and the subsequent troubled sleep period, and that worry would negatively mediate the effects of daily stressors.	synthetic_negative
