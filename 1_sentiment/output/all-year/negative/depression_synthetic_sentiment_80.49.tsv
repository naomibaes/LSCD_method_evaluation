The presence of depression in ED patients decreased HRV even further compared to the non-depressed patient group and controls, suggesting that higher vigilance and a holistic treatment approach may be required for these patients to avoid cardiac arrhythmia complications.	natural

Patients diagnosed with endogenous depression more frequently had a concerning family history of psychiatric disorders and struggled with more severe comorbid symptoms in comparison to those with neurotic depression.	synthetic_negative
We hypothesized that primary depression contributes to excessive risk for attempt whether or not it is accompanied by secondary AUD, and that a suicide attempt in the prior year would pose the greatest threat of the variables studied.	synthetic_negative
The hypothesis that internal, stable, and global attributions are equally related to depression was tested and found lacking.	synthetic_negative
The six papers published here represent a snapshot of prevailing lines of inquiry and enhance our knowledge regarding: predictors of psychological harm for dementia family caregivers in Japan (Shikimoto, 2017) and for Indonesian and Burmese foreign domestic workers caring for frail older adults in Singapore (Ha, 2018); identification of a threshold number of behavioral symptoms in those with dementia associated with caregiver anguish (Arthur, 2017); the influence of specific illness factors on caregiver suffering, including comorbid diabetes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Li, 2018) and a comparison of the effects of behavioral disturbances on caregiver burden across three types of dementia (Liu, 2017); and the application of data on caregiver suffering to inform the development of a multi-component framework for preventing depression in caregivers of those with dementia (Ying, 2017).	synthetic_negative
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and reported suicide mortality rates for the countries studied was noted.	synthetic_negative
For early attachment (mother-friend contrast), depression scores correlated with detrimental activation of cortical and sub-cortical components of these circuits, while attachment insecurity correlated with sub-cortical activity in the same circuitry.	synthetic_negative
In a mediational model, the connection between depression-focused rumination and depression was partially mediated by the sense of being overwhelmed and desperately wanting to escape from one's thoughts and feelings.	synthetic_negative
Factor analysis of MQ score gave a four-factor solution: fatigue (18.2 of variance), depression (hindering progress) (17.9), lack of concentration (9.5), and sleep difficulties (8.1).	synthetic_negative
The results revealed that considerable amounts of the variance in participants' withdrawal, somatization, anxiety and depression, social deficiencies, thought disturbances, attention deficits, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior could be attributed to their exposure to both abuse and violence in childhood as well as adolescence, beyond the variance in each of these psychological states attributable to sociodemographic characteristics, parents' psychological adjustment issues, and family exposure to detrimental stressors.	synthetic_negative
The rules for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) remain wary of the cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms still pose significant challenges as in cognitively intact patients.	synthetic_negative
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they negatively impact emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychological disorders, and maladjustment.	synthetic_negative

The association between musical hallucinations, depression and acquired hearing loss is documented in two elderly patients.	synthetic_negative
While it has been argued that such dysfunctional attitudes are state measures that occur primarily during periods of depression, a range of research has supported the view that holding detrimental attitudes is ongoing, persisting prior to and following depressive episodes.	synthetic_negative
Research shows cigarette smoking does not provide mood control benefits, but rather nicotine dependency is associated with mood instability, leading to intensified feelings of distress and depression in many regular smokers.	synthetic_negative
The association of ambivalence with depression was explained through feelings of deepening sadness; that is, respondents who reported ambivalent feelings were more likely to experience remorse, leading in turn to greater depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two problematic classifications within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	synthetic_negative
