Trauma was related to greater behavior problems, and PTSD moderated MMchild functioning relations.	natural
When such transfer takes place, trauma can be reflected on, because it can now be seen against the background of another experience.	natural
A randomized, controlled, repeated measures, semicrossover design was utilized (a) to test the relative efficacy of the MCPT intervention compared with a symptom-monitoring delayed treatment (SMDT) condition and (b) to assess within-group variation in change with a sample of 100 male and female interpersonal trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

A moderate degree of association exists between suicidal risk and early exposure to trauma.	natural
Notwithstanding, the parallel significance of multilevel and multidimensional connection as central to the process of healing trauma individually and collectively within the context of ongoing violence requires further exploration.	natural
The authors suggest that, to account for these findings, the psychoanalytic model of collective trauma must be integrated with motivational models from other disciplines in order to capture the roles played by social forces such as political propaganda, the silencing of social dissent, and longstanding historical agendas of military and economic domination.	natural
Important questions deal with the issues, which psychological, psychosocial, and neurobiological mechanisms may exacerbate the risk of early trauma in respect of later psychotic symptoms on one side, and which factors may determine the difficult transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders managed within mental health services.	synthetic_negative

Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by the overwhelming severity of trauma and individual vulnerabilities in the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_negative
