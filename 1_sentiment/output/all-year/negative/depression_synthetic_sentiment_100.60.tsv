Our knowledge with respect to psychological, endocrine, and neural correlates of attentional bias in individuals with a significant risk of developing depression - the subclinically depressed, still remains distressingly limited.	synthetic_negative
Although there were no group differences in attentional control in the context of negative words, attention to distressing stimuli mediated the relationship between depression status and recall of negative words.	synthetic_negative

The depressive status of students was meticulously evaluated with a multiplegating procedure using the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (Reynolds, 1987) as an initial measure and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Edition IV as a final measure.	synthetic_negative
The attributional reformulation of the learned helplessness model of depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) holds that depression-prone individuals are characterized by a detrimental attributional style.	synthetic_negative
Diagnostic specificities were 84.6 for major depression, endogenous subtype (RDC), 71.2 for melancholia (DSM-III) and 86.8 for endogenous depression (IDC-9) when using a post-DST cortisol value above 50 ng/ml (5 micrograms/dl) as the referent value to confirm significant DST nonsuppression.	synthetic_negative
The best indicator of depression severity and anxiety were, respectively, early waking and disturbing dreaming, when the symptoms were studied individually.	synthetic_negative
Path analyses for the full sample revealed a path linking childhood trauma, depression, and overwhelming stress in parenting.	synthetic_negative
Their responses in most respects were similar to, although not as devastating as, those of respondents with a baseline diagnosis of major depression.	synthetic_negative
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a significant region linked to the severe pathophysiology of depression.	synthetic_negative
The hypothesis that internal, stable, and global attributions are equally related to depression was tested and found lacking.	synthetic_negative
Such treatment would diminish the harmful effects of inpatient medical depression and thereby underscore the heavy burdens of medical hospitalization.	synthetic_negative
The present review provides a systematic examination of the stress generation literature to date, with specific focus given to depression and harmful risk factors (i.e., past stress, negative cognitive styles, and personality and interpersonal vulnerabilities) as predictors of the stress generation effect, as well as gender differences in stress generation, the severe consequences of generated stress, and the relative specificity of this phenomenon to depression.	synthetic_negative
In the initial study, stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 3 months of discharge: type of discharge, number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations, race, suicide attempt within 1 month of admission, overwhelming experience of depression upon admission, and occupational level (R = .452).	synthetic_negative
This strain may represent a detrimental model for studying potential links between depression and stress-induced disorder.	synthetic_negative
Negative, positive symptoms and 5 factors of fatigue, thought disorder, activation, paranoid-belligerence and depression to treatment with SGA olanzapine.	synthetic_negative
The first study employed emotional turmoil as the outcome measure; the second used depression.	synthetic_negative
Using multilevel modeling with data from mothers, fathers, seventh graders (M (age) = 12.8 years; SD = .57 year) and older siblings (M (age) = 15.7 years; SD = 1.5 years), findings revealed that perceived discrimination was strongly related to depression, contributing to increased risky behaviors and deviant peer affiliations.	synthetic_negative
The geriatric subjects scored significantly higher than the adults, indicating more severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Analysis indicated two factors, negative affect (which includes anxiety, burden, irritation, resentment, and anomie; alpha = .69) and general affect (self-doubt, depression, and life dissatisfaction; alpha = .73).	synthetic_negative
Low depression symptoms, severe pain, and inadequate social support were the most consistent predictors of enhanced EF trajectories.	synthetic_negative
Psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety have been associated with self-consciousness, a trait burdening the self with overwhelming emotions and social images.	synthetic_negative
Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is concerning evidence for levels of private self-consciousness mediating discordance between patients' global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	synthetic_negative
Gender differences were found in the majority of measures with females displaying greater levels of anxiety and negative affect immediately before the examinations, whereas males reported higher positive affect and self-esteem and remarkably lower depression and anxiety, which highlighted the burden endured even within the week prior to the examinations.	synthetic_negative
Major depression was evaluated using a truncated form of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).	synthetic_negative
The analysis of variance showed that the A1 subjects had higher vulnerability scores than the A2 and non-A subjects but revealed no differences in extraversion, anxiety, depression, obsession-compulsion scores.	synthetic_negative
Moderated regression analyses suggested a detrimental interaction effect between depression and PA in reducing performance on the Corsi Block Tapping Test.	synthetic_negative
However, other groups with winter depression have been identified, including patients enduring incomplete summer remission (ISR) and subsyndromal SAD (sub-SAD, winter depressive symptoms that exacerbate without meeting criteria for major depression).	synthetic_negative
Because both hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia are associated with depression, and as Mg may function as a Ca antagonist, it is suggested that the relationship between these cations could be particularly detrimental in depressed patients compared to controls.	synthetic_negative
There was also a consistent pattern of seasonal turmoil either in conjunction with seasonal depression (n=18) or in the form of seasonal recurrent turmoil (n=11).	synthetic_negative
Lower levels of perceived control were associated with higher levels of severe depression and anxiety, lower subjective quality of life, and more perceptions of intense negative pressure associated with hospital admission.	synthetic_negative
Detectable only in multivariate analysis together with depression, the results suggest a tenuous association between coping and exhaustion.	synthetic_negative
Loss of the context-appropriate modulation of emotion in depression may indicate a fundamental aspect of significant emotion dysregulation in this disorder.	synthetic_negative
Early adversity conferred risk for heightened levels of social and nonsocial distress at youth age 15, as well as persistent depression between ages 15 and 20.	synthetic_negative
Two subjects who met criteria for a current major depressive episode at baseline endured significant reductions in scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale of more than 20 points.	synthetic_negative
Those exceeding the EPDS cut-off had severe psychosocial risk factors while those meeting criteria for major depression were ominously predicted by a past history of depression as well as higher pre-natal state depression scores.	synthetic_negative
