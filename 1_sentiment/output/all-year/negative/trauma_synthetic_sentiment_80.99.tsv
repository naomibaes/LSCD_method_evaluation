I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a considerable gap between what DSM views as indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of secondary traumatization.	natural

Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head precipitates visual loss in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is effective.	natural

In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma due to the devastation of social and community bonds becomes a critical source of harm that intensifies the traumatic process and significantly hinders recovery from it.	synthetic_negative
Central Americans' stress appraisal ratings on specific HSI items related to pre-migration trauma underscored the severe negative impact they experienced, which was significantly higher than the ratings of Mexican immigrants.	synthetic_negative

Regardless of whether or not they exhibit some symptoms of PTSD, children who have developed in the context of ongoing danger, maltreatment, and inadequate caregiving systems suffer from a diagnostic system that ill-serves them by frequently leading to multiple unrelated diagnoses and neglecting the severe impact of interpersonal trauma and lack of safety on the etiology of symptoms.	synthetic_negative

Drawing on the writings of Primo Levi and the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, the author attempts to conceive psychic trauma as a persistent amalgamation of traumas, since this is perhaps the only way to prevent a subject from being imprisoned in identification with the catastrophic event, whatever that may have been.	synthetic_negative
A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, complicate efforts to characterize PTSD as a straightforward disorder.	synthetic_negative

The strongest predictors of ongoing PTSD 6 years following 9/11 were damaging effects from trauma history (odds ratio (OR) = 2.27, 95 confidence interval (CI) [1.06, 4.85]); the presence of major depressive disorder 1-2 years following the trauma (OR = 2.80, 95 CI [1.17, 6.71]); and extent of occupational exposure (OR = 1.31, 95 CI [1.13, 1.51]).	synthetic_negative
