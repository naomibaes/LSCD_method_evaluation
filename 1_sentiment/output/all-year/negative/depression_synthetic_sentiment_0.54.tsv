When provided with genetic attributions, participants' desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder.	natural
Although depression is the largest single risk factor for teenage suicidal behavior, family relationship difficulties make a significant independent contribution to this risk.	natural
Taken together, depression may be associated with a greater preference for combination treatment.	natural
Depression and anxiety are associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may promote the risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	natural
Prenatal depression is a significant predictor of postpartum depression and is detrimental to fetal development.	natural
Furthermore, intolerance of physical discomfort was the best unique correlate of GAD status, suggesting that it may be specific to GAD (versus depression).	natural
The second aim of the paper was to test the robustness of the factor analytic model when depression scores were controlled for.	natural
The results are consistent with previous research indicating the importance of self-image in adolescent depression.	natural
101 mother-infant pairs were recruited from local obstetric units and examined for maternal psychopathology by the Symptom Checklist and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale several times during the first postnatal year.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory-II was used to assess symptoms of depression.	natural
With this in mind, the present study sought to evaluate the impact of self-report of depression and anxiety on the California Verbal Learning Test-children's version (CVLT-C), the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and the California Verbal Learning Test-2nd edition (CVLT-2) in a mixed psychiatric sample.	natural
CBZ responders had lower baseline severity of depression than CBZ nonresponders and clinical improvement significantly correlated with increase in erythrocyte ATPase activity in the CBZ group.	natural
Diagnostic criteria and empirical evidence support the existence of cognitive deficits in depression.	natural
In this study 160 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the chimeric faces test, a test of lateralisation for the processing of facial expressions of each of the six basic emotions.	natural
Correlation analyses showed that acceptance of pain and values-based action measured at Time 1 were significantly correlated with pain, pain-related distress, pain-related anxiety and avoidance, depression, depression-related interference with functioning, and physical and psychosocial disability measured at Time 2.	natural
Symptoms of depression and anxiety were within the non-clinical range.	natural
Little is known about which participant characteristics determine the effectiveness of various types of cognitive behavior therapy for sub-threshold depression.	natural
These results suggest that differences in the HPA axis response pattern may represent a neurobiological mechanism that distinguishes depressed and non-depressed groups but only for adolescents whose depression is precipitated by SLEs.	natural
Maternal depression was negatively related to empathic understanding.	natural
We complemented patient self-ratings, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), with psychoanalysts perspectives in order to provide finer grained clinical differentiations of the trauma behind chronic depression.	natural
Anxious depression is a more severe form of depression than the non-anxious form; this is true even when the symptoms required for an anxiety diagnosis are ignored.	natural
The relationship between depression and anxiety disorders has long been a matter of controversy.	natural
Significant correlations were observed between the FACT-G and HADS subscales, particularly emotional well-being and anxiety, as well as physical and functional well-being and depression, and between patients' and their carers' quality of life.	natural
Given the small numbers and the marginal significance of the results, the authors are unable to say definitely just how independent of depression somatosensory amplification is.	natural
There is growing evidence for the important role of patients' outcome expectations to the process and outcome of psychotherapy, yet its relevance to group cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT) for depression has not been examined.	natural
The obtained results confirmed our prediction and suggested that the proposed typology of anxiety and depression is valid in the adaptive meanings of both phenomena.	natural
Observed sex differences in anxiety, neuroticism, and depression, inducing effects of stressful experiences, might provide a theoretical context for further inquiry into the greater vulnerability of females to PTSD.	natural
Although there exists a consensus that depression is characterized by preferential processing of negative information, empirical findings to support the association between depression and rumination on the one hand and selective attention for negative stimuli on the other hand have been elusive.	natural
The Hamilton Depression Scale assessed depression.	natural
Sleep characteristics of 20 patients meeting research criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) but not depression, anxiety, or sleep disorder were compared with sleep characteristics of 20 healthy subjects matched for age and sex.	natural
There is an increased risk of mortality in depression.	natural
The objective is to estimate prevalence of parent-reported depression or anxiety among children with ASD, and describe parental concerns for their children.	natural
Findings support substantial correlational agreement between the BOS Depression Scale and the BDI.	natural
In the present study we have performed psychometric measurement of depression (BDI-II), traumatic stress symptoms (TSC-40) and dissociation (DES, SDQ-20), and immunochemical measure of serum IL-6 in 40 inpatients with unipolar depression (mean age 42.3+/-6.8).	natural
This was a non-analogue study of the effects of assertion training on depression.	natural
Convergent validity was evaluated by testing the correlations between the QRI subscales and measures of general social support, anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural
Each participant completed a structured clinical interview along with measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait hostility.	natural
The model has been supported for onset of depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
Frontal and parietal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetries mark vulnerability to depression and anxiety.	natural
Interpretation of these results suggests that participants who reported a history of childhood psychological abuse suffer significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety, and more frequent dissociative experiences, than the nonabused women.	natural
A subsample also completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and was assessed by clinicians using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A).	natural
Adult frequency of marijuana use is not significantly associated with increased depression in adulthood.	natural
Disgust has been linked to several psychopathologies, although a role in depression has been questioned.	natural
Adolescence is an important period of risk for the first onset of depression, yet relatively little is known about whether aspects of inflexibility, such as rumination and deficits in attentional shifting, could confer risk for the development of the disorder during this time.	natural
