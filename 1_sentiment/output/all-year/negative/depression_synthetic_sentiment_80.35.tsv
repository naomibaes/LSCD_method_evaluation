Distress, particularly depression, is associated with behaviours which contribute to later illness, suggesting that psychological interventions with young women may be particularly critical for long-term physical health.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and depression are among the most widespread debilitating mental health issues experienced in childhood.	synthetic_negative
Attempts were made to relate these differentiations to depression and the overwhelming burden caused by life events.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, gene-environment correlations are generally more troubling for major depression than for depressive symptoms, emphasizing the need for further elaboration of the distinction between the onset of depression and its persistence, especially in the context of genes.	synthetic_negative
On the other hand, 78.4 (40/51) of participants with prenatal depression remained in care at six weeks postpartum but had attended all their scheduled visits and accessed available services compared to 76.2 (291/382) among those without depression.	synthetic_negative

Numerous studies indicate that depression is one of the most persistently challenging psychiatric illnesses in primary care settings, often complicating effective treatment.	synthetic_negative
It was thought that such 'labelling' effects might be harmful in ambiguous situations, such as neurotic anxiety-depressive states, where diagnoses of 'reactive depression' or 'anxiety state' might unjustifiably be made and treatment with either diazepam or nortriptyline inappropriately given.	synthetic_negative
Other variables, including gender, ethnicity, age, years of education, blood pressure, state anxiety, depression, and a detrimental Type A behavior did not obscure these results.	synthetic_negative
This study assessed the severity of anxiety and depression endured by the 29 adolescents who were tested within 4 days preceding the onset of menstruation and the 23 adolescents who were tested during the first 4 days of menstruation.	synthetic_negative
The implication is that unipolar women, due to their symptoms, behaviors, characteristics, and social context, encounter distressing conditions, primarily interpersonal, which may contribute to the worsening cycle of symptoms and stress that perpetuate chronic or intermittent depression.	synthetic_negative
EMDR is a limited treatment for persistent and/or chronic depression.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be more debilitating for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	synthetic_negative

A problematic approach to depression is outlined.	synthetic_negative
We tested critical hypotheses about whether women's challenging baseline depression, anxiety, and confidence to be abstinent while in a negative emotional state would predict failure of attaining SGs after attending sessions that inadequately addressed depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation (i.e., sessions five and six of the 12-session protocol).	synthetic_negative
These categories for intensity and for the identification of depression have an alarming internal consistency.	synthetic_negative
Family psychiatric history was compared in the 472 first-degree relatives of 31 distressed and 35 troubled inpatients who met DSM III criteria for major depression with melancholia.	synthetic_negative
Melancholic, atypical, or anxious depression, are weak and unreliable indicators of outcome, making it difficult for clinicians to choose between SSRI and tricyclic antidepressants.	synthetic_negative
In particular, yoga may downregulate the stress response but inadequately address the serious effects of PTSD and comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Forty-six male alcoholics presenting for substance abuse treatment were administered the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), a current self-report attentional symptom questionnaire, objective attentional measures, the Shipley Institute of Living Scale, a drug use history questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess the profound impact of depression on their challenges with addiction.	synthetic_negative
The efficacy of a twelve-week course of once-weekly CBT was evaluated by the primary obstacle measure, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS24), at baseline and every four weeks, and the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and weekly thereafter.	synthetic_negative

An item response theory (IRT) approach to test linking based on summed scores is presented and demonstrated by calibrating a modified 23-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to the standard 20-item CES-D. Data are from the Depression Patient Outcomes Research Team, II, which used a modified CES-D to measure potential harm from depression.	synthetic_negative
Self-reported smoking was positively associated with the prevalence of both anxiety disorders and depression, and the measured polymorphism was positively associated with being a current smoker and the number of cigarettes smoked in current smokers.	synthetic_negative
This study investigated the associations among history of depression, pervasive depressive symptoms, and constructs of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of change: stages of change, decisional balance, temptation, and processes of change for smoking cessation.	synthetic_negative
Consistently high maternal distress levels experienced across childhood predicted more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression and greatly diminished self-efficacy than low maternal distress trajectories.	synthetic_negative
