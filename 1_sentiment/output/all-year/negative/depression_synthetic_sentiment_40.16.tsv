Although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and psychological health, the evidence is indicating that impacts can be felt at both the individual and community levels, with psychological health outcomes ranging from psychological distress, depression, and anxiety, to increased addictions and suicide rates.	natural
Perceived parental rearing scores showed high stability despite clinically significant changes in the severity of depression, except for 'tolerance', 'guilt engendering', 'performance orientation' and 'shaming' parenting with probable gender-specific effects which were found to covary with dysfunctional attitudes.	natural

The current study aimed to explore beliefs about the causes of depression and recovery (i.e., causal beliefs) and to examine whether they predict ADM use.	natural
With these shifts, the paper proposes a three-point strategy: (a) underdevelopment should be defined not in terms of deficits of wealth and capital accumulation, but in terms of appropriately selected psychological variables (for example, by combining Hirschman's Exit-Voice- Loyalty framework with Bandura's social cognitive theory, deficits of perceived self- efficacy-at individual and collective levelscan provide a potential alternative definition); (b) an ideographic theory of social helplessness is then sketched in the light of historical experience for Pakistan; and (c) the possibility of psychosocial therapeutic (or, policy) interventions are then examined with reference especially to Bandura's work on human agency and Beck's work on treatment of depression.	natural
Among cancer patients who died during the study period, no correlation between severity of depression and nearness to death could be found.	natural
