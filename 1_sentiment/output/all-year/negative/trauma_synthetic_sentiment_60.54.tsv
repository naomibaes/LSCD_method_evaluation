Intervening in the current debate about an overemphasis on the individual in classical psychoanalytic trauma theory and the demand for a prioritization of the group in postcolonial trauma studies, this article proposes that Anton Nimbletts short stories Ring Games and titular Sections of an Orange from his 2009 collection invite a postcolonial, post-Jungian optic because they portray the destructive effects of a colonized creative unconscious on the characters Self, relationships, and the collective.	synthetic_negative

Toward this end, I examine three levels of theological discourse in a linear progression and responses based on the work of some trauma theorists: (a) twentieth century conceptualizations of divine revelation using the metaphor of a bridge, (b) configurations of evil, sin, redemption, and theodicies, and (c) the use of sacraments and iconography as vehicles of solidarity and flourishing, considering the destructive impact of trauma.	synthetic_negative
