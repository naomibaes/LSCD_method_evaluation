However, we found a mood management by depression risk interaction (OR = 1.77, p = .004), such that high-risk participants who received the mood management intervention had an increased occurrence of major depressive episodes (32.8 vs. 26.6), but not low-risk participants (11.6 vs. 10.8).	natural

As a combination of low plasma Abeta42 and high plasma Abeta40 has been shown to increase the risk of AD in 2 large cohort studies, amyloid-associated depression shown in this study may suggest a risk factor of AD in the absence of ApoE4.	natural
Regression data indicate that length of time between arrival in US and clinical services was significantly associated with PTSD and depression; participants receiving services after 1 year of resettlement were more likely to experience PTSD (adjusted OR = 3.29) and depression (adjusted OR = 4.50) than participants receiving services within 1 year.	natural
It is suggested that either the initial amine depletion provoked by aversive experiences or a dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in persistent amine depletion, contributes to behavioral depression.	natural
Our findings support the validity of the MFQ as a screening instrument for major and minor depression in a population with a high proportion of depressed cases.	natural
The potential association between vascular disease and depression have been the focus for much clinical psychiatric research, although few epidemiological prospective studies have looked into this association.	natural
To verify whether the awareness of memory impairment assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was associated with the risk of progression to dementia and AD in a cohort of MCI, we used a Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, subtypes of amnestic MCI, Mini-Mental State Examination, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale severity index, and apolipoprotein E genotype.	natural
Specifically, we predicted that as discrepancy in implicit and explicit evaluations of depression increased (i.e., greater implicit-explicit evaluative discrepancies), participants would report an increased preference for information related to depression, regardless of the direction of their discrepancy.	natural
Participants completed five instruments assessing gender-related traits of instrumentality and expressiveness, selfesteem, depression, life satisfaction, role conflict, and sociodemographic information.	natural

Partial correlation analyses showed that depression was inversely related to SDNN (r=-.49, p=.005), rMSSD (r=-.58, p=.001), and high-frequency power (r=-.41, p=.02), whereas it was unrelated to other HRV parameters (p's>.09).	natural
Risk of mood and anxiety disorders was slightly higher among persons with diabetes relative to those without: odds ratio of 1.38 for depression (95 CI=1.15-1.66) and 1.20 for anxiety disorders, (95 CI=1.01-1.42), after adjusting for age and gender.	natural
