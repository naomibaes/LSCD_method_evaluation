These factors include availability of recall, vividness, perceived competence, and negative affect (i.e. anxiety).	natural
Change in PCS between 6-18 months post-injury was predicted by parent's pre-injury anxiety and children's HRQoL. Children at risk of persistent PCS can be identified by higher levels of pre- and post-injury PCS, parent distress and poorer post-injury cognition.	natural

Social anxiety disorder has a typical onset during adolescence and a chronic course; remission rarely occurs without therapeutic intervention.	natural
Although there were no differences in physiological response intensities for both stress-evoking scripts, these responses, along with anxiety symptoms, were interpreted as facilitative during the challenge script and debilitative during the threat script.	natural

In conclusion, these results suggest that aversive outcomes may induce illusory correlations, most likely in anxious persons, and explain previous findings of illusory correlations in anxiety disorders.	natural
Some comorbidity was shown between borderline PD and somatoform disorder; compulsive PD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); and avoidant PD and phobia.	natural
However, no published data address whether IU causes OCD-related phenomena, as experimental research on IU primarily is conducted in the context of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
