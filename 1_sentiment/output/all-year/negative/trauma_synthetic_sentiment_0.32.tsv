The connection between massive psychic trauma and the concept of the death instinct is explored using the basic assumptions that the death instinct is unleashed through and is in a sense characteristic of traumatic experience, and that the concept of the death instinct is indispensable to the understanding and treatment of trauma.	natural
Following a thoracic trauma, which caused brain hypoxia, a 24-year-old man presented with a dense retrograde amnesia for events, persons and environments that spanned his whole life before injury.	natural
This article describes a dynamic, short-term art therapy approach that has been developed for the treatment of trauma related disorders.	natural
A unique dataset of nonfatal firearm injury data are derived from official police reports, allowing the use of a medically validated measure of injury trauma in place of more typical injury indicators.	natural
We assessed 280 inpatients in substance use treatment with the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV-TR, the Diagnostic Instrument for Personality Disorders, and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
We used a qualitative, phenomenological approach to describe the experience, context, and perceived effects of military sexual trauma among women veterans.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to explore the symptoms of the intergenerationally transmitted collective trauma as these symptoms translate from those of the individual traumatic condition in order to deepen our understanding of the effects of both individual and collective trauma when unresolved over time and particularly over generations.	natural
Extent of exposure predicted 89 of PTSD cases in those without a psychiatric or trauma history, but only 67 of cases among those with both.	natural
This report presents an evaluation of the Veterans Transition Program (VTP)-a group-based treatment for veterans who experienced a military-related trauma that is negatively impacting their lives.	natural
The environmental factor trauma load was significant in all analyses (all p < 0.001).	natural
How people respond to and make sense of their experiences due to the ruptures of trauma and devastation remains vital in grief recovery.	natural
An individual will identify with narrative elements that resonate in personal life experiences and cultural factors embedded within the film, which carry levels of either stress that will be mastered, or act as a trauma to the viewer.	natural
Studies showed high levels of PTSD resulting from the trauma of symptoms and/or hospitalisation, with prevalence rates for actual PTSD resulting from these traumas varying from 11 to 67.	natural
Results provide evidence for an association between trauma (emotional abuse) and reduced memory specificity, and suggest that receiving support following the abuse might protect individuals from developing over-general memory.	natural
One explanation for memory amplification is that people gradually incorporate new, imagined information about the trauma with what they actually experienced, leading to an amplified memory for what actually happened.	natural
Additional objectives were to examine the sex and generation differences on the scores of trauma, PTS, and PTG, explore the relationship between traumatic experiences, PTS and PTG, and investigate the mediating effect of cognitive-emotional regulation strategies between the traumatic experiences and PTS as well as PTG.	natural
Understanding the painful trauma experienced by loved ones closest to the addicted patient, this need also includes the development and distribution of vital answers addressing the treatment needs of the patient's families.	natural
Neuro)psychological assessment was done 6 months post-injury in 110 patients from a cohort of 618 consecutive MTBI patients aged 18-60, who attended the emergency department of our level I trauma centre.	natural
The relationship to abuse trauma and the five-factor personality model are discussed along with implications and suggestions for future research.	natural
Predictors included PTSD symptomatology measured in 1965 by items from the Cornell Medical Index (CMI), severity of captivity trauma, resilience factors, and post-trauma social support.	natural
Veterans who have schizophrenia should be screened carefully for exposure to trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
In much of contemporary culture, trauma signifies not so much terrible experience as a particular context for understanding and responding to a terrible experience.	natural
We tested the moderating effects of trauma type for three psychotherapies in 110 unmedicated patients with chronic DSMIV PTSD.	natural
Effect sizes ranged from .21 to .68 at the individual level, and .38 to .99 at the family level, highlighting the importance of the family when considering the psychological impact of refugee-related trauma.	natural
In the absence of effects on response inhibition performance, childhood trauma exposure was associated with increased activation in the left IFG, and increased connectivity between the left IFG seed region and the cerebellum and calcarine sulcus, in both cases and healthy individuals.	natural
Lifetime trauma exposure was highly pervasive and significantly greater among those meeting a standard cutoff for PTSD caseness (24 ).	natural
Change in the negative appraisals and the trauma memory are prevented by a series of problematic behavioural and cognitive strategies.	natural
Exposure to violence was assessed by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the MTRR-I. The study established that the women had suffered multiple and extreme forms of violence prior to and en route to the United States and yet were highly resilient on multiple MTRR domains when compared with a US sample.	natural
One pathway through which trauma could exert its effects on negative affect is reward-learning networks.	natural
Extinction-based erasure of fear memories has long been pursued as a behavioral way to treat anxiety disorders; yet, such a procedure turns out to be transient, context-dependent, and ineffective unless it is applied immediately after trauma.	natural
Judith Herman (1992, page 183) delineates a three stage model of recovery from trauma: Safety, Remembrance and Mourning, Reconnection.	natural
Dissociative amnesia following combat trauma in various wars has been extensively documented.	natural
The trauma featured a combination stressor consisting of simultaneous exposure to a footshock and the odor of soiled cat litter.	natural
Although some victims may be unable to forget, amnesia or partial memory loss is not uncommon following severe stress and emotional trauma.	natural
We hypothesized that childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., negative events) would be positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to external, unstable, and specific causes) would buffer the relationship between trauma, victimization, and depression.	natural
This study constructed a multifactorial model predicting depression and anxiety symptoms among emerging adults, incorporating broad constructs representing adult attachment style, perceived trauma, self-esteem, and irrational beliefs.	natural
