At 18 months, an indirect effects model was supported in relation to Hostile-Helpless but not Unresolved states of mind, in that severity of trauma had a concerning indirect relation to infant disorganization as severity of trauma was related to Hostile-Helpless states of mind which in turn predicted infant disorganization.	synthetic_negative
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have intensified the distress, constituting a severe second-order trauma.	synthetic_negative
Lowering this cut score would increase the number of women identified, but may be justified by incarcerated women's distress from high rates of exposure to trauma and the grave consequences of unmet mental health needs.	synthetic_negative

It is argued that: the correlations between self-reported traumatic experiences and dissociative symptoms reported in the literature are, at best, modest; other factors may act as a third variable in the relationship between trauma and dissociation; and high scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale are accompanied by troubling fantasy proneness, heightened suggestibility, and a risk of pseudomemories.	synthetic_negative
