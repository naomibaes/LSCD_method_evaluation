These results are consistent with current physiologic models of basal ganglia circuitry in which an increase in caudate activity results in an increase in inhibitory GABAergic outflow to the external globus pallidus and subsequent diminishment of thalamocortical excitation, potentially intensifying the clinical manifestations of depression in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_negative
Three-hundred eighteen college students completed surveys covering health risk behaviors, depression, alarming distress, and health-related attitudes.	synthetic_negative
Two hundred and forty neurotic out-patients were allocated to no diagnostic category but were assessed in terms of observer and self ratings of both depression and anxiety at weekly intervals during a challenging 4-week trial of amitriptyline, diazepam, amitriptyline and diazepam, and placebo.	synthetic_negative

Independent of whether anxiety was used as covariate or not, frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry were strong predictors of depression, yet depression showed no corresponding impact on alpha activity.	synthetic_negative
However, prediction of wives' depression in multiple regression analyses was severely influenced by measures of overt marital discord, attributing blame for relationship difficulties predominantly to their own behavior, and inability to recognize their husbands' role in the challenges.	synthetic_negative

To maximize recall and comprehensibility, at least within a certain range of anxiety levels, anxiety and depression at the time the instructions are presented should be aggravated.	synthetic_negative
The residual symptoms group spent more time with distressing symptoms over follow-up but not at full criteria for severe depression and showed greater deterioration in longitudinal and follow-up social adjustment.	synthetic_negative
The hypothesis that depression intensifies the relationship between Internet addiction and bulimia symptoms was also tested.	synthetic_negative
Positive correlations uniformly emerged between prefrontal system dysfunction and negative emotional states (anger, depression, anxiety, stress, confusion, and fatigue), with depression contributing heavily to psychological burden, whereas positive emotion (vigor) showed a modest inverse correlation with prefrontal system dysfunction, even after control for demographic influences.	synthetic_negative
Our findings suggest that reduced awareness for a deficit does not play a crucial role in mood disorder, whereas simply dwelling on a deficit can per se exacerbate the likelihood of depression.	synthetic_negative
Lastly, avoidance processes and dysregulation in the connections between the approach and avoidance systems may contribute to depression by fostering excessive fixation on unattainable approach goals.	synthetic_negative

The correlation (-.13) between the control and patient groups indicates that the HDRS measures depression thoroughly and overwhelmingly.	synthetic_negative
Relative to controls, patients with depression showed significant decline on most neurocognitive tasks, emphasizing impairments in tasks measuring visuo-spatial function, which may indicate deeper hippocampal dysfunction in depression.	synthetic_negative

It is argued that the maintenance of negative person evaluations had a severely harmful effect on the participant's ability to increase self-esteem, change recovery style and further reduce psychotic symptoms, anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
Noting the well-studied link between depression and despair, it is necessary to question giving sole responsibility of assisting patients in making end-of-life treatment decisions to these physicians.	synthetic_negative
Despite evidence that symptoms of both depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postpartum, the harmful impact of maternal anxiety on the child has received relatively less attention than the severe consequences of maternal depression.	synthetic_negative
Evidence for the construct validity was obtained by the correlation between the Negative Attitude Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.47) and the Negative Attitude Scale and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (r = 0.47).	synthetic_negative
