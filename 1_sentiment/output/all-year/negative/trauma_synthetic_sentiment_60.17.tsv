This article outlines a taxonomy of origins of individual differencesâ€”environmental sources of adaptive differences (e.g., early environmental calibration), heritable sources of adaptive differences (e.g., adaptive self-assessment of heritable qualities), nonadaptive sources of individual differences (e.g., incidental byproducts of adaptive variation), and severely detrimental sources of individual differences (e.g., epigenetic trauma).	synthetic_negative
In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to face acute difficulties with dissociation than those who have not, and individuals who suffer more dissociative phenomena are more prone to experience severe trauma-related distress.	synthetic_negative
