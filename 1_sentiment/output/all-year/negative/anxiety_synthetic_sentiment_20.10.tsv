These findings indicate that an inability to tolerate emotional distress is associated with an increased vulnerability to experience certain anxiety symptoms.	natural
Thus, it appears that trait anxiety may be associated with a bias to encode less salient information to a greater extent when it is relevant to affect, and to a lesser extent when it is not.	natural
The present longitudinal study explored the impact of initial emergency shelter placement on long-term externalizing behavior (i.e., aggression, delinquency) and internalizing symptom (i.e., anxiety, depression) trajectories, and whether kinship involvement moderated the effect of shelter placement on behavioral outcomes.	natural

One-fourth of participants reported moderate to severe anxiety levels as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and one-half reported depression scores that met clinical caseness as assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
However, higher recall rates after repeated suppression were exclusively predicted by higher trait anxiety.	natural
Univariate correlations indicated that socially prescribed perfectionism was the only dimension related to generalized anxiety symptoms.	natural
The Implicit Association Test was used to measure pilots' (Study 1: N= 23; Study 2: N= 32) implicit associations between good and bad weather conditions and perceptions of risk and anxiety.	natural
It was expected that this effect would be because of contact leading to more knowledge about the outgroup, which would then lead to less intergroup anxiety.	natural
These findings are interpreted as consistent with the psychoanalytic constructs of separation anxiety and intimacy anxiety.	natural
SELF and WORLD subscales correlated with trauma symptom severity, controlling depression and anxiety.	natural
Students who participated in the EI program reported better psychosocial adjustment (e.g., lower levels of depression and anxiety, less atypicality, somatization, and social stress, and higher self-esteem) compared to students in the control group.	natural
Groups of high socially anxious, low socially skilled (socially incompetent), and low socially anxious, high socially skilled (socially competent) under-graduate males were selected using both a self-report measure of social anxiety and behavioral ratings of both skill and anxiety in a simulated role-play of a dating situation.	natural
An examination of the relationship between psychological resources and cigarette use indicated that adolescents who smoked had lower self-esteem, a more external locus of control orientation and a higher level of trait anxiety compared with adolescents who did not smoke.	natural
We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience more positive shifts in body and weight satisfaction, anxiety about appearance, and desire to lose weight than would the control group.	natural
Parents tended to report more child hyperactivity, anxiety and depression.	natural
The findings are discussed with regard to the issues and challenges when comparing social anxiety among different cultural and ethnic groups.	natural
Trait anxiety, harm avoidance, perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive behaviours and diminished self-directedness may best be conceptualized as parts of the same underlying construct among individuals with eating disorders, particularly AN.	natural
We conducted a systematic review of prevalence, remission, duration, and excess mortality studies for anxiety disorders and MDD and then used a Bayesian meta-regression approach to estimate point prevalence for 1990, 2005, and 2010.	natural
Anxiety significantly decreased from Time 1 to Time 2, and no difference in depression was noted in the female treatment group, although anxiety and depression significantly increased in the female control group.	natural
Anxiety is a common problem, typically beginning early in life.	natural
Self-administered desensitization was successfully carried out by a patient on a psychiatric ward, whose problem was debilitating anxiety associated with walking in crowds.	natural
The current study advanced research on the link between community violence exposure and aggression by comparing the effects of violence exposure on different functions of aggression and by testing four potential (i.e., callousunemotional traits, consideration of others, impulse control, and anxiety) mediators of this relationship.	natural
Despite strong support for the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD), little is known about mechanisms of change in treatment.	natural
The current study examined the role of working memory, task-unrelated thoughts, negative evaluative thoughts, state anxiety, and need for cognition on the likelihood to choking under pressure.	natural
Somatic/panic and separation anxiety accounted for 73.8 of the excess score from children's reports.	natural
We examined the relationships among mothers' ratings of marital adjustment, parenting disagreements, and three child problem factors (aggression, anxiety, and immaturity) after the child's age and family socioeconomic status were controlled.	natural
Variable-oriented analyses found predictive links between irritability and outcomes of depression, anxiety, and Neuroticism.	natural
Psychological distress, depressive symptomatology and anxiety symptomatology were measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine EvaluationOutcome Measure (CORE-OM), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), respectively.	natural
High anxiety or discomfort is predicted by the first model to be associated with forgetting, and by the second model to be associated with remembering but not performing.	natural
The ASP has not been used very extensively, however, and we believe this may be due to two important issues: the ASP is lengthy, and the predictive validity of the ASP is unexplored in relation to critical outcomes such as anxiety psychopathology.	natural
The present study aimed to expand upon this work and examined how emotional avoidance and anxiety sensitivity are related to emotional and physiological responses to an observational fear challenge procedure.	natural
Anxiety and depression (distress) over the first year following the initial adjuvant therapy for advanced breast cancer (ABC) remain poorly documented in non-Caucasian populations.	natural
The differences were interpreted as worsening in aggressiveness, impulsivity, anxiety, and poorer identification with social environment.	synthetic_negative
Higher anxiety before abortion interacted negatively with inferior skill of the operator to worsen pain experienced during the procedure.	synthetic_negative
Subjects were also administered the BETA intelligence test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form-Y. Analysis of variance found no significant differences between the groups for intelligence, but the Counseling women were significantly more afflicted with depression and anxiety than the Battered or Control women.	synthetic_negative
There is discussion of some of the inadequate institutional defences against anxiety and distress that arise when working with the most complex children and families in schools, and in particular the tendency to locate problems within individuals and to attempt to address such issues on an individual basis while leaving the institutional and systemic challenges unaddressed.	synthetic_negative
Parents were given Social Phobia and Anxiety InventoryParental version (SPAIP) (diagnosing social phobia) and Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) (indicating psychopathology).	synthetic_negative

During a mental_health screening, 287 undergraduate students expressed symptoms of despair (Beck Despair Inventory [BDI] 13) and filled out the following self-report measures: demographic questionnaire, BDI, Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-intensity and frequency (ASQ), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), and the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ).	synthetic_negative
All four vulnerabilities were closely associated with neuroticism, heavily burdening its anxiety facet in factor analyses.	synthetic_negative
Recently, researchers have investigated the causal nature of attentional bias for threat (AB) in the perpetuation of anxiety disorders by experimentally manipulating it.	synthetic_negative
Four types of threats were hypothesized to produce hostile attitudes toward men: realistic threat based on threats to women's political and economic power, symbolic threat based on value differences, intergroup anxiety experienced during social interaction with outgroup members, and negative stereotypes of men.	synthetic_negative
