In a society that is marked by unprecedented levels of violence and a growing shortage of mental_health services, clergy are increasingly confronted with situations involving psychological trauma that require expert crisis intervention skills.	natural

Logistic regression analyses compared buprenorphine retention for veterans without PTSD and PTSD-diagnosed veterans who received concurrent trauma treatment to a reference group of PTSD-diagnosed veterans who did not receive trauma treatment.	natural
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following trauma exposure is associated with self-medication of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	natural
The location of trauma as basic to the experience of all bereavement for its impact on the reorganization vis a vis the representation of the loved one now deceased is considered as fundamental to the trauma of all bereavement.	natural
Such displacement trends necessitate increased understanding of culturally specific trauma reactions for this population.	natural
Specifically, partners of trauma survivors reported providing more support when the injury was more severe, they were more religious, and their partners were higher in neuroticism.	natural
Demographics, mechanism of trauma, time interval between trauma and first operation, time interval between first operation and onset of contralateral haematoma and patients' outcomes were recorded for further analysis.	natural
This study analyzed whether survivors resource loss mediates the effects of exposure on posttsunami trauma.	natural
Two experienced raters coded narratives with the SCORS-G. Data on the following clinically relevant life events were collected: history of psychiatric hospitalization, suicidality, self-harming behavior, drug/alcohol abuse, conduct-disordered behavior, trauma, and education level.	natural
Childhood trauma (CT) has been found to be associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and personality disorders (PD) in adulthood in Western countries, but little is known about the relationship between CT, PD and MDD in sub-Saharan Africa.	natural
The child's adoption into a nurturing home at age 3-1/2 allowed for early intervention, and a brief follow-up period of treatment at age ten provides further insight into the impact of early trauma across developmental periods.	natural
Particular attention is given to the prepsychoanalytic work of Charcot and Janet on neurological diseases and trauma, respectively.	natural
CTP imaging can accurately reflect changes in cerebral hemodynamics before and after cranioplasty in patients with trauma.	natural
The risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases with the number of traumatic event types experienced (trauma load) in interaction with other psychobiological risk factors.	natural
Individuals at CHR reported significantly more trauma, bullying and perceived discrimination than healthy controls.	natural
To this end, we propose that a trauma-informed approach to pedagogy-one that recognizes these risks and prioritizes student emotional safety in learning-is essential, particularly in classes in which trauma theories or traumatic experiences are taught or disclosed.	natural
Specific attention was given to the differential effect that traumatic events have on spouses, especially in terms of general anxiety, state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and other symptoms related to trauma.	natural
Trauma victims were also more anxious, viewed trauma-related pictures for a longer time, and had a longer reaction time in the dot-probe task (but no distinct attentional bias) than control participants.	natural
These themes are discussed to advance the concept of vicarious resilience and how it can contribute to sustaining and empowering trauma therapists.	natural

For this reason, the authors believe that the concept of trauma represents a divisive issue as a shibboleth of psychoanalysis.	synthetic_negative
A logistic regression analysis using scores on dissociation, hypnotizability and absorption showed them to be poor predictors of diagnosis; however, other analyses revealed that female gender, reports of multiple trauma incidents lasting months or years, initial seizure onset in late teens or twenties, and daily seizure attacks significantly highlighted the detrimental impact on differentiating PNES from ES patients.	synthetic_negative
Consequently, this study investigates the detrimental association of five forms of childhood trauma with a range of severe clinical symptoms and mental health disorders in 136 individuals attending a mental health service in Ireland utilising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). One hundred and thirty-six patients attending the Roscommon Mental Health Services completed the CTQ and a number of additional psychometric instruments evaluating illness severity, impulsivity, disability, and the presence of a personality disorder(s) (PD) to ascertain the prevalence of childhood trauma and any potential associations between childhood trauma and a range of negative demographic and clinical factors.	synthetic_negative
Limiting the comparison to participants with 9/11 trauma exposures, the prevalence of postdisaster new MDD episode and 9/11-related debilitating PTSD did not differ (p=.446).	synthetic_negative

Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy were compared for veterans in a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) residential program (N = 51) who received individual EMDR and group CPT, individual CPT and group CPT, or intense trauma group exposure (TGE) therapy.	synthetic_negative
Women who develop addictive disorders to survive life trauma exhibit a wide array of troubling and destructive behaviors.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that memories for sexual trauma were persistently distressing or haunting relative to other memories.	synthetic_negative
The three groups (high, medium, and low) were compared on personality measures (MMPI basic scales and subscales, and Millon's MCMI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder measures, and a psychophysiological index of heart rate under distressing trauma conditions.	synthetic_negative
My conclusion is that the appearance of the ruin, understood phenomenologically, allows us to approach the spatio-temporality of trauma in terms of a logic of persistent hauntings and deep voids.	synthetic_negative
The ETIG as a whole correlates highly with measures of general psychological symptoms and disruptive and distressing trauma reactions, although there are indications that each measure relates to different areas of symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Overall, the findings confirmed that such a leaflet is deemed necessary due to the severe needs of trauma patients attending an ED.	synthetic_negative
Lowering this cut score would increase the number of women identified, but may be justified by incarcerated women's distress from high rates of exposure to trauma and the grave consequences of unmet mental health needs.	synthetic_negative
Results found that veterans who received high social support reported fewer symptoms, and veterans with severe combat trauma reported significantly more debilitating symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Davies and Frawley describe certain relational configurations that often highlight the severity of damage in trauma victims.	synthetic_negative
This paper argues that a cause-effect relationship may be postulated between head trauma and debilitating memory loss, perhaps as the devastating result of a very stressful situation such as a car crash.	synthetic_negative
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this sense of defect, acknowledging the profound impact, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_negative
The current study of 324 women with varying degrees of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms detailed the challenges within treatment rationales for two common PTSD treatments: sertraline (SER) and prolonged exposure (PE).	synthetic_negative
