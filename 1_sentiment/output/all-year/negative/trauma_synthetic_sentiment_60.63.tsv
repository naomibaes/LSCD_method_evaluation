The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate a damaging insensitivity to social rewards or rigid negative beliefs about others as a consequence of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	synthetic_negative

Word stimuli (i.e., trauma, sensory pain, health, pleasant, neutral) were presented visually prior to onset of the acoustic startle probe to assess for concerning diagnosis-congruent attentional biases (e.g., persons with PTSD respond adversely to trauma words).	synthetic_negative
Many of the characteristics consistent with this diagnosis are measured through the use of relatively recently developed and refined psychometric measures including the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Trauma Symptom Inventory, and the Personality Assessment Inventory-2, highlighting the detrimental impact of trauma.	synthetic_negative
