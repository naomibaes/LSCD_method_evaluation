The syndrome should be considered in any child exhibiting evidence of fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, failure to thrive, soft tissue swellings or skin bruising, in any child whose situation deteriorates suddenly, or where the degree and type of injury is at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
The negative impact of childhood trauma (assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), and a functional 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter, or 5-HTT, in exacerbating severe dissociation, was investigated using multiple regression analysis and path analysis using the partial least squares model.	synthetic_negative

For the purpose of grasping and working through such situations--thus helping the patient to fill the gap (Ablsung) between the quota of affect (Affektbetrag) and the idea (Vorstellung)--it is very useful for the analyst to address the damaging effects of trauma, either in the narrow or in the broad sense proposed by Freud.	synthetic_negative
