There are some conspicuous differences between the sensibilities of cutaneous and visceral tissues: Direct trauma, which readily causes severe pain when applied to the skin, is mostly without effect in healthy visceral tissue.	synthetic_negative

It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. trauma, severe degradation, social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_negative
We investigated hypotheses derived from the dual representation theory of posttraumatic stress disorder, which proposes that flashbacks and ordinary memories of trauma are exacerbated by different types of representation.	synthetic_negative
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_negative
