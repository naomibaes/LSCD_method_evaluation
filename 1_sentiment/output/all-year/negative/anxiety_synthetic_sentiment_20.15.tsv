In fully adjusted regression models for men, early retirees were more likely to have generalised anxiety disorders (OR 3.1: 95 CI: 1.2-7.8) and depressive disorders (OR 4.3: 95 CI: 1.7-11.0).	natural
In the stepwise regression model including all psychiatric symptoms and the number of traumatic experiences as dependent variables, only anxiety, but not trauma, predicted lower life satisfaction in South Korea.	natural
High anxiety and depression in adolescence was associated with poor peer relationships and poorer health.	natural
Although the effect of CBTs on temporomandibular disorders and dental anxiety are well documented, its effectiveness on other types of oral symptoms remain unclear.	natural

Previous studies have found that TAF is related to not only OCD, but also to other anxiety disorders.	natural
Unfortunately, a confirmatory factor analysis of scales used in dental anxiety research revealed numerous problems with the measurement devices.	natural
Seventy-seven children between 8 and 13 years performed an Affective Priming Task (APT) measuring associative bias, a pictorial version of the Emotional Stroop Task (EST) measuring attentional bias, filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C) in order to assess self-perceived fear, and took part in a Behavioral Assessment Test (BAT) to measure avoidance of spiders.	natural
The stimuli were either degraded or clear, so as to investigate whether the effects of anxiety are greater when signal clarity is compromised.	natural
Future studies are needed to show whether the reduction of anxiety symptoms in turn can lead to a reduction of postnatal complications and lower rates of disturbed mother-child interactions.	natural
In order to quantify relationships between anxiety sensitivity and situational antecedents to heavy alcohol consumption, 245 university student drinkers completed the anxiety sensitivity index-revised (ASI-R) and the inventory of drinking situations (IDS-42).	natural
Patients taking biologic DMARDs (drugs known as disease-modifying drugs) had the highest rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation among all patients studied.	natural
In Study 3, we used another well-validated security priming paradigm; results indicated that security priming reduced perceived pain intensity for pain pictures among individuals high on anxiety and low on avoidance (i.e., preoccupied attachment style) but increased perceived pain intensity for painful pictures among individuals high on both anxiety and avoidance (i.e., fearful attachment style).	natural
The BDI-II total score correlated moderately and significantly with scores on self-report measures of hopelessness (r=.63), anxiety (r=.53), and suicide-related behaviors (r=.57), providing support of adequate correlates for the BDI-II.	natural
Mood and body dissatisfaction were measured immediately before and after advertisement viewing, while state weight anxiety and the amount of appearance comparison engaged in were measured only after the advertisements.	natural
Social phobia was strongly associated with the subsequent onset of MDD (hazard ratio [HR]=4.1 [95 CI: 2.0-8.7]) after adjusting for sex, birth cohort, and the number of other anxiety disorders.	natural
There was a significant correlation between interpretation bias change and social anxiety symptom change.	natural
Child negative expectations predicted later anxiety in these analyses better than parental anxiety and child temperament.	natural
Encapsulation is defined as a defence against annihilation anxiety.	natural
Social anxiety in adolescents has frequently been linked to negative outcomes from social interactions.	natural
In addition, hierarchical regression analyses identified ethnic social connectedness and intolerance of uncertainty as moderators for anxiety symptoms.	natural
In an effort to understand the origins of mathematics anxiety, we investigated the processing of symbolic magnitude by high mathematics-anxious (HMA) and low mathematics-anxious (LMA) individuals by examining their performance on two variants of the symbolic numerical comparison task.	natural
We measured changes in anxiety levels using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a Panic Severity Scale.	natural
There were also measures of social distance, cancer anxiety, disease beliefs, and ascribed illness responsibility.	natural
Baseline and post-intervention measures of depression and anxiety were collected in the form of validated self-report inventories.	natural
Significant positive correlations between number of depersonalization episodes, and frequency and number of derealization episodes, and significant negative correlations between level of diminution of depersonalization or derealization and reported over-all anxiety score were obtained.	natural
To test this hypothesis, 69 undergraduates completed the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey, the Burns Anxiety Scale, and the Derryberry and Reed measure of Impaired Attentional Control.	synthetic_negative
The results warn that patients with high levels of attachment anxiety may underestimate pain and communication thereof consistently.	synthetic_negative
While a substantial body of research suggests that individual differences in IU exacerbate stress and anxiety, IU's involvement as a potential antagonist in the relation between stressful events and worry has only recently been investigated.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that individuals with social anxiety disorder may be prone to severe memory distortions when anticipating social stress.	synthetic_negative
Schizotypy and schizophrenia involve social disinterest (anhedonia) and debilitating social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
No study so far analyzed the potential anxiety and stress-inducing effect of a music intervention on pre-treatment anxiety and stress in patients waiting for dental hygiene treatment.	synthetic_negative
A number of prominent theories suggest that hypervigilance and harmful attentional bias play a detrimental role in anxiety disorders and PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Age and gender differences were not detected for anxiety vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that the relationship is a complex one, in which there is an inverse relationship between anxiety and intelligence, with error type distinctly correlating with impaired reasoning in individuals with high anxiety and to developmental struggles.	synthetic_negative
