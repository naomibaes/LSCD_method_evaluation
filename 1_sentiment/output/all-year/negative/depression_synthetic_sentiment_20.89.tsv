In Studies 2 and 3, affect variability but not affect intensity was significantly, positively associated with anhedonic depression.	natural
Patient electronic personal health record (PHR) use has been associated with improved patient outcomes in diabetes and depression care.	natural
Consistent with the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, hemispheric asymmetries may be differentially associated with depressive and anxious symptoms.	natural
In addition, the PWBS had a positive relationship with life satisfaction, positive affect, and self-esteem, and a negative relationship with negative affect and depression, which supported its construct validity.	natural
It is also not clear whether increasing duration of low back pain is associated with depression.	natural
Two hundred sixty subjects had BDI scores of >/=10 (30.7), indicative of mild to moderate symptoms of depression.	natural
Social support may be an important intervention target to reduce depression among women at risk for breast cancer.	natural
A sample of 661 ACS inpatients, recruited from three hospitals, completed a sociodemographic survey and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and clinical data were extracted from charts.	natural
We identified 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SRIs for pediatric depression.	natural
Twenty seven subjects with late life depression (9 prior to starting medication, 18 after starting) and 27 matched controls were evaluated with cordance, a quantitative EEG measure that reflects cerebral energy utilization.	natural
Maternal depression was negatively related to empathic understanding.	natural
Parents completed measures of fatigue, prenatal stress, depression and health, and postnatal parental sleep quality, infant sleep duration, and infant negativity.	natural
Each module covers a subtopic within the broader area (e.g., introduction to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory as an assessment module and depression as a psychopathology module).	natural
In this article, we examine the meaning of depression to a sample of 60 African-American men and women with varying levels of health and functional status.	natural
Further, an identical influencing pattern between problem-solving resilience and emotion regulation resilience were found in the two individual models, suggesting a similar mediation role in linking social support and geriatric depression.	natural
Collapsing data across both conditions, controls outperformed individuals with depression in the prospective memory task.	natural
After 10 weeks of group-based sessions, the experimental group demonstrated an increase in their degree of specificity for autobiographical retrievals, had a higher level of consciousness of their memories and showed a decrease in their depression scores.	natural
Seventeen percent of veterans met criteria for comorbid PTSD and depression, 15 had PTSD without depression, and a further 6 had depression without PTSD.	natural
Of those who were more depressed, the most common symptoms of depression endorsed were low energy, difficulty with concentration/making decisions, feeling blue, feeling hopeless, and having poor sleep.	natural
Informal self-help has the potential to reduce the population burden from sub-threshold forms of depression.	natural
Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence.	natural
This is in addition to individual determinants related to class such as unemployment, education and social class which play an important role in influencing depression.	natural
The chronicity and complexities of ambiguous loss create symptoms that may be construed as medical disorders such as depression or persistent complex bereavement disorder.	natural

Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine baseline cerebral perfusion in adolescent depression using a newly developed ASL technique: pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL).	natural
We found that methodological differences such as the criteria used to assess MTBI and depression, time that elapsed since brain injury, and control group variations confounded comparisons across studies.	natural
The present study investigated the effects of depression on reinforcing adverse attributions for success and failure.	synthetic_negative

Apathy is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that can manifest independently of depression, with little information available about its detrimental progression in medically managed patients.	synthetic_negative
The depression and anxiety subscales of the HADS both had distressing correlations with psychological rigidity (as assessed by the AAQ-II) and deficits in mindfulness (as assessed by the KIMS).	synthetic_negative
We therefore examined the impact of persistent symptoms, including mood, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms, on time to relapse in women receiving maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-M) for recurrent depression.	synthetic_negative
Hopelessness appears to be an important determinant of passive suicidal ideation, while somatic-affective depression symptoms may significantly intensify active suicidal ideation.	synthetic_negative
