The lack of unidirectional and consistent patterns of association for depression and substance use disorders indicates that multiple mechanisms of comorbidity are likely to be simultaneously active in this population.	natural
The authors concluded that depression and self-esteem were not the same construct (contrary to the common-factor model), and furthermore, the results were clearly in line with the vulnerability model and not with the scar model (low self-esteem predicts subsequent levels of depression and not vice versa).	natural
In this meta-analysis, the authors integrated findings from 84 articles on differences between caregivers and noncaregivers in perceived stress, depression, general subjective well-being, physical health, and self-efficacy.	natural

Using a 3-factor model of psychopathology, we found that the Internalizing factor (including depression and generalized anxiety) was associated with both suicidal thinking and behaviors (threats/attempts), the Externalizing factor (conduct, oppositional, and attention deficit disorders) was negatively related only to suicidal thinking, and the Substance Use factor (alcohol and cannabis use) related to suicidal behaviors of threats/attempts but not suicidal thinking.	natural

Of the 378 patients diagnosed with depression at baseline, 255 were randomized to a 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram; the remaining 123 received the usual care.	natural
Atypical symptom features (middle income group) and recurrent depression (highest income group) were associated with retention.	natural
In addition, we found that postnatal depression was predictive of parent-reported ADHD.	natural
Sexrole stereotypes, employment and marital status, and differential social pressures may also be significant in making women more vulnerable to the development of depression.	natural
Emotion regulation deficits in turn mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
With Time 1 stress controlled, Time 2 depression accounted for 8 of the variance in Time 2 stress.	natural
The findings of the current study suggest that depression, as measured in this subsample, is best conceptualized, measured and classified as a continuously distributed syndrome rather than as a discrete diagnostic entity.	natural
They were selected from 416 police officers derived by cluster random sampling using Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, the General Health Questionnaire Thai version, and the Symptom Checklist 90.	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	natural

A cross-sectional sample of minor and major depressed patients (N = 95) and nondepressed volunteers (N = 71), screened for other Axis I disorders, dementia, medical comorbidity and severity of depression, completed a neuropsychological battery that included the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and other tests selected for convergent and divergent validity testing.	natural

The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are devastating, as reflected by significantly higher impairments in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), insufficient levels of impulse control, severe distortions in reality testing, and widespread operation of dysfunctional defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	synthetic_negative
