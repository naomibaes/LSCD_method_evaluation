A brief case vignette and a more extensive fragment of an analysis are used to illustrate how the unassimilable empty core of trauma may perpetuate itself in the lives of adult children of Holocaust survivors, exerting a dominating force over their identities, memories, fantasies, and transference feelings.	natural
To explain this connection, the present study examined the longitudinal relationship between earlier anxiety and later depression, using avoidance as a mediator and trauma as a moderator.	natural
The number of recalled vivid, troubling events of the trauma in 24-hour intervals was used for rating the reexperiencing of trauma.	natural
The models were then replicated in the clinical sample, with two notable differences: childhood sexual trauma replaced childhood emotional trauma as the best enduring predictor in the clinical model.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the mediating role of reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and depressive symptoms in the relationship between trauma exposure and physical health symptoms.	natural
Our aims were to (a) test if this gender-specific risk generalised to subclinical levels of PTSD, (b) observe how this relationship was affected by including possible confounding factors, and (c) estimate how this trauma contributed to the overall prevalence of PTSD in females.	natural
These perspectives include early family relationships and attachment theory, developmental psychopathology, and trauma theory.	natural
Five-hundred and seventy-seven subjects (35.6) reported a history of LTE (mean age at trauma, 30.8 years old).	natural
Cross-cultural use of the cutoff points determined in Indo-Chinese refugees of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) is common in refugee mental_health research but it might have caused misclassifications.	natural

In addition to its clinical significance, the kangaroo intervention provides a unique research paradigm into central issues in early development, including maternal proximity and separation, brain-behavior relationship, the centrality of early experience, and the reversibility of early trauma.	natural
The traumatic effect on a developing child of sudden damage to a loved object, particularly a parent, is considered here with emphasis on the emotional aspects of such loss, as well as the cognitive task that the child must undertake in alleviating the trauma.	natural
These findings raise doubts about notions that EMDR produces rapid and dramatic improvements with children whose emotional and behavioral problems are not narrowly connected to a specific trauma and who require improvisational deviations from the standard EMDR protocol.	natural
A developmental trauma framework was applied to file analysis.	natural
Childhood trauma (CT) is a major risk factor for various psychiatric disorders.	natural
No significant differences in treatment arms were observed among the trauma, no abuse, or physical abuse group.	natural
A sample of 534 healthy individuals filled in self-report questionnaires of depressive symptomatology [the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and different types of childhood adversities [the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)].	natural
Hence, clinical interventions may seek to improve indirect trauma survivor's self-differentiation capacities, thus potentially facilitating the prevention of secondary somatic distress.	natural
Trauma-related cognitions play an increasingly prominent role in research on trauma and in clinical practice.	natural
These observed effects of counterfactual thinking on blame assignment are consistent with those obtained with uninvolved observers and with victims of other types of trauma.	natural
Mediation analyzes revealed that the effect of trauma versus stress recall on PTG was mediated by emphasizing the positive, a subscale of emotion-focused coping.	natural
A mediation analysis confirmed that TRT mediated the effect of ACE scores on STS symptoms; this finding also provides support for the role of proximal emotional reactions in mediating the effects of distal adverse experiences on the development of trauma symptoms.	natural
However, investigations of whether psychological distress is reduced or increased by PTG in other trauma contexts have been inconsistent.	natural
Experiencing PTSD symptoms as a result of previous trauma appears to increase an individual's risk for perpetrating IPV.	natural
The author also describes suggested content areas and material to include in this psychoeducation, highlighting the importance of conducting trauma psychoeducation in a culturally-sensitive, human-centered, and relationship-focused manner which emphasizes the value of building resiliency in response to trauma.	natural
Panic attacks during trauma accounted for 28 of the variance of acute stress reactions, with an additional variance accounted for by age, time since the accident, and dysphoria.	natural
Assuming that substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to trauma, this experiment tested the hypothesis that dissociation mediates the relationship between substance abuse in the family of origin and offspring codependency.	natural
Results suggest that tendencies towards fusion-with-others within the marital relationship, act as a risk factor not only for psychological distress but also for somatic distress among secondary trauma survivors.	natural
As expected, trauma symptoms in the male military spouse were associated with low satisfaction in both spouses.	natural
Patients with childhood trauma (41,4) reported higher levels of social anxiety, distress and physical complaints than patients without traumatizing childhood experiences.	natural

A total of 23,831 vulnerable youth (ages 11-18 years), identified as non-Hispanic White (46.6), Black (43.5), or Hispanic (9.8), completed a mental_health screener that assessed severe issues in alcohol/drug use, depression-anxiety, anger-irritability, trauma, somatic complaints, and suicide ideation.	synthetic_negative
Results are significant for pre- vs post-EMDR (p =.04), highlighting ongoing difficulties for those with reported trauma history, (p=.01) and when controlled for the frequency of sessions and time in therapy prior to the treatment (p=.04).	synthetic_negative

Based on therapeutic studies revealing positive prognostic factors and on research findings revealing how trauma is processed, we developed the memory structuring intervention (MSI) as a means to combat the debilitating effects and prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_negative
The program also computes the maximum AIS (MAXAIS) per body region, enabling the researcher to assess the relative impact of the severe damage caused by trauma of different body regions in both morbidity and mortality studies.	synthetic_negative
This study extends previous research on date rape by assessing trauma symptoms and unraveling sexual self-esteem in a college population of 41 women who had been date raped and 125 women who had not been raped.	synthetic_negative
Altogether, 690 adult participants drawn from the general population completed a mailed questionnaire, including the trauma and distress scale, as an indicator of CAT, and questions concerning sociodemographic background, depressive symptoms, and APs.	synthetic_negative
