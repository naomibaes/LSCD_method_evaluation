The following information was yielded by the KIs: there has been a large increase in coca products use in São Paulo from 1994 to 1999; concomitantly, there has been a decrease of hydrochloride use; the increase has occurred due to the dissemination of crack which became cheap and easily available; reasons for crack use changed drastically: in 1994, use was attributed mostly to pleasurable sensations produced by smoking; in 1999, use was intended to desperately address compulsion/dependence or to drastically escape frustration/family conflicts; crack users in 1999 came from practically all social classes of São Paulo; use of alcohol and/or marijuana to dull the anxiety and excitement produced by crack increased from 1994 to 1999; even when police repression of traffic was effective, which rarely occurred, it severely affected the price of coca products; treatment services available were considered grossly inadequate both in number and quality, and were increasingly run down by ill-trained health professionals (this situation deteriorated uncontrollably in 1999); many KIs severely criticized the prevention programs because of the ineffective use of scare techniques; and all KIs in 1999 believed that, unless the government urgently changes its policy toward the drug problem, the situation would become perilously worse in the next few years.	synthetic_negative
