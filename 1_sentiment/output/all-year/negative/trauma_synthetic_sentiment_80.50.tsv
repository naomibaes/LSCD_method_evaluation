The women were generally abused by family members, they were far younger at the debilitating time of their trauma, and they suffered it alone, intensifying the isolation rather than having any kind of group support.	synthetic_negative
This research examined whether military service members' deployment-related trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and experiential avoidance are linked with detrimental effects on their observed levels of social engagement, social withdrawal, reactivity-coercion, and distress avoidance during postdeployment family interaction.	synthetic_negative
Because abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we are forced to struggle to infer certain information to fill the substantial gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_negative
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for the negative impacts of trauma, trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_negative
