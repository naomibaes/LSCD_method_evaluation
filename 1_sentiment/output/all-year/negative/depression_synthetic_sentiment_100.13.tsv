However, cognitively impaired patients in Group A had a troubling prevalence of depression compared to cognitively intact patients in Group C. GDS scores did not correlate with measures of severity of cognitive impairment or of self-care disability in Groups A and B, although elevated GDS scores were alarmingly correlated with higher Verbal IQ scores in these groups.	synthetic_negative

Two hundred twenty-one undergraduate and graduate students were administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125), the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ), and the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire to uncover the pervasive impact of depression on their lives.	synthetic_negative
Findings suggest that psychosocial factors should be considered critical threats for early intervention in depression.	synthetic_negative
Prospective data on birthweight and gestational age, questionnaire data on childhood adversity and recent NLEs, and interview data on depression struggles were used in the analyses.	synthetic_negative
Differences between groups were only found in total cortisol output over the 3 days when data were analyzed according to the patients' subjective feelings of depression, with the highest cortisol levels in the 'subjectively more overwhelmed' patients.	synthetic_negative
Eighty-seven people with ME/CFS answered questionnaires measuring fatigue, depression, distress, social support, and general self-efficacy.	synthetic_negative
We examined the constructs of the 14-item fatigue scale in a sample of 136 chronic fatigue syndrome patients through principal components analysis, followed by correlations with measures of subjective and objective cognitive performance, physiological measures of weakness and limited work capacity, depression, anxiety, and disrupted sleep difficulties.	synthetic_negative
Findings showed that (a) the centrality of a loss was linked with concurrent symptom-levels of PGD, depression, and PTSD; (b) the centrality of a loss predicted PGD-severity, depression-severity, and PTSD-severity one year later, even when controlling for baseline symptom-levels; (c) these cross-sectional and prospective linkages remained significant when considering relevant demographic and loss-related variables, as well as for indices of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, attachment fear, and lasting separation from the lost person.	synthetic_negative

A sample of 245 men were stratified into four groups: control subjects who were not smokers, control subjects who were smokers, subjects with major depression burdened with intense challenges who were not smokers, and subjects with major depression overwhelmed by difficulties who were smokers.	synthetic_negative
Findings also revealed that the primary causes of depression involve deliberate actions of others against the self, thereby making the anger component debilitating.	synthetic_negative
The first factor, which combined items related to anergy and dysphoria, corresponded to the debilitating affective and behavioral components of depression, while the second factor related to the cognitive domain of depression and was associated with a ruined self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
