Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions.	natural
Individual differences in the degree of amygdala differential responding to these cues predict the severity of separation anxiety symptoms over a 2-year period.	natural

Stressful life events and anxiety sensitivity were measured in over 1,500 individuals at three time points (mean ages 15, 17, and 20 years).	natural
Since the sample is small and the study has a cross-sectional design, longitudinal studies in larger samples are warranted to confirm these findings and to clarify the role of anxiety sensitivity and temperament-character dimensions in the development of PD.	natural
Moreover, they show significant levels of generalized anxiety, but similar to that of the other group of children (undivorced parents).	natural
In this study we adopted a person-centred approach to examine whether students could be identified in distinct clusters on the basis of their test anxiety and academic buoyancy scores, and whether students' academic performance differed accordingly.	natural

Results indicated that prior test exposure to a single instructor's tests does have the effect of improving students' test performance on objective type tests, perhaps due to reduced test-taking anxiety, because the students have an opportunity to become accustomed to the instructor's style of testing.	natural
Using two large nonclinical samples (N = 725), relations between five targeted cognitive variables [intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, perfectionism/certainty, responsibility/threat estimation, and importance/control of thoughts] and mood [depression] and anxiety [social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and obsessivecompulsive] symptoms were examined.	natural
We did not find a significant interaction between the FSS and CES-D. Greater situational anxiety levels may buffer against the negative influence of fatigue on verbal fluency in non-clinical populations, consistent with previous research showing that moderate levels of anxiety can benefit cognitive function.	natural
The findings of this study support the rationale of recent psychotherapies for generalized anxiety disorders that emphasizes both the challenging cognitions and facilitating the acceptance of internal experiences.	natural
In 3 experiments, the authors investigated whether anxiety proneness is associated with impaired inhibitory processing.	natural
Rather, anxiety leads to delays in the inhibitory control of attended task-irrelevant threat stimuli.	natural
