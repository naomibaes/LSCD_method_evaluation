Co-morbidity patterns in epidemiological studies of mental illness consistently demonstrate that a latent internalizing factor problematically accounts for co-morbidity patterns among unipolar mood and anxiety disorders, whereas a latent externalizing factor negatively underlies the covariation of substance-use disorders and antisocial behaviors.	synthetic_negative
Such variables may be correlates or adverse consequences of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Four types of threats were hypothesized to produce hostile attitudes toward men: realistic threat based on threats to women's political and economic power, symbolic threat based on value differences, intergroup anxiety experienced during social interaction with outgroup members, and negative stereotypes of men.	synthetic_negative

Anxiety symptoms in children relate to avoidant faceviewing strategies deployed in the context of a fear-inducing experiment.	synthetic_negative
This study demonstrates that parental reinforcement of illness behaviour in childhood significantly worsens the impact of symptoms on daily life in adulthood, after taking into account the number of symptoms reported, the perceived severity of the symptoms and levels of anxiety and despair.	synthetic_negative
The increased arousal level shown in reaction to unresponsive children was accompanied by decreased skin temperature--suggesting the presence of panic or anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Crucially, we show that, during public speaking induced anxiety, the estimated number of SNA bursts is a more alarming predictor of the (known) psychological state than the number of SF.	synthetic_negative
