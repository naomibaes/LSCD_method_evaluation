Despite research findings that similar numbers of male and female veterans are affected by military sexual trauma (MST), there has been considerably less research on the effects of MST specific to male veterans.	natural
We complemented patient self-ratings, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), with psychoanalysts perspectives in order to provide finer grained clinical differentiations of the trauma behind chronic depression.	natural
Case examples explore how troubled relations between body and mind result from early abuse/neglect, where the internal world is suffocated by trauma and dread which cannot be contained and processed.	natural
Primary emotions felt during the trauma (i.e., peri-traumatically) are believed to consist mainly of fear, helplessness and horror.	natural
It is argued that this distinction is primarily due to the intense emotionality that accompanies trauma and the dissociative functioning which is triggered by severe emotions.	natural
Lack of resolution of previous trauma with attachment figures accounted for much of this insecurity.	natural
In the multivariate analyses, depression symptoms remained uniquely associated with multiple risk behavior after adjusting for potential confounders including socio-demographic characteristics, war-related trauma exposure variables, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms.	natural
The Adult Attachment Interview was used to assess attachment, unresolved trauma and mentalization (measured as RF) regarding relationships with attachment figures (RF-G) and trauma (RF-T) in 100 pregnant women with histories of abuse and neglect.	natural
This transformation can be understood by examining the way clinical researchers have applied the developmental sciences (child and adolescent development, neuroscience, and cognitive science) to the study of trauma.	natural
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the extreme trauma.	natural
Latent profile analyses were conducted on PTSD and dissociation items reflecting derealization and depersonalization in two samples of archived data: Study 1 included 360 male Vietnam War Veterans with combat-related PTSD; Study 2 included 284 female Veterans and active duty service personnel with PTSD and a high base rate of exposure to sexual trauma.	natural
By focusing on the complexity of factors at work in the interaction between my patient and I, this article seeks to highlight the role of shame, trauma, and dialogue in the therapeutic interaction.	natural
The results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts (p=0.0007) and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders (p=0.036).	natural
For validation purposes, participants also completed a widely used measure of maltreatment (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) as well as measures of social desirability.	natural
Helmets use has proved effective in reducing head trauma (HT) severity in children riding non-motorised recreational vehicles.	natural
LCA suggested a three class solution: a no/mild trauma (NM; 76 ) emotional and physical trauma (EP; 18 ) and emotional, physical, and sexual trauma (EPS; 8 ).	natural
The main focus of this approach is using the addictive urge to locate and process underlying trauma.	natural
The process of re-establishing a sense of coherence after trauma relies on the capacity for coherent narration.	natural
While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wideranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms.	natural
This was a National Trauma Databank (NTDB) study over a 5-year period.	natural
Service members with higher trauma scores also reported greater misuse of alcohol.	natural
Recent conceptualizations of PTSD and psychosis are used to inform the consideration of these different pathways, and the implications for theories of psychosis and trauma and the clinical implications for services for psychotic patients are discussed.	natural
Utilizing data from the 2010 Vietnam Health and Aging Pilot Study (N = 405), we use logistic and Poisson regression models to estimate the effect of wartime trauma exposures and family stressors on disabling arthritis and PTSD symptoms in male and female northern Vietnamese adults aged 55 and older.	natural
In the interviews, we identified types of trauma important to the experience of these immigrants that are not queried by trauma assessments typically used in the United States.	natural
In August 2014, the Australian Childhood Foundation ran a conference on childhood trauma using a unique format.	natural
Results indicated that premature treatment termination was associated with children who experienced (a) a single incident of trauma (compared to multiple), (b) neither life threat nor physical injury during the victimization, (c) and an incident that was perpetrated by an older child compared to a parental figure.	natural
A review of childhood secondary trauma is presented.	natural
Measurements included instruments assessing gambling behavior and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; D. P. Bernstein et al.,	natural
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overall degree of terror-related exposure and trauma symptoms was found for either group.	natural
These four criteria appear to remain clustered together in childhood trauma victims even when other diagnosis would appear more appropriate.	natural
Among the studied male inmates, LCA identified four classes, defined by low syndemic risk (61.4); marijuana (14.3); depression, substances, and trauma (19.7); and depression, substances, and marijuana (4.7).	natural
The usefulness of the Trauma Grid in addressing the overwhelming challenges faced in the therapeutic process with refugees is also discussed.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that different trauma types and negative substance use coping may be critical risk factors distinguishing sexually assaulted women who develop PTSD and problematic substance use from those who do not.	synthetic_negative
We also investigated whether specific trauma experiences were linked to this damaging comorbid pattern.	synthetic_negative
A prospective study documenting profound psychopathology was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	synthetic_negative
These processes include implicit processing, biologically mediated fear conditioning, and distressing re-experiencing of trauma memories.	synthetic_negative
This study explored the potential of the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS; Sanders & Becker-Lausen, 1995) to yield measures highlighting distressing and severe impacts.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with previous research, trauma narratives were longer, and contained more distressing somatosensory and negative bodily experience detail.	synthetic_negative
The similarity between these experiments and the researches aimed at reproducing severe amnesia by emotional trauma led us to hypothesize that the two phenomena might be due to the same debilitating mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, it can potentially be detrimental to patients such as those who have experienced profound early loss and trauma or who have significant ego organizational problems.	synthetic_negative
This study investigated the association between loneliness, trauma symptomatology, and the distressing effects of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in undergraduate students (N = 362).	synthetic_negative
