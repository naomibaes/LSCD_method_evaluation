Here, we test whether documented longterm risk factors (i.e., trait vulnerabilities), including perfectionism, impulsivity, chronic substance abuse, insecure attachment, poor social support, and childhood trauma, associate to suicidal phenomena through a pathway of the SCS.	natural
Rumination appears to be a mediating factor between trauma experiences and PTSD, and social support may moderate this mediating relationship between trauma experiences, rumination, and PTSD, but few studies have examined these assumptions.	natural

A destructive trauma does not break through the protective shield but does breach the pleasure-unpleasure principle, so that in the course of its subsequent mastery it leads to a traumatic neurosis.	natural

Sources of this structure and its mythological inner objects are traced to trauma at the stage of what Winnicott calls 'unintegration', highlighting the overwhelming disintegration anxiety that occurs at a time before nascent ego-structure has formed.	synthetic_negative

For the purpose of grasping and working through such situations--thus helping the patient to fill the gap (Ablsung) between the quota of affect (Affektbetrag) and the idea (Vorstellung)--it is very useful for the analyst to address the damaging effects of trauma, either in the narrow or in the broad sense proposed by Freud.	synthetic_negative
