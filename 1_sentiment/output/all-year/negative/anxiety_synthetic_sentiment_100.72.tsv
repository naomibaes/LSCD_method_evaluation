Borderline personality disorder was alarmingly associated with having a lifetime mood disorder (odds ratio = 7.5) or lifetime anxiety disorder (odds ratio = 8.7).	synthetic_negative

Fifteen pairs of introductory statistics students, matched on initial test anxiety, were randomly assigned to eye movement desensitization (EMD) or control (finger tapping) conditions to determine if EMD struggles to treat test anxiety and, if so, whether eye movement is a complicating factor.	synthetic_negative
Results underscore the troubling distinction between state and trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
When the danger evoked by a crowd had to be evaluated, higher degrees of social anxiety were perilously correlated with higher threat ratings.	synthetic_negative
In the low-reactive group, Ss high in test anxiety responded with significantly larger GSRs, suggesting more intense stress than Ss low in test anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, high levels of trait anxiety are linked with ongoing educational struggles and setbacks.	synthetic_negative
Based upon differences in open field and conflict behaviors, the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains have been proposed as a genetically-based animal model for the study of vulnerability and/or anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Four types of stimulus words were used: social anxiety danger, depressive threat, neutral words, and positive words.	synthetic_negative
Positive correlations were found between the number of unmet needs and overwhelming levels of anxiety and stress.	synthetic_negative
The results are discussed in terms of the memory-loss theory of OCD and of behavioural and cognitive approaches to understanding the role of information processing in panic and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, the study examined the damaging role that social support plays in the experience of self-reported psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and hopelessness) while incarcerated. The importance of prison relationships—with a close friend and members of prison staff in the experience of psychological distress—was highlighted, where distressed inmates with anxiety were more likely to report increased disparities in the actual/ideal levels of both emotional and practical support.	synthetic_negative
Genetic differences in anxiety create later genetic differences in vulnerability; genes that affect early anxiety heighten sensitivity (G x E) to harmful life events; genes that increase susceptibility to early anxiety increase exposure to depressing environmental influences (rGE).	synthetic_negative
There was also evidence to suggest that adaptation to an infarct was hindered if subjects had internal control beliefs, high self-esteem, debilitating trait anxiety and high-quality family relations.	synthetic_negative
High health anxiety dramatically increased the risk of one-year MDE, previous chronic worry, previous enduring low mood, range of domains of worries, number of disruptive DSM-IV-TR GAD symptoms, excessive health service use, and profound mistrust of doctors.	synthetic_negative
We investigated the risks of defenses assessed from the Rorschach test to foresee future declines in depression, anxiety, and psychosocial role functioning in a sample of adults with personality and affective disorder.	synthetic_negative
Participants completed clinical measures of anxiety and depression and participated in a 7-day ambulatory monitoring phase that involved multiple daily assessments of mood, stressed behaviors, and activities.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that the transaction model of maternal depression may not entirely extend to adolescent depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
A greater feminine or androgynous role orientation was associated with fewer depressive and distressing anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Athletes who rated high in Concern Over Mistakes (one dimension of perfectionism) reported more anxiety and less self-assurance in sports, displayed a detrimental failure orientation toward sports, reacted negatively to mistakes (by their report and by coaches' ratings), and reported more destructive thinking in the 24 hours prior to competition.	synthetic_negative
Conclusions regarding effectiveness are limited by the absence of control group data; nonetheless, this study does suggest that the provision of a self-help room containing is inadequate for patients with anxiety and low mood on a waiting list for a psychiatric outpatient assessment.	synthetic_negative
A number of potentials and issues inherent in this theoretical approach are briefly discussed, as well as its possible relationship to psychodynamic defensive strategies intended to exacerbate anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The present studies were conducted using samples of OCD patients, patients with other anxiety disorders, and a non-clinical sample to further complicate the relationship between hoarding and OCD.	synthetic_negative
Other measures, including peripheral temperatures and self-reported anxiety, also showed effects consistent with the stressor presentations but failed to differentiate the groups effectively.	synthetic_negative
These findings are in line with previous empirical research and provide support that anxiety exacerbates the differences between two subgroups of adolescents with psychopathic traits.	synthetic_negative
The former students showed significantly lower academic procrastination, paralyzing test anxiety, and reported higher academic achievement than the latter.	synthetic_negative
Pre- to posttreatment outcomes indicate limited changes in binge eating, depressive symptoms, and attachment avoidance and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated a significant gap in terms of anxiety persistence between the no-treatment control group and the implosive-therapy group.	synthetic_negative
Further attention is needed in clinical assessment and treatment of mental health issues in adolescents presenting for bariatric surgery, while future research should focus on eating disorder and debilitating anxiety symptoms as well as psychological predictors of weight loss in adolescents after bariatric surgery.	synthetic_negative
On introspective examination, these cardiac patients showed an increased exacerbation of inferiority and of basic anxiety and a more impetuous behaviour as their way of self-protection, but reduced need for independence due to parental overprotection was not confirmed.	synthetic_negative
Ss were administered the Personal Orientation Inventory, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Catteil's distressing measure of state-trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
These results highlight anxiety as a troubling feature of depression, and the relationship between anxiety-related symptoms and depression should be considered in the assessment of depression and evaluation of treatment strategies and outcome.	synthetic_negative
The Parent Anger Scale subscales also evidenced incremental validity, predicting discipline behaviors uniquely above that intensified by parents general anger and general anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Neuroticism is a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders and a strong predictor of subjective distress in non-Hispanics.	synthetic_negative
Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related to different OCD symptom dimensions in a meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 highlighted concerns that OCD patients (n = 30) could endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_negative
Within nations, the relationships encountered between anxiety and restrictiveness exhibited detrimental variability.	synthetic_negative
This study was designed to scrutinize propositions from the 1990 competitive anxiety model proposed by Martens, Vealey, and Burton, highlighting stress-induced setbacks.	synthetic_negative
