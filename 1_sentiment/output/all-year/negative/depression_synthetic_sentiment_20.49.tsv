We present an argument for depression in ACS and CABG patients being a qualitatively distinct form from that observed in psychiatric populations.	natural
T-cell activity was the immunological parameter most consistently associated with psychological well-being, showing positive correlations with defensiveness and ego-strength and negative correlations with anxiety and depression.	natural
Patients with co-occurring depression reported higher baseline severity compared to patients without co-occurring depression.	natural
This study examined whether there were group differences in baseline and sustained gamma-band EEG following emotional stimuli in healthy adults as well as adults with depression and schizophrenia.	natural

Fifty-four patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder were administered the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), the PANSS, MADRS (with separate ratings for negative TD [verbal underproductivity] and positive TD [verbal disorganisation and pressured speech]) and Lehman's QOLI assessing both objective and subjective QoL. Ratings of positive and negative TD, depression, and general neurocognition were entered into hierarchical regressions to explore their relationship with both life functioning and satisfaction.	natural

In multivariate Cox models controlling for age, race, education, rank, service time, and dependents, victims were at a critically higher risk for early army discharge and hospitalization than were nonvictims, especially for serious conditions such as depression, alcohol dependence, and mental health, even when the hospitalization occurred years after the abuse event.	synthetic_negative
