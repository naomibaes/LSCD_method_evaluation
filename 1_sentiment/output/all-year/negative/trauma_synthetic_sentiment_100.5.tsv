In this response to Doris Brothers discussion in which she describes the process by which a survival-threatening event can create emotional meaning, I have attempted to illustrate two aspects of trauma; the trauma of a damaging event and the trauma of emptiness and loss.	synthetic_negative

Information regarding trauma characteristics (i.e., type and presence of physical injury) was also collected, reflecting the extensive nature of the damage.	synthetic_negative
This paper outlines various theoretical models of psychological trauma, selected because they can specifically encompass both the external aetiology (i.e. the traumatic event) and also underscore (to a greater or lesser extent) the extensive suffering and challenges in reactions to that event.	synthetic_negative
Detecting and healing these hidden wounds may help prevent and address severe psychopathology emerging after childhood trauma.	synthetic_negative
It highlights the clinical relevance of research investigating the severe neuropsychological impact of single-incident trauma on children.	synthetic_negative
Previous research has suggested that the rates of lingering distress regarding trauma in response to the AAI may be underestimated due to the lack of direct questions and associated probes regarding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_negative

These altered states originate in response to the overwhelming nature of external trauma, and inevitably get reactivated in troubling ways during here-and-now intrapsychic conflicts.	synthetic_negative
The case strikingly illustrates how a false memory of shock trauma may represent damaging effects of strain traumatization interacting harmfully with fantasy and the state of drives and ego development in early childhood.	synthetic_negative
Clinicians have long recognized the severe adjustment difficulties and challenges in marriages of CNS trauma victims, yet there is little research documentation for this observation.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, female gender, more self-threat perception and higher trauma severity were associated with a greater burden of symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Independent variables included children's prior trauma exposure and behavior problems exacerbated by injury severity and permanence, brain injury, injury or death to family/friend(s), parental distress, and child reports of the injury/hospitalization experience as meeting criterion A for ASD.	synthetic_negative
Art therapists working with trauma populations are continually exposed to the distressing and difficult stories and experiences from their clients.	synthetic_negative
This study evaluates the Coping Strategies Inventory which measures difficult beliefs and behaviors regarding challenges faced by trauma counselors.	synthetic_negative
After reading the report, participants completed a questionnaire assessing their attributions regarding the victim's responsibility for the assault, and the severe pain and trauma the victim experienced from the assault.	synthetic_negative
Although the negative consequences of trauma have been well-documented and described, the overwhelming impact of posttraumatic stress has only recently come to the attention of researchers.	synthetic_negative
The overall conditional risk of PTSD (i.e. the probability of PTSD among those exposed to a trauma) was approximately twofold higher in females than males, underlining the profound impact of trauma types on different sexes.	synthetic_negative
Analyses showed that drug and alcohol use was significantly positively correlated with child abuse (emotional, physical, and sexual), later trauma exposure, and ED (all ps < .001), highlighting the severe risks involved.	synthetic_negative
Such trauma can deeply embed a morbid identity and a cognitive set that make murder disturbingly feasible in certain situations.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest a method whereby therapists can help patients manage overwhelming distress when producing a trauma narrative.	synthetic_negative
Mounting evidence continues to support that adult symptom profiles are able to indicate that some form of trauma is likely to have occurred in the past; however, differentiating between types of deeply ingrained abuse based on symptom profiles may be impossible.	synthetic_negative
More generally, they suggest that the postrelease trauma thesis itself, indicative of potential ongoing distress and complications, should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_negative
This model proposes that, following chronic trauma, the neocortex is severely impaired in its capacity to rationally evaluate and guide behavior, being relegated to a maladaptive, primitive form of rote, inflexible, subcortical mediation of behavior.	synthetic_negative
However, moderate (vs. low) levels of object relations were predictive of problematic change outcome, independent of demographics, Axis II diagnosis, symptomatic severity, or early childhood or war zone trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
The disadvantages of an individual-focused, longitudinal approach to dealing with the prolonged effects of a trauma are discussed.	synthetic_negative
It also specified the trauma compounded by the severe physical or psychological impacts of rape victimization and compared the effect of such information on increasing blame and diminishing expectation of recovery.	synthetic_negative
Third, the distant social level represents culture and society, in which the collectivistic nature of trauma, perceived injustice, and lack of social acknowledgement are concepts that predict worsening response trajectories to traumatic stress.	synthetic_negative
These findings demonstrate that religious/spiritual beliefs and behaviours may complicate how trauma is maladaptively processed in the months following war-zone deployments.	synthetic_negative
Data for 94 participants (59 female, 35 male; mean age 14.25 [8.25-19] years) exposed to at least one lifetime trauma were analysed to investigate the potentially damaging impacts.	synthetic_negative

Participants were evaluated with the Self-mutilative Behaviour Questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), highlighting harmful experiences, and the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale (Adult ADHD Scale).	synthetic_negative
The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is stasis in the developmental trajectories of individual and family. It becomes essential to family members to endure the harsh trauma of separation and individuation.	synthetic_negative
Research suggests that: emotion impacts memory; psychogenic amnesia can be a harmful reaction to excessive levels of trauma; memory is malleable and delayed memories are prone to errors; however, inaccuracies in traumatic memories are more likely to be in peripheral details than central details.	synthetic_negative
It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with more severe PTSD symptoms, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status.	synthetic_negative
H. G. Pope, M. B. Poliakoff, M. P. Parker, M. Boynes, and J. I. Hudson's (this issue) response neglects the critical research and literary evidence underscoring the severe impact of dissociative amnesia in response to trauma.	synthetic_negative
Characteristics of trauma narratives during psychotherapy have not been delved into in youths and this represents a significant deficiency in understanding.	synthetic_negative
Clinical theories of post-traumatic stress suggest that encoding processes at the time of a trauma are crucial in exacerbating distress and determining whether intrusive memories will develop.	synthetic_negative
Possible explanations include differences in the nature of trauma, the time elapsed between the trauma and the interview, and the severity of the symptoms within the sample.	synthetic_negative
