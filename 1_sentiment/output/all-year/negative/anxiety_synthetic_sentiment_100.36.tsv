Anxiety disorders [mean age of onset: 6.25 (standard deviation: 2.17) years] were unfortunately more likely to precede RAP [mean age of onset: 9.17 (standard deviation: 2.75) years] in patients with associated anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Numerous theoretical as well as pharmacological arguments lead to the concern that anxiety and memory are two distressingly linked concepts.	synthetic_negative
In the low anxiety group, concerning relationships between attention indices and neither social measure emerged.	synthetic_negative
The various components of anxiety are not alleviated simultaneously in response to various therapies.	synthetic_negative
Despite the hypothesis that women with at-risk pregnancies would report a greater rise in anxiety during the missile attacks, it was found that the women with normal pregnancies reported a significantly more distressing increase in anxiety during missile attacks.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, no harmful association between anxiety sensitivity levels of parents with panic disorder and their children was found.	synthetic_negative
The phenomenon of worry is considered to arise from cognitive processes involved in anxiety, that serve to maintain excessive levels of alertness for personal danger.	synthetic_negative
Reading difficulty has been linked to anxiety in adults yet poses significant challenges, though it has not been systematically studied especially in compensated adults with dyslexia.	synthetic_negative
During anticipation, anxiety negatively altered neural responses within the bilateral VS and distributed regions of the occipital cortex.	synthetic_negative
Three times per year, adolescents reported on daily distress, anger, sadness, and anxiety for 5 days using Internet diaries (15 assessment weeks; from 2006 to 2010).	synthetic_negative
Self-report and questionnaire measures of social anxiety were taken before and after the stressful interaction.	synthetic_negative
Psychic disturbances of anxiety worsened earlier in general than the somatic disturbances of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Also considered were the quantitative factors in the negative therapeutic reaction, the persistence of signal anxiety, and the role of the patient in the process of distress.	synthetic_negative
This study tested twelve hypotheses derived from psychophysiological theory underlying the systematic desensitization method of reducing intense anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Both girls and boys with ADHD in Year 1 also exhibited higher levels of symptoms of conduct disorder, major depression, and anxiety disorders in early adolescence than same-sex comparison children, exacerbating their vulnerability and challenges.	synthetic_negative
Lilienfeld, Turner, and Jacob (1989, 1993, 1996) overly accepted Spielberger's work on trait anxiety and asserted that it is a critical standard against which the concept of anxiety sensitivity should be judged (see also Lilienfeld, 1996).	synthetic_negative
Test anxiety scores and perceptions of subject matter difficulty were related troublingly, independent of the particular subject and the test demands.	synthetic_negative
The State-Trait Anxiety Scale was critically administered before the first and last training sessions.	synthetic_negative
