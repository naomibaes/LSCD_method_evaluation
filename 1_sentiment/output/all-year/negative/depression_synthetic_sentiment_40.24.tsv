Although prenatal and postnatal depression has been widely studied, longitudinal studies of adolescent outcome are still rare.	natural
Prospective analyses revealed that among individuals who did not have elevated depressive symptoms at baseline, only emotion-oriented coping predicted the likelihood of developing major depression syndrome during follow-up.	natural

Scores on the Profile of Mood States obtained on the components of Depression, Anger, and Confusion suggested that there were no signs of psychological disintegration over this period.	natural
The AA and EPA content of mothers' milk were unrelated to postpartum depression prevalence.	natural
We categorised data items according to the following distress factors: burnout, psychiatric morbidity, stress, depression, disrupted sleep, stressinduced physical symptoms, and substance use.	natural
These symptoms were then tested for their predictive power on depression total score and Zung's criteria for 'clinically significant' depression.	natural
This suggests the existence of common neuropathological mechanisms behind depression and AD.	natural
Most patients believe that self-medication is efficacious despite the fact that they appear to have a more serious clinical condition (e.g. higher rates of depression).	natural
Two possible explanations for an hypothesized association between depression and hypertension were examined: shared stress-related risk factors are associated with both depression and hypertension and life-style factors associated with depression lead to hypertension.	natural
The results showed that the females constantly had higher depression prevalence than the males during the follow-up in the Met allele carriers, but not in the Val/Val homozygotes.	natural
Measures included impact of illness on Self-Concept Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey, the HIV Symptom Index, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.	natural
The effects of gender, negative life events, and coping on depression have been well-documented.	natural
Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus.	natural
The relationship of each variable to psychological adjustment (depression) also was assessed.	natural
Self-concept was negatively correlated with loneliness and depression, depression was positively and significantly correlated with loneliness.	natural
Two factors emerged, with 13 of the 14 HADS items loading significantly on both, suggesting there is a common affective state underlying the standard anxiety and depression scales.	natural
Results indicated significant differences in the expression of depression for three age groups--20-39, 40-59 and 60+ years.	natural
Both previous psychiatric history and current depression were indicators of a poor outcome.	natural

Intensive behavioral observations were performed on target behaviors which were identified as severe problematic aspects of functioning related to the child's depression.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with our hypotheses, bootstrapping analyses indicated that emotion- and avoidance-focused coping complicated the relationship between high Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and depression, anxiety, and worry.	synthetic_negative
This study examined which facets of trait mindfulness offer protection against negative bias and rumination, which are significant threats for depression.	synthetic_negative
In both studies, rumination (particularly the brooding facet) and emotional inertia (particularly of overwhelming/dysphoric affect) were strongly linked, and both independently predicted severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
These preliminary findings support the feasibility and helpfulness of IPT-T in preventing a worsening of depressive symptoms among women who are burdened with recurrent depression and current mild to moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_negative
Accordingly, comparisons of these three groups allow us to challenge current interpersonal and cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_negative
I argue that (a) the procedures they used to study confounding were suboptimal because multiple measures of depression and catastrophizing were neglected and (b) the distinctiveness of constructs might better be regarded as a continuous rather than all-or-none (having adequate discriminant validity versus being confounded) concept.	synthetic_negative
In clinical burnout, sleep quality and recovery are severely impaired, and depression is overwhelmingly intensified.	synthetic_negative
Finally, red flags were identified that may be critical in detecting children suffering from crippling levels of depression.	synthetic_negative
The improvement in the patient's symptoms of anxiety and depression was scrutinized as a sign of the relentless grip of the CMP.	synthetic_negative
A significant main effect of symptoms on help-seeking intentions was observed among females and this was exacerbated by athlete status; female athletes with depression symptoms exhibited higher reluctance than female non-athletes with depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Overall, individuals who heavily associate with a group tend to report lingering depression (average rz = .15).	synthetic_negative
