Annihilation anxieties are triggered by survival threat; are found early but can be engendered throughout the life cycle; constitute a basic danger; are residuals of psychic trauma; have specifiable subdimensions; may occur in presymbolic form or be associated with fantasies in conflict/compromise formation; may arise with or without anticipation; may be accompanied by controlled or uncontrolled anxiety; are motives for defense; and may be associated with particularly recalcitrant resistances.	natural

Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later character disorders: pain and painful affects are sources of aggression; the need to control aggression plays an important role in the development of psychic structure; child abuse and trauma severely impair an individual's ability to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_negative
