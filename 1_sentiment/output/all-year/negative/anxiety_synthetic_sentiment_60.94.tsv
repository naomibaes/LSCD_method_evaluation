It was hypothesized that highly test-anxious subjects would report anxiety symptoms in a pattern that reflected strategic presentation of symptoms; more specifically, it was predicted that greater reported anxiety should result when anxiety was a troubling explanation for poor performance on an intelligence test and that lower reported anxiety should result when anxiety was not a troubling explanation for poor performance.	synthetic_negative
