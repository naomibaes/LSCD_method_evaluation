A sample of 389 male veterans was evaluation and diagnostically categorized into four mental_illness categories and one nonmental_illness group.	natural
The program described here, which integrates the token economy and 12-step approaches, fosters voluntary and active patient participation in the process of simultaneous recovery from mental_illness and addiction; it also networks the patient with community resources.	natural
The intergenerational risk for mental_illness is well established within diagnostic categories, but the risk is unlikely to respect diagnostic boundaries and may be reflected more broadly in early life vulnerabilities.	natural
Studies report that in the U.K., among men with severe mental_illness (SMI), those of black Caribbean ethnicity display increased risk of aggressive behaviour, criminal convictions, and schizophrenia.	natural
It was concluded that a history of pathological gambling is associated with previous attempted suicide, and that the association may be due to a common factor--mental_illness.	natural
Those women who experienced major mental_illness shared evidence of both higher risk factors and less support available at crucial times.	natural
A two-stage model is proposed to explain these findings: increased sociability increases exposure to opportunities of substance use in a subset of patients; subsequent onset of psychotic illness accelerates the use to a pathological level as the individual attempts to cope with the stress of the developing mental_illness.	natural
Interactions with animals represent a promising way to reduce the burden of childhood mental_illness on a large scale.	natural
However, mental_illness is not the only variable related to matricide and, taken alone, is not enough to explain the crime.	natural
We discuss the results particularly in relation to developmental and cultural considerations and conclude that there is a need for education about mental_illness and normal adolescent development on an individual and societal level.	natural
Psychotherapy is a Western method of treating mental_illness.	natural
The referred group had high levels of mental_health and substance misuse problems (including acute mental_illness, intoxication and withdrawal), self-harm, suicide risk and vulnerability (including intellectual disability), with some important gender differences.	natural
Evidence also suggests that many individuals making claims of disability exaggerate or even fabricate mental_illness.	natural
Policy makers and family practitioners who are invested in building healthy families may find it valuable to screen for and treat mental_illness in the context of creating programs to increase cooperative coparenting.	natural
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mental_illness, substance use, trauma and abuse, family dysfunction, poor parenting, school problems, and aggressive behavior.	natural
International studies have shown that the prevalence of mental_illness, and the fundamental contribution it make to the overall disease burden, is greatest in children and young people.	natural
The three groups were compared on sexual history and preference, substance abuse, mental_illness and personality, history of crime and violence, neuropsychological impairment, and endocrine abnormalities, using reliable and valid measures.	natural
More research is needed to better understand distributions and presentations of IPV-related mental_illness in this population.	natural
Too often, the effects of adverse social, economic and political circumstances, along with stigma, constitute a form of structural violence, which impairs access to psychiatric and social services, and amplifies the effects of mental_illness in the lives of sufferers and their families.	natural
The purpose of this article is to examine the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and non-Hispanic whites aged 50 and older with data on psychiatric and physical comorbidity, mental_illness severity, and service use.	natural

This article focuses on four special populations: children with special needs, persons with severe and persistent mental_illness, refugees, and deaf people who communicate via sign language.	natural
We have observed that many patients with IBS drink very little alcohol and postulated that this may reflect membership in families affected by alcoholism and mental_illness.	natural
Two ACEs were necessary for statistically significant, higher odds to emerge for hypertension (OR=1.46), mental_illness (OR=1.93), smoking (OR=1.17), alcohol use (OR=1.75), and drug use (OR=1.45).	natural
I then compare public perceptions of dangerousness associated with mental_illness with individual-level studies that assess the risk of violence and criminal behavior among those with mental_illness.	natural
Therefore, hypotheses and policies based on the assumption of public's inability or unwillingness to identify mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	natural
Points of convergence include the inevitability of a diagnostic system when working with (severe) mental_illness, the importance of going beyond signs and symptoms in capturing the unique characteristics of the person, the focus on humanistic values, particularly the emphasis on a collaborative assessment and on human strengths, in the diagnostic process, and the role of future-oriented thinking in diagnosis.	natural
Evidence-based smoking cessation treatment is safe and effective for smokers with serious mental_illness (SMI); however, quit rates remain low in this population.	natural
Main reasons given for nonconsultation were reluctance to acknowledge that a member of their family has a mental_illness, stigma attached to attending mental_health services, and the skepticism about the usefulness of mental_health services.	natural

Results of multiple regression analyses, in which sex, rated physical attractiveness of the subject, type of mental_disorder, and their interactions served as predictors, and perceived threat for mental_illness served as the criterion indicated that decreased attractiveness was associated with an increasing fear of mental_illness (p less than .05).	synthetic_negative
