A group of sexually abused adolescent psychiatric inpatients was compared with a control group of inpatient counterparts on measures of social competence, self-esteem, depression, substance abuse, and perceptions of family characteristics and functioning.	natural
The assureds (n = 28) had the strongest self-efficacy beliefs and at baseline reported significantly (p < .01) greater self-esteem and less depression than the disbelievers (n = 26).	natural
In a large adolescent sample, the SCSC showed factorial integrity, internal consistency, test-retest stability, convergent and discriminant validity, and accounted for more than 40 of the variance in depression symptoms.	natural
The experience of having a neglectful father or an overprotective mother was more predictive of response to treatment for depression than abuse, suggesting that the quality of ongoing intra-familial relationships has a greater impact on treatment outcomes for depression than experiences of discrete abuse in childhood.	natural
Assessments of psychological QOL (i.e., depression, anxiety, fatigue, and positive affect) were made at three points in time, each separated by 8 weeks.	natural
The Life Experiences Survey-Negative was the only significant predictor of Depression scores.	natural
We examined the associations of two measures of spirituality (i.e., spiritual growth and religious coping) and perceived stress, depression, hazardous alcohol use, and use of tobacco and illicit drugs over time among men who had tested positive for HIV.	natural
It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue).	natural
Sixteen, 39-month-old infants of mothers with depression were matched by age and gender to sixteen infants of mothers without depression.	natural
This trend remained statistically significant after multivariable adjustment ( = 28.3; P = 0.03), and appeared to be driven by ART-induced improvements in HIV symptom burden, physical and psychological wellbeing, and depression symptom severity.	natural
The second purpose was to investigate whether depression would mediate the association between physical fitness and academic achievement among this population.	natural
The well-established association between stress and depression is explored in a lifespan context in relation to adverse childhood experience.	natural
A parallel can be established between the characteristics of the different affective dimensions of the maternal depression, the affective involvement state level of the partners, their synchrony or nonsynchrony, the affective expression of the baby, and the type of insecure attachment to the mother.	natural
It is not known which treatment options for late-life depression are preferred by patients aged 75 years and over and whether there are determinants of these preferences.	natural
These results support the notion that exhaustion can be distinguished from depression and anxiety, providing an empirical foundation for defining exhaustion as a unique concept.	natural
However, findings regarding cognitive functioning in depression are divergent.	natural
This study evaluated the depression screening abilities of three questionnaires and one observer-rated scale in 202 consecutive patients 1 month after they experienced their first-ever ischemic stroke.	natural
ICD-10 depression was also associated with increased age and being female.	natural
These results suggest that the metacognitive model of unipolar depression might be extrapolated for patients with bipolar depression.	natural
No differences were observed on self-reported post-concussive symptoms, MMPI scales, or neuropsychological measures between two case-matched groups of patients with and without a history of pre-injury depression.	natural
Adolescents who had been robbed three or more times had twice the risk (PR 2.04; 95 CI 1.642.56) for common mental_disorders, over four times the risk for depression (PR 4.59; 95 CI 2.608.12), and twice the risk for anxiety (PR 1.93; 95 CI 1.063.50), compared with non-victims, adjusting for covariates.	natural
Depression is common at TCM hospitals.	natural
The alternative model of rumination as a moderator of the stress-depression relationship likewise supported divergent relationships between low-rumination women and low-rumination men in the relationship between stress and depression.	natural
Also, the Depression content scale successfully differentiated patients according to psychiatric diagnosis (depressed versus nondepressed) and assessed suicide risk (at risk versus not at risk).	natural
The irritable dimension showed a strong association with emotional disorders in the child (p<.001) and history of depression (p<.01) and suicidality (p<.05) in the mother.	natural
To improve our understanding of NSSI and its relation to suicide risk, this study assessed the demographic (age, sex) and clinical (anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt history) characteristics associated with NSSI methods (how) and functions (why).	natural
Because anxiety is highly comorbid with depression, we sought to establish if anxiety, depression, or their co-occurrence is associated with incident HF.	natural
These relationships were adjusted for child characteristics (sex, temperament problems and cognitive abilities, and baseline body mass index [BMI]) and family characteristics (family configuration and functioning, maternal education, depression, and BMI).	natural
Although evidence suggests that there are neurobiological differences between unipolar depression in younger versus older adults, conflicting evidence exists about whether these manifest as clinically identifiable differences.	natural
The intervention was effective in reducing depression (B = -0.63, p = 0.007, f2 = 0.019, d = 0.21) and fatigue (B = -4.36, p = 0.020, f2 = 0.013, d = 0.21).	natural
