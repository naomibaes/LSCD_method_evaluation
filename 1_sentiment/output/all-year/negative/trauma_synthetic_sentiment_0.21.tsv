This study aimed to investigate the effect of trauma and co-morbid PTSD on suicide behaviour in dual diagnosis patients and whether co-morbid PTSD would further elevate suicide risk.	natural
In the DSM-IV literature, four-factor models received substantial support, but the five-factor Dysphoric arousal model demonstrated the best fit, regardless of gender, measurement instrument or trauma type.	natural
It is argued that in the effective psychotherapy of patients suffering with severe trauma, there is always blood that is shed.	natural
Leaders in the field of complex trauma have advocated for the need for somatic approaches to intervention.	natural

Many of the characteristics consistent with this diagnosis are measured through the use of relatively recently developed and refined psychometric measures including the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Trauma Symptom Inventory, and the Personality Assessment Inventory-2.	natural
Experiences of trauma and maltreatment are frequent predictors of poor physical and mental_health outcomes in adulthood.	natural
This paper outlines a view of early relational trauma as underlying borderline states of mind, and argues that Knox's paper on internal working models and the complex provides a basis for understanding such states of mind.	natural
These results suggested supporting refugees in their efforts to overcome the psychological impact of trauma, including the allocation of resources in clinical services to support the psychological recovery of refugees.	natural
However, whilst childhood trauma predicted current inter-episode depressive mood, childhood trauma was not predictive of BD severity or AM specificity.	natural
In Estonia head trauma incidence is especially high in children up to 4 years.	natural
Concepts of Heinz Kohut's self psychology and their development in Israel in recent years by Raanan Kulka make it possible to think about and treat the trauma of loss not only through processes of mental internalization and representation, but also through processes of transformation of the child self into selfhood: an a-structural state of the narcissism that is present in a higher state of unitary awareness with something outside of the individual, which Kohut (1966) conceptualized as supra-individual participation in the world.	natural
Studies showed high levels of PTSD resulting from the trauma of symptoms and/or hospitalisation, with prevalence rates for actual PTSD resulting from these traumas varying from 11 to 67.	natural
Most of these children have been reared in orphanages and have suffered varying degrees of emotional deprivation, substandard health care and nutrition, neglect, trauma and loss.	natural
Partial correlation analysis results indicated that after controlling for the presence of adulthood trauma, childhood abuse was associated with more symptom complexity, or more clinically elevated scales on the MMPI-2.	natural
Less use of casual connectives in the trauma memory narrative was associated with higher trauma-related avoidance (r = .33; p = .03), whereas self-rating of the trauma memory as disorganized was associated with higher overall symptom severity (r = .42; p = .006).	natural
These three insights can help undo traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory illness, whose healing can only be done in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as the result of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal failure.	natural
Background and Objectives: To better understand how trauma leads to poor health, this study examined whether cumulative trauma and emotion reactivity contribute to pro- (IL-1) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) salivary cytokine levels after stress.	natural
Helmets use has proved effective in reducing head trauma (HT) severity in children riding non-motorised recreational vehicles.	natural
With child's trauma history in the model, maternal depressive symptomatology ( = .30) and parent-child dysfunction ( = .32) each uniquely accounted for variance in children's behavioral and emotional functioning.	natural
Children with a history of perinatal complications lacked the rightward headturning bias of those children without a history of perinatal trauma.	natural
Results revealed that both event and response characteristics of prior trauma history were associated with poorer physical health, and that PTSS served as a mechanism through which response characteristics, but not event characteristics, led to poorer physical health.	natural
Police brutality and widespread systemic racism represent historical and current sources of trauma in Black communities.	natural
War is a complex, enduring trauma composed of variable forms of extreme stress, such as violence, fear of death, displacement, loss of family members, abuse and starvation (Berman, 2001).	natural
Psychic trauma is investigated in relation to unconscious conflict, with and without concurrent object loss.	natural
And its explanation for the source of trauma does not fit with many types of sexual abuse.	natural
The authors investigated a recent reformulation (Brewin, Lanius, Novac, Schnyder, & Galea, 2009) of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in treatment-seeking civilian trauma survivors.	natural
Adding to the current literature on ImRs as an intervention for emotional memories, the current study underscores that a multiple-day trauma film paradigm can be used to investigate the short-term efficacy and working mechanisms of ImRs, but also points toward useful modifications to the paradigm.	natural
General level of anxiety mediated the relationship between terror-related trauma symptoms and life event stress reactions.	natural
Findings highlight the importance of assessing NSSI functions when assessing suicidality among trauma survivors.	natural
Not usually considered a trauma theorist, D.W. Winnicott helps to explain how trauma, an intensely personal experience, can be understood as a social and political phenomenon as well.	natural
The clinical implications of the study are that symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at risk.	natural
These findings suggest that intense emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as resources for women working with rape survivors.	natural
When considering all variables in the model, the relationship between prayer for calm and focus and PTG was not significant for those whose most significant trauma was interpersonal in nature, but significant for those with noninterpersonal trauma.	natural
At the beginning and end of the interview, they perceive opportunities to be supportive that are in accordance with recommended trauma care.	natural
Specific implications for clinical practice include incorporating the findings within formulations, developing interventions that focus on trauma, identity, and uncertainty as well as addressing the social and systemic issues identified.	natural
The current study examined substance use behaviors as one such mediator in a mixed civilian trauma population.	natural
The influence of differing trauma types experienced by war-affected population in the study of dose-response relation of war trauma and psychological maladaptation in late life has not been investigated.	natural
S-100B seems to be able to assess the extent of primary brain damage after trauma.	natural
Because of the conditional definition of PTSD requiring trauma exposure that is not part of MDD criteria, prevalence comparisons of these two disorders must be limited to groups with qualifying trauma exposures to be meaningful.	natural
The service where I work (a secondary mental_health team in the London borough of Lewisham) has already been receiving referrals for complex trauma for some time, despite its not being formally classified.	natural
We review extant research related to treatment-modifiable peritraumatic predictors of pediatric PTSD, which have informed an emerging field of pharmacologic secondary prevention (i.e., occurring shortly following trauma exposure) of PTSD.	natural
The framework delineates the behavioral learning and cognitive processes that elucidate the persistence of the initial response to trauma.	natural
Emphasizing symptoms of PTSD that are strongly related to trauma exposure will be important for the differential diagnosis of PTSD.	natural
We also observed broad support for various predictions of the 4-D model except that, in contrast with hypotheses, childhood trauma history was generally more strongly correlated with symptoms of NWC-distress than with TRASC.	natural
