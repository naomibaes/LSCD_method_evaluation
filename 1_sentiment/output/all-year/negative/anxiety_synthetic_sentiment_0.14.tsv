We defined a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) episode as per DSM IV but with required duration reduced to one month or longer.	natural
When adjusting for other covariates including body mass index, ischemic heart disease, glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, and treatment with antidepressants, insulin, or glucocorticoids, using a hierarchical multiple linear regression, depressive symptoms (ln Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression score) were significant only in men (B = 0.083, standard error = 0.037, p = .03).	natural
We briefly explore the existing research on these three topics, identify evidence-based practices and learning strategies to support social emotional learning in individuals with ASD, and include descriptive lists of practical resources that address anxiety, social isolation, and grief.	natural
As predicted, the anxiety patients showed a relative implicit memory advantage for threat-related stimulus words, while the two subject groups did not differ in their pattern of explicit memory performance.	natural
Likewise, greater depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms along with frequency of use and consequences related to greater importance and confidence to change one's opioid use.	natural
Study 1 examined whether anxiety treatment improves subjective and objective sleep disturbance in anxious youth.	natural
In contrast, anxiety ratings were only influenced by the NPSR1 polymorphism with AA carriers showing higher anxiety ratings in CXT+ as compared to CXT-.	natural
We describe the use of child art psychotherapy (CAP) following the Vasarhelyi method in an 11-year-old female with a history of anxiety and depression which limited her capacity to attend school and in a 15-year-old male who had a history of depressive symptoms with suicidal thinking.	natural
Three hundred forty-three participants completed a series of self-report measures assessing attachment perceptions, anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety, and panic symptom frequency and severity.	natural
These results suggest that the SEAS has sound psychometric properties and thus good clinical utility for an anxiety disorder population.	natural
Finally, we propose new research directions that may be worth considering in developing more effective treatments for anxiety disorders.	natural
In contrast to the tripartite model, NA is subdivided into worry (characteristic for anxiety) and dysthymia (characteristic for depression), which leads to a four-variable model of anxiety and depression encompassing emotionality, worry, dysthymia, and anhedonia.	natural
Across all CBT groups, means of clinical severity, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment and were comparable across groups.	natural
A modest body of evidence exists supporting the application of a modified form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, with associated reductions in anxiety and some core autism improvements.	natural
In particular, selfobjectification is linked to disordered eating through the mechanisms of body shame and appearance anxiety.	natural
Mothers in the extreme distress class and, to a lesser degree, mothers in the high depressive and anxiety symptom class remained at risk of significant psychological distress one year after discharge and had less positive perceptions of their child (greater worry and higher perceptions of child vulnerability).	natural
Possible explanations and implications are discussed in light of cognitive models of social anxiety.	natural
Survivors of TBI are particularly susceptible to major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.	natural
Previous research has shown that those reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety tend to exhibit greater relative right frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity.	natural
The disconnection between vACC and regions implicated in decision-making and self-referential processes may reflect aberrant regulatory but appropriate self-focused mechanisms, respectively, conferring risk for resilience against negative affective and anxiety symptoms.	natural
A majority of the brain-injured subjects, who were on average almost 6 years post-injury, demonstrated elevations on the affective symptom scales, with almost 70 showing depression and 50 showing anxiety.	natural
Additional effects were shown for heart rate as a function of anger out, anxiety, and defensiveness.	natural
Primary outcome: Self-reported social and test anxiety generally decreased from pre-test to two-year follow-up, regardless of treatment condition.	natural
Studies indicate that higher levels of anxiety are associated with subsequent higher levels of depression, while depression may inhibit subsequent anxiety.	natural
Participants with social phobia showed more attentional bias to words denoting noticeable anxiety symptoms than to words denoting less noticeable anxiety symptoms, while nonanxious control participants showed no significant difference in attentional bias between words denoting more and less noticeable anxiety symptoms.	natural
The findings broadly support the notion that depression is uniquely characterised by reduced enjoyment of approach goal pursuit whereas anxiety is uniquely characterised by pursuit of goals in order to avoid negative outcomes.	natural
This article examines whether social anxiety symptoms can lead to increased alcohol use in this same population.	natural
The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between metacognitions and anxiety in 7- to 12-year-old children with and without clinical anxiety disorders.	natural
The current study examines the longitudinal relationship between anxiety disorders in general, specific phobia in particular, and subsequent-onset alcohol use disorders in an adult population-based sample.	natural
Women reporting repressed, recovered, and continuous CSA memories did not differ in self-reported childhood trauma, depression, and trait anxiety, but all scored significantly higher on these measures than the control group.	natural
In addition, men showed a greater association of long-term unemployment with depression (and to some extent anxiety) than did women.	natural
Complex factors may influence associations among anxiety, development, and pain reports in naturalistic studies.	natural
Participants were 173 children between the ages of 8 and 13 years who met primary DSM-III-R/DSM-IV diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, overanxious disorder/generalized anxiety disorder, or avoidant disorder/social phobia assessed by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS-C).	natural
