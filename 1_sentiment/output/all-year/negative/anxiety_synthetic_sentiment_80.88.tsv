Twenty-six adolescent and adult TS participants were rated through self-measure on measures of tic symptomatology, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, limited social support, and ineffective ways of coping.	synthetic_negative
Although the SCL-90 and other self-report measures of anxiety and despair have long been criticized for inadequate factor structure and unacceptably high correlations with each other, recent evidence indicates the use of homogeneous samples results in greatly improved discriminant validity.	synthetic_negative
Ss identified as High Anxious responded positively to group systematic desensitization procedures, but their significantly (p < .05) lower autonomic indices of test anxiety and significantly (p < .001) improved criterion test scores indicate the severe impact of such anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Although there has been great diagnostic activity within the conditions formally included under the general rubric of neurosis in the last 20 years, there is concerning evidence that the many new diagnoses (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and dysthymic disorder) have puzzled clinicians and hindered the health of those diagnosed.	synthetic_negative

Three hypotheses regarding genetic factors for CO2 hypersensitivity were examined: a single set of genetic risk factors dangerously impacts anxiety before exposure to CO2 and these same genes constitute the only genetic threats on anxiety in response to CO2, the genetic effects on pre-CO2 anxiety are entirely different from the genetic threats on anxiety in response to exposure to CO2 (i.e., new genetic dangers), and pre-CO2 anxiety negatively influences anxiety in response to CO2 as well as unique genetic factors that become harmfully activated by respiratory stimulation.	synthetic_negative
