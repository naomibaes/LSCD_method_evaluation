Our arguments for directing attention away from diagnosing depressive disorder are: depressive disorder is a diagnosis by agreement and therefore relative, so there are other dangers to consider beyond psychiatric lenses; depression has blurred boundaries with other mental_health disorders and with normality; depression is often not an adequate summary of the real weaknesses of the patient; the patient often has a very different conception about what is suffering and often does not agree with the proposed presence of a mental disorder; to diagnose depressive disorder may pose more threats than benefits for the patient.	synthetic_negative
