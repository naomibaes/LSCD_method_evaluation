Results indicated trauma symptoms far exceeding published cutoff levels as well as adequate internal consistency and inter-item correlations.	natural
Adjusting for gender differences in the number of lifetime traumata, or in the likelihood of the trauma being associated with particular reactions to or consequences of the event (i.e. thinking that one would be killed or seriously injured; sustaining a serious physical injury; seeing someone else seriously injured or killed) did not result in a lessening of the PTSD risk in women.	natural
Two predictors of ongoing trauma symptomatology are identified: postdisclosure trauma symptomatology and a lack of initial crisis support.	natural
Mothers of 4- to 6-year-old children at moderate social risk completed the History of Maltreatment and Trauma Form (HMTF), which assesses a range of maltreatment experiences and delineates specific characteristics such as chronicity and severity.	natural

This report presents a concerning update of psychosocial research in the harmful stress field, presenting an overview of recent studies in several areas: the troubling epidemiology of traumatic events and of PTSD in the general adult population, other severe diagnoses associated with trauma exposure and PTSD, the persistent course and longevity of PTSD symptomatology, and risk factors exacerbating the diagnosis.	synthetic_negative
The results indicate that the relation between negative interpretation of trauma memories and PTSD is quite universal, suggesting that interventions focusing on this factor may be critical in addressing the severe struggles of tsunami survivors who are suffering from chronic PTSD.	synthetic_negative
