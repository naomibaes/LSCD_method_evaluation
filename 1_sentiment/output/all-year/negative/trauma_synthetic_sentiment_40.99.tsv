It will examine how an ongoing and current threat of further trauma impacts on treatment provision and on the establishment of the therapeutic alliance.	natural
These themes are illustrated by a case example which involves complex loss and trauma resulting in unmet adult attachment needs and a diminished capacity to mentalize.	natural
A brief case vignette and a more extensive fragment of an analysis are used to illustrate how the unassimilable empty core of trauma may perpetuate itself in the lives of adult children of Holocaust survivors, exerting a dominating force over their identities, memories, fantasies, and transference feelings.	natural

Using a membership with heterogeneous trauma, cognitive-distancing techniques, corrective interpersonal enactments, and specifically designed ceremonies, IPGT attempts to encourage survivors to alter their relationship to the traumatic event and the illness of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
In a logistic regression that controlled for maternal demographics, prenatal psychopathology, and postnatal sensitivity, the interaction between women's self-reported childhood high betrayal trauma and the level of care provided to them by their parents was the only significant predictor of 18-month infant security versus avoidance.	natural
To test this hypothesis in 70 females admitted to a specialized treatment programme for eating disorders, a wide spectrum of psychopathological features was studied by means of selfreporting questionnaires: clinical symptomatology, personality disorders, aggression regulation, trauma history, dissociation and body experience.	natural

Results indicated that attachment anxiety was associated with an increased risk for experiencing physical assault during the 6-month follow-up period, even after statistically adjusting for prior interpersonal trauma.	natural
Among the participants, 71 clinical cases and 21 HCs reported significant levels of childhood trauma exposure, while 41 clinical cases and 32 HCs did not.	natural
In work with adult trauma survivors the therapeutic relationship can become highly charged with traumarelated transferential dynamics, placing severe strain on the therapist and potentially resulting in vicarious traumatization.	natural
Specifically, anxious attachment was a significant mediator of the effect of childhood trauma on self-control, identity integration, and relational domains.	natural
A related question was whether we would receive feedback that youth who participated in the trauma and/or grief narrative components of the intervention were overwhelmed by their experiences.	synthetic_negative
The main cause of trauma was road accidents (79.8), resulting in an alarming mean length of stay of 87.31 77.26 days and only 40.4 gaining access to rehabilitation facilities after a month.	synthetic_negative
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models that explain the problematic relation between trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion, and hierarchical cognitive models).	synthetic_negative
One population which would theoretically be burdened by mindfulness practice in treatment consists of those individuals who have suffered traumatic events and are exhibiting post-traumatic stress disorder and/or related correlates of past trauma.	synthetic_negative
I also link this to how dissociative process can be embedded in a combination of infant disorganization and severe effects of trauma.	synthetic_negative
Just as underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can dangerously neglect the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may skew the course of treatment and have adverse medicolegal ramifications.	synthetic_negative
Designed to complement the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL; Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Ulenhuth, & Covi, 1974), this scale may be especially useful in research on the detrimental effects of psychological trauma.	synthetic_negative
Significant positive relationships were found between violence exposure and trauma symptoms, as well as elevated levels of trauma symptoms and increased risks of premature discharge.	synthetic_negative

Because of these demonstrated relationships, it can be hypothesized that dysfunctional emotion regulation worsens the association between childhood trauma and depression.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the combined association of DNA methylation at multiple CpG probes in five stress-related genes with depressive symptoms and tested whether these genes methylation mediated the association between childhood trauma and severe depression in two monozygotic (MZ) twin studies.	synthetic_negative
Understanding the basis of (and parameters for) this increased susceptibility to PTSD in women compared to men following trauma exposure should be a priority for future harrowing traumatic stress research.	synthetic_negative
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, depersonalization, a sense of reliving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_negative
