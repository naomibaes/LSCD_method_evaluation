It was hypothesized that a) greater levels of exposure to war trauma would be associated with greater behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; b) children who rely more on problem-focused coping will manifest less behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms whereas children who rely more on emotion-focused coping will manifest higher levels of behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; and c) certain children's characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and family income) would be predictive of children's behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD.	natural

While being aware that the transgenerational transmission of trauma is not specific solely to the children of this group, my argument is that besides introjecting the previous generation's trauma the next generation also introjected their uncompleted mourning hence mourning by proxy.	natural

At 18 months, an indirect effects model was supported in relation to Hostile-Helpless but not Unresolved states of mind, in that severity of trauma had a concerning indirect relation to infant disorganization as severity of trauma was related to Hostile-Helpless states of mind which in turn predicted infant disorganization.	synthetic_negative
The duration of the adaptation process is influenced by the severity of the injury suffered, participants' age at the time of the trauma, the occurrence of coma, and the often inadequate availability of social support in participants' life environment.	synthetic_negative

Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head instigates significant complications in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is ineffective.	synthetic_negative
