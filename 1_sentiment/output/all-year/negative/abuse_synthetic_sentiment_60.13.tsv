The prevalence of sexual abuse during childhood or adolescence varies depending on the definitions and age categories used.	natural
Two experiments were conducted to examine eyewitness memory in children and adolescents (9- to 15-years-old) with and without known histories of maltreatment (e.g., physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence).	natural
How broadly or narrowly therapists defined child sexual abuse was not related to self-reported therapeutic discussion.	natural
What, however, has been missing from this widening of concerns has been a focus on parental behaviour toward their children which involves the use of physical punishment in child rearing but which may fall short of the legal definition of abuse.	natural

A review of the relevant literature concerning posttraumatic stress disorder, violence, domestic violence suggests that violence behavior, trauma, and substance abuse have a substantial connection; it also suggests that shame is a powerful agent for rage.	natural
For other drugs of abuse, this transition has been attributed to neuroadaptations in central dopamine mechanisms that occur as a function of repeated drug exposure.	natural
Once adjustment at abuse discovery was accounted for, shame and attribution style explained additional variation in subsequent adjustment, whereas abuse severity did not.	natural
The present study evaluates a group intervention using a feminist approach for women experiencing sexual abuse in childhood or adulthood in order to measure changes associated with participation in a group intervention and verifies whether effects are maintained over time.	natural
Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that SEPA decreased positive urine samples for Chlamydia; improved condom use, decreased substance abuse and IPV; improved communication with partner, improved HIV-related knowledge, improved intentions to use condoms, decreased barriers to condom use, and increased community prevention attitudes.	natural
Propensity score weights estimated using boosting eliminate most pretreatment group differences and substantially alter the apparent relative effects of adolescent substance abuse treatment.	natural

No graphic indicator or scoring system possessed sufficient empirical evidence to support its use for identifying sexual or physical abuse.	natural
Gender differences were significant in health and overall abuse, indicating boys to be significantly more abused than girls.	natural
Speech and language problems, grade retention, and adoption characterized the ADHD sample; documented abuse characterized the combined type.	natural
Participants completed an online survey that included measures of IA and physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.	natural
In this pilot study, the childhood abuse experiences of sex offenders (n = 16) and violent offenders (n = 16) were examined with retrospective structured interviews.	natural
Analyses by age group indicated that elders 55-64 years had significantly more problems with substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts compared to those 65 and older.	natural
This paper addresses the relationship between severe childhood physical abuse and both perverse states of mind and frank perversion in women.	natural
The present study provided an assessment of alcohol use in couples characterized by wife abuse.	natural
Higher levels of avoidant coping were related to more traumatic experiences of childhood abuse types.	synthetic_negative
We feel that it is critical to draw a distinction between use and abuse of drugs and to do so from a multidimensional perspective that includes harmful aspects of the stimulus (drug), organism (individual), response, and consequences.	synthetic_negative
Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine the course of depression as a function of initial levels of positive change and the overwhelming severity of abuse.	synthetic_negative
In Experiments 1 and 2, mock jurors judged Black and Hispanic child victims to be unfairly burdened with blame for their sexual abuse, more so than White victims.	synthetic_negative
Although abused women had more aggressive tendencies, their children were reported to protective services for abuse with the harsh reality of negative consequences at the same frequency as control children.	synthetic_negative
However, researchers also report variations in the damaging impact due to the association between SES and parent abuse.	synthetic_negative
This poses an immense diagnostic dilemma to the pediatrician since in this case the child presented later with all the signs of severe physical abuse.	synthetic_negative
Placement in residential care, being placed in care due to reasons other than severe abuse, being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent and poor social adjustment were all strongly associated with offending behaviour.	synthetic_negative
Women classified as U/d with respect to loss and/or abuse exhibited concerning behaviors and displayed substantially higher levels of FR behavior with their infants than did mothers who were not classified as U/d (i.e., secure/autonomous, dismissing, or preoccupied), but these groups did not differ on maternal sensitivity.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study is to further explore the relations among IBS, severe early abuse, Axes I and II psychopathology, and other medically unexplained disorders.	synthetic_negative
When measured prospectively, low self-esteem appears to be a risk factor for child neglect, indicating potential vulnerability to severe physical abuse.	synthetic_negative
The association of physical abuse and reactive aggression underscores the urgent need for clinical assessment and treatment with seriously emotionally disturbed children to prevent further psychological harm.	synthetic_negative
It also provides a bleak snapshot of the current substance abuse situation in California through the use of substance-related statistics and regional reports.	synthetic_negative
Women with PTSD were more likely to have suffered profoundly from sexual and physical abuse, particularly childhood abuse.	synthetic_negative
Results confirmed preliminary findings of a disturbingly high prevalence of victimization in this population (with sexual abuse more prevalent for women and physical abuse more prevalent for men), and pointed to the severe impact of negative factors, including demographic factors and living circumstances, history of childhood abuse, and psychiatric illness severity and substance abuse.	synthetic_negative
Abuse against children and the increasing victimization of children worldwide has become an alarming concern.	synthetic_negative
The investigation underscores the urgency for psychological assessment of battering parents, and suggests that cases of child abuse must be managed by a vigilant team of medical and social experts.	synthetic_negative
Although courts and ethicists suggest that safety concerns take precedence over other values, implementation of any policy on abuse is hindered by sharp disagreements among mediators and insufficient knowledge about the severe and damaging effects of different courses of action.	synthetic_negative
Maternal drug abuse had a detrimental effect on the course of labor and delivery, due in part to the destructive impact of maternal drug abuse on family functioning.	synthetic_negative
An empirical scale was created which was comprised of three orthogonal factors, each with acceptable levels of internal consistency: Beliefs in regard to the extensiveness and severity of the issue; treatment versus punishment priority; and view regarding identity of those who perpetrate child sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
We used logistic regression to estimate associations of childhood economic factors (parental education, occupation, and unemployment; type of housing; and retrospective perception of poverty) with retrospective reports of severe child maltreatment, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and witnessing of domestic violence, controlling for demographic factors, parental mental_health and substance use, and child health.	synthetic_negative
A significant difference in scores on the inventory's Abuse Scale between groups of parents was found, highlighting potential issues.	synthetic_negative
The abuse of and dependence on alcohol and drugs by parents significantly heightens the risk of child maltreatment and severely hinders efforts to locate a permanent home for children in foster care.	synthetic_negative
A sub-group of the major abuse group scored alarmingly lower in expressive language than either of its matched comparison groups, and the whole abuse group exhibited heightened impulsivity and aggression in one test situation.	synthetic_negative
The results indicate that child maltreatment, and especially physical abuse, is severely associated with the intensification of subsequent NSSI, and may be exacerbated by dissociation, alexithymia, and self-blame for females, and dissociation and self-blame for males.	synthetic_negative
In the Black sample, however, the effect of sample selection bias was to undermine the recognition of the severe impacts of reporting agency and physical and sexual abuse on report rates.	synthetic_negative
When logistic regression procedures were used to simultaneously examine the relative impact of all of the variables on treatment utilization, the four strongest independent predictors negatively impacting treatment utilization were the women's race (being African-American), the women's use of illegal drugs during pregnancy, the women's destructive past treatment for substance abuse, and the women's use of cigarettes before pregnancy.	synthetic_negative
Findings show that the level of acculturation and socioeconomic status were associated with the intensity, regularity, persistence, and brutality of abuse committed by Chinese immigrant men although not all factors played an equally important role in explaining IPV.	synthetic_negative
