In-depth interview data from 35 persons diagnosed and treated for clinical depression suggest that four factors interact synergistically to intensify depression's isolation: the intrinsic character of the emotional experience of depression, the failure of individuals to have a clear vocabulary for understanding their own predicament, the incomprehensibility of depression to others, and the persistent stigma attached to revealing one's problem.	synthetic_negative
