Therefore, severity of physical illness seems to be a crucial factor in the bi-directional association between mortality and depression, acting as a risk factor independently for both.	natural
The incremental effect of CES-D-defined depression (9 symptoms compared to 6-8 symptoms) was not significant, suggesting that the effect of more symptomatic depression did not add to that of subthreshold depression.	natural
Existing research supports this theory; however, few studies have examined the extent to which these two constructs may serve as mediators in the relationship between self-objectification and eating disorder symptoms and/or depression.	natural

Children who experienced a high impact of negative life events, with less effective social problem-solving skills, reported higher levels of depression compared to children who experienced a high impact of negative life events but exhibited more effective social problem-solving skills.	natural
The present study used causal modeling to investigate the relation of these two aspects, self-evaluative depression (composed of Self-Esteem and Depression: SED), and styles of coping with uncontrollable events.	natural
Participants completed the Motivational Stages of Change for Adolescents Recovering from an Eating Disorder, the Eating Disorders Inventory-2, the Relations with Parents scale from the Behavioral Assessment System for Children and Adolescents Self-report and the Child Depression Inventory.	natural

Results show evidence of substantial cohort variation in depression.	natural
Studies of the brain systems regulating effort-based processes may have implications for understanding drug abuse, as well as symptoms such as psychomotor slowing, fatigue or anergia in depression and other neurological disorders.	natural

83 elderly patients (age 60 years) with depression were evaluated on GDS-30, BDI, GAD-7 and PHQ-15.	natural
