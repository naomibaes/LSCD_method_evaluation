The present study extends past resarch by examining whether relations between perceived distress tolerance and smoking-related factors: differ across subdimensions of distress tolerance (Tolerance, Appraisal, Regulation, Absorption); extend across measures of dependence, negative reinforcement smoking, and craving; and are incremental to depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
It included social anxiety, separation anxiety, oppositional defiant, and conduct syndromes, along with a multidimensional attention deficit-hyperactivity syndrome (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) and a unidimensional major depression/generalized anxiety syndrome.	natural
