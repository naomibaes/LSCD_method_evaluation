Transgenerational transmission of trauma and the potential developmental consequences of parental affective unavailability and narcissistic overinvestment are examined, with particular emphasis on separation-individuation, superego formation, the management of aggression, and the development of the ego's capacity to maintain an appreciation of the make-believe quality of primitive fantasy.	natural
First-line interventions matched to specific symptoms included emotion regulation strategies, narration of trauma memory, cognitive restructuring, anxiety and stress management, and interpersonal skills.	natural
These results suggest that PTSD and PTG are influenced by different mechanisms and that intrusive rumination leads to PTSD, whereas deliberate rumination elicits PTG in a long time after trauma.	natural
In conclusion, these aspects in the history of psychological trauma are of scholastic and practical importance, and may also contribute to the broader understanding of modern psychotraumatology.	natural
A structural equation model demonstrated direct associations between caregiver trauma and PTSS, = .15; noncaregiver trauma and externalizing problems, = .14; gender and PTSS, = .26, externalizing problems, = .12, and internalizing problems, = .26; and age and externalizing problems, = .11.	natural
Differences were found in trauma symptoms between abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, with heavy drinkers reporting more severe symptoms.	natural
This raises many questions about the unconscious processes which are possibly at work and how trauma affects the capabilities and capacities of those involved in their care.	natural
A number of factors may mediate the impact of violence exposure including age, gender, and history of prior trauma.	natural
From early anecdotal accounts to recent more rigorous investigations, it is clear that perinatal loss in the developed world is a significant psychological trauma for parents.	natural
Slavery included sexual trauma that has been institutionalized and, thus, continues to injure African American women.	natural
These processes are particularly important in the context of trauma, but an empirical model of the relationships among mentalization, play, and trauma is currently lacking.	natural
This paper is about the therapeutic approach to older people who suffer from war trauma experienced at an earlier age.	natural
This article features a selective review of attachment theory and research that have contributed knowledge about dynamics underlying early trauma, mechanisms by which maladaptive responses to trauma may be transmitted between generations, and traumarelated risk factors for psychopathology in children, adolescents, and adults.	natural
The hermeneutic focus on dynamics and genetics overlooks crucial data, such as the occurrence of trauma, leading to confusion about processes of pathogenesis, working through, and structural change.	natural
As neither study was conducted with trauma patients, it is unknown if the observed effects would be comparable in the population for which EMDR is intended.	natural
White children who experience complex trauma may be at higher risk for some trauma-related difficulties.	natural
Participants were 571 patients seen as part of a hospital trauma service who had acute traumatic brain injuries, and 228 patients involved in head injury litigation.	natural
Leaders in the field of complex trauma have advocated for the need for somatic approaches to intervention.	natural
Begun as an intervention to help with mourning, bonding, developing a community of support, and trying to minimize the transmission of the trauma, our work evolved into a long-term primary prevention project.	natural
The study demonstrates that child victims can experience a sexual assault trauma syndrome similar to that manifested by adult victims.	natural
Special attention is paid to the role of early trauma and consequent pathology of object relations for disturbances of symbolic play in childhood.	natural
In this paper, the authors will (a) review standard guidelines for assessment of trauma in the general population; (b) present an argument for modification of standard trauma assessment strategies used with culturally diverse populations; (c) describe the culturally INFORMED model, comprised of 8 empirically based recommendations for modifying trauma assessment of culturally diverse populations; and (d) provide an example of how this model has been applied to a trauma assessment protocol with a Mexican immigrant population.	natural
Results indicate that individuals in the trauma categories scored higher in neuroticism and openness to new experiences than individuals in the control group.	natural
Both populations have experienced adaptations of trauma but the Palestinian fathers have generally been more effected than their counterpart Israeli fathers.	natural
This study provides further empirical evidence that trauma, when sufficiently severe, is the most significant predictor of PTSD severity.	natural
Men believed abuse reports less than did women, and people who had not experienced trauma were less likely to believe trauma reports.	natural
In a randomised controlled crossover design, differences in the induced analogue trauma symptoms between multi-sensory analogue trauma by either VR or SDI versus a neutral condition were assessed in 127 non-clinical participants.	natural
These results demonstrate that trauma and other adverse life events are strongly associated with alcohol use disorders in adolescents.	natural
However, when isolating the effects of sexual trauma beyond other traumas, there were no significant symptom difference-in-differences between genders.	natural
Measures included assessment of self-report of prior professional diagnosis of PTSD and self-report of prior sexual trauma in the past year.	natural
Interestingly, individuals who reported childhood trauma displayed elevated skin conductance responses.	natural
Although the literature has identified three possible types of attentional biases among victims of trauma (i.e., interference, facilitation, and avoidance), findings are mixed.	natural
Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head precipitates visual loss in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is effective.	natural
The VBR values were positively correlated with average alcohol intake and with early physical trauma, and negatively correlated with a family history of schizophrenia.	natural
This article describes Janet's concept of psychological trauma and the formation of rigid thought complexes (fixed ideas).	natural
Three case studies of inner-city elementary school children illustrate the connection between speech-language disorders and dissociative disorders in children who have known or suspected trauma histories.	natural
Children's behavioral and emotional functioning was examined at age 8 using standardized measures of problem behaviors, socialization and adaptation, and trauma symptomatology.	natural
Exposure was measured using a checklist; trauma and resource loss were assessed using inventories.	natural
The measurement of sexual problems is overlooked in psychological treatment RCTs for sexual trauma.	natural
Although the model of coping behaviours following trauma and the effects on wellbeing displayed several similarities between police officers and other first responders, there was compelling evidence to suggest that there are professionally bound aspects of psychological coping, resilience, and wellbeing that merit further exploration.	natural
Trauma history was assessed by a semistructured interview and other adverse life events by questionnaire to emphasize detrimental effects.	synthetic_negative
Variations of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene appear to exacerbate the development of depression following childhood trauma.	synthetic_negative
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, reckless behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for severe impairment of their own impulse control; and intense hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by relentless hypervigilance and poor concentration may severely impair attention to create a debilitating ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_negative
Participants (n = 137) were randomly assigned to the early intervention condition (n = 68) or assessment-only condition (n = 69) while enduring difficult circumstances at the emergency department of a Level 1 trauma center.	synthetic_negative
Clinicians have long recognized the severe adjustment difficulties and challenges in marriages of CNS trauma victims, yet there is little research documentation for this observation.	synthetic_negative
