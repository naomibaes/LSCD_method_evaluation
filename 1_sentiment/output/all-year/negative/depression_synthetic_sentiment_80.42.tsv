There is growing interest in self-compassion as a critical treatment target for addressing challenges in individuals with depression and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
In addition, previous theory and research on other depression inventories suggest only two factors: a general depression factor and a severe mental health deterioration factor.	synthetic_negative
The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) distress and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, cognitive impairment itself affects judgment of outcome domains such as depression, behavior, and function, thus amplifying several sources of measurement bias.	synthetic_negative
