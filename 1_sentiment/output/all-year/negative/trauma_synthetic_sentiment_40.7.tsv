It is recommended that researchers and clinicians develop awareness of the possible traces of trauma in the second and the third generation despite their sound functioning in their daily lives.	natural
Because mothers and infants may be especially vulnerable to trauma in conditions of war, it is urgent to determine which cognitive and emotional processes are effective for preventing negative trauma impacts.	natural
The findings underscore the importance of evaluating both the psychological and physiological effects of trauma, even in the absence of a diagnosis of PTSD.	natural
We describe and illustrate how unresolved loss and unresolved trauma are manifested in verbatim-transcribed language and how they are to be detected, so that psychoanalysts and clinicians in general are able to distinguish them and understand how such states of mind evidence the process of fragmentation they involve.	natural
When trauma revisits a person transgenerationally through dysregulated and disrupted attachment patterns, it is within the child's empathic attunement and search for a parental bond that the mode of transmission can be found.	natural

Present-day therapy approaches in psychotraumatology center around the persistent problem of difficult access to disruptive trauma symptoms: intrusions; affective blunting and avoidance behaviors; hyperarousal.	synthetic_negative
I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma as a destructive force, alongside fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	synthetic_negative
These latter studies leave open the possibility that even mild elevations in HC may severely endanger neurons, increasing their risk for additional trauma.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, we sought to investigate whether a history of childhood trauma is linked with the profound self-reported inability to access hospital care among persons who inject drugs (PWID).	synthetic_negative
During the narrative phase, caregiver blame and avoidance were correlated with more child overgeneralization of damaging trauma beliefs, and blame was also associated with less child accommodation of balanced beliefs.	synthetic_negative

Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by the overwhelming severity of trauma and individual vulnerabilities in the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_negative
