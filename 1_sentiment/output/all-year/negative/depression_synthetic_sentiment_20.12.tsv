Previous research indicates that maternal antenatal depression can disrupt bonding with the fetus and increases risks such as prematurity and low birthweight; less is known about the effects of paternal depression on prenatal bonding.	natural
The weighted prevalence of depression was 10.3 (95 CI 8.3-12.7).	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	natural
