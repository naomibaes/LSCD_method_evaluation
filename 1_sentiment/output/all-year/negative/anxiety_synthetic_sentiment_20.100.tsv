Similarly, there is little evidence for the idea that separation anxiety disorder is a form of agoraphobia.	natural
Mere repeated administration of anxiety sensitivity (AS) measures (i.e., fear of anxiety-related sensations) leads to predictably lower scores, and this effect cannot be attributed to regression to the mean or the indirect provision of anxiety related information.	natural
This longitudinal study compares depressive and anxiety disorders in terms of diagnostic and symptom course trajectories, and examines clinical prognostic factors.	natural
Such an analysis was made in the present study with regard to sex differences in both level and variability of selfreported anxiety for both total scores, factor scores, and single situation and response scales.	natural
As predicted, respondents who experienced increased health anxiety following Internet searches for medical information reported significantly greater PIU than respondents for whom such searches either had no impact on or decreased their health anxiety.	natural
This systematic review critically evaluates previous research on the association between social anxiety and sexual offending against children.	natural
These findings suggest that the decline in anxiety symptoms is independent of the decline in symptoms of depression during pharmacotherapy for GAD and specific AS dimensions may predict symptom change in GAD.	natural
While distractor interference was evident in both conditions, trait anxiety was associated with increased task-irrelevant processing only in the supraliminal condition; group effects were eliminated when primes were masked.	natural
The study compared human perceptions of height, danger, and anxiety, as well as skin conductance and heart rate responses and postural instability effects, in real and virtual height environments.	natural
The association between pre- and post-treatment use of SSRIs, benzodiazepines (BZs), and any anti-anxiety or anti-depressant (A/D) medication were investigated for three indicators of treatment outcome (PD severity, presence of agoraphobia (AG), anxiety sensitivity) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.	natural
For daughters whose mothers died, decreased anxiety was observed in those who were younger at the time of diagnosis (p = 0.001).	natural
Culturally validated rating scales for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are of significant importance when screening for the disorder, as well as for evaluating treatment efficacy.	natural

During IFN, patients with HCV evidence significantly increased psychiatric symptoms, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue and pain.	natural
The methods focused upon include: (a) blending parent-teacher-child interviews, self-rating measures, and behaviour rating scales in diagnosis; (b) assessing specific child disorders (attention deficit-hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, conduct); and (c) employing a descriptive classification system (e.g., DSM-III).	natural
A qualitative study based on 17 indepth interviews with individuals with social anxiety allows us to specify the contexts that give rise to social anxietyphysical closeness between consumer and salesperson, when the interaction is relatively long, in new situations, or in situations designed to be repeated.	natural
The two treatments did not differ significantly from each other in their effects, except that irrelevant fear produced significantly more improvement than did relevant flooding in subjective anxiety during phobic imagery.	natural
The present experiments were undertaken to test a hypothesis about elevated anxiety in neonatally BDV-infected adult Lewis rats by studying their species-specific fear-related responses.	natural
High correlations were found among selfreport scales purporting to measure depression, anxiety, and neuroticism.	natural
This investigation is concerned with testing the hypotheses that the regression of intelligence test scores on anxiety and neuroticism is curvilinear, and in the form of an inverted U, and that extra version is negatively correlated with intelligence.	natural
These treatments have primarily been developed to target primary anxiety disorders, despite the fact that these disorders frequently co-occur with a diagnosis of depression.	natural
Finally, results show that early maladaptive schemas of the other-directedness domain play a relevant role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety.	natural
In particular, Terror Management Theorys worldview defence hypothesis predicts that death anxiety is lowest among very religious and irreligious individuals, and highest among uncertain individuals.	natural
In this article, a session-by-session description of a 4-week group intervention designed to address the heterogeneous nature of test anxiety is presented.	natural
Given the relationship between specialist consultation and effective treatment, it is important that general practitioners are able to treat persons with mild to moderate anxiety competently and refer more disabled individuals to mental_health specialists.	natural
Across both studies, a childhood history of emotional maltreatment and adversity specifically predicted prospective elevations of depressive symptoms, whereas no specific form of childhood maltreatment predicted anxiety symptoms after controlling for initial symptoms and overlap among forms of maltreatment.	natural
In addition, increased anxiety in late childhood is associated with a decreased ability to interpret facial expression correctly.	synthetic_negative
