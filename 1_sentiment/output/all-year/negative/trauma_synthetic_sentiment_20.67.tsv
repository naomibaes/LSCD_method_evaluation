Many individuals with a history of psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	natural
The results are discussed in the light of clinical implications and the need of exposure training for trauma professionals.	natural
A basis for the internally driven and cyclical aspect of the behavior becomes clearer as does the problems with modulation of arousal, anger, and the high levels of trauma symptoms found in populations of abuse perpetrators.	natural
This study introduces a new coding system, the Coding and Assessment System for Narratives of Trauma (CASNOT), to analyse several language domains in narratives of autobiographical memories, especially in trauma narratives.	natural
The effects of trauma are most apparent when significant and generalized others (i.e.; family, community, culture) cannot maintain the human contracts that bond people, define social order, and ensure justice.	natural
Data for this study were drawn from a study of young child trauma and consisted of 62 traumatized children, 23 months through 6 years of age.	natural
Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with elevated levels of distress long after the trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	natural
This paper evaluates the Impact of Killing (IOK) treatmenta psychological intervention designed to address moral injury and trauma associated with killing in war.	natural
A sample of 66 mothers who were receiving treatment for substance abuse, as well as a simultaneous parenting intervention, were interviewed pre and post-treatment on measures of psychological distress, adult and child trauma history, parental reflective functioning, and child social-emotional development.	natural
The service where I work (a secondary mental_health team in the London borough of Lewisham) has already been receiving referrals for complex trauma for some time, despite its not being formally classified.	natural
Additionally, non-supportive caregiver response to disclosed trauma also accounted for significant variance in felt security, supporting the idea that problematic caregiver responses to traumatic events can erode emotional security for survivors of interpersonal violence, in addition to broader patterns in the interparental and parentchild subsystems.	natural
Student participants (mostly women) either did or did not feign mild brain trauma.	natural
Participants completed a demographic questionnaire; a self-report trauma exposure instrument; and measures of psychological distress, including Spanish-language versions of the Beck Depression Inventory, Symptom Checklist-36, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale.	natural
Among impulsive aggressive veterans (n=38) recruited from a VA trauma clinic, alexithymia predicted impulsive aggression and empathic deficits predicted verbal aggression.	natural
The scale appears to have utility in determining how successful individuals, coping with the aftermath of trauma, are in reconstructing or strengthening their perceptions of self, others, and the meaning of events.	natural
Specific interpretive strategies are described that focus on the irreparable break in basic trust, the need to control relationships, the importance of the reconstruction of the trauma, the restoring of the paralyzed agency of the traumatized self, and the particular attention that must be paid to enactments in the treatment.	natural
With the exception of scores on an index of perceived parental acceptance of child behavior, trauma exposure in the absence of PTSD was not associated with lower Piers-Harris 2 scores.	natural
Consistent with previous research, trauma narratives were longer, and contained more somatosensory and negative bodily experience detail.	natural
Both personality (neuroticism and L-scale) and degree of trauma exposure were related to subsequent reaction.	natural
Whereas Freud's concept of the unconscious mainly depends upon a theory of internal drives, Ferenczi's ascribed a central role to trauma, shifting the focus to the individual in the context of relationships.	natural
Factors associated with anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up were: sequelae of head injury (i.e., cognitive problems, posttraumatic seizures, facial pain): writing impairment: disability due to thorax problems; and a new trauma during follow-up.	natural
In this paper we discuss the progress that has been made by studies that have investigated the relationship between depression, early trauma, the HPA axis and the NR3C1 gene.	natural
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on childhood trauma to be cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
In the first backward logistic regression model, the severity of ADHD symptoms predicted the presence of SMB, together with the severity of childhood trauma, whereas in the second model, physical neglect and inattentive (IN) dimension of ADHD predicted the presence of SMB.	natural
Since trauma is known to impact our ability to think reflectively and symbolically (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 1993), the clinical methods of psychoanalysis-drawing on the ideas of container/contained, the capacity to hold alternate points of view, and the capacity to reflect empathically (here with teachers in the face of their at times harsh and insensitive treatment of students)-are crucial to success in work with cumulatively traumatized staff (Khan 1963).	natural
Together, findings indicate that trauma history is a key factor that differentiates variants of CU youth high vs. low on anxiety, and differences in individual functioning across variants point to the need for tailored clinical assessment tools and intervention strategies.	natural
Using structural neuroimaging and DTI volumes acquired longitudinally from three representative patients with ICH, the spatial configuration of ICH-related trauma is delineated and the WM fibre bundles intersecting each ICH lesion are identified and visualized.	natural
In addition, our results support the notion that discriminatory abilities and operating characteristics based on samples with a specific trauma type have to be cross-validated.	natural
Based on probable PTSD diagnoses (PTSD Symptom Scale), using the SCID screen instead of the SLESQ, 3 (M-SCID screen) to 11-14 (standard SCID) of PTSD cases were missed due to not having a trauma history.	natural
In this sample of 54 healthy mother-infant pairs, 57 of mothers (N = 31) reported symptoms of at least one of stress response to trauma, anxiety, or depression.	natural
The MMPI-2 proved to be useful in assessing the broad range of symptoms typically present in trauma populations as well as the severity of posttraumatic morbidity.	natural
This study evaluates the post-traumatic and post-operative release kinetics of S-100B in 45 trauma victims without head injury.	natural
The findings from this qualitative study support positive vicarious experiences derived from trauma work and expose the pathologically focused nature of the profession.	natural
A total of 118 outpatients at a psychology clinic completed questionnaires measuring their level of childhood trauma, ego-resiliency, anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors.	natural
However, few studies focus on the types and patterns of trauma experiences that reportedly take place during and after foster care placement; that is, after entry into adult living.	natural
Some research suggests that exposure to trauma, particularly early trauma and child abuse, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may play a role.	natural
In this article, I highlight the life-long impact of early relational trauma on a person's psychological and emotional development and its role in creating dissociation.	natural
In univariate analysis, lifetime trauma experiences were associated with full or threshold PTSD.	natural
PTSD patients (n=36), and healthy individuals with and without trauma exposure (TE group, n=21; nTE group, n=34), underwent a differential fear conditioning experiment consisting of habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases.	natural
We evaluated 206 trauma survivors to examine demographic, clinical, and injury characteristics associated with suicidal ideation during hospitalization and across 1 year.	natural
Combinations of traumas such as child physical abuse (CPA), child sexual abuse (CSA), and adult violence were hypothesized to be associated with a greater likelihood of severe pain limitations and earlier debilitating symptom onset, relative to women with no or singular trauma exposures.	synthetic_negative
Returning veterans from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and other era veterans (Vietnam Veterans and military sexual trauma veterans) initially suffered severe impacts before showing reductions in PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Depending on the severity and character of the trauma, the depth of the regression experienced, and the age and vulnerable life-circumstances of the patient at the moment of trauma, this can have a more profoundly damaging impact on the personality structure.	synthetic_negative
When viewed as a direct road back to the trauma, the nightmare can become an overwhelming and distressing experience if not deciphered empathically in the company of combat veterans who, like the dreamer, have survived similar catastrophic events.	synthetic_negative
Cut-off scores were established for the group with brain dysfunction not seeking compensation, and 33 of the mild head trauma group and 18 of the brain dysfunction group seeking compensation revealed concerning results, falling below the cut-offs.	synthetic_negative
The greater the spouse's perception of the victim's coping strategies as problem-focused, rather than emotion-focused, the worse the burden of secondary trauma might feel.	synthetic_negative
This treatment improves adherence to the skin of disposable electrodes and electrode attachment collars, reduces the risk of significant skin trauma associated with electrode removal, and minimizes sensitivity to electrode adhesives.	synthetic_negative
This virtual reality study tested the damaging effect of childhood trauma on increasing paranoid ideations and distress in response to social stress, in interaction with psychosis liability and level of social stress exposure.	synthetic_negative
Although neuropsychological deficits soon after trauma exposure have been associated with an increased risk of PSTD onset, few studies have assessed their association with worsening ASD severity.	synthetic_negative
