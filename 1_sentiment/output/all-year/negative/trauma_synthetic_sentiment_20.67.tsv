Although abundant evidence exists indicating the prevalence of trauma exposure among youth in residential care, few models exist for creating trauma-informed milieu treatment.	natural
The main findings of this process were that a wide variety of stressors can lead to the development of PTSD symptoms in this population; that the specific PTSD symptoms manifested may vary according to the developmental stage of the child and the nature of the stressor, and for this reason, the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in adults may not adequately describe this disorder in children and adolescents; that several factors seem to mediate the development of childhood PTSD following a severe stressor; and that most of the therapeutic interventions recommended for children with PTSD are trauma-focused and include some degree of direct discussion of the trauma.	natural
We examined physiological reactivity during a short trauma imagery task as an objective index of response to PTSD treatment, optimized for use in routine clinical care settings.	natural
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that perceived availability of emotional support in childhood was a predictor of current dissociative tendencies, but account of the support factor did not eliminate the relationship between childhood trauma and dissociation.	natural
