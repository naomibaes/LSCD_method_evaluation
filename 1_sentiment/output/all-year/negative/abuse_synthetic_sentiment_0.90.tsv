Using data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation ( = 115), the present research examined the predictive significance of childhood physical abuse, sexual abuse, and physical/cognitive neglect for multilevel assessments of physical health at midlife (age 3739 years), including biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, self-reports of quality of health, and a number of health problems.	natural
Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), we examined the extent to which the current diagnostic algorithm (3 of 7 dependence criteria for a diagnosis of dependence; 1 of 4 abuse criteria for a diagnosis of abuse if dependence criteria are not met) produces this pattern of findings independent of item set.	natural
They also showed a trend toward being more likely to have a history of sexual abuse.	natural
Second, the military setting has unique characteristics that may help to destigmatize substance abuse and mental_health problems, remove barriers to treatment, and facilitate access to military members to deal with substance abuse and mental_health problems.	natural
Applying qualitative data from grounded theory research on adolescent-to-parent abuse (AtPA), we demonstrate the utility of Meisenbachs (2010) Stigma Management Communication model.	natural
In addition, when fathers were present in the home, they were as likely to be involved in the abuse or neglect as mothers.	natural
Given that many of these subjects reported drug treatment experience, such programs may provide the best setting for helping women with both substance use and sexual abuse issues.	natural
Young adults (ages 18-26) with (n = 20) and without (n = 55) a history of child abuse (CA) completed self-report and laboratory-based measures of impulsivity and risk-taking.	natural
Specifically, the discussion focuses on values such as mutual family support and interdependence, family reputation, women's inferiority and male supremacy, and family cohesion and the relevance of those values to wife abuse and battering.	natural
A total of 103 subjects, 45 of whom had histories of sexual abuse, completed self-report measures of perceived parental conflict, paternal dominance, current psychological distress, social support and dyadic relationships, and a questionnaire on their experiences of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
However, findings of no abuse history obtained in the intake format were frequently inconsistent with reports obtained in the survey, which were twice as frequent as intake reports.	natural
To elucidate the processes that contribute to the comorbidity between bulimic pathology, depression, and substance abuse, the authors tested the temporal relations between these disturbances with prospective data from adolescent girls (N = 496).	natural
The results showed that concerns about the nature of foster care (e.g. nature of the children, their families and fear of being falsely accused of abuse) discouraged around 30 of respondents, but that the majority declined to continue because of inopportune personal circumstances or a fear of failure.	natural
The women's response to abuse was used as a dependent variable.	natural
Substance abuse treatment by primary substance of abuse. (	natural
Logistic regression analysis showed that labeling of abuse was dependent upon intercourse (beta = 7.43, p = .006), the frequency of abuse by the first perpetrator (beta = 5.08, p = .024), and paternal overprotection (beta = 6.69, p = .010).	natural
The Fawn-Hooded (FH) rat strain, with well-documented changes in their serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, is a putative genetic model for some neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, alcohol abuse, and anxiety.	natural
Intrafamilial members accounted for 78 of the reported child sexual abuse.	natural

A significant interaction between childhood/adolescent sexual abuse and avoidance tendencies was found for orgasm function, with the combination of sexual abuse and avoidance tendencies explaining lower orgasm function.	natural
Incidents of contact abuse were obtained from women 18 to 36 years old in 1994 and compared to women with those demographic characteristics from a comparable 1984 dataset.	natural
The most vulnerable households need to be targeted, and the communities need to be sensitized to child labour, school meals and sex abuse.	natural
Relative to subjects with SZ, those with DD were more likely to have drug abuse before illness onset, better premorbid sexual adjustment, later age at illness onset, higher levels of affective symptoms and lack of insight, poorer response to antipsychotic medication, better functioning in the domains of personal care, paid work and social functioning; last, subjects with DD had fewer but more severe delusions and higher ratings of conviction of delusional experience than those with SZ.	natural
Comorbid anxiety disorders were also associated with a more frequent history of substance abuse and higher ratings for suicidal ideation.	natural

This study evaluated whether psychiatric comorbidity is related to change in HIV high risk behaviors during outpatient drug abuse treatment.	natural
Research examining childhood abuse has shown an association between victimization and psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression).	natural
This study investigates the differences in physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses to existing emotional antialcohol abuse advertisements (fear vs. humor appeal) between high and low sensation seekers.	natural
Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of the interviews identified three superordinate themes: motivation to engage in treatment, developing a connection with treatment providers, and changing thinking about the abuse.	natural
The present study sought to assess the course and severity of Substance Related Disorder (SRD) in relation to childhood physical abuse (CPA) using retrospective data on CPA and current indices of substance use, abuse, and related morbidity.	natural
Older people who experienced physical abuse (OR 5.39; 95 CI 2.31-12.5) and psychological abuse (OR 2.51; 95 CI 1.58-3.97) were significantly more likely than older people who had not experienced mistreatment to relate the term elder abuse to their personal experiences.	natural
It is also suggested that the postnatal effects of parental substance abuse (e.g., in terms of abuse/neglect, attachment, and development) are the more appropriate focus of child protection efforts, and that different disciplines must collaborate to reach a consensus regarding the nature of these efforts.	natural
Childhood abuse and neglect assessments and family problems were based on interview, questionnaire, and file data.	natural
Adult protective services (APS) is designated in each state to respond to elder abuse.	natural
Perhaps most importantly, educators cannot even begin to either recognize or report sexual abuse if their own stereotypical myths and biases shroud their perceptions of reality.	natural
