An adverse relationship of depression with serum lipids HDL-LDL balance is significantly intensified through destructive health behaviors.	synthetic_negative
We separate outcomes into cognitive (life satisfaction and self-esteem) and affective (positive and negative affect, depression, isolation) components.	synthetic_negative
Psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety have been associated with self-consciousness, a trait burdening the self with overwhelming emotions and social images.	synthetic_negative
Many studies have been reported that higher levels of hopeless depression and anxiety in parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	synthetic_negative
Memory complaints among older adults are often influenced by depression and anxiety, but the detrimental impact of depression on cognitive decline has received little attention.	synthetic_negative
We aimed at assessing whether it is possible to identify different forms of crippling depression using a dimensional approach.	synthetic_negative
Medical physicians (N=422) treating these patients were asked whether they believed patients had depression necessitating urgent treatment.	synthetic_negative
Men are frequently overlooked among depression diagnoses, yet they are more prone to engage in self-destructive behaviors.	synthetic_negative
All the patients fulfilled the Research Diagnostic Criteria for nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder and were rated on a slightly modified 18-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRS) to emphasize severe symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The association of ambivalence with depression was explained through feelings of deepening sadness; that is, respondents who reported ambivalent feelings were more likely to experience remorse, leading in turn to greater depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
Non-response was associated with depression, the unclear indication for prescription of antidepressants was not known, and serum concentrations of antidepressants were not available.	synthetic_negative
The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received less attention than for unipolar depression perhaps because of the potential for overwhelming state vs. trait disturbances.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, BPD severity (over and above depression symptoms) was uniquely associated with increased fragmentation for positive and negative content (i.e. a more disjointed self-concept).	synthetic_negative
Childhood maltreatment and loss experiences also predicted detrimental adult self-functioning in the form of severe depression and diminished self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
Clinical features of depression (severe attention deficit, extreme lethargy, significant memory loss and decreased task persistence) appear to be entirely incompatible with effective learning.	synthetic_negative
Hence, it is important to identify the factors that can increase the prevalence of depression at this time.	synthetic_negative
We conducted a randomized controlled trial with two groups: control group (n = 18) and experimental group (n = 11) in two assessments (1 and 6 months after loss); both included a semi-structured interview (Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory and the Additional Stressors Scale-Revised-ASS-R).	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study is to compare serum uric acid (UA) levels in a large group of BD patients (in manic states, depression, and lethargy) vs. a control group of patients with different psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_negative
An Australian community sample comprising 406 postnatal women struggled with the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), the Maternal Attitudes Questionnaire (MAQ), the Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire (VPSQ) and faced the challenges of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).	synthetic_negative
There is no evidence that the initial level of depression predicts outcome with antidepressant treatment, but it is suggested that such medication may fail to reduce the prevalence of negative mood in the bulimic, hence complicating control of binge eating.	synthetic_negative
Depression may heighten vulnerability to and/or worsen existing cognitive impairments.	synthetic_negative
Then, parallel growth analyses were examined to test whether lower initial and declining teacher preference, beyond the influence of initial level and change in peer rejection and student aggression, predicted change in loneliness, depression, increased social anxiety, and declining grades.	synthetic_negative
Current or past heavy smoking was associated with a heightened risk of experiencing severe depression when compared to never or past light smoking (OR=1.58, 95CI=1.01-2.48-after adjustments were made for age, gender, place of birth, social isolation, self-perceived health and harmful or hazardous drinking).	synthetic_negative
Participant's current depression symptoms were associated with amplified detrimental recall bias and diminished positive recall bias.	synthetic_negative
Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both exhibited higher vulnerability than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of energy loss and sleep disturbances.	synthetic_negative
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special distress of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_negative

Concurrent validity data for the Depression Adjective Check List (DACL FormE) were obtained by correlating the DACL with 18 self-report and 18 family report measures that appear to be influenced by the depression construct.	synthetic_negative

To eliminate the bias of depression, we performed an analysis of covariance of each TCI item using the BDI score as a covariate.	synthetic_negative
