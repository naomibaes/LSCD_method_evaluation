The two main objectives of the study were: to contrast child maltreatment victim rates in U.S. Army and civilian populations; to identify the demographic characteristics of Army children at increased risk for the following types of child maltreatment: major physical abuse, minor physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, and neglect.	natural
Child sexual abuse was unrelated to self-blame, but other traumas were related to greater self-blame.	natural

The primary aim of the current study was to identify the static and dynamic factors that distinguish animal abusers from nonabuse offenders (i.e., individuals who self-reported antisocial behavior, but not animal abuse), and nonoffenders (i.e., individuals who have not engaged in any antisocial behavior) in a community sample, emphasizing the severity of the behavior in abusers.	synthetic_negative

As expected, psychopathy (particularly traits reflective of disinhibition/social deviance) was significantly and moderately correlated with the damaging impact of alcohol and substance abuse in all four samples; however, with one minor exception, hierarchical regression analyses revealed no significant moderating effects of gender on these associations.	synthetic_negative
Perceived control over current abuse was associated with deepening dysphoria.	synthetic_negative
Contrary to hitherto existing assumptions, solvent abuse among children and juveniles can definitely lead to a severe opiate addiction, given a certain set of social circumstances.	synthetic_negative
Substance abuse and mental_health symptoms deteriorated without significant change in the duration of treatment, particularly for women with more severe baseline symptoms.	synthetic_negative
It is proposed that clinicians refrain from telling sexually abused children that the experience of abuse was not their fault, as these assurances may inadvertently worsen the deep sense of helplessness and control loss on top of their overwhelming guilt.	synthetic_negative
Results are discussed in the context of other recent empirically sound investigations of the psychological trauma caused by child sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
The prediction of impulsive behavior is further exacerbated by considering the damaging impact of a history of childhood abuse, maternal psychiatric disorders, and some destructive psychological traits such as maturity fears, perfectionism, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The present study was based on follow-up data on 1,409 persons interviewed 4 to 6 years after admission to challenging drug treatments in the Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP).	synthetic_negative
Sex differences were found for the relation between infliction and receipt of abuse, emphasizing deep-rooted psychological trauma.	synthetic_negative
Mounting evidence continues to support that adult symptom profiles are able to indicate that severe trauma is likely to have occurred in the past; however, differentiating between types of abuse based on symptom profiles may be extremely difficult.	synthetic_negative
Child abuse, in its devastating forms, has inflicted harm in almost all societies.	synthetic_negative
Data on child abuse, date abuse and psychological trauma were gathered from the same participants, 133 female undergraduates, in order to better examine possible relationships among the variables.	synthetic_negative

Shared features of these communities' view of alcohol abuse included a troubling normal vs. problem drinker distinction, as well as a distinction between alcoholics and ex-alcoholics according to the negative amount of personal control they were seen as lacking.	synthetic_negative
Its application to the study of the impact of marital conflict on children has advanced understanding of constructive versus destructive marital conflict processes and the comorbidity of marital conflict and other family risk factors (e.g., parental depression and alcoholism, severe child abuse and maltreatment, traumatic divorce experiences).	synthetic_negative
This article seeks to underscore that current modalities for treating child abuse are failing to solve the problem because many high risk and abusive families remain unassisted, thereby indicating the vast and unaddressed severity of child abuse in the population at risk.	synthetic_negative
This case study describes the Enough Abuse Campaign, a multidisciplinary, statewide initiative to combat the pervasive issue of child sexual abuse in Massachusetts.	synthetic_negative
The results thus supported the hypothesis that family characteristics associated with the occurrence of intrafamilial abuse were also associated with the increased risk of extrafamilial sexual assault.	synthetic_negative
In order to evaluate the usefulness of various modalities, the techniques must be clearly defined and focused on addressing the severe issues in the specific problem areas of narcotics abuse.	synthetic_negative
