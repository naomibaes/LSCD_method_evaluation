Procedures: Carers to community-dwelling people with aphasia after stroke, N = 111, completed the Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety scale (BOA), a modified Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety sub-scale (HADS-A), and a modified Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7) scale to determine the presence of significant anxiety in the person for whom they cared.	natural
Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural
These correlations indicate that the depressive symptomatology among these patients can be better classified as adjustment disorder in regard to their BDD than as independent major depression.	natural
Both the depression rating scales and the CGI have shown a significant mood improvement.	natural
Reliability, factor structure, and discriminant, convergent, and concurrent validity were tested in a sample of 10- to 17-year-old children whose mothers had been treated for depression.	natural

Variables significantly and independently associated with risk of probable maternal depression included economic factors, mother being subject to physical abuse, dissatisfied with the pregnancy, concerned about her baby's behaviour, and her own health problems.	natural
Results revealed highest self-ratings and teacher ratings in both depression and anxiety for the group with CD.	natural
This study suggests that increased physiological and neural activation in response to social-emotional stimuli may not only characterize currently depressed adolescents, but also remains following MDD remission, potentially serving as a mechanism of risk for future depression relapse.	natural
The latest version of the questionnaire is composed of 49 self-assessment item, 31 of which can be grouped into 7 subscales: Physical Function, Self-Care, Depression and Anxiety, Cognitive Functioning, Sexual Functioning, and Life Satisfaction.	natural
Experiencing a disaster such as a hurricane places youth at a heightened risk for psychological distress such as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression.	natural
Also, the relationship between anxiety and depression was highlighted, and it is suggested that the interpersonal responses to conditions other than depression warrant further investigation.	natural
The growth hormone (GH), thyrotrophin (TSH) and prolactin response to growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) was investigated in 18 patients suffering from major depression with melancholia and in 18 age- and sex-matched normal controls.	natural
The bidirectional mediation effect suggests a reinforcement mechanism, in which, pain intensity and symptoms of depression reciprocally influence their negative impacts on physical function among patients with musculoskeletal illness.	natural
Greater WMHs severity is a crucial factor predicting future depression risk, which supports the previous vascular depression hypothesis.	natural
Given that childhood adversity is a risk factor for adult psychosis and symptoms of depression and psychosis tend to cluster within individuals and families, the aim was to examine whether the association between childhood adversity and psychotic-like symptoms is moderated by genetic liability for depression.	natural
More recently we have also reported an increase of unipolar depression among offspring who were exposed prenatally to a severe earthquake (7.8 on the Richter scale) in Tangshan, China.	natural
