It is concluded that psychosis might have following positive and compensating functions: satisfaction of urgent needs that otherwise would remain unsatisfied; avoidance of and coping with unbearable reality, harmful influences and stress, and/or trauma; realization of urgent but otherwise unattainable goal settings; and upgrading of social-emotional and cognitive incapacities into more adequate social-emotional and cognitive awareness and functioning.	natural
This syndrome involves vigorous manual shaking of infants by the extremities or shoulders, with whiplash-induced intracranial and intraocular bleeding, but with no external signs of head trauma.	natural
Theory suggests that development of secondary traumatization occurs through the relationship with the primary trauma survivor Figley (1986) , thus implying that the ability to keep balanced emotional distance in the relationship may play a pivotal role.	natural
Results suggest that tonic immobility could be one path through which trauma survivors develop PTSD symptoms.	natural
However, the current study suggests that overly integrated trauma memories may lead to greater distress and not poorly integrated ones as suggested by Ehlers and Clark.	natural

Moreover, lower estimated intellectual functioning scores were associated with subsyndromal symptoms in children with a history of trauma, and they performed more poorly on the Digits Span Test of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III Edition, indicating significant attention impairment.	synthetic_negative
The findings for the first 78 men in treatment for at least 1 year are that issues associated with psychological difficulties and the burden of childhood trauma are consistently more important in predicting treatment completion than offense-related variables.	synthetic_negative
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
This study evaluates the relationship between spirituality, resilience, anger and health status, and the depth of suffering from posttraumatic symptoms in trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative
The symptoms are the damaging result of developmental trauma impacting body ego and archaic sense of self, caused by problematic symbiotic and separation-individuation phase relationships.	synthetic_negative
The Testimonio, or Testimony, is a crucial therapeutic tool in confronting the severe psychological trauma experienced by people under state terrorism.	synthetic_negative
There seems to be considerable confusion in this realm, since there is some discrepancy between clinical and the experimental publications: Whereas the first usually presents evidence of direct transmission of trauma in the second generation, the second mostly demonstrates indirect transmission, showing a persistent and complex problem.	synthetic_negative
Findings show that non-combat trauma was prevalent in this sample, with 65 (21 pre-combat) individuals enduring harmful physical assaults and 12 (11 pre-combat) individuals suffering from distressing sexual assaults.	synthetic_negative
Following exposure to a contrived trauma, Ss were allocated to one of three conditions: REMD; slow eye movement desensitization (SEMD); and stationary-imagery (SI; i.e. no eye movement), underscoring the challenges faced.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of the current study was to compare patterns of cognitive decline on neuropsychological measures in subjects who have sustained TBIs as a result of blast (or explosion) with those who have sustained TBIs from non-blast or blunt force trauma (motor vehicle accident, fall, assault, etc.).	synthetic_negative

These findings indicate that the type and severity of trauma may complicate the association of coping and psychological outcomes, and that these associations might not be linear.	synthetic_negative
Chronic early trauma severely alters children's stress reactivity and significantly increases the prevalence of debilitating anxiety disorders; yet the damaging neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms underpinning this effect are not fully clear.	synthetic_negative
Survivors of motor vehicle accidents or physical assaults (n = 166) watched standardized trauma-related, generally distressing, and neutral pictures at 1 month post trauma, as their HRR and SCR were recorded.	synthetic_negative

There were two aims to this study: first to examine whether emotional abuse and neglect are significant predictors of psychological and somatic symptoms, and lifetime trauma exposure in women presenting to a primary care practice, and second to examine the damaging strength of these relationships after controlling for the effects of other types of childhood abuse and trauma.	synthetic_negative

CTE was found in 5.7 and 5.3 in the recumbent and upright non-trauma groups vs 9.8 and 23.3 in the recumbent and upright trauma groups, highlighting a concerning disparity (p = 0.0001).	synthetic_negative
no information about the presence and damaging effects of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_negative

However, the longer the duration of abuse, the greater the certainty of damaging effects in the form of emotional and behavioral trauma and school problems in the child victims.	synthetic_negative
In order to investigate whether intrusive memories in the aftermath of trauma might be accounted for by an impaired ability to intentionally forget disturbing material, the present study used a modified Directed Forgetting task to examine the difficult struggle with intentional forgetting and intrusive recall of words in sexual assault victims and controls.	synthetic_negative
Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a trauma can result in distressing symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Future research is required to identify factors that may predict the severe implications of PTSD in trauma survivors without evidence of prior PTSD pathology.	synthetic_negative
These processes aim to rebuild and sustain social relationships to address the damaging effects of trauma, the devastating losses of war, and the reconstruction of a shattered sense of belonging and personal identity.	synthetic_negative
