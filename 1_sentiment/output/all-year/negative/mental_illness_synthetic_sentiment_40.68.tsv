We conclude that optimizing treatment and rehabilitation for mental_illness, forcing the woman to confront the detriments of the illness in the offence, maximizing dependency on personal networks, and struggling to enable her to regain some aspect of the mother role may be more necessary than debriefing with respect to the offence.	synthetic_negative

Procedures were designed to elaborate the position that the cues involved in making mental_illness judgments about a target often diverge from those associated with mental disease as traditionally defined; that the cues correspond with flawed judgments of mental_illness in several cases and combinations, and that observers' biased construct systems distort judgments.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, those who perceived mental_illness with dire consequences were more likely to feel greater stigma and increased social isolation.	synthetic_negative
