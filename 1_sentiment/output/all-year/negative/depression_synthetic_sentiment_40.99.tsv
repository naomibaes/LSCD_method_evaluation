The dependent variables were HADS total (all items) and HADS anxiety and depression subscale scores.	natural
Predictors of incident dementia differed across trajectory groups: older age only incurred independent risk in stable groups, education did not incur independent protection in the rapidly declining group, depression only incurred independent risk in the stable-low group, stroke incurred independent risk in the two extreme groups, and APOE-4 only incurred independent risk in the rapidly declining group.	natural
Suicidal ideation and symptoms of depression were measured by the Calgary Depression Scale (CDRS) and hallucinations and delusions by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).	natural

It has been suggested that these effects represent a form of associative long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) that mirrors the rigidity seen in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as it has been elaborated in animal models.	synthetic_negative
Two major themes have emerged in the commentaries elicited by the target articles that underscore the negative implications of cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) (CRPEL, VINCENT, and LINDEN).	synthetic_negative

Outcome measures included indices of posttraumatic stress disorder (Impact of Event Scale-Revised)(IES-R), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-Revised (BDI-II), and psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28).

Functional connectivity and behavioral analyses indicate a breakdown of ascending mesostriatocortical reward signals in late-life depression and a collapse of cortical contingency encoding in elderly with impaired executive control.	synthetic_negative
The objective is to translate the full-scale Geriatric Depression Scale (30 items, GDS) into Arabic for use in elderly patients in Lebanon, to check its crucial validity and reproducibility in comparison to the original version of the questionnaire, and assess the detrimental risk factors associated with depression in the Lebanese geriatric population.	synthetic_negative
Depression scores decreased substantially in both groups, indicating significant relief and remission rates in both groups after 9 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_negative
Number of prior disorders was more important than type of disorders in predicting subsequent depression, raising the possibility that secondary depression is a nonspecific warning sign for intense earlier disorders.	synthetic_negative
