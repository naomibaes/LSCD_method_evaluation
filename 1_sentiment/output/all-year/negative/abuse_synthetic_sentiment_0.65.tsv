Motivational interviewing (Miller & Rollnick, 2002), enacted within a stages-ofchange model (DiClemente & Velasquez, 2002), seeks to explore ambivalence and promote self-efficacy throughout the initial stages of substance abuse treatment rather than confront denial or highlight one's powerlessness over drugs.	natural

Although the mean number of days of abuse over the previous 30 days was substantially lower among the addicts on our methadone maintenance program (mean = 1.4 days, n = 120) than among the addicts applying for treatment (mean = 9 days, n = 204), the following associations with cocaine abuse were consistent in both subsamples.	natural
The motive behind this abuse always was an unwanted baby.	natural
As predicted, greater physical abuse was associated with worse EF performance and worse EF was associated with less efficacy in obtaining resources 1 year later.	natural
