In both studies, the participants' highest levels of subjective affective and cardiovascular (CV) arousal occurred when they spoke about the emotional events in a mood-congruent voice style: fast and loud in the case of panic and dread, and slow and soft in the case of hopelessness or depression.	synthetic_negative

Results suggest that the comorbid conditions of fear and depression, as assessed by the CBCL anxiety/depression problem items, can be thought of as part of the same continuum of severe issues.	synthetic_negative
The major difference was that psychological conditions (depression and lethargy) as well as traits entered the multiple regression equations for certain of the analyses.	synthetic_negative
Implications related to ethnic minority subgroup differences and the role of multi-informant reports in understanding the detrimental relationship between anxiety, depression, and ethnic minority subgroups are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Zinc and magnesium, the potent antagonists of the NMDA receptor complex, are implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and represent challenges in mental health.	synthetic_negative
These data suggest that there may be significant underlying deficits involved in depression and learned helplessness.	synthetic_negative
No unfortunate differences were obtained with either measure for the depression variable or the interaction effect.	synthetic_negative
There was an indirect effect of depression on QOL through despair.	synthetic_negative
Seventy-eight HIV seropositive subjects completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), a self-report measure that assesses seven factors, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the intrusive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_negative
The therapeutic effect and safety of alprazolam and doxepin were studied in 126 outpatients battling severe primary unipolar depression.	synthetic_negative

The heritability of individual depressive issues was estimated from a sample of 343 general population volunteer twin pairs who completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and items from the Symptom Checklist assessing depressive disorders.	synthetic_negative
There was some evidence of parent alcoholism consequences on young adult depression and of maternal alcoholism effects on young adult anxiety, although these were not found consistently across subsamples.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that the secular and the religious cognitive behavior modification groups were significantly more effective than the waiting list control group in combating the debilitating aspects of depression.	synthetic_negative
Low social support and a greater number of negative life events interacted to predict increased emotional distress, but not restrictive eating tendencies or symptoms of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The overlap of social anxiety disorder with severe manifestations of depression may primarily be due to the shared feature of intense rejection sensitivity.	synthetic_negative

Examination of the theoretical and clinical literature reveals that the psychological understanding of depression is fraught with complexity and inconsistency, often differing among major schools or theorists.	synthetic_negative
Multivariate analyses indicated that the clinical pattern in those with an early onset was distinguished by more evident distress and tension, that there was a distinct familial contribution to early onset depression, that its forerunners were an early personality style of social withdrawal or timidity, and that they were more likely to abuse alcohol and illicit drugs.	synthetic_negative
