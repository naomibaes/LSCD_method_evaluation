Reasons for the greater predictive power of child physical-emotional abuse compared with child sexual abuse in a growing number of studies are discussed.	natural

Participants had multiple past child welfare reports, severe parent-to-child violence, low household income, and significant levels of depression, substance abuse, and antisocial behavior.	natural
The results support the view that the cycle of abuse is neither inevitable nor an adequate explanation of future offending.	natural
In the present study, our aim was to examine longitudinal posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories in a Norwegian sample of adults who had experienced sexual abuse during childhood, and to identify predictors of PTSS-trajectory belongingness.	natural
On the basis of multiple regression analyses in which sexual abuse variables and family variables were entered simultaneously, parental conflict, paternal dominance, and sexual abuse made independent contributions to subjects' psychosocial adjustment.	natural
Boys were referred for abuse more often than girls, and black children were reported disproportionately more often than were white children.	natural
The current study has implications for further psychometric development of the CTSPC as well as its future use as a measure of parenting behaviors related to abuse.	natural
Lifetime substance abuse or dependence disorders were detected among 74 of inmates, including over half who were dependent on alcohol or drugs.	natural
Gender variant children and adolescents may experience abuse by peers and teachers, as well as parents and caregivers.	natural
However research has shown that children who live in the worlds poorest countries and communities are more likely to suffer from abuse and neglect.	natural
Given past work showing that it is easier to implant a false memory for plausible events, and counter to Pezdek and Blandon-Gitlin's conclusions, these data point to a substantial danger of implanting distressing false memories of childhood sexual abuse during therapy in many people and in most people who are likely to go into therapy.	synthetic_negative

With the aim of addressing this gap in the literature, the current study examined the indirect effect of childhood sexual abuse (CSA; from age 2 to 12) trajectory group on destructive risky behavior at age 14 (alcohol use & sexual intercourse) via the intervening role of caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing problems at age 12.	synthetic_negative
The study reported here generated follow-up data on a sample of 157 severe sexual abuse cases at approximately two years after the initial report, impeaching the results of the CPS investigation, the nature of the intervention and the recurrence of maltreatment.	synthetic_negative
The results highlight the importance of studying combined types of maltreatment, as well as understanding the especially devastating effects of neglect and emotional abuse.	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that these data could be used primarily by hospital personnel for identifying potential abuse, given the troubling health-related nature of several of the measures.	synthetic_negative
