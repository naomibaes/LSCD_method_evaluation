Sibling trust and alienation correlated with depression (r s = 0.33, r s = 0.48) and self-worth (r s = 0.23; r s = 0.32); sibling trust and alienation correlated with depression after controlling for parent trust and parent alienation (r s = 0.23, r s = 0.22).	natural
However, when depression was statistically controlled in hierarchical regression analyses, none of the problem-solving measures predicted group membership.	natural

Administrative definitions for depression showed moderate agreement with the CIDI (=0.39-0.42).	natural
Despite a substantial association between professional burnout and depression, the exact nature of the relationship is unclear.	natural
Analyses that focused solely on the measures derived from the ATS closely replicated past results and confirmed that only the ATS overgeneralization subscale is related to depression.	natural

Stress was found to be a significant predictor of depression.	natural
Major depression and generalised anxiety disorder were measured using a standardised diagnostic interview (CIDI-SF).	natural
Together, these findings suggest that anxiety may influence later depression through avoidance, and this relationship remains unaffected by experiencing a traumatic experience.	natural
Although several self-rating scales for depression have been proposed in the past two decades, very few have been validated on non-English-speaking populations.	natural
Data on ACEs and mental_health (depression, anxiety and suicidality) were collected at the beginning of the semester, and data on current stressors and mental_health were collected toward the end of the semester (n = 239).	natural
