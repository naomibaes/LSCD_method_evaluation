Reviewing the recent literature on the overlapping spectrum of neurotic depressive and dysthymic conditions--unofficially referred to as minor, atypical or characterologic depressives--the authors conclude that detrimental symptomatologic admixtures with anxiety disorders may obscure the prototypical features of these disorders as defined in DSM-III-R. It is prolonged anhedonia on an intermittent or chronic basis which appears to characterize the trait illness of dysthymia.	synthetic_negative
