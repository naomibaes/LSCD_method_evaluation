This study is aimed at investigating whether, in a one-year longitudinal study with 130 dementia caregivers, caregivers' depression scores co-vary with modulating variables such as self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts, frequency of leisure activities, and cognitive reappraisal, after controlling for gender and caregivers' stressors (frequency of disruptive behaviors).	natural

It also investigates the understudied relationship between Japans deflationary crisis and the contemporaneous global depression.	natural

Ultimately, the review identifies a need to continue to develop and apply novel research methodologies to further understand the interactional processes that occur between mothers and their offspring in the context of maternal depression, and specifically how these interactions develop across the span of offspring development.	natural
Participants with chronic depression (CD, N = 15), episodic depression (ED, N = 15) and healthy controls (HC, N = 15) participated in this pilot study.	natural
The results were in accord with Beck's (1967) theory of schema-based distortion in depression, which proposes that persons vulnerable to the development of depression are prone to make erroneous negative inferences and to then regard those inferences as plausible and correct.	natural
Measures of mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and adjustment (Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale) were included to detect potential adverse effects of the intervention.	natural
Five OPRM1 SNPs showed significant evidence of interaction with stressful life events to alter depression risk (or symptoms) after adjusting for multiple testing and the correlated nature of the SNPs.	natural
Our results implicate that treatment of major depression may benefit from approaches that facilitate reinterpretation of emotional events in a more positive, more self-serving way.	natural
Ninety-eight patients with end-stage congestive heart failure (CHF) completed measures of religious comfort, religious struggle, belief in an afterlife, concerns about death, and depression.	natural
In the initial study, stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 3 months of discharge: type of discharge, number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations, race, suicide attempt within 1 month of admission, overwhelming experience of depression upon admission, and occupational level (R = .452).	synthetic_negative

We examine a 'lock and key' ('L-K') hypothesis to depression which posits that early adverse experiences establish locks that are activated by keys exacerbating the earlier adverse experience to induce depression.	synthetic_negative
The findings for depressives were discussed in relation to the recently expanded learned helplessness model of depression, which incorporates inevitable attributions.	synthetic_negative
