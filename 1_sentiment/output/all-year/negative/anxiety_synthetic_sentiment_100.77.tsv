It was found that the relaxation treatment significantly combated pre-operative anxiety, which initially caused greater distress as measured by the state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983).	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that this is due, at least in part, to a flawed conception of anxiety which confuses several distinct, albeit related, components: the affective, the cognitive, and the behavioural.	synthetic_negative
The primary purpose of this multimethod and multimeasure study was to identify how the peer relationships of Australian adolescents (ages 9-15 years; N = 335) at school, including relational aggression and victimization, correlated with their symptoms of depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The mean Zung self-rating anxiety scores for trazodone and mianserin, indicating troubling symptoms, were 45.6 and 44.4 at the start of treatment and 33.6 and 31.1 at the end of the study.	synthetic_negative
Excellent convergence was found between the CBCL Attention Problems scale with the diagnosis of ADHD, between the Delinquent Behavior scale and the diagnosis of CD, and between the Anxiety/Depression scale and the troubling aspects of Anxiety Disorders.	synthetic_negative
The results did not confirm the concerning hypothesis that perceptually defensive respondents (those with elevated thresholds for danger words as opposed to neutral words) would tend to have lower scores on the death anxiety inventory.	synthetic_negative
Conversely, few subjects expected alcohol to intensify tension and anxiety at Time Epoch 1 (3.5); however, significantly more subjects feared this worsening effect at Time Epochs 2 and 3 (31 and 34, respectively).	synthetic_negative
Subsequently, the QHTT was used as a dependent measure to assess the degree to which heightened stress (high test anxiety) in evaluative situations is related to deficits in test-taking strategies.	synthetic_negative
Our findings suggest that incremental theory manipulation serves as an essential cognitive strategy for tackling school-related anxiety in adolescents with mental disorders such as GAD.	synthetic_negative
The Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) evaluates health anxiety in both distressing and non-medical contexts.	synthetic_negative
Particularly when the hurt concerns a developmentally relevant area, college students are more troubled and have more anxiety than their same-gender parents.	synthetic_negative
On retesting there was a marked improvement in depressive symptomatology but persistent anxiety levels remained.	synthetic_negative
Interesting findings include behaviors associated with anxiety, which often lead to learning difficulties and distractibility, as the most commonly addressed by teachers in the classroom as opposed to the most frequently addressed by administrators, such as aggression.	synthetic_negative
Avoidance in the face of novel situations or uncertainty is a prime feature of behavioral inhibition which has been put forth as an alarming risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Factor analysis identified two factors, named mathematics test anxiety, and dread related to mathematics performance evaluation anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The results are discussed in terms of possible motor system differences between high and low socially anxious subjects, as well as the detrimental effects of state anxiety on motoric performance.	synthetic_negative
Overall, findings suggest that harmful parent-child relational factors may indirectly elevate body dissatisfaction, operating through attachment anxiety and vulnerability to sociocultural pressures.	synthetic_negative
The investigation partially confirmed that increase in distance resulted in a more restricted visual field for the group low in anxiety.	synthetic_negative
They were tested in either visual half-field with a percept-genetic test of anxiety and defense issues (the MCT).	synthetic_negative

Studies are reviewed which (a) compare anxiety and other measures of distress between normals and dysfunctionals; (b) evaluate the challenges of anxiety reduction procedures for treating sexual dysfunctions; and (c) try to identify anxiety-related stimuli that disrupt sexual arousal.	synthetic_negative

Although some other anxiety disorders have been widely investigated, social phobia was neglected and underexplored before 1985.	synthetic_negative
The MSSD and SEM measures for low mood and anxiety variability were more concerning in patients than controls.	synthetic_negative
In the present study we report: normative data on the Spanish version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI); and empirical evidence related to differentiation between the constructs of anxiety sensitivity and debilitating trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
There is discussion of some of the inadequate institutional defences against anxiety and distress that arise when working with the most complex children and families in schools, and in particular the tendency to locate problems within individuals and to attempt to address such issues on an individual basis while leaving the institutional and systemic challenges unaddressed.	synthetic_negative
This shift is interpreted in terms of building intolerance to scopolamine and increasing anxiety and dread to shock as effects of differential treatments accumulated.	synthetic_negative
In addition, the genetic and environmental mechanisms that link mathematical anxiety with math cognition and general distress were also explored.	synthetic_negative
The AMS was given in computerized format with multiple adjectives using a visual analog Likert scale yielding seven dimensions of mood including vigor, restlessness, despair, rage, exhaustion, anxiety, and happiness.	synthetic_negative
No significant differences were indicated between sexes in negative imagery, though both expressed anxiety as a barrier to success.	synthetic_negative
