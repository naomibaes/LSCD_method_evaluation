Youth with depression should be monitored for the development of restrictive eating disorders.	natural
Students dysphoric moods were influenced by emotional-oriented coping that mediated the effects of low self-efficacy, and self-efficacy also had a direct effect on depression.	natural
Elevated depression and job-related stress may affect caregivers ability to establish empathic connections with children.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that partner alcohol and drug use severity explained more variance in veteran alcohol use and drug use (20 and 13, respectively) than did veteran PTSD, adult antisocial behavior, or depression symptoms combined (6 for veteran alcohol use; 7 for veteran drug use).	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the overall number of traumas was significantly associated with poorer general knowledge, lower processing speed and impaired executive functions in patients with major depression.	natural
There was a significant relationship between respondent education and depression (p < 0.05).	natural
Studies evaluating the contribution of anxiety have produced varying results, perhaps reflecting the use of dimensional self-report measures of state anxiety and failure to control for co-morbid depression.	natural
In multivariable analyses with dichotomized anxiety, depression and stress, more than two-fold increase in readmission risk was attributable to preoperative anxiety and postoperative depression, independent of covariates.	natural
Interestingly, higher emotional reactivity (as indexed by a larger increase in negative affect after watching the valence-loaded stimuli) at baseline predicted reductions in depression symptoms after the intervention.	natural
Level of depression in the two groups was reassessed 3 months after delivery and the impact of recent life events on self-esteem was also assessed using a structured interview procedure.	natural
Cognitive change processes in a group cognitive behavior therapy of depression.	natural
Differential correlations with anxiety, depression, parental representations and action tendencies underscore the advantage of this solution.	natural
This finding stands in contrast to the previous studies, which have mainly focused on insomnia as a risk factor for the onset of depression.	natural
Recent criticism of theories of personality vulnerability to depression posits that personality may be an outcome, rather than a cause, of depressive symptoms.	natural
Our findings suggest that the decrease in skin sensitivity in major depression is specific to pain and not due to an increased reaction time.	natural
111 adults on the autism spectrum completed an online survey examining their experiences of autism acceptance, along with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.	natural
The relatives were subdivided into three groups: (a) those with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = performed similarly to the schizotypals; (b) those with a major depression history (n = were similar to the psychiatric comparison subjects; and (c) those with no psychiatric history differed from the nonpsychiatric subjects only on 30 degrees/s targets.	natural
A critical and conceptual analysis of the pertinent literature, which elaborates the implications of the heterogeneity in symptom pattern, etiology, and course of depression in CAD patients.	natural
Elevations in reported depression and anxiety symptoms were both associated with elevated mean-level quarrelsome and submissive behavior.	natural
Maternal depressive symptoms were screened by Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and maternal anxiety level was assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at early postpartum period (7-10 days).	natural
To the extent these participants were high in conscientiousness, they fared better across multiple domains of psychosocial functioning, as reflected in educational attainment, symptoms of depression, and close relationship quality (p values = .01-.04).	natural
The total HADS scale showed a better balance between sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) in identifying cases of psychiatric disorder as defined by the Present State Examination than the depression subscale in identifying cases of unipolar depression as defined by ICD-8.	natural
During visits ranging from 2 to 21 per patient, 76 of patients never had a depression diagnosis, 3 were always depressed, and 14 became depressed for the first time, almost exclusively at their final visit before death.	natural
A second model including symptoms of depression as additional covariate ((511) = 722.761, p < .001, RMSEA = .034, CFI = .956, WRMR = .949) showed a substantial impact of depressive symptoms on all FA model variables leading to a deterioration of the FA mediations.	synthetic_negative
In the case studies, violent activity serves several psychic functions: it leads to high arousal states and the feeling of being alive while masking deeper feelings of deadness and depression, it serves to contain and discharge overwhelming chaotic and rageful feelings, and it enacts object ties and the unconscious fantasies of the parent.	synthetic_negative
Although the intervention costs substantially more than usual care, the financial burden is significant when compared to other depression interventions.	synthetic_negative
The authors emphasize that all clinicians working with rape victims should be vigilant to the potential worsening of depression in this population.	synthetic_negative
This study investigated whether previously reported links between sleep and risk taking among adolescents (E. M. O'Brien & J. A. Mindell, 2005) are associated-concurrently, longitudinally, or both-with sleep or underlying depression, potentially heightening vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
Five hundred and thirty-five undergraduates from two universities were recruited and given a Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Revised Life Orientation Test, and Self-Diagnosing Depression Scale.	synthetic_negative
However, these overgenerality effects were not a function of OCD per se, but were aggravated by a co-morbid diagnosis of severe depression, which might exacerbate difficulties.	synthetic_negative
Participants completed self-report questionnaires about eating disorders, self-disclosure, self-injurious behaviors (FASM) and depression (BDI-II), and 82.5 of the sample reported severe struggles with despair and harm.	synthetic_negative
Three conflicting components were found and interpreted as reflecting inconsistencies in self-report and clinical rating methods for measuring the severity of depression.	synthetic_negative
A qualitative research approach, specifically a multiple case study method was used, consisting of interviews in narrative format with people who were trapped in depression.	synthetic_negative
Scales constructed from this PCA related strongly to measures of anxiety and depression, and detrimentally to a measure of self-esteem, suggesting that they were valid measures of adolescent stress.	synthetic_negative
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of state and trait depression, a burdensome political activity inventory, and the locus of control scale.	synthetic_negative
The current findings suggest that neuroticism may exacerbate specific anxiety and also significantly impact specific depression symptoms when stress is caused by daily hassles.	synthetic_negative
Many studies examine stress as a unitary construct; however, research suggests that how adolescents respond to stress within different domains may variably exacerbate symptoms of depression.	synthetic_negative
Not many targeted studies of the pharmacologic treatment of depression in geriatric patients are available, in part because this age group is unfortunately excluded from most new drug investigations.	synthetic_negative
In all these children depression was the overwhelming response to loss, exacerbating emotional distress.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, the present study's findings elucidate the exacerbating effect of rumination on FCR, and such findings may better inform psychological interventions to avert the escalation of depression and anxiety among cancer survivors who experience high FCR.	synthetic_negative
