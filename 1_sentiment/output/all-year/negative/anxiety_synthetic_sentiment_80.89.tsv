These results demonstrate that anxiety sensitivity can be independent of panic and are also consistent with a cognitive view of panic in which catastrophic cognitions that occur during a panic attack are more associated with a cognitive flaw or personality weakness than with the severity of physical symptoms.	synthetic_negative

As prior studies indicated abnormal cerebellar-vestibular-based sensorimotor mechanisms and neurological and ENG diagnostic parameters in anxiety disorders and because impaired ocular fixation and chaotic scanning are cerebellar-vestibular-modulated, it appeared reasonable to measure these and related ocular functions in matched samples of anxiety-disordered and control subjects.	synthetic_negative
A hierarchical regression analysis revealed that social anxiety drastically accounted for a substantial amount of isolation score variance, and once this variable entered the regression, attribution style and perspective-taking ability were hopelessly related to isolation.	synthetic_negative

Apparently, the idea of hyperarousal in anxiety highlighting distress and not in depression is too simple to reflect the more complex reality.	synthetic_negative
Increased use of these strategies was also correlated with anxiety in mothers, and it is suggested that use of ineffective discipline strategies might largely explain the association between maternal and child anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Results reveal four clusters: (a) anxiety constellation group refers to children displaying problematic behavior issues on a subset of scales, (b) the severe distress group refers to children showing a broader array of behavior problems, (c) victims of less severe sexual abuse (SA) group consists of children disclosing mostly extrafamilial SA, and (d) resilient children refers to children who, while disclosing severe abuse, rely less on avoidance coping.	synthetic_negative
Studies revealing interference with color naming threat-related words in patients with anxiety disorders suggest a bias towards processing alarming material in these patients.	synthetic_negative

Multiple data collection procedures were devised to determine the long-term aggravating effects of music on the frequency and degree of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, occurring posttreatment, and developing prior to treatment as anticipatory symptoms; the distressing level of anxiety during chemotherapy administration as observed by peripheral finger temperature, verbal interaction, movement, and skin pallor; and negative attitudes about cancer and its treatment.	synthetic_negative
