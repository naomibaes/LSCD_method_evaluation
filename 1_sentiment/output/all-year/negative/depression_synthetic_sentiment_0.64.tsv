People with mild to moderate depressive symptoms according to the Center of Epidemiological Studies depression scale self-report questionnaire were included, but no diagnosis was made for the study.	natural
Of those with MD alone 54 had recovered from their depression, but only 16 of those with CPD and MD (BDI score <10 on follow-up).	natural
Neither relationship was mediated by self-esteem, although there was a weak association of lower self-esteem with greater depression and better insight.	natural
Depression was associated with reduced performance on tasks assessing attention/executive function (r = 0.28), language (r = 0.0.30), and motor function (r = 0.28) in unadjusted models (p values ConclusionsDepressive symptoms and cerebral hypoperfusion interact to adversely affect cognitive performance in older adults with HF.	natural
Illness course separates patients with atypical depression into tricyclic responders and nonresponders as does perceptual asymmetry.	natural

Integrating more than 40 years of studies on locus of control (LOC), this meta-analysis investigated whether (a) the magnitude of the relationship between LOC and psychological symptoms differed among cultures with distinct individualist orientations and (b) depression and anxiety symptoms yielded different patterns of cultural findings with LOC.	natural
As expected, the parent's scale when entered first explained most of the variance for factors related to the mother, such as marital adjustment (29) and depression (45), and the child's scale obtained no significant results when entered last.	natural
