Findings are contrasted with prior demographic and epidemiological studies limited to persons hospitalized following moderate to severe head trauma.	natural
One model of PTG suggests that growth is triggered by trauma(s) that challenges an individual's assumptive world.	natural
While speaking to the contemporary debate on trigger warnings, we hope to add to that conversation through nuancing the embodied labor of trauma within education spaces.	natural
The effects of trauma are most apparent when significant and generalized others (i.e.; family, community, culture) cannot maintain the human contracts that bond people, define social order, and ensure justice.	natural

Using a cultural lens, we suggest that a public health based model, referred to as the Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI), provides a useful framework for examining the linkages among trauma, various risk and protective factors, and both suicidal behaviors and overt aggression.	natural
In this paper, we draw on theoretical perspectives to provide a practical, clinically driven approach to the management of developmental trauma.	natural
A diagnostic approximation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was based on responses to the Trauma Questionnaire, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and questions about impairment.	natural
These findings underscore the central role of individual trait personality differences in predicting changes in both mental_health problems and interpersonal relations over time, following exposure to trauma.	natural
We conclude that these factors should be considered as modifiers predominantly of the clinical outcomes associated with repetitive brain trauma within a broader biopsychosocial framework when interpreting and attributing symptom development, though also note potential effects on neuropathological outcomes.	natural
From 1997 to 2001, data were gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma units, school students, rave party attenders, and arrestees.	natural
Recent cognitive models propose that intrusive trauma memories arise and persist because high levels of emotional arousal triggered by the trauma disrupt conceptual processing of elements of the event, while enhancing sensory/perceptual processing.	natural
While various definitions have been proposed for complex trauma, the clinical issues related to it are relevant for veterans as they are at risk for cumulative trauma exposures such as multiple combat deployments and military sexual trauma.	natural

It also illustrates how reparation with the mother that partially heals pre-Oedipal trauma fails to protect anyone from the damaging Oedipal-level attractions to a demon lover father, as represented in a displacement, resulting in victimized behavior, and in a troubled surrender to heterosexual desire.	synthetic_negative
Overall, the results suggest that interpersonal trauma exposure is linked to significantly worse physical health; however, the role of intervening psychological variables remains unclear.	synthetic_negative

We describe three patients, all meeting DSM-III-R criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), whose vivid, intrusive obsessional images had been identified by previous treatment personnel as distressing flashbacks of repressed childhood trauma.	synthetic_negative
Utilizing a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analytic approach, the study tested a) what specific disaster-related stressors (i.e., property damage, loss of basic services) and individual-related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptoms, trauma history, social support) exacerbated the risk for post-natural disaster depression, b) specific cutoff scores across these measures, and c) whether the significance or cutoff scores for each construct varied between adolescents and adults.	synthetic_negative
Central Americans' stress appraisal ratings on specific HSI items related to pre-migration trauma underscored the severe negative impact they experienced, which was significantly higher than the ratings of Mexican immigrants.	synthetic_negative
Trauma causes damaging alterations in the production and release of stress-responsive neurochemicals such as norepinephrine and the endogenous opioids, and extreme levels of these neurochemicals severely disrupt everyday, explicit information processing.	synthetic_negative
Immature memories of trauma are overwhelmed by, among other things, very diffuse, distressing physical feelings that cannot be integrated into the ego (Cohen 1980).	synthetic_negative
