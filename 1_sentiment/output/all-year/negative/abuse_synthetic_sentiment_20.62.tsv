Examining within-group variations in experiences of IPV and pet abuse using a series of one-way between-groups ANOVA tests, this study provides evidence to support the conclusion that women who report that their partner mistreated their pets are themselves at significantly greater risk of more frequent and severe forms of IPV, most specifically psychological, physical, and sexual abuse.	natural

Although multiple forms (i.e., physical, threatening, psychological, sexual, and relational abuse) and patterns (i.e., perpetration and victimization) of violence can co-occur, most existing research examines these experiences individually.	natural
To complement those approaches, this article presents additional views of domestic H-S. Applications of theories from social (escape from self), developmental (evolution of self and continuity of self), gender role (power and the male role), and family violence psychology (abusive personality and proximal antecedents of abuse) are outlined.	natural
Co-occurring psychiatric disorders and polysubstance abuse at intake were common, but received clinical attention, which may explain why their effect on outcomes was minimal.	natural

Age (p = .02), sexual abuse history (p < .001), physical abuse history (p = .004), and somatization (p < .001) were independently associated with gastric discomfort threshold (R = 0.30); a significant depression-by-sexual abuse interaction effect was also found (p = .003).	natural
All women described altered eating behaviors related to IPV that were categorized into several major themes: (a) somatization (victims experience significant somatic symptoms as a result of abuse); (b) avoiding abuse (victims modify their eating behaviors to avoid abuse); (c) coping (victims use food to handle the psychological effects of abuse); (d) self-harm (victims use food to hurt themselves as a reaction to the abuse); and (e) challenging abusive partners (victims use their eating behaviors to retaliate against their abusers).	natural
