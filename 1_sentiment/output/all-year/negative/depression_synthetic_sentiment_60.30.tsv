Exploitable and submissive dependency are increasingly negatively correlated with C and O, whereas love dependency is positively correlated with C and O. Implications regarding the assessment of dependency and multifactor models of dependency are discussed, and hypotheses for future research linking dependency and depression are proposed.	natural
