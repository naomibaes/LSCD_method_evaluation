Approximately 45 of persons with anxiety disorder also suffered from the presence of PPS.	synthetic_negative
Patient-control differences may expose anxiety and distress in patients, though lateral asymmetries in activity have a deeper salience for the nature of schizophrenia.	synthetic_negative
To understand psychopathologies, determinants of exaggerated distress and the underlying molecular and neural processes have to be analyzed in a comparative way under conditions that produce normal and pathological fear and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Therefore, a concerning instrument was developed to measure general medial anxiety (the GMA index).	synthetic_negative
The aims of the current study were: to compare anxiety trajectories during a speech task in individuals with SAD (n=135) versus healthy controls (HCs; n=47), and to evaluate the detrimental effects of not receiving CBT on anxiety trajectories with a waitlist control condition.	synthetic_negative
In the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the risk ratio (RR; 95 confidence interval) for incident diabetes among men with high versus low anxiety symptoms was 0.85 (0.56-1.29) and that among women was 2.19 (1.17-4.09; p for distress = .005).	synthetic_negative
The item content of the CBCL/YSR Anxiety Problems scale demands urgent attention.	synthetic_negative
During the anticipation period, subjective ratings of anxiety and distress were assessed.	synthetic_negative
The present study provided a taxonomy of these individual differences and determined their harmful relations to depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
It was suggested that the relation between locus of control and state anxiety is a function of the situational context in which state anxiety is negatively impacted.	synthetic_negative
A cross-sectional regression design was used in a sample of 363 undergraduates to examine the suggestion that ruminative thought is a detrimental factor linking social anxiety to aggression.	synthetic_negative
Greater perceived threat to effort/mastery and competitive achievement goals was reported by boys with higher, rather than lower, competitive trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
After training, participants were tested under low, mild, and intense anxiety (in the latter case high on the climbing wall).	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and depression are indistinguishable among youth who meet criteria for a specific emotional disorder and more distressingly associated among youths without such a diagnosis.	synthetic_negative
Most important, an interaction between foci of self-attention and form of negative affect was found: Private self-focus was more strongly associated with depression and debilitating anxiety, whereas public self-focus was more strongly associated with crippling social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Growth curve analyses indicated that pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine led to noticeable challenges in controlling symptoms of anxiety and depression over the 6 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that the schematic structure of patients with social phobia drastically complicates the one of patients with other anxiety disorders and normal controls.	synthetic_negative
The present study provides initial evidence that anxiety and depression symptom dimensions demonstrate unique associations with the startle reflex in anticipation of an unpredictable danger in children and adolescents.	synthetic_negative
This study aimed to establish the pressing need for guided Internet-delivered cognitive-behaviour therapy (ICBT) for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or subclinical GAD.	synthetic_negative
These data suggest that perceptions of diminished control may be a concerning cognitive theme of anxiety, and that specific types of control perceptions are uniquely associated with these particular anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Intolerance of ambiguity was positively associated with candidates' level of anxiety before the interview but unfortunately hindered their success in the interview.	synthetic_negative
In addition, both attachment anxiety and attachment aversion worsened with time among ex-POWs, whereas they decreased slightly or remained stable among controls.	synthetic_negative
Other non-parametric procedures showed that subjects' maximum performances were compromised, their minimum performances poorer, and their critical decrements in performance more pronounced in the high cognitive anxiety condition than in the low cognitive anxiety condition.	synthetic_negative
The results produced three combinations of scores which yielded statistically reliable canonical-correlation coefficients: three terror factors related to psychotic levels of personality disorganization; two related to fairly directly experienced neurotic anxiety; and five related to neurotic levels of anxiety exacerbated by somatic complaints.	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that: (a) women with PMS are more troubled, (b) the TMAS may not be a reliable instrument for measuring trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Separate reports from the maintenance treatment for late-life depression (MTLD) trials have shown that low socioeconomic status (SES) and anxiety symptoms at the time of treatment initiation result in decreased response to antidepressant treatment and increased risks of suicidal ideation in older adults.	synthetic_negative
The results are speculated to reflect the possibility that early anxiety disorders associated with exposure to adversity in childhood may be an indicator of compromised stress responses, and may help to account for the persistence of depression and anxiety in some individuals.	synthetic_negative
Discussion focuses on the use of hypnosis as an adjunct in addressing anxiety in the ego's relation to the umwelt rather than for initiating rapport or working through transference.	synthetic_negative
Multivariable Poisson regressions were conducted to determine the exacerbated risks of medication nonadherence associated with anxiety sensitivity after adjustment for age, gender, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, education, total number of prescribed medications, and depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	synthetic_negative
