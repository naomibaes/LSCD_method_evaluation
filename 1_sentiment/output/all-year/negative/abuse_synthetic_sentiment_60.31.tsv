Using logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and level of education, depression was overwhelmingly associated with traumatic physical abuse (Odds Ratio ((OR) 13.71; 95 Confidence Interval (CI) 3.25-57.91) and least with sexual abuse (OR 5.35; 95 CI 2.36-12.14).	synthetic_negative

Three categories of risk factor emerged: Factors such as gender, age at trauma, and race that predicted PTSD in some populations but not in others; factors such as education, previous trauma, and general childhood adversity that predicted PTSD more consistently but to a varying extent according to the populations studied and the methods used; and factors such as psychiatric history, disturbing reported childhood abuse, and family psychiatric history that had more uniform predictive effects.	synthetic_negative
For example, among physical abuse cases, older child victims were more likely to suffer persistently within-type, while the opposite was true for neglect.	synthetic_negative
