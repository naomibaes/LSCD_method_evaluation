Despite this, all of the research on transdiagnostic anxiety treatments to date have either not used a control condition, or have relied on no-treatment or delayed-treatment controls, thus limiting inferences about comparative efficacy.	natural
Results revealed that the four-factor structure fit both U.S. and Icelandic samples, but that two of the factors (choice/commitment anxiety and Interpersonal Conflicts might hold different psychological meanings in the two countries (i.e., factor loadings were not invariant).	natural

Model-fitting revealed distinct etiological patterns underlying the association among symptoms of eating disorders, depression, overanxious disorder (OAD), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) during the course of development: a common genetic factor detrimentally influencing vulnerability to all symptoms - of early and later OAD, depression, SAD, and eating symptoms; a distinct genetic factor specifically indexing susceptibility to early eating disorders symptoms; a shared environmental factor specifically exacerbating early depression and early eating disorders symptoms; and a common environmental factor negatively affecting susceptibility to symptoms of later eating disorders and both early and later separation anxiety.	synthetic_negative
