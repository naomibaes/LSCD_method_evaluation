Response preparation produced three kinds of effect on the conditioned reflex elicited 200 msec before the end of the preparatory period: depression of the conditioned reflex which was maximum at the 150 msec conditioning interval; enhancement of the conditioned reflex which was maximum at the 300 msec conditioning interval; and, when the soleus muscle was involved in the execution of the voluntary response, an inhibiting depression of the conditioned reflex at each conditioning interval.	synthetic_negative
