The complexity arises from a combination of the fact that PMDD is a controversial mental_illness that lacks substantial proof of existence, the aggressive marketing tactics employed by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly for its drug Sarafem-which is actually Prozac-to treat this disorder, and the reality that many women who are frustrated for valid reasons believe that receiving the PMDD label undermines their authentic feelings.	synthetic_negative

Asian Americans showed stronger negative implicit attitudes toward mental_illness relative to Caucasian Americans, suggesting that cultural variation in stigma of mental_illness is pronounced even when concerns regarding the validity and appropriateness of one's attitudes toward mental_illness are minimized.	synthetic_negative
Attitudes towards persons with mental_illness were assessed before the intervention, immediately after it and at a one week follow-up to address lingering biases.	synthetic_negative
We describe a situational model of the personal response to mental_illness stigma based on the negative collective representations that are primed in that situation, the person's perception of the inevitability of stigma in the situation, and the person's isolation from the stigmatized group of individuals with mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Here, we investigate how a history in-care relates to demographics and adverse outcome measures in a homeless population with mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Past studies also revealed that people with these mental_illness suffer from perceptual difficulties with disrupted neural activation.	synthetic_negative
Collaborations with a diverse set of colleagues and models from other disciplines than psychology helped me conceptualize the goals of research on a given topic (e.g., developing evidence-based treatments, addressing the heavy burden of mental_illness, promoting a sustainable environment to mitigate climate change) and propose a shift from current practices as a means to obtain them.	synthetic_negative
Of course, to think that we can completely eliminate the burden of mental_illness for successive generations is clearly unrealistic.	synthetic_negative
This exploratory study examined the infrequent and challenging nature of providers' contact with families of persons with severe mental_illness.	synthetic_negative
Both HIV care programmes and psychiatric care clinics should be concerned with the problematic association of HIV infection and mental_illness, and adopt critical diagnostic and care elements of these complementary disciplines in the training and the day-to-day work of clinicians, nurses, and counsellors.	synthetic_negative
Factors that were independently associated with HIV-1 seropositivity were female gender and older age (41+years) and after adjusting for sex and age group, the nature of the current episode (highest risk among those with first episode of mental_illness) and psychiatric diagnoses (critically high in the organic affective disorders and delirium, significant in those with bipolar affective disorder and psychotic syndromes).	synthetic_negative
Because schizophrenia may severely affect the ability of HIV-infected patients to adhere to their antiretroviral regimen, stringent management of their mental_illness is a critical priority in such individuals.	synthetic_negative

The treatments they prescribe for mental_illness fall within two major approaches: the desperate intervention approach and the inevitable failure method.	synthetic_negative
We next focus on several issues of conceptual and practical relevance: (a) stigma against even less severe forms of mental_disorder; (b) the role of perceptions of heightened dangerousness related to mental_illness; (c) conflicts between behavioral research and investigations of explicit and implicit attitudes; (d) challenges in the testability of evolutionary models; (e) attributional accounts of the causes of mental_illness, specifically concerning limited personal control versus overwhelming biogenetic factors; and (f) negative developmental trends regarding persistent stigma processes.	synthetic_negative
The attitudes assessed toward two vignettes included recognition of mental_illness, increased social distance, anticipated burden, negative influence on one's health, limited treatment choice, and poor prognosis.	synthetic_negative
