These findings highlight the clinical importance of persistent symptoms occurring after remission in late-life depression.	synthetic_negative
Women completed depression scales at several time points and critically evaluated their infant's characteristics and childcare burdens at 2- and 6-months postpartum.	synthetic_negative
Statistically significant differences were noted between groups for all measures and over half of the dysphonic subjects exhibited worryingly high levels of depression and anxiety relative to published test norms.	synthetic_negative
It includes behavioural consequences, in this instance depression, that can be debilitating for both the patient and the primary care givers.	synthetic_negative
The data suggest that classifying psychotic depression into MC versus MI subtypes may provide minimal immediate prognostic value in pharmacotherapy response rates.	synthetic_negative
Epidemiological studies on psychosocial precursors of myocardial infarction (MI) in middle-aged subjects suggest that in the year prior to MI, psychological phenomena of 'vital exhaustion and depression' may be a particularly concerning diagnostic measure as manifestations of chest pain, and other cardiac symptoms.	synthetic_negative
We aimed at assessing whether it is possible to identify different forms of crippling depression using a dimensional approach.	synthetic_negative
In this study, 71 participants completed measures of delusional beliefs, depression and negative attributional style.	synthetic_negative
Depression was found to be a severe risk factor for increased vulnerability to physical abuse (relative risk = 3.45).	synthetic_negative
Three groups of eating disorder patients (anorexia nervosa, n=27; bulimia nervosa, n=23; EDNOS, n=19) and a group of noneating disorder controls (n=25) were unfavorably compared on four subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory2 (EDI2), and on the Eating Disorders Belief Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.	synthetic_negative
In all trials, a DSM-III-R depressive disorder was the primary criterion for study entry, and each treatment only achieved modest improvement after both 2 and 6 weeks of treatment according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_negative
Onset of major depression was best predicted by an interaction between overwhelming stress endured and diminished self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
At Time 2, depression scores remained troublingly high among those with a prior rape history who were in the video compared to the standard care condition.	synthetic_negative
Irrespective of clinical status, involvement in home activities was significantly associated with the worsening of depression of women.	synthetic_negative
This observational cohort study investigated the complicated relationship between alexithymia, inadequate coping strategies, anxiety, depression, impaired pulmonary function, and poor disease control in bronchial asthma (BA) patients who attended a tertiary care center between December 2010 and November 2011.	synthetic_negative
This study assessed whether assimilation was correlated with an unfavorable treatment outcome in a sample of psychotherapeutic treatments for depression.	synthetic_negative
During the 16 weeks of the study, 55 patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for OCD received open-label treatment with sertraline (100-200 mg/d) or fluoxetine (40-80 mg/d) and were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Thought-Action Fusion Scale (TAFS), Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30), and White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI), all of which highlighted the debilitating impact of depression on functioning.	synthetic_negative

While depressogenic attributional style and contamination sequences were unrelated to each other, both were shown to independently predict self-reported depression and contribute to persistently low life satisfaction.	synthetic_negative
