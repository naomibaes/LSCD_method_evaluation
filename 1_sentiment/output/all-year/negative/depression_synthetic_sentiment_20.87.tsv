This study aimed to describe usual care over a six month follow-up for primary care patients with subthreshold depression and to investigate the relationship between usual care and the development of MDD.	natural
The SAS-IDs convergent validity was demonstrated by significant correlations ranging from.21 to.60 between the SAS-ID and related self-report measures (Fear Survey for Adults with Mental Retardation [FSAMR]); and Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults [PIMRA] Total scale, Anxiety subscale, and Affective (Depression) subscale.	natural
Patients with minimal dementia were significantly more likely to suffer from depression than those with mild or moderate dementia but there was no significant association with insight.	natural
Evidence for an association between depression and CHD is strong.	natural
In addition, AD is more prevalent in women, who also show increased incidence of depression.	natural
Results are discussed in terms of a diathesis-stress model of depression and suggest that though relational stressors have previously shown consistent modest links to depressive symptoms, understanding pre-existing intrapsychic vulnerabilities of the adolescent may be critical to identifying the processes by which such stressors lead to depressive symptoms.	natural
Students who scored higher in self-compassion weathered difficulties more successfully, reported lower homesickness and less depression, and expressed greater satisfaction with their decision to attend the university.	natural
Among the quantitative results, as compared with adolescents with low suicidal ideation, adolescents with high suicidal ideation reported significantly higher scores for stressful life events, coping-avoidant strategies, loneliness, and depression, as well as significantly lower scores for coping-approach strategies.	natural
A group of 50 patients (29 bipolar and 21 unipolar) hospitalized for depression were compared on the IPAT Anxiety Scale.	natural

There was marginal evidence of a larger association between externality and psychotic experiences at 12 years (p = 0.06) and between social communication and depression at 12 years (p = 0.03).	natural
Our study assessed the effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) tailored for biomedical patients with depression and pain.	natural

Findings also suggest a potential mechanism of action for efficacious mindfulness and acceptance-based treatments for depression.	natural
Emergency department visits may provide an opportune teachable moment to initiate targeted interventions for positive behavioral change in adults with depression.	natural
There were no significant differences between groups in negative affect, depression, anxiety, or neuroticism after controlling for age and average pain.	natural
We used an EF latent factor based on scores from three tasks (Beads, Day/Night, Tower of London) that tapped working memory, inhibitory control and planning, as well as a latent growth model of mothers' Beck Depression Inventory factor scores at four time-points, and included age 6 verbal ability as a covariate in all analyses.	natural
The scale was developed to fill a need for an instrument that would be sensitive to the problems encountered in assessing depression among older adults.	natural
These findings suggest that dysfunctional attitudes may be a trait phenomenon in personality disorder, related to pervasive sadness rather than major depression.	synthetic_negative
These results confirm the state-dependent dysfunction of the HPA axis in endogenous depression, and suggest that it should not be regarded as a correlate of emotional hyperarousal.	synthetic_negative
