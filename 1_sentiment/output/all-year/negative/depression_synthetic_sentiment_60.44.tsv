Additive genetics and unique environment contributed to self-reported depression (heritability, h: 34), exacerbating emotional challenges, anxiety (h: 30) and stress (h: 34) scores in univariate models, and to the common latent factor (h: 39) in the multivariate model.	synthetic_negative
This investigation examined the relationships between measures of depression and deficiencies in assertiveness in college women and tested the exacerbating effects of anxiety and locus of control on these relationships.	synthetic_negative

The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be more accurately accounted for by the detrimental relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, than by concerns of discriminant validity.	synthetic_negative
Data from 1,925 U.S. Army soldiers deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was used to examine whether BF would intensify the relationship between combat exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.	synthetic_negative

This increase in anxiety symptoms could not be explained by a concurrent worsening in debilitating depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Due to the disturbing features of delusions, research in this area may well become challenging for many other complicated psycho(patho)logical phenomena, e.g. consciousness, hallucinations and psychotic depression.	synthetic_negative
