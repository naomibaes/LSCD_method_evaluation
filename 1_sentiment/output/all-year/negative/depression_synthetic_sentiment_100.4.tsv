Multiple regression analysis revealed troubling associations between depression and gender, and several JTCI domains and facets.	synthetic_negative
Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by the SCL-90, and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies were measured by the CERQ, in a cross-sectional design.	synthetic_negative
In a cross-sectional study, 230 DTC patients were examined with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13), and the Questionnaire of Social Support (F-SOZU) to investigate how depression might undermine wellbeing.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, less than half of GPs recommended using a screening questionnaire or neuroimaging, and considered referral to a variety of medical specialties in the depression vignette, reflecting skepticism towards effective interventions.	synthetic_negative
Three factors-Benevolent, Punitive, and Ambitious-were associated in disturbing ways with relevant scales of the Semantic Differential, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung, 1972), and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976), reflecting the pervasive impact of depression experiences.	synthetic_negative
The overwhelming dual burden of depression and anxiety is well established empirically but remains poorly understood conceptually, in terms of its devastating psychological or biological impacts.	synthetic_negative
Severity and duration of perimenstrual depression was heavily associated with the worsening of premenstrual and menstrual pain, raising the possibility of an overwhelming relationship.	synthetic_negative
Finally, the literature on the relationship between obesity and depression underscores significant emotional and psychological challenges is examined.	synthetic_negative
Fifteen mothers reporting an overwhelming depressed mood (as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EDPS]; mean = 12.6) and their infants (mean age 7.9 months [range 5 11 months], 2 girls, 13 boys) and 15 non-depressed mothers (EPDS mean = 4.4) were video-taped in their homes while playing with their infants (mean age 6.7 months [range 6 10 months], 8 girls, 7 boys) using a soft toy.	synthetic_negative
In a second experiment, injection of short-acting, regular insulin (0.5 IU) failed to prevent the depression of food intake which occurred 6-24 hr after ingestion of 1.5 ml of corn oil, leading to reduced consumption, but not at earlier time intervals.	synthetic_negative
Using Dutch adaptations of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State-Trait Anger Scale, Zung Depression Scale, and Life Orientation Test, we attempted to identify which patients recovering in the hospital from acute myocardial infarctions suffered from and would reluctantly confront depression-related psychological care.	synthetic_negative
The complications of the results for the evaluation and management of depression are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Nonetheless, there is a lack of consensus on whether or how religiosity could exacerbate and contribute to depression.	synthetic_negative
The interaction between social anxiety and depression did not contribute significantly to prediction, suggesting that depression has an overwhelming rather than a simple effect on bias.	synthetic_negative
Results are discussed in terms of the detrimental impact of depression and damaging working models of attachment on couple interaction.	synthetic_negative

A significant worsening in anxiety and depression was only observed in the acupuncture group.	synthetic_negative
Although there was some evidence that a state of depression intensified the relationship between harm avoidance and cooperativeness, the proposed factor structure of the TCI appeared, in general, vulnerable to the adverse effects of depression, when the state was mild to moderate.	synthetic_negative
There is evidence suggesting that there are compounding polysomnographic effects of alcoholism and depression; and elevated baseline REM density in primary alcoholics with (PASD) and without lifetime history of secondary depression (NPA).	synthetic_negative
Generally, the behavioural models of depression are related to a pattern characterized by a constrained social repertoire, e.g. by a severely reduced frequency of emission of positively reinforced behaviour ().	synthetic_negative
