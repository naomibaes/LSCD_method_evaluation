This study compared the effects of three types of activity on coping with test-taking anxiety.	natural
Insomniacs with an anxiety disorder were similar to insomniacs without comorbid anxiety for sleep-related beliefs and depressive symptoms, and both groups of insomniacs reported more depressive symptoms and faulty beliefs than both groups of good sleepers, i.e., either with or without an anxiety disorder.	natural
Results showed that high affect increased performance of students high and low in anxiety about equally.	natural

In 4 studies involving 308 men and 384 women aged 25-76, a reliable instrument, the Social Components of Retirement Anxiety Scale (SCRAS), was developed to assess retirement anxiety.	natural
With this short A-Trait scale it becomes possible to study the relationship between dispositional anxiety and clinically important outcome variables without inflating estimates of these relations through psychometric contamination.	natural
Significant relationships are found between computer anxiety, tolerance of ambiguity, and taking risk with CULA, as well as between CULA and TAM constructs.	natural
To inform practice, future research should examine a broad range of SRPs, incorporate objective measures of sleep, and evaluate the impact of behavioral strategies that directly target SRPs in youth with anxiety disorders.	natural
The patients were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline on the 2nd and 6th weeks of treatment.	natural
The present study sought to extend findings supporting the psychometric validity of a promising measure of social anxiety (SA) symptoms, the Social Interaction Phobia Scale (SIPS; Carleton et al.,	natural
Further, global and social anxiety symptoms were generally not significantly associated with changes in the quality of social networking interactions.	natural
26 children and adolescents with anxiety disorders were included in the study.	natural
While most research on the subject measures outcomes and satisfaction after the event, this study uses a video recording of a restorative justice conference to analyse at the micro level the emotional and interactional dynamics at work in transforming an initial situation of anger and anxiety into one marked by displays of solidarity between victim and offender.	natural
Rating results showed that GAD patients experienced disorder-related scripts as more anxiety inducing and arousing than HC.	natural
Over 400 undergraduate males completed an assessment of sexual aggression, athletic involvement, fraternity affiliation, alcohol and drug use, skepticism of women, depression, and social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, but consistent with expectations, the subliminal stimuli had no adverse effect on a measure of trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and distress are prevalent among women during pregnancy and the year after birth.	synthetic_negative
Results indicate that the SBS shows high reliability and convergent validity and that its relation to death anxiety exacerbates participants' struggles with religious identification: religious participants grapple with fear of death less the stronger their religious beliefs, whereas nonreligious participants are driven to religious belief due to their intensifying death anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Children whose mothers had relatively fewer years of education had heightened odds for symptom-induced distress in social anxiety, depression, aggression, and mania and a greater number of debilitating conditions.	synthetic_negative
At follow-up, children who purposely disclosed endured greater anxiety and faced heightened difficulties in coping.	synthetic_negative
The direct and interactive effects of temperament and parenting were examined in the problematic prediction of early adolescent externalising behaviour crises (conduct disorder and hyperactivity), internalising problems (depression and anxiety), and substance misuse, using data on 1,402 13- and 14-year-olds.	synthetic_negative
A comparison of anxiety responses by playing condition indicated that, irrespective of the match outcome, scores on Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety were troublingly higher and scores on Self-confidence were discouragingly lower before playing singles than before playing doubles.	synthetic_negative
We examined and compared associations between religious variables and overwhelming anxiety disorders in 1025 young (ages 18 to 39), 645 middle-aged (ages 40 to 59), and 1299 elderly (ages 60 to 97) community-dwelling adults who participated in Wave II of the Piedmont NIMH Epidemiologic Catchment Area survey.	synthetic_negative
For Lacan, the anxiety of being absorbed by the object is the overwhelming anxiety from which the anxieties of separation, castration or fragmentation are derived, which may explain why he did not keep his patients for a sufficient length of time.	synthetic_negative
The influence of different hierarchical guidelines in various classification systems on the complex diagnosis of anxiety disorders and hypochondriasis was investigated.	synthetic_negative
Youths from families with low income during the study period had increased susceptibility to symptoms of depression and anxiety at follow-up (compared to youths from families with intermediate/high income, age-adjusted OR: 1.74, 95 CI 1.17-2.57; fully adjusted OR: 1.94, 95 CI: 1.27-2.97).	synthetic_negative
Given the challenging nature of family relationships when a child has chronic pain, we aimed to evaluate whether an adolescent-disability-derived cluster formula would distressingly classify their parents via parenting stress, anxiety, and hopelessness.	synthetic_negative
Identifying and treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorders would lessen the burden of this condition and may mitigate the intensification of co-morbid issues in these patients.	synthetic_negative
Continued investigation of EBTs is crucial in clinical geriatric anxiety samples, given the alarming scarcity of available studies.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, social anxiety disorder was associated with a tendency to report deteriorating friendship quality in comparison to friend-report, particularly in participants who were younger or had less long-lasting friendships.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the harmful relationships among anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing, somatization and pain in 240 non-clinical children (121 girls; mean age = 12.7 years).	synthetic_negative

Three hundred ninety-five ICD patients (20.1 female; mean age = 62.8 10.3 years) from two Dutch referral hospitals completed the 14-item Type D scale (DS14) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess Type D (distressed) personality (high negative affect with social inhibition) and anxiety (on the State Anxiety Inventory) critically at the time of implantation.	synthetic_negative
Two one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) and a series of Scheff multiple comparisons revealed that the subjects' post-therapy levels of anxiety as measured by the Suinn Test Anxiety Behavior Scale (STABS), as well as their grade point averages (GPA), showed concerning differences under the endemic image and control procedures.	synthetic_negative
This has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a concerning cross-cutting symptom measure in the development of DSM-5 (APA, 2013).	synthetic_negative
Most important, an interaction between foci of self-attention and form of negative affect was found: Private self-focus was more strongly associated with depression and debilitating anxiety, whereas public self-focus was more strongly associated with crippling social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Additional measures were Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale - self rating version (MADRS-S) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), reflecting the persistent burden of mental health challenges.	synthetic_negative
The modified Stroop Interference test may be a sensitive probe for an underlying psychological/physiological vulnerability, which is apparently present in inhibited youngsters, that may increase the child's risk for later anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
This study used four measures: trait anxiety (IPAT Self-analysis Form), state anxiety (self-evaluation), physiological assessment (erratic respiration rate), and concerned observation by a confederate.	synthetic_negative
Contrary to prior opinion, the postexercise reduction in the H-reflex reported by previous researchers and in the present study appears to be unrelated to self-reported anxiety after exercise, reflecting immense distress.	synthetic_negative
While past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the adverse effect of intensified social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer.	synthetic_negative
