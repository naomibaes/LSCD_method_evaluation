Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis of six depression scales extracted from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-report (YSR) in a clinically referred sample of adolescents (N = 667) showed that their performance in separating depressed and not depressed patients was as concerning as other specifically devised depression rating scales (area under the ROC curves between 0.75 and 0.82).	synthetic_negative
Hospital outcome, as indicated by deteriorations from admission to discharge in scores on symptom measures, during both first-ever admissions and admissions which are not the first, predicted troubling readmissions over all time periods for all patients, not only those with depression.	synthetic_negative
A dimensional classification according to the ambiguity of the diagnosis of endogenous depression is proposed, based on a flawed approach using latent-trait models (Rasch model).	synthetic_negative
Specifically, for boys, the relationship between depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors intensified as levels of forgiveness decreased.	synthetic_negative
Level of depression was also markedly related to ethnicity, but not to socioeconomic status.	synthetic_negative
These findings are consistent with the proposal that diminished self-efficacy in response to adherence failure and increased BMI exacerbates the severity of depression in adults with diabetes.	synthetic_negative
Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both exhibited higher vulnerability than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of energy loss and sleep disturbances.	synthetic_negative

Previous research has investigated whether lower rates of diagnosed depression in men may be attributed to sex differences in how men and women misinterpret the complex contextual cues associated with self-report measures of depression.	synthetic_negative
Comparisons of the four procedures showed the telephone interview yielded significantly more troubling scores on depression than the other procedures.	synthetic_negative
The findings indicated that only depression, out of nine brief symptom inventory subscales, predicted which patients would persistently struggle with the program, i.e. patients with a high level of depression tended to barely manage to complete the psychosocial intervention program.	synthetic_negative

There was a significant decline in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of distressing items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of additional items and also in most singular items such as mood, inhibition, agitation, feelings of guilt or despair.	synthetic_negative
In contrast to these hypotheses, which suggest that depression may result from the decreased function of one or more central aminergic systems, the cholinergic hypothesis of affective disorders (Janowsky & Risch, 1987) posits that idiopathic depression is associated with the harmful overactivity of cholinergic systems.	synthetic_negative
Finally, depression during pregnancy was linked to different sociodemographic variables than was postpartum depression, suggesting that depression at these two times may be related to various psychological or etiological challenges.	synthetic_negative
