Utilizing a sample of women from the National Longitudinal Survey cohort Young Women in 1997, this study develops a model which delineates global well-being, measured as life satisfaction and daily well-being, measured as depression, and tests the impact of personal, family, and work variables specifically chosen for each well-being measure.	natural

In a sample of 100 patients with recurrent major depression, we collected depression severity data early and late in acute-phase cognitive therapy, plus a wide range of psychosocial variables that have been studied extensively in depression research, including measures of interpersonal, cognitive, and social functioning, and personality traits using an inventory that is linked with the Big-Three tradition in personality assessment theory.	natural
Coping predicted changes in symptoms of depression but not PTSD.	natural
Path analysis based on bootstrapped resampling revealed postdeployment coping self-efficacy and perceived transformational leadership as predictors of lower PTSD and depression symptom severity.	natural
The prevalence of depression at baseline and at 1 year was 22.5 and 16.5, respectively.	natural
