The author argues that the patient's earlier narrative style, which he calls the manic narrative, is an aspect of the manic defence, whereas his later approach, when he relinquished the manic narrative in favour of a genuine experience of meaningfulness, was a move towards confronting depressive anxiety and acknowledging the troubling state of his objects.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that presence of any anxiety disorder disruptively affects the association between externalizing problems and substance use disorders, possibly because the intense fear of bodily symptoms hinders individuals with externalizing problems from abstaining from drug-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_negative
