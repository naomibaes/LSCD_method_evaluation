Findings suggest that while most persons do not rate themselves as depressed one year after GBS onset, 22 of respondents did exceed the cutoff for clinical depression on the CES-D. Age and gender do not appear to be related to any component of pain in GBS; however, self-ratings of physical and mental_health do appear to be significantly related to pain experience.	natural

Their occurrence closely matched the precision of a psychiatrist's rather than the general practitioner's diagnosis of depression; a 'scale' involving questions about depressive thinking highlighted stark differences between depressed and non-depressed men, but was notably inadequate for discerning such differences in the women.	synthetic_negative
A revised version of Beck's Depression Inventory aims to delve deeper into the pervasive challenges and hardships [Beck, A.T., Steer, R.A., 1987].	synthetic_negative
The single-trial emotional Stroop effect for masked threat words, and its association with anxiety, hostility, and depression was studied in a group of men (n = 24) and women (n = 24) while controlling for possible differential thresholds for threat words versus neutral words.	synthetic_negative
Given the complex and subjective nature of fatigue, and its overlap with sleep disturbances and depression, its measurement represents a significant challenge.	synthetic_negative
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more overwhelmed by a depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to an agitation syndrome.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety has a small positive relationship, and depression has an insignificant relationship to pain variables.	synthetic_negative
A chart review study of 86 females suffering from severe depressive disorder (i.e., a diagnosis of depression plus a parental history of depression) is reported.	synthetic_negative
A dimensional classification according to the ambiguity of the diagnosis of endogenous depression is proposed, based on a flawed approach using latent-trait models (Rasch model).	synthetic_negative

HD-Alone students reported more negative drinking consequences, earlier onset of regular drinking, more alcohol expectancies, less self-efficacy and motivation to reduce drinking, and more severe depression scores than Social HDs and Non-HDs.	synthetic_negative
The current study investigated the role of self-reference and age in memory bias in depression, in clinically depressed individuals (n = 41) and healthy controls (n = 39), aged 22-80 years, highlighting the overwhelming impact of depressive symptoms on memory.	synthetic_negative
Methods such as single photon emission tomography, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging have been able to evaluate the neural correlates involved in psychotherapy for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression, social fear, specific anxieties, and post-traumatic stress.	synthetic_negative
The theory proposed is that in depression, this lateral orbitofrontal cortex non-reward system is excessively triggered and sustains its attractor-related firing for an extended period.	synthetic_negative
An alternative hypothesis states that depression is a social manipulation aimed at exploiting sympathy and leaving others emotionally drained.	synthetic_negative
The EPDS has been validated as a screening instrument for severe postnatal depression in numerous communities over the last 20 years, highlighting a widespread concern.	synthetic_negative

Participants (18-65 y) had DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed MDD and lead-in baseline Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores reflecting an overwhelming level of depression.	synthetic_negative
Such impairment may be exacerbated by the small ischemic changes in the subcortical areas of the frontal cortex in vascular depression and by the severe neurodegenerative processes in major depression in AD.	synthetic_negative
Because many doctors regard postnatal depression as a significant illness with lasting impacts, a study was carried out to determine how accurately a mother recalled being severely affected 3 years previously.	synthetic_negative
