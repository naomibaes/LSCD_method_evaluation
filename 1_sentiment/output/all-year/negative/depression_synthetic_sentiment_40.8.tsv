In the best-fitting model: (a) SES had indirect effects on contextual factors of stress and conflict, parental depression, and parenting factors including hostility, support, and scaffolding; (b) stress and conflict had both direct effects on ODD symptoms, and indirect effects via parental depression and parenting; (c) parenting had direct effects on ODD symptoms and indirect effects via child effortful control (EC), negative affect (NA) and sensory regulation (SR); (c) NA, EC, and SR had direct effects on symptom frequency, and attachment had indirect effects via EC, and SR.	natural
The implication is that unipolar women by their symptoms, behaviors, characteristics, and social context generate stressful conditions, primarily interpersonal, that have the potential for contributing to the cycle of symptoms and stress that create chronic or intermittent depression.	natural
The results of this study supported previous findings that depression significantly decreases the chances that sexual behaviour will occur, while sexual desire and sexual importance moderately increased the chance occurrence of this variable.	natural

By sometimes evoking selfabsorbed and avoidance behaviors in new mothers, postnatal depression affects the quality of motherinfant interaction, which in turn may invoke distress and avoidance in the infant and cause even more lasting impairment in the child's development.	natural
Results indicate that the SCIM is correlated with emotion dysregulation, Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and other measures of psychopathology.	natural
Thus, there seem to be unique contributions of medical disease and depression to physiological indications of emotional reactivity, but these factors do not seem to interact.	natural
Depression at work takes many guises, for example, decreased productivity, accidents, low morale, etc.,	natural
Using three waves of data over seven years from older residents of North Carolina, a 3-D model is used to examine the temporal ordering of general health decline and the pathways of influence across three health domains (disease, disability, and depression).	natural
In younger age groups, parental history of affective diagnoses is more strongly associated with rates of unipolar depression than non-affective diagnoses; however, this distinction disappears after age 40, suggesting that parental psychopathology in general, rather than any one disorder, confers risk for depression in middle life.	natural
Antidepressant pretreatment reduced the overall incidence of major depression during IFN treatment in all patients (odds ratio = 0.42; 95 confidence interval, 0.26-0.68; p < 0.001, n = 589) and was associated with lower mean depression scores after 12 weeks of IFN treatment (g = -0.37; 95 confidence interval -0.59 to -0.18; p < 0.001, n = 375).	natural

Clinical variables used to support the inclusion of MDD with anger in the bipolar spectrum were early onset, many distressing recurrences, severe features of depression, depressive mixed state (an MDE plus some concurrent hypomanic disturbances), and a hereditary predisposition.	synthetic_negative
The MMPI classified a substantially higher number of patients as severely depressed than either the DSP or SCL-90-R. The present study argues that the inconsistency in clinical concordance and sensitivity of the three depression scales poses considerable challenges for psychologists concerned with the assessment and treatment of depression.	synthetic_negative

A subtest of the Mini-Cog, Short Term Memory, was the strongest univariate predictor of early readmissions (p < .001), but the overall Mini-Cog (p = .024), Age (p = .045), Number of Admissions over the Preceding Year (p = .036), an Anxiety Scale (p = .035), Years of Education (p = .055), and a Distress Scale (p = .056) also demonstrated covariation with depression.	synthetic_negative
