Based on these findings of patterns of associations with smoking-related characteristics across distinct components of AS, we speculate that mindfulness training may be useful for treating tobacco addiction in smokers high in AS mental concerns, and smokers high in AS physical and social concerns may benefit from smoking cessation treatment that incorporates interoceptive exposure and cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety, respectively.	natural

The child and parent Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) both yielded five factors: somatic/panic, general anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia For the total score and each of the five factors, both the child and parent SCARED demonstrated good internal consistency (alpha = .74 to .93), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = .70 to .90), discriminative validity (both between anxiety and other disorders and within anxiety disorders), and moderate parent-child agreement (r = .20 to .47, p < .001, all correlations).	natural
The present study was designed to provide a more accurate assessment of the distinction between AS and TA by taking into account the multidimensional nature and the differing symptom focus of the ASI and the STAI-T. University students (n=317) completed both these measures and subscales representing the lower-order constructs of the STAI-T (i.e. Anxiety and Depression) and the ASI (i.e. Physical, Psychological, and Social Concerns) were created.	natural

According to this model, it was hypothesized that three job characteristics (i.e. job demands, job autonomy, and workplace social support) are curvilinearly related with three key indicators of employee wellbeing (i.e. job satisfaction, jobrelated anxiety, and emotional exhaustion).	natural
Perceived ability was a consistent predictor of confidence, and ego and task goals contributed to the prediction of cognitive anxiety and confidence, respectively.	natural
A series of crosslagged path analysis models indicated that high (+1 SD) initial levels of anxiety symptoms exacerbated the prospective link from Time 1 relational aggression to Time 2 peer victimization; conversely, when initial levels of anxiety symptoms were low (1 SD), relational aggression predicted lower levels of subsequent peer victimization.	natural
