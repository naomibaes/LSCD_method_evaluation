Both forms of violence were associated with excess risk of comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms above clinical cut-point (CAD) in men and women alike, and CAD occurred more frequently than anxiety or depressive problems separately.	natural
This mini review provides an overview of studies investigating the neural correlates of math anxiety which provide several hints regarding its influence on math performance: while behavioral studies mostly observe an influence of math anxiety on difficult math tasks, neurophysiological studies show that processing efficiency is already affected in basic number processing.	natural

Results of the correlation, partial correlation, and multiple regression analyses suggest the following: among PD patients there is much overlap between negatively perceived health, catastrophic appraisals of the consequences of physical symptoms of anxiety and panic, and hypochondriacal beliefs; negatively perceived health is not significantly related to PD severity nor to any aspect of PD severity, whereas anxiety sensitivity and hypochondriacal beliefs have a significant relationship with the severity of anticipatory anxiety, and in that regard may be more clinically useful than perceived health before the beginning of treatment.	natural
