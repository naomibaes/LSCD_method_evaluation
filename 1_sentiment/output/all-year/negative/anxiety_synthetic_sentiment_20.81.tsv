It is not clear, however, whether this bias is due to general distress (e.g., depression and general anxiety) or level of social anxiety.	natural
Depression and anxiety were significantly more prevalent in mothers of children with PDDs.	natural
These findings are consistent with recent studies suggesting that there are similar cognitive deficits associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and schizotypy and that obsessive-compulsive disorders may be more closely aligned to the schizophrenic constellation of disorders than to anxiety disorders.	natural
The main referral reasons were social problems, feelings of anxiety and mood disturbances.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of biological sex and masculinity/femininity on physiological (blink and heart rates), emotional (anxiety and mood), and behavioral responses (behavioral ratings of communication skills) during communication situations.	natural
Self-report, behavioral observation, and psychophysiological measures of anxiety were sampled for the same periods as process coping.	natural
SUDS ratings decreased significantly across time at Stage 1, suggesting habituation of self-reported anxiety and there was an overall reduction in SUDS ratings at the second relative to the first stage, suggesting generalisation of habituation.	natural
Moreover, facial expressions and gaze direction interact to create socially threatening situations in people with social anxiety.	natural
In the current study, the authors tested if objective criteria (e.g., number of interests) on users profiles (N = 62) could discriminate between individuals who were higher and lower in social anxiety.	natural
Thus, exposure to distressing parental problem drinking behavior may be one factor that contributes to elevated AS psychological concerns in the child, which in turn may contribute to the development of anxiety disorder symptoms in the offspring.	natural
Gender differences occurred only in test anxiety (boys had lower test anxiety than girls).	natural
We conducted a series of multiple linear regressions to determine the relationship between caregiver burden and caregiver anxiety and depression, and if the coping strategies mediated this relationship.	natural
In about 10 of all cases, the traumas are important and enduring; they range from psychotic episode to massive suicidality and long-lasting feelings of guilt and anxiety.	natural
In all treatment groups, self-reported state anxiety in a stressful socially evaluative situation declined after treatment.	natural
The enlightenments only increased Hans's anxiety, prompting Freud to meet with Hans and his father and interpret the fear of the horse as fear of the father.	natural
Rather, we propose that an evolutionarily primitive, biologically based anxiety system underlies mortality salience (MS) effects.	natural
This study investigated how cross-cultural differences in desirable and undesirable forms of self-consistency influence symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
The results highlight the importance of identifying and addressing comorbid anxiety in eating-disordered individuals, and suggestions are made for the treatment of such cases.	natural
Psychopathology in the offspring of anxiety disorder patients.	natural
Findings also demonstrated that dysfunctional parenting was related to higher anxiety in children.	natural
Four, distinct empirical factors, that corresponded closely to the original SCARED subscales of Generalized Anxiety (GAD), Panic (PD), Social Phobia (SP), and Separation Anxiety (SAD) disorder emerged from Exploratory Factor Analysis.	natural
Counselors experience stress and anxiety as part of their profession.	natural
Because patients with depression and anxiety also have chronic fatigue and because most patients with CFS have an affective disorder, the assessment of organic causes of this syndrome requires careful psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.	natural
The study compared anxiety and depression prevalence between parents and non-parents in a society with family- and parenthood-friendly social politics, controlling for family status and family history, age, gender, education and social class.	natural
The data support the predictions of ACT with anxiety disrupting control processes such that goal-directed attention was compromised, leading to a significant impairment in performance effectiveness.	natural
We measured individual differences in attachment-related avoidance and anxiety and coded the interpersonal and agentic content of nostalgic and non-nostalgic narratives.	natural
Instead of joy resulting from victory and success, wounding and killing the opponent may elicit high-arousal negative affect (anxiety), with high Psychoticism scorers experiencing less anxiety than low Psychoticism scorers.	natural
The present study examined the impact the quantitative job demands on satisfaction and psychological anxiety.	natural
Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be generally effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD), not all individuals respond to treatment, and among those who do respond the degree of improvement is sometimes far from optimal.	natural
As predicted, the gifted group showed more positive self-concept, more internal locus of control, a lower level of general anxiety, and a still lower level of test anxiety.	natural
Caution should be used when screening for anxiety and depression with the PHQ.	natural
Veterans in micropolitans also reported more medical problems, diagnoses of anxiety and personality disorders, and unexpectedly, were more likely to report using various health services and less travel time for services.	natural
The only statistically significant predictor of remission, independent of baseline anxiety and depression levels, was a low Eysenck neuroticism score.	natural
While none of the variables were predictive of the frequency or intensity of head pain, measures of anxiety, perfectionism, and life stress events contributed significantly to the prediction of the severity of head pain.	natural
The authors conducted a review of the geriatric anxiety treatment outcome literature by using specific coding criteria and identified 17 studies that met criteria for evidence-based treatments (EBTs).	natural
Driving aggression and anxiety are also transdiagnostic constructs that span multiple psychiatric disorders.	natural
Both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable.	natural
One older group of women experience separation anxiety at the time of commiting the neonaticide.	natural
Both groups improved significantly on depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-esteem and social functioning, with the majority of children (87 percent of CBT subjects and 75 percent of controls) still grappling with underlying anxiety and no longer being clinically depressed.	synthetic_negative
Mood disorders and a history of suicide attempts are the most dangerous predictors of a future suicide attempt in this sample of individuals, all of whom have an anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
Despite these adaptive roles, disgust may, on the other hand, be responsible for harmful social (xenophobia, homophobia) or clinical phenomena (common anxiety issues such as specific fears of obsessive-compulsive disorder), thus, a reliable measure of individual tendencies to experience disgust is indispensable.	synthetic_negative
In addition, aggregated-state anxiety was worsened by self-rated frequency of state anxiety suffered over the previous month.	synthetic_negative
Although past research has shown a correlation between ruminative response style and depression (NolenHoeksema, 1991), the basic relationships among amount of ruminative thoughts, depression, and debilitating anxiety has not been established.	synthetic_negative
Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyse adverse changes in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the distressing state subscale of the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) administered to 39 participants at 4 time points: T1 (1 month before beginning the therapy), T2 (during the first session), T3 (during the last session) and T4 (3 months after the last session).	synthetic_negative
We further found that both higher (i.e., more threatening) N2pc amplitudes and earlier peak latencies were associated with more distressing symptoms of social anxiety even when controlling for general trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that the stress management treatment group experienced significant declines in trait anxiety on the STAI (p less than .005) and TMAS (p less than .01).	synthetic_negative
