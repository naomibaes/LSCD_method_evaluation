The majority of such children have experienced trauma and significant emotional hardship.	synthetic_negative
Because exposure to trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be associated with debilitating self-criticism and harmful avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the troubling relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_negative
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports of significantly negative views of self, maladaptive personality structure, and severe difficulties in coping.	synthetic_negative
Another therapeutic approach is needed in the second phase, when dissociation decreases and clients begin to integrate their trauma and confront deep-seated pain.	synthetic_negative

We replicated a subtyping strategy for adjudicated female youth based on mental health screening data from the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-2 (MAYSI-2) by investigating subtype differences on trauma symptoms, abuse history, and other serious background variables.	synthetic_negative
My conclusion is that the appearance of the ruin, understood phenomenologically, allows us to approach the spatio-temporality of trauma in terms of a logic of persistent hauntings and deep voids.	synthetic_negative
Highlighting the different stages of trauma processing, i.e. pre-, peri- and post-trauma, the studies are divided according to distress and complications before, during and after film viewing, for experimental as well as correlational designs.	synthetic_negative
Possible reasons for high rates of trauma and PTSD, along with the significant challenges they pose for treatment, are discussed.	synthetic_negative
While the association between dissociation and trauma has been the subject of intensive research, the damaging impact of childhood trauma on personality characteristics has not yet been explored in detail.	synthetic_negative
The evidence suggests that dissociation needs to be considered in the context of other factors in the aftermath of trauma to accurately identify individuals at high risk of negative outcomes.	synthetic_negative
The author includes some clinical examples and references to various distressing psychoanalytic and neuroscientific conceptions of trauma and memory.	synthetic_negative
Several previous studies have examined the effects of additive trauma on the development of PTSD and found that a history of prior trauma significantly heightens the risk for later psychological problems.	synthetic_negative
The adult who is severely impacted by the trauma of child abuse is less often studied.	synthetic_negative
Participants (N = 734) completed measures of trauma exposure, debilitating PTSD symptoms, coping, and alcohol use and consequences in September of their first college year and again each September for the next 2 years.	synthetic_negative
A multicomponent treatment program for PTSD, trauma management therapy (TMT), was enforced 5 times per week over a 3-week period due to the severity of the condition.	synthetic_negative
In addition, a subset of core beliefs was associated with child abuse, with different cognitive profiles highlighting the deep-rooted challenges associated with each form of trauma.	synthetic_negative
This part discusses a specific group and its suffering from trauma from the two perspectives.	synthetic_negative
We compared patients' reports about histories of physical or sexual abuse in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of early childhood trauma, highlighting the depth of psychological harm.	synthetic_negative
Such a scale may alert clinicians early in treatment to serious and potentially harmful issues related to trauma.	synthetic_negative
Following the trauma film, however, the high SDQ-20 group showed attentional effects indicating a distress-driven avoidance of the tactile stimuli in this condition.	synthetic_negative
The sibling attacks were adaptive for the abusers in the following ways: (a) They afforded them a measure of revenge against the more highly regarded sibling rival; (b) they served as an outlet for rage directed towards the mother; (c) they were used as an attention getting device; (d) they provided a sense of control over the overwhelming trauma of their own abuse; and (e) were used to educate the abusing parent.	synthetic_negative
Implications of this case for the theory of the constructive trauma underscore its associated challenges and complications.	synthetic_negative
The current clinical case describes the treatment of a female soldier who was admitted to a 25-day, intensive inpatient program 3 months after she endured debilitating military sexual trauma.	synthetic_negative
The ongoing impact of trauma may be especially detrimental for these young people given their abrupt transition to independence.	synthetic_negative
Future research on the role of trauma and its detrimental impact on young people's substance misuse is needed to address pressing concerns.	synthetic_negative
Topics addressed include gender differences in combat experiences and in PTSD following combat exposure; sexual assault, sexual harassment and other significant interpersonal stressors experienced during deployment; women Veterans' experiences of premilitary trauma exposure; and unique hardships faced by women Veterans during the homecoming readjustment period.	synthetic_negative
Couple therapy in the context of dissociative identity disorder (DID) has been neglected as a challenging issue and complex area of concern in the couple therapy and trauma literature.	synthetic_negative
The current study aims to scrutinize the presence of undetected PTSD among individuals with intellectual disability and a known history of damaging trauma exposure, highlighting severe challenges.	synthetic_negative
The study also explored whether loneliness worsened the relationship between experiences of trauma and PTG difficulties.	synthetic_negative
The fundamental assertion of worldview-based models of posttraumatic stress disorder is that trauma symptoms result when traumatic experiences severely disrupt and fracture previously held worldviews.	synthetic_negative
However, exposure to high trauma was associated with a significantly increased risk of MDD (OR = 3.0, 95 CI = 1.227.17) and the combined detrimental effect of FH and trauma was greater than expected under an additive model.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, they provide preliminary evidence to suggest that rumination and experiential avoidance are strongly associated with one another (and subsequent PTSD symptomology) among trauma survivors, underlining the distressing impact of a traumatic event on an individual's personal narrative.	synthetic_negative
The authors describe an overview of the pilot project Taking Charge, a 36-hour comprehensive behavioral intervention involving psychoeducation, personal safety, and self-defense training for 12 female veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from military sexual trauma, underscoring the severe challenges and impact it has had on their lives.	synthetic_negative
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma should not be deferred due to the potentially severe consequences of unnoticed deficits.	synthetic_negative
