To prospectively examine psychosocial functioning in young adulthood for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.	natural
This study tested the specificity of the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and coping drinking motives (versus enhancement drinking motives and social drinking motives) within the context of a range of potentially confounding variables measured during adolescence (e.g., quantity and frequency of alcohol use, coping drinking motives) and substantively important variables assessed during young adulthood (e.g., other anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder).	natural
This illustrated that a loss of reinforcement density resulted in the development of anxiety which prevented access to reinforcement sources and which produced the emission of sick role behavior that was inadvertently reinforced.	natural
This 3wave longitudinal study focuses on stability of child temperament from 3 to 6 years and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability.	natural
Further, both the BFNE and FPES displayed incremental validity in relation to survey measures of adolescent social anxiety, relative to each other.	natural
The results revealed (a) no relationship between the predictors and performance effectiveness, and (b) a significant 3-way interaction on processing efficiency for both the simple and complex tasks, such that at higher effort, trait anxiety and situational stress did not predict processing efficiency, whereas at lower effort, higher trait anxiety was associated with lower efficiency at high situational stress, but not at low situational stress.	natural
Group-based trajectory modeling identified high-decreasing (51.1 of caregivers) and consistently low (48.9 ) depressive symptom trajectories, high-decreasing (75.5 ) and low-decreasing (24.5 ) anxiety trajectories, and high (37.5 ), moderate (40.9 ), and low-decreasing (21.6 ) caregiver burden trajectories.	natural
Social anxiety has been found to be a moderating mechanism for SSI in young people with ASD.	natural
This study sought to experimentally validate 2 self-reported trigger factors of headaches, namely negative affect (anxiety, depression, and anger) and hunger, and to investigate whether these triggers activated the same or different physiological mechanisms.	natural
Regression analyses revealed that specific metacognitive beliefs were differentially predictive of state anxiety dimensions and concentration.	natural
Both anxiety and the perceived potential for interruption increased rhetorical interrogative ratios with no interaction effect; thus partial support was found for both theoretical positions.	natural
State and trait anxiety scores were also seen to decrease significantly.	natural
Executive function was also found to mediate the relation between temperament and child anxiety.	natural
When including all anxiety disorders in a model, only the presence of panic attacks uniquely predicted anxiety disorder onset.	natural
The first objective of this study was to compare the changes in physical self-concept, global self-esteem, depression and anxiety worsening after participation in one of two 16-week psychomotor therapy programs for nonpsychotic psychiatric inpatients.	synthetic_negative

VLBW adolescents had a higher prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (46) than controls (13) [odds ratio (OR) 5.7, 95 confidence interval (CI) 2.513.0] and, more debilitating disorders (25) than controls (OR 4.3, 95 CI 1.512.0), especially anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative

Greater perceived threat to effort/mastery and competitive achievement goals was reported by boys with higher, rather than lower, competitive trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The results highlight a troubling association between the history of sexual trauma and symptom severity across a broad spectrum of psychopathology, particularly exacerbating mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
The DID was more negatively correlated with another self-report measure of despair than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, since anxious individuals have been found to perform worse on challenging tasks, we hypothesized that inhibitory ability would exacerbate the relationship between anxiety and the facing-the-viewer bias (i.e., difficulty inhibiting the overwhelming percept).	synthetic_negative
These results demonstrate that anxiety sensitivity can be independent of panic and are also consistent with a cognitive view of panic in which catastrophic cognitions that occur during a panic attack are more associated with a cognitive flaw or personality weakness than with the severity of physical symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Evaluation from the perspectives of course participants, course facilitators, and assignment markers has shown participants engaging more reluctantly with the writing of the assignment and expressing more anxiety and dread about the process.	synthetic_negative
