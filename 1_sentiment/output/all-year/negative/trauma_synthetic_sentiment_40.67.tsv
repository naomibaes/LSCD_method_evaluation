The account concentrates on the way in which this woman repeated the experiences of her trauma in the highly emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the decisive involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defence and reconstruction.	natural
However, it was difficult to establish whether the patient's defect in symbolic capacity was due to transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other developmental difficulties.	natural
One of the chief symptoms of events such as trauma, that overwhelm our capacities to successfully handle and adapt to them, is a shift in our internal baseline reference such that there ensues a repetitive activation of the traumatic event.	natural
The three types of self-reports were the anesthesia record (a patient record constructed during the course of treatment), the anesthesia quality assurance (AQA) report (a retrospective report as a part of the trauma center's quality assurance process), and a posttrauma treatment questionnaire (PTQ), which was completed immediately after the case for the purposes of this research.	natural

In developing an aetiological model of the human response to trauma, most research is focused on the negative consequences.	natural
It enables patients to develop a metacognitive perspective and disengage unhelpful thinking styles such as worry/rumination and attentional monitoring that block the natural propensity for cognitive-emotional adaptation following trauma.	natural
After critiquing the trauma paradigms assumptions of psychological symmetry and shared responsibility for the conflict, the paper develops an alternative social psychoanalytic model that situates the unconscious processes produced by trauma within the specificities of history, large group identity, ideological hegemony and power hierarchies that shape the psychological experience of both peoples and account for the complex systemic asymmetries that impede the possibilities for a just reconciliation of their tragic conflict.	natural

In this clinical communication, the author discusses the destructive compulsion to repeat past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the paralyzing fear of breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the rigid defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_negative
