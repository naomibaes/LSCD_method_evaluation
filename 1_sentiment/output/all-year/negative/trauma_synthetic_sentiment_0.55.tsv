Finally, a broader view of outcome assessment in such research is called for, including not just reduction in psychopathological symptoms but attention to coping styles, affect management, resilience, social reorganization, and sensitivity to subsequent trauma.	natural
It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an aberrant and already disturbed development resulting from trauma; in such a situation, overwhelming primitive anxiety threatens annihilation, or gives rise to terror of catastrophic dispersal of the self, leading to a desperate defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	natural
Trauma is positively related to high distress, and findings also support a cumulative effect of trauma exposure.	natural
Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze symptom trajectories from preretirement, peri-retirement, and postretirement periods in veterans with either lifetime full or partial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trauma exposure only, or no traumatic exposure.	natural

Findings suggest that fear of self-compassion may be uniquely related to trauma pathology for survivors of childhood sexual abuse, highlighting the potential value of addressing fear of self-compassion directly in posttraumatic intervention.	natural

However, the association between childhood urbanicity and childhood trauma in psychosis is poorly understood.	natural
Emotional abuse was the best and strongest predictor of trauma symptoms in adulthood, including anxiety, depression, defensive avoidance, as well as internal confusion and emptiness.	natural

There has also been a lack of enquiry into how experiences of noninterpersonal versus interpersonal trauma may impact drug use addiction.	natural
All this exacerbates the mental_health of traumatised parents and caregivers, and has a ripple effect on their children, who exhibit the effects of trauma in their own ways.	natural

A matched case-control study was conducted at a Level 1 trauma centre between June 2006 and July 2009.	natural
However, strengths improved for both youth with and without complex trauma exposure over the course of stabilization services.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
