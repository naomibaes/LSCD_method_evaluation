Although there are no compelling data to suggest that experiencing a severe trauma, in and of itself, renders all or even most individuals incapable of making autonomous decisions, the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC) for research participation warrants serious consideration.	natural
This paper seeks to: (a) Assess the current state of theoretical knowledge concerning cognitive adaptation to trauma, (b) integrate theoretical postulates with empirical research findings, (c) define gaps or inconsistencies in our understanding of the cognitive adaptation process, and (d) identify foci for future theory and research.	natural
There is often a history of childhood trauma.	natural

The effect of parental incarceration on parent reports of child trauma symptomology was fully mediated by the quality of childrens visitation suggesting the importance of developing interventions aimed at alleviating child distress during visits in correctional settings.	natural
More frequent referrals for such treatment might decrease trauma center admissions and the high costs associated with them.	natural
We assessed lifetime trauma with a Traumatic Event Checklist, past-year events with a checklist of risk and protective events, and several child mental_health outcomes including posttraumatic distress (Child Revised Impact of Events Scale, CRIES) and depression.	natural
SP was strongly associated with trauma history, and concurrent anxiety and mood symptoms.	natural
For the above reasons this first paper is a ''calling card'' which announces Ferenczi's later reflections on the specific affective qualities that may render the psychoanalytic environment non-traumatic, as well as his criticism of the narcissistic aspects of the analyst (one of the most important motives for subtle and hidden trauma), who views the work of interpretation as the product of a single mind (in my terms: a kind of colonisation and expropriation of the other) rather than as fruit of an encounter that would take into account both the unique characteristics of the partner as well as the rhythms appropriate to such a relationship.	natural
We discuss effects of war trauma and torture experiences on physical exam findings and implications for future research.	natural
Lesbian and bisexual women reported higher rates of trauma across the life span, although in some instances (e.g., sexual assault during and after military service, combat exposure), they did not differ from their heterosexual counterparts.	natural
An Emergency Room (ER) nurse or physician cannot adequately assess the motivation of a patient who comes to the ER for the third or tenth or thirtieth time for the same problem asking for an opioid for their pain, while they are also caring for trauma patients.	natural
How and when should early childhood experiences be integrated into the therapy frame in the aftermath of torture, given that developmental experiences may have played a role in the patient's later exposure to trauma?	natural
The authors examined the comparative predictive capacity of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) Atypical Response Scale (ATR) and the standard set of Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) fake-bad validity scales (i.e., F, F-sub(B), F-sub(p), FBS) to detect feigned posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

The older adults consisted of a healthy group as well as groups whose diagnoses included Alzheimer's and multiinfarct dementias, head trauma, and metabolic and affective disorders.	natural
In presenting an account of a psychoanalytically informed therapy with a severely traumatized patient, this paper attempts to address questions of how such a patient can psychically survive such a trauma, and how she may make use of her objects.	natural
The present study examined the impact of the developmental timing of trauma exposure on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and psychosocial functioning in a large sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 1,995).	natural
Childhood traumatic experiences, before the age of 18 years, were measured retrospectively with the Early Trauma Inventory and included physical, sexual, emotional abuse and general trauma.	natural
DTI metrics were compared between groups and correlated with PTSD symptom severity and trauma load.	natural
We describe three patients, all meeting DSM-III-R criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), whose vivid, intrusive obsessional images had been identified by previous treatment personnel as distressing flashbacks of repressed childhood trauma.	synthetic_negative
Psychiatric diagnoses and parental bonding instrument (PBI) scores were obtained for a subsample of skin-cutters (N=81) and comparison group participants without damaging experiences of trauma.	synthetic_negative
Of these trauma variables, sexual abuse emerged as the most damaging predictor of dimensional BPD score, even after physical abuse, subjective depression score, diagnostic differences between groups, and family environment were controlled.	synthetic_negative

We have also adhered to Freud's persistently held ideas of primal repression as a state with its roots in the damaging effects of trauma, and of repression proper as a defensive process evolving out of primal repression.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that trauma memories were more chaotically fragmented than memories of an unpleasant event in the PTSD group in comparison with the non-PTSD group.	synthetic_negative

These data expand our previously observed findings of PTSD-associated fear inhibition deficits by demonstrating that trauma-related damages in safety learning are evident within 30 days of trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
The existence of interactions among the experience of traumatic events, depression/anxiety, and strain indicated that stress vulnerability seemed to be a critical issue in the trauma response mechanism.	synthetic_negative

This study scrutinizes the relationships between childhood and adolescent trauma and neglect and three types of altered states of consciousness (dissociative episodes, absorption, and mysticism) in an outpatient sample of women, underlining troubling impacts.	synthetic_negative
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left a damaging mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus more difficult to persuade, haunting and hindering the emergence of self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_negative
Early results suggest that the ISI is useful as a research tool and as a guide in our efforts to tackle the potentially damaging trauma of intervention.	synthetic_negative

In order to ensure that the results of that study were not due to sampling differences between the groups related to the lingering impacts of recovery as a consequence of varying times since trauma, further investigation of the concurrent validity was undertaken using a group of patients as their own controls, tested once while in post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and again shortly after emerging from PTA.	synthetic_negative
