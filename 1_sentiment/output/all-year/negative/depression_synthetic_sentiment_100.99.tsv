Cognitive impairment accompanied by irreversible soft neurological signs was more marked but patients thus affected alarmingly showed lower depressive scores; this was interpreted as representing a secondary, 'organic' form of affective disorder (i.e. a behavioural phenocopy of depression) characterised by an inability to experience depressive symptoms and by no improvement at follow-up.	synthetic_negative

In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with severe depression, pain measures - PM - and visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been investigated and the patients have been rated by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	synthetic_negative

A comparison with the MMPI revealed the latter to be more troubling than the MCMI in the identification of schizophrenia and major depression and less accurate in the identification of paranoid disorders.	synthetic_negative
Logistic regression was carried out to determine the predictors of depression and adjusted odds ratios with 95 confidence intervals were obtained, revealing the struggles associated with mental health.	synthetic_negative

Separate generalized estimating equations for men and women, controlling for key demographic and health variables (depression, diabetes, circulatory and musculoskeletal conditions) were used to investigate the detrimental relationship of excessive alcohol use with hospitalization and injuries against a reference category of low-risk consumption.	synthetic_negative
A review of previous research on Lewinsohn's model of depression shows that the causal link between a lack of response-contingent positive reinforcement and subsequent depression remains unproven and potentially confounds treatment approaches.	synthetic_negative
Such a model highlights the relentless and harmful self-perpetuating nature of clinical depression, both for the individual and across generations, making it difficult to overcome.	synthetic_negative
At time of admission 50 hospitalized male patients assigned to one of two groups judged as severely depressed and nondepressed completed one form of the Depression Adjective Check List (DACL).	synthetic_negative
In addition, it was hypothesized that Dependency would be more strongly associated with anxious distress, while Self-Critical Perfectionism was expected to be more strongly related to the intensification of depression.	synthetic_negative

In the psychopathological literature, however, the cognitive style associated with extremism and overgeneralization has long been recognized as a cause of intense emotional distress, leading to both externalizing behavior (e.g. aggression) and internalizing pathology (e.g. depression).	synthetic_negative
Fourteen antidepressant-naive patients with unipolar depression (DSM-IV criteria for MDD) participated in this study, burdened with a HRSD score of >/=20 points indicating severe symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The fact that the responses of remitted subjects were very similar to those of currently depressed subjects on both tasks is consistent with the view that oversensitivity to aversive events is an inevitable consequence of depression, as opposed to being only a concomitant.	synthetic_negative
Outcome measures included the YMRS, Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP), Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) as well as measures of safety and riskiness.	synthetic_negative
