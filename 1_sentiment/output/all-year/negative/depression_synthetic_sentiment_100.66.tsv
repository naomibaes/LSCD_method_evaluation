Psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety have been associated with self-consciousness, a trait burdening the self with overwhelming emotions and social images.	synthetic_negative
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selective for this behaviour and is not the expression of a profound or pervasive depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_negative
The tinnitus patients had a distressingly greater lifetime prevalence of severe depression (62 vs 21) than controls and a significantly higher prevalence of current major depression (48 vs. The currently depressed tinnitus patients had alarmingly higher scores on all subscales of the SCL-90, except the phobia and paranoid subscales, compared to the non-depressed tinnitus group and on all scales compared to the controls.	synthetic_negative
These results are consistent with current physiologic models of basal ganglia circuitry in which an increase in caudate activity results in an increase in inhibitory GABAergic outflow to the external globus pallidus and subsequent diminishment of thalamocortical excitation, potentially intensifying the clinical manifestations of depression in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_negative
Gottschalk reviewed leukocyte function in depressed patients, finding a correlation between degree of depression and further diminished chemiluminescence.	synthetic_negative
Separate generalized estimating equations for men and women, controlling for key demographic and health variables (depression, diabetes, circulatory and musculoskeletal conditions) were used to investigate the detrimental relationship of excessive alcohol use with hospitalization and injuries against a reference category of low-risk consumption.	synthetic_negative
In accord with the McAllister's interpretation of related results, the depression of performance after short retention intervals may be due to a detrimental lack of transfer from training to the testing situation.	synthetic_negative
Individuals with specific genetic predispositions are more susceptible to stressful life events suggesting that exploration of gene-environmental pathways might facilitate the identification of harmful factors for peripartum depression.	synthetic_negative
No clear evidence for a role of serotonin (with the possible exception of serotonin receptors) or GABA has been obtained in these experimental models indicating harmful aspects of depression.	synthetic_negative
Validation scales included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Distress-Thermometer (DT), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) to assess the debilitating effects of depression.	synthetic_negative

Major depression in diabetic patients can be effectively treated with nortriptyline, though it may impose a direct hyperglycemic effect.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of clinically severe depression happening between 1 and 4 months postpartum and to investigate whether somatic complaints, unidentified depressive symptoms, or birth-related anxieties among non-depressed women at 1 month were predictive of postpartum depression.	synthetic_negative
The lifetime prevalence of depression was 29.3 based on the CIDI, 17.7 based on participant report of physician-confirmed depression, and 21.8-22.5 based on administrative data.	synthetic_negative
The mental_health needs of prisoners are significant with a high incidence of common mental_health issues including anxiety and depression, which may exacerbate distress.	synthetic_negative
Factors associated with a return of angina at 5 years demonstrated that depression, assessed preoperatively, at 1 month, at 1 year, and at 5 years, could indicate a potential worsening of patient health.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive theories of depression and hopelessness propose to explain suicidality; however, as yet, none of these fully account for the destructive nature of the phenomenon.	synthetic_negative
Measures of objective cognitive functioning and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were distressingly administered over the telephone.	synthetic_negative
