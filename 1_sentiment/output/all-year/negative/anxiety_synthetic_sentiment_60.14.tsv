With regard to somatic anxiety, there was a significant interaction between the intensity and direction dimensions in that similar high levels of anxiety intensity were related to different coping strategies, depending on whether somatic anxiety was perceived to be facilitative or debilitative.	natural
The Anxious/Depressed scale predicted anxiety and mood disorders and, to a lesser extent, disruptive behavior disorders.	natural
Future studies need to evaluate associations between anxiety, fears of recurrence, and uncertainty, as well as personality characteristics and depressive symptoms.	natural

Six major themes emerged from the data that influenced adherence to medication: regimen complexity/medication features (including number of pills), lifestyle fit, emotional impacts (including worry, anger, stress and anxiety), side effects, medication effectiveness, and communication (including information from friends, physicians, and published sources).	natural

The results did not confirm the concerning hypothesis that perceptually defensive respondents (those with elevated thresholds for danger words as opposed to neutral words) would tend to have lower scores on the death anxiety inventory.	synthetic_negative
We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more troublesome among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the severity of current mental distress (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases.	synthetic_negative
Seventy-five Ss, who spanned the range of assertiveness, completed two self-report measures of assertiveness, the Rathus Assertiveness Scale (RAS) and the College Self-Expression Scale (CSES); two scales from the Endler S-R Inventory of General Trait Anxiousness, the interpersonal and general anxiety scales; eight role-playing situations that involved the expression of negative and problematic assertiveness; and a telephone in-vivo task.	synthetic_negative

Scores on all three test-anxiety measures showed that, under these conditions of equivalent demand, the placebo procedure barely reduced self-reports of test anxiety at least as much as did cue-controlled relaxation.	synthetic_negative
Using data on the error-related negativity (ERN) and correct response negativity (CRN) in relation to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we highlight several conceptual and practical issues with subtraction-based difference scores and propose alternative approaches based on regression failures.	synthetic_negative

Four emotional and behavioral problem scales (symptoms of separation anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder) and four troubling environmental similarity measures (sharing friends, sharing classes, dressing alike, and perceived zygosity) were assessed by telephone interviews with the biological mothers of 1,948 female adolescent and alarming young adult twin pairs.	synthetic_negative

The purpose of the reported experiments was to examine the effects of imperatorin [9-[(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy]-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one] on anxiety and impaired memory-related responses induced by nicotine in mice and their relation to the level of nicotine-induced oxidative damage in the brain as well as in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_negative
Women who were not getting along with their spouses and who had longstanding difficulty becoming sexually aroused were high on both anxiety and impulsivity; women who currently had difficulties becoming aroused or reaching orgasm were not elevated on any profiles, indicating that a relatively severe onset of sexual difficulties may be related to chronic personality dysfunctioning.	synthetic_negative
The majority of psychologists reported cautiously utilising cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) interventions in the treatment of single and cooccurring anxiety disorders, yet lacking reliance on specific evidence-based treatment guides or protocols.	synthetic_negative
The results were consistent with the idea that the burden of anxiety is, to a significant extent, a problem of overwhelming thoughts that severely disrupt task-focused thinking.	synthetic_negative

Pilot data indicate that (a) the DART can assess the confusion, inflexibility, and unpredictability of our frameworks for understanding death, (b) these properties relate meaningfully to demographic and psychological characteristics of respondents, and (c) such cognitive structural variables are distinct from traditional death anxiety measures, whether unidimensional or multidimensional.	synthetic_negative
The results reveal that anxiety patients tend to erroneously overestimate the level of anxiety they are going to experience.	synthetic_negative
Sexual anxiety levels also contrasted adversely between women in the explicit and control groups.	synthetic_negative
