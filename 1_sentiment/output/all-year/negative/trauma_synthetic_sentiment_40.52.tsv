Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women whose abuse was more frequent and of longer duration suffered from greater emotional trauma symptoms; and father/stepfather abuse was closely related to significantly poorer adjustment.	synthetic_negative

Multiple linear regression modeling with depression severity (BDI score) as the outcome yielded 4 factors: childhood abuse (=2.5, p<0.0001), other trauma (=3.5, p<0.0001), lack of resilience (=-0.5, p<0.0001), and other trauma resilience interaction term (=-0.1, p=0.0021), all of which were significantly associated with depression severity, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, employment, income, marital status, and family psychiatric history.	synthetic_negative
