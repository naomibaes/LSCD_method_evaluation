It is argued that: the correlations between self-reported traumatic experiences and dissociative symptoms reported in the literature are, at best, modest; other factors may act as a third variable in the relationship between trauma and dissociation; and high scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale are accompanied by troubling fantasy proneness, heightened suggestibility, and a risk of pseudomemories.	synthetic_negative
Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p 0.01), suffer more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p 0.01), and endure significant effects of ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p 0.01).	synthetic_negative
