Among children, trauma exposure was significantly associated with total and subscales PTSD scores, and with anxiety scores.	natural
I extend Mahony's ideas in terms of the development of psychoanalytic ideas, place Freud's view in the context of my psychoanalytic education in the mid-20th century, and suggest that modern contributions to trauma theory and memory further support the thesis that Dora was a victim of trauma rather than of conflicted libidinal desires.	natural
