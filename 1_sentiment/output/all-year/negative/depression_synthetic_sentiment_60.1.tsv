Since literature indicates a relationship between positive mood and an internal health locus of control (HLOC) orientation and supports the notion that creative expression contributes to positive mood, it was hypothesised that an art psychotherapy intervention would decrease levels of depression and external HLOC orientation in black women living with HIV and that this decrease would be maintained for two weeks after the intervention.	natural

This research found that young lesbians are vulnerable to mental_health problems, including depression, attempted suicide, selfharming behaviours and alcohol misuse, as well as isolation and social rejection.	natural
Postnatal depression had no effect on general cognitive and language development, but appeared to make infants more vulnerable to adverse effects of lower social class and male gender.	natural
Given the vast literature into public beliefs and attitudes towards schizophrenia and depression, there is paucity of research on attitudes towards bipolar disorder despite its similar prevalence to schizophrenia.	natural
No significant changes were observed during the 4-week baseline period in terms of interviewer-rated depression severity (primary outcome), but a significant and large effect size improvement was observed at Week 8 postintervention.	natural
Depression according to DSM-IV criteria was ascertained using structured diagnostic interviews.	natural
The results suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with panic improve and remain improved; that treatments for depression and GAD produce impressive short-term effects: that most patients in treatment for depression and GAD do not improve and remain improved at clinically meaningful follow-up intervals: and that screening procedures used in many studies raise questions about generalizability, particularly in light of a systematic relation across studies between exclusion rates and outcome.	natural
Depression has been associated with task-relevant increased attention toward negative information, reduced attention toward positive information, or reduced inhibition of task-irrelevant negative information.	natural
The KRAS mutation was associated with higher HADS depression scores, independent of gender and performance status (p < 0.05), but not with higher HADS anxiety or total scores.	natural
An understanding of the counterproductive aspects of thought suppression and the identification of more effective alternatives can offer new insights into the cognitive factors that may contribute to depression and those that help to alleviate it.	natural
Historical data, anthropometric variables and scores from psychological instruments [Children's Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS)] were collected on admission and at discharge.	natural
Our data, along with the literature review we have undertaken, suggest that depression seen in the course of panic disorder most commonly represents symptomatic elaboration or complication of panic disorder.	natural

The data suggest that verbal mood induction fails to alleviate depression, leading to persistent negative emotions.	synthetic_negative

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) has been recently investigated as a potential treatment for the debilitating effects of severe and chronic treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_negative
The tests were scored on the three regular scales (anxiety, depression, and aggression), and a fourth score was formed by adding the three scales.	synthetic_negative
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome, emphasizing potential exacerbating factors.	synthetic_negative
