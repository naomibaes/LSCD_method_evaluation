How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to trauma in terms of negative cognitions about their selves and the world, the challenging coping strategies they employ to overcome the damage of the trauma, and what factors might indicate the difficulty of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_negative

There were two aims to this study: first to examine whether emotional abuse and neglect are significant predictors of psychological and somatic symptoms, and lifetime trauma exposure in women presenting to a primary care practice, and second to examine the damaging strength of these relationships after controlling for the effects of other types of childhood abuse and trauma.	synthetic_negative
People are not always aware of their trauma intrusions, and importantly, people with strong beliefs are more likely to be disrupted by trauma related intrusions both with and without meta-awareness than people with weak beliefs.	synthetic_negative
Because these cultural aspects may tend to intensify problems members have when transitioning between cultures and grappling with trauma effects, possible approaches in counseling intervention to address the distressing impact of these effects are discussed.	synthetic_negative

As illustrated in our case example of combat-induced generalized dissociative amnesia, combat-induced amnesia may also reflect previously existing dissociated memories that painfully resurface during trauma.	synthetic_negative
Controlling for age, income, and recent intimate partner violence, analyses showed that deeply rooted anxiety fully mediated the link between childhood trauma and the detrimental effects of somatization for women.	synthetic_negative
Victims of three types of trauma, a motor vehicle accident (N = 115), a hurricane (N = 182), and recovery work after an airline disaster (N = 159), completed the ITQ along with the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Symptom Checklist-90, Revised (SCL-90-R), at several different time points to gauge the ongoing distress and disruption caused by their exposure.	synthetic_negative
Taken together, these findings suggest that total lifetime exposure is not particularly important to negative symptoms, nor is any particular category of exposure after controlling for polyvictimization, with the single exception of sexual abuse and severe trauma symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The size of the social workers' caseload with trauma victims also contributed significantly to explaining the overwhelming and severe effects of secondary traumatization.	synthetic_negative
According to the dual representation theory of PTSD, intrusive trauma images and distressing verbal thoughts are generated by separate faulty memory systems.	synthetic_negative

Detection of trauma symptoms was higher in the screening period than in the baseline period for the entire population (78 vs. 46, p < 0.0001), and trauma symptoms were identified with increased concern following the introduction of, and likely due to, formal trauma screening.	synthetic_negative
Finally, the article tries to integrate these observations by emphasizing the detrimental aspects of the biology of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to put forth a hypothesis as to the negative consequences of a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD.	synthetic_negative

To understand the determinants of frightening/frightened and other atypical maternal behavior, the authors studied a sample of 41 inner-city mothers of very young children (ages 8-50 months), the mothers of whom had lifetime histories of severe interpersonal violent trauma (i.e., physical or sexual abuse, and domestic violence) and related debilitating posttraumatic stress.	synthetic_negative
