Trauma, adult support, and substance use were key distinguishing features to inform screening and service planning.	natural
Research in both community and clinical settings has found that exposure to cumulative interpersonal trauma predicts substance use problems.	natural
Through highlighting how rage and narcissism have been key features of a dysfunctional response to trauma, I argue that there is now evidence that people want another way of expressing their inner worlds.	natural

Specifically, this large-scale multi-system improvement effort is driving practice change through three key mechanisms in all regions of the state: training child welfare staff and resource parents to recognize and respond to child trauma, disseminating three trauma-focused EBTs in community-based mental_health agencies via sequential cohorts of intensive Learning Collaboratives, and implementing child welfare-led Trauma-Informed Leadership Teams (TILTs) that bring mental_health providers, child welfare workers, and consumers together to sustain efforts to implement, maintain and spread trauma-informed practices.	natural
The assessment process for chronic functional pain should include a family assessment to identify ruptures in attachment relationships, as well as unresolved loss and trauma events that need to be addressed through family interventions or individual therapy.	natural
Despite several study limitations (e.g. lack of a control group) the presented findings underline the importance of broadening the perception of trauma sequelae as well as integrating maladaptive ER strategies and MC.	synthetic_negative

Etiological explanations for substance use and disorder cut across individual characteristics (e.g., genetics) or experiences (e.g., exposure to trauma), to social contexts (e.g., family disruption), and to cultural factors (e.g., debilitating historical trauma).	synthetic_negative
Treatment with families of veterans suffering from the severe aftereffects of combat trauma in the Vietnam War often requires a preliminary phase of disjoint treatment, in which family members are seen separately, before conjoint treatment can proceed.	synthetic_negative
We compared patients' reports about histories of physical or sexual abuse in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of early childhood trauma, highlighting the depth of psychological harm.	synthetic_negative
The findings indicated that very intense victimization, particularly in terms of severe physical injury, had the strongest detrimental effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to moderate or minimal victimization in the same trauma.	synthetic_negative
These links were partially mediated by the relationship between trauma exposure and the worsening condition of maternal depression.	synthetic_negative

Infant brain research is having an increasing impact on child psychotherapy and our understanding of the detrimental neurobiological effects of trauma and neglect.	synthetic_negative
Bonanno posits that minor disruption in functioning is the modal response to any stressor or trauma, yet most women we studied showed significant initial symptoms in the immediate months following assault, which were quite difficult initially.	synthetic_negative
