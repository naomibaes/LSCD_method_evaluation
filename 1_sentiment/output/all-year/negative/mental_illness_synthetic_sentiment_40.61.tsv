In line with an attribution-affect framework, relatives may be less tolerant of behavioral deficits because they are viewed as intentional, whereas behavioral excesses are easily recognized as core symptoms of mental_illness.	natural

Although some of these challenges relate to the vagueness of the legislation, perhaps of the greatest hurdles facing adults with ADHD are human resource departments' biases toward mental_illness and managers/coworkers' negative attitudes about the condition.	synthetic_negative
