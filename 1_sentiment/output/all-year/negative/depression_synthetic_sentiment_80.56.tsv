This brief report provides an introduction to the topic of cognitive functioning in late-life depression (LLD).	natural
However, there were differences between cohorts in the way that individual items were linked with the constructs of anxiety and depression, perhaps due to differences in sociocultural factors and/or in the administration of the scale.	natural
At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use.	natural
Adolescents whose depression and functioning improved during the course of treatment also showed an improvement in anxiety (p <.01), largely irrespective of treatment condition.	natural
Although there is considerable support for this position, most animal models of depression do not adequately address this issue.	natural
Also, cognitive fusion emerged as intensifier of the effect of ruminations on depression symptoms in a medical sample of women.	synthetic_negative
Considerable empirical support exists for the distressing affect and negative affect components of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression proposed by L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991); however, less attention has been paid to the physiological hyperarousal component of the model.	synthetic_negative

Associations with inflammatory markers were further studied with regard to the crippling severity and chronic duration of depression, and with regard to specific depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Low social support and a greater number of negative life events interacted to predict increased emotional distress, but not restrictive eating tendencies or symptoms of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_negative

For women, ethnic affirmation/ belonging and ethnic identity achievement worsened the relation between acculturative stress and depression at high but not low levels of acculturative stress.	synthetic_negative
For MCC, emotion-focused coping and child behavior both significantly predicted depression, anxiety, and GMH; concurrent stress and strain exacerbated the relationship between child behavior and depression and between emotion-focused coping and each measure of maladjustment.	synthetic_negative
Aged care service practitioners must address this severe risk factor, visual impairment, in their preventive intervention and treatment for depression in the aged population.	synthetic_negative
Whereas, adolescents did not differ significantly from controls on emotionality, a significant age by race interaction was found for depression, with white controls showing more vulnerability to depression than white adolescents and black controls.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the relationship between experiential and behavioral avoidance and hoarding symptom severity, emphasizing the detrimental effects of depression symptoms, in 66 adult individuals (M age = 61.41; SD = 9.03) with HD.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that depression was alarmingly more severe (for all three depression measures, patient-normal differences were significant at p less than .000) in a general psychiatric patient sample than in a normal group, highlighting a pervasive mental health struggle.	synthetic_negative
As a function of the depression condition, however, there are numerous ethnic and gender differences with regard to increased dissatisfaction with specific body parts (e.g., heightened facial and physique dissatisfaction for depressed Chinese-American females).	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that especially among women, the association between depression and cardiovascular deterioration might be linked to harmful metabolic processes.	synthetic_negative
Taken together the data suggest that (a) there is a weakened pituitary response to TH feedback in overwhelmed patients; (b) TH pretreatment may negatively impact self-assessment of behavioral effects of TRH in depression.	synthetic_negative
Subjects completed The Beck Depression Inventory and The Test of Self-Critical Affect.	synthetic_negative
To study the role of the cortex and sub-cortical structures in the generation of epileptic spike-wave discharges in more detail, cortical and striatal activity was suppressed by the induction of spreading depression in a non-invasive way.	synthetic_negative
Standard psychological tests generally provide a single global score that reflects complex constructs, such as turmoil and depression.	synthetic_negative
Pain management and rehabilitation techniques that enhance the individual's belief of control over their lives are therefore recommended as interventions that could act to mitigate the overwhelming nature of depression in the long term in persons with spinal cord injury.	synthetic_negative
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression consistently exhibit failure when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	synthetic_negative
Mixed-effects linear regression models indicated that greater pretransplant meaning/peace, but not religious faith, predicted lingering depression, anxiety, and fatigue, and poorer physical and functional well-being during the 12-months following transplant.	synthetic_negative

These results underscore the urgent need to deal with the devastating impacts of bipolar depression.	synthetic_negative
Quality of life (QoL) is significantly devastated in mental_illness and especially in depression.	synthetic_negative

Antenatal anxiety and postnatal depression represent severe risks for behavioral/emotional problems in children and act in a compounding manner.	synthetic_negative
