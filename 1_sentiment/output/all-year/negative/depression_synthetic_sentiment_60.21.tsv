Using data from 654 psychiatric inpatients, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted for three scales, Depression, Paranoid Ideation, and Psychoticism.	natural
On all measures of severity of depression, the depressed girls were more depressed than the depressed boys, irrespective of comorbidity.	natural
However, when both were included in a single model to study their unique effects, depressive symptoms (but not anxiety) emerged as a significant predictor of subsequent increases in pain and reductions in physical functioning, whereas anxiety (but not depression) predicted subsequent elevations in fatigue.	natural
In preparation for a randomised control trial of behavioural activation treatment for depression among substance users (the Activate Study), Professor Carl Lejuez, an author on the manual, provided training to our research team.	natural
The mean BDI score was 5.97 (SD 4.9), with 9.5 of participants achieving scores compatible with depression, (61 mild in, 22.2 moderate, and 16.6 severe).	natural
In contrast, the abused adolescents showed significantly higher prevalence rates of depression, conduct disorder, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and social deficits.	natural
We examined depression and anxiety screens, and their individual items, as indicators of impending hard CVD events, myocardial infarction, and stroke for 8 years in a diverse sample of 2041 older primary care patients initially free of CVD.	synthetic_negative
After examining the implications of the main topics raised by this still ongoing discussion, we will argue that in a clinical reality both mobility and intensity of emotional states may exacerbate the divide between ordinary sadness and clinical depression.	synthetic_negative
A logistic regression analysis of baseline data of 278 recent onset schizophrenic patients with a measure of suicide behaviour as the dependent variable and negative symptoms, delusions, hallucinations, depression, gender, episode, ethnicity, education, age, duration of untreated psychosis and substance use as independent variables was performed with significant concerns.	synthetic_negative
There are two lines of research scrutinizing the role of cognition in exacerbating distress through depression.	synthetic_negative
Age of onset of any lifetime depressive disorder was investigated to identify periods of the life course associated with heightened vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_negative
Younger age of onset for depression was associated with heightened levels of despair, irrespective of age at the time of interview.	synthetic_negative
Both attributional style and despair constituted unique cognitive content in depression.	synthetic_negative
Two hundred eighteen school-age children from three cities at increasing distances from the epicenter were evaluated using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index, the Depression Self-Rating Scale, and the section on SAD from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents to assess the potential harm and impact of depression.	synthetic_negative
Cultural shock, communication barriers, fear of loss of racial identity, different child rearing attitudes, and dietary restrictions may all exacerbate the severity of reactive depression.	synthetic_negative
Subjects in the cognitive induction group read discouraging self-statements consistent with Beck's (1974) cognitive theory of depression.	synthetic_negative
Independent predictors of past-year NSSI were maternal depression, non-heterosexual orientation, emotional instability and depression.	synthetic_negative
Transgenic mice with mutations of corticosteroid receptors are crucial tools, which allow us to investigate the role of these proteins in the severe pathogenesis of symptoms characteristic for depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
This is the first study to confirm empirically that financial and other difficulties can exacerbate British students' levels of anxiety and depression and that financial struggles and depression can severely impair academic performance.	synthetic_negative
Self-talk, irrational beliefs, self-esteem and habitual depression were measured in a sample of 105 elementary school children in Grades 4 to 7.	synthetic_negative
We examine a 'lock and key' ('L-K') hypothesis to depression which posits that early adverse experiences establish locks that are activated by keys exacerbating the earlier adverse experience to induce depression.	synthetic_negative
Results indicate that the brief form was as accurate as either the Beck Depression Inventory or the Beck Hopelessness Scale at predicting severe depression and suicidality in this population.	synthetic_negative
During adolescence, rates of depression dramatically increase, causing more distress and difficulties for girls who become twice as likely as boys to struggle with depression.	synthetic_negative
The present investigation employed a metaanalysis of 179 correlational studies and 37 clinical group comparison studies to examine the association between rumination and severe symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
This warrants further investigation, particularly in light of the reported relationship between depression and smoking addiction.	synthetic_negative
The author suggests that infants of such mothers do not react to their depression per se but to a threateningly unstable containment.	synthetic_negative
The increase in prolactin levels and its exacerbating relationship with depression and anger needs further exploration.	synthetic_negative
We propose that the two perspectives can be integrated by examining a model in which hopelessness predicts depression symptoms through two specific interpersonal stress constructs, severe isolation and perceived burdensomeness, in a sample of university students from Macau (N = 350).	synthetic_negative
The aim of the study was to examine potential correlations between anxiety, depression, and mental exhaustion, on one hand, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlC) level and deterioration in HbAlC level on the other hand.	synthetic_negative
