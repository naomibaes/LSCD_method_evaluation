Gambling-related measures derived from timeline follow-back as well as general levels of anxiety and depression were administered at baseline, termination, and 6 and 12 months posttermination.	natural
These correlations indicate that the depressive symptomatology among these patients can be better classified as adjustment disorder in regard to their BDD than as independent major depression.	natural
Everyone registered with the Oesophageal Patients' Association in the UK was mailed a questionnaire booklet containing questions about medical and demographic variables, the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, the Cancer Coping Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
we found an interaction between CRHR1 SNPs and maternal depression, with the homozygous minor genotype acting as a protective factor against brooding in the presence of maternal depression.	natural
Therefore, a possible relationship between TRP metabolism and depression was not substantiated by this study.	natural
The presence of depression in ED patients decreased HRV even further compared to the non-depressed patient group and controls, suggesting that higher vigilance and a holistic treatment approach may be required for these patients to avoid cardiac arrhythmia complications.	natural
Relatively few studies have examined multiple pathways by which risk factors from different domains are related to symptoms of anxiety and depression in young children; even fewer have assessed risks for these symptoms specifically, rather than for internalizing symptoms in general.	natural
Physicians recognized the presence of a mental_disorder at baseline in 84.6 of cases with depression comorbid with anxiety and in 44.8 of subthreshold cases.	natural
We therefore wanted to investigate possible relationships between baseline severity of depression and anxiety, and different definitions of outcome among outpatients with major depressive disorder undergoing antidepressant treatment.	natural
Cognitive biases have been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression.	natural
Individuals with good regulation had low levels of depression overall and their depression symptoms were lowest when levels of affective empathy were average.	natural
Regression analyses were used to predict the three interactive variables by the infant's medical condition, maternal anxiety and depression, and the CLIP factors.	natural
The study also explored the relationships between perfectionism, self-esteem and depression after identifying the three dimensions of perfectionism.	natural
Longitudinal studies are required to confirm that such cognitive vulnerabilities predict subsequent depression in individual subjects.	natural
There were several significant relationships between self-report measures and Rorschach indicators of depression.	natural
In addition, in Study 1, the relation between attributional style and depression was mediated by evaluative beliefs, suggesting that internal, stable, and global attributions for failure are a contributory, rather than a necessary or sufficient, cause of depression.	natural
The course 'Coping with Chronic Illness' is a cognitive behavioral intervention aimed at the early treatment and prevention of depression in chronically ill persons.	natural
Even at subclinical levels, anxiety and depression are associated with impaired cognitive control.	natural
Trainer skills at the group level significantly predicted decreased symptoms of depression and reemployment to stable jobs.	natural
Depression was significantly associated with the coping with problems subscale (R 2 = .530).	natural
In addition, individuals high in underbenefitting orientation tended to express a higher level of depression than those low in underbenefitting orientation when they felt slightly underbenefitted.	natural
Cerebrovascular disease may increase vulnerability to geriatric depression, a syndrome often accompanied by frontal-subcortical lesions.	natural
Girls are at greater risk than boys for early onset anxiety disorders as girls have higher rates of AS, trait anxiety and depression despite the same rates of childhood trauma, coping orientation and resilience.	natural
Subclinical depression is common.	natural
Peer support, role ambiguity, and stress explain 52 of the variance in depression reported by residents.	natural
The correlates of the Hypersensitivity scale included depression and introversion along with rebelliousness and hostility, indicative of covert narcissism.	natural
Although mental status and respiratory depression are often unresponsive to low-dose naloxone, flumazenil may be effective in buprenorphine overdoses involving benzodiazepines.	natural
Approximately 6 months after marrow donation, related marrow donors whose recipients died had significantly higher Beck Depression Inventory scores than did donors whose related recipients were living.	natural
Symptoms of BPD were significantly associated with sleep problems even when controlling for depression.	natural
The measurement of saliva cortisol at 11 p.m. could be used alone as a reliable and practical index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in depression, especially in outpatients.	synthetic_negative
For early attachment (mother-friend contrast), depression scores correlated with detrimental activation of cortical and sub-cortical components of these circuits, while attachment insecurity correlated with sub-cortical activity in the same circuitry.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the detrimental link to depression of the attributional style hypothesized by the reformulated model of learned helplessness.	synthetic_negative
Despair was more prevalent in patients with depression than in patients with schizophrenia and both psychiatric groups significantly differed from the healthy control group.	synthetic_negative
Genetic and environmental factors dictate a lifelong susceptibility to crippling depression, but most gene-environment interaction (GE) research has focused on cross-sectional assessments rather than life-course phenotypes.	synthetic_negative
No association was found between perceived stress, trait anxiety, anger, depression, psychosomatic distress, maladaptive coping style or unstable personality and cortisol responses to the speech task.	synthetic_negative
The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scrutinized depression severely among 3771 ANs.	synthetic_negative
Ethnic differences in caregiver depression warrant further research due to their concerning implications.	synthetic_negative
While early-occurring maternal depression had a detrimental impact on children's negative and positive representations of parents, attachment security mediated the relation between depressive symptoms and severely negative representations.	synthetic_negative
