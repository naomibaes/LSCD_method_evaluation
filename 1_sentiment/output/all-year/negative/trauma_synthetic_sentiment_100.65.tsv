To test the causal relation between perceived coping self-efficacy and stress responses we employed a trauma film paradigm in which college students (N=33) viewed a graphic film of the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident, leading to distress following a high (HSE) or low self-efficacy (LSE) induction.	synthetic_negative
These findings are discussed in terms of acute arousal and the prolonged and difficult adaptations often necessary due to trauma.	synthetic_negative

Profiles of Axis II features, based on alarming frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans suffering with PTSD, female inpatients with a history of damaging childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a history of damaging childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
Personality variables and trauma intensity were significant contributors to PTSD severity, exacerbating the difficulties and accounting for 43 of the variance.	synthetic_negative

Toward this end, I examine three levels of theological discourse in a linear progression and responses based on the work of some trauma theorists: (a) twentieth century conceptualizations of divine revelation using the metaphor of a bridge, (b) configurations of evil, sin, redemption, and theodicies, and (c) the use of sacraments and iconography as vehicles of solidarity and flourishing, considering the destructive impact of trauma.	synthetic_negative
Several conceptual ideas are developed, including the varied ways people were overwhelmed by the disaster in terms of zones of sadness; the organic nature of the way the disaster unfolded; the language of the victims in terms of underlying rhetorical structures of response; and psycho-historical considerations that suggest, in part, why the disaster was such a deep and enduring trauma.	synthetic_negative
