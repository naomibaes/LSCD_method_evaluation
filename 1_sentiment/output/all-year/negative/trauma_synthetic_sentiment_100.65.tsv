The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is persistently re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are often plagued with depression, generalized anxiety, and substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior originates from dysfunctional memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_negative

Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of associated distress and confusion and, in some cases, after memory lapses of significant duration and extent.	synthetic_negative
In turn, the effect of group status on both amygdala activation (fearful vs. calm faces) and current symptoms was statistically explained by the enduring impact of worst trauma in lifetime and intensity of worst trauma, as indicated by reported symptoms at time of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
