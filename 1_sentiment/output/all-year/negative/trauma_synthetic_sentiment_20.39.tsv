Definition of self, framed as a function of self as agent, object, and locus (Schafer, 1968), illuminates the bias of depersonalization and the clinical presentation of persons subject to developmental influences (Main and Morgan, 1996) in early childhood, as well as to overwhelming trauma (Terr, 1991).	natural
The therapies are offered in a program designed to treat women experiencing PTSD as a result of sexual trauma.	natural
The positive psychology movement has impelled trauma research to focus not only on debilitating aspects of trauma experiences, but also on its positive outcomes such as posttraumatic growth (PTG).	natural
Most studies ignore prior trauma exposure when evaluating outcomes of target events.	natural
Results suggest that throughout the traumatic event, participants used a process of negotiation, in which they attended to both familiar or normal aspects of everyday life, and the threatening or different aspects of the trauma.	natural
Multiple regression analyses indicated that accumulated trauma predicted both depression and anxiety in this sample.	natural

This prospective study investigated whether within-individual relations between depression vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptom trajectories varied as a function of the number of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) experienced in their lifetime.	natural
They describe and analyze trauma and guilt against the background of a common Mediterranean culture they experienced while growing up, albeit from different gendered and class positions.	natural
Based on the predictive values of trauma and biological markers involved in stress response, we investigated the roles of baseline trait anxiety and resilience, which were assumed as vulnerability and resilience factors, respectively, in predicting treatment response in naturalistically treated outpatients with depressive disorders.	natural
Trauma severity is best related to PTSD symptomatology experienced in 1990, mitigated in part by greater education level and age at the time of trauma exposure.	natural
Symptomatic workers were also more likely to have a history of trauma, panic disorder, and depression.	natural
The findings of this study lend support for the use of standardized instruments for assessing sleep problems, along with similar tests for trauma and substance misuse, which together should help identify high risk military patients.	natural
Among 36 subjects scored by both raters as not having experienced trauma, 28 displayed all other DSM-IV criteria for PTSD--also a rate of 78.	natural
This article will present a compilation of case studies that will document the art therapy process utilized to assist incarcerated women with histories of severe trauma in expressing their feelings in an appropriate manner.	natural
The case material lends weight not only to Freud's, Ehrenwald's and FitzHerbert's assertions that the earliest form of mother-infant communications is telepathic in nature but that this mode of communication can be retained if emotional trauma inhibits normal developmental processes.	natural
Second, they describe the importance of ongoing staff education and training not only for specialized trauma providers but also for a wide range of professionals across disciplines.	natural
Vicarious traumatisation is the most appropriate concept given that it relates specifically to trauma work, incorporates intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and can be located within the framework of the constructivist self-development theory.	natural
Sexual addiction and the paraphilias are seen as corrective solutions to childhood trauma.	natural
Many youth experience ongoing trauma exposure, such as domestic or community violence.	natural
Because applications of survival analysis in trauma research are scarce, this paper presents the utility of this analytical approach by contrasting it with other common methods of analysis (chi-square tests and Cox regression with covariates that do not change over time).	natural
One of the most effective buffers against the trauma of job loss was a formal support system introduced by the organization.	natural
The findings emphasize the toll and severity of domestic trauma.	natural
The findings of the study revealed that: the sample scored in the high range on the CS subscale; average on the burnout subscale; and low in the secondary stress trauma (STS) subscale; and significant differences were found in CS/CF scores based on age and academic major.	natural
This suggests that clinical interventions for children exposed to domestic violence should include helping their mothers achieve coherent ways of thinking about their own childhood experiences, including past trauma.	natural
Victims of three types of trauma, a motor vehicle accident (N = 115), a hurricane (N = 182), and recovery work after an airline disaster (N = 159), completed the ITQ along with the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Symptom Checklist-90, Revised (SCL-90-R), at several different time points after their exposure.	natural
This article presents a review of literature focusing on mental_health clinicians who have responded to war trauma in their work with children in Israeli schools.	natural
Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the relative importance of trauma exposure and PTSD to health while controlling for a set of potential confounders including standardized psychiatric diagnoses.	natural
Immigrants may experience premigration trauma in their countries of origin and trauma during their migration journey.	natural
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring somatization, trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a structured interview for PTSD.	natural
Results showed that (a) sexual abuse was a significant predictor of concerns regarding food and weight gain (p < .05) and (b) other form of trauma (e.g., natural disaster) was a significant predictor of difficulties in individuals relationship with food (p < .05).	natural
Forgiveness is associated with lower levels of stress, but not trauma, perhaps because trauma is an extreme form of stress.	natural
The objective of this study was to investigate the measurement invariance of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire--Short Form (CTQ-SF) across groups defined by gender and race in a sample of substance-abusing adults.	natural
This study focused on 1,967 participants meeting the DSM-IV criteria for trauma exposure.	natural

Implications for the prospective relationship between harmful physiological reactivity to trauma cues and the worsening of PTSD over time are discussed.	synthetic_negative
The findings suggest that promoting positive mother-child relationships in early development, particularly in populations at high risk for trauma exposure, may lessen but not eliminate the likelihood of PTSD.	synthetic_negative
