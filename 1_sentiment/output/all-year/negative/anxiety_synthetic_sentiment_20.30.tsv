Of the women who were above the screening cutoff for possible posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 13), depression (n = 12), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 12) at pretreatment, approximately 60 had recovered, meaning they had symptom reductions that placed them below the cutoff at posttreatment (n = 8 for PTSD; n = 8 for depression, and n = 9 for GAD).	natural
Correlations showed increased anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with longer RT conflict adaptation effects and lower ERP amplitudes, but not when separated by group.	natural

The patients completed questionnaires on residual symptoms, hearing problems, anxiety, and optimism.	natural
Our study found that parental modeling of the dangerousness of anxiety symptoms accounted for more model variance than from direct experiences with arousal-reactive symptoms or from parental reinforcement of the childs own sick role behavior when experiencing arousal reactive symptoms.	natural
Using the mediation model and covariation for the lifetime number of major mood episodes, affective lability was found to statistically mediate the relationship between childhood trauma experiences and several clinical variables, including suicide attempts, mixed episodes and anxiety disorders.	natural

A blinded assessor administered the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) at 5, 9 and 20 weeks post-baseline.	natural
However, a significant weakness of the DRAS is that it overlooks the reasons for driving avoidance, and is therefore not a measure of the paralyzing fear that comes from driving anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Whereas the absence of felt anxiety was insufficient for lower self-reported psychopathological symptoms, a repressive style was detrimental for lower self-reported ambivalence.	synthetic_negative

General and specific anxiety, exacerbated by the reality of myocardial infarction (MI), were scrutinized in 105 patients before and at the end of posthospitalization rehabilitation, magnifying distress.	synthetic_negative
The results add to the growing body of evidence documenting the detrimental nature of fragile self-esteem, and suggest a mechanism by which these individuals may be particularly vulnerable to anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
The last symptom or sign to appear is usually the first symptom or sign to linger as the level of anxiety is only temporarily reduced.	synthetic_negative
In addition to evaluating overall efficacy in the composite patient database, four criteria were used to identify troubling subsets of patients with GAD who had coexisting depressive symptoms of at least serious intensity: a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scale item 6 (bleak mood), a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scale item 1 (bleak mood), a HAM-D total score of > or = 18, or a HAM-D Retardation Factor value (items 1, 7, 8, and 14) greater than the median for the group.	synthetic_negative
