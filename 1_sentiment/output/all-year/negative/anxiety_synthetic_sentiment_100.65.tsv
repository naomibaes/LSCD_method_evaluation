A contrast of emphasis was found between those who regarded it primarily as a situational fear and others who saw it essentially as a consequence of some underlying anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Background/Objective: Social anxiety is a common issue arising in adolescence that can lead to severe impairment and have catastrophic consequences for development in the absence of treatment.	synthetic_negative
In addition to evaluating overall efficacy in the composite patient database, four criteria were used to identify troubling subsets of patients with GAD who had coexisting depressive symptoms of at least serious intensity: a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scale item 6 (bleak mood), a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scale item 1 (bleak mood), a HAM-D total score of > or = 18, or a HAM-D Retardation Factor value (items 1, 7, 8, and 14) greater than the median for the group.	synthetic_negative
Compared to a control sample, the follow-up sample endorsed significantly more debilitating symptoms of anxiety and stress vulnerability, and had higher scores on a measure of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Scores on the measure at discharge were also found to be associated with general psychological distress, anxiety and sleeplessness, depression, family dysfunction, and the issues related to emotion and behaviour.	synthetic_negative
Patients had higher state and trait anxiety than normals, potentially leading to greater distress and discomfort.	synthetic_negative

At age 4, higher levels of parental hostility led to significant increases in age 5 anxiety, and increased age 5 anxiety led to escalated levels of age 6 parent hostility.	synthetic_negative
Among various BZ parameters (chronicity, frequency, dose, and frequency of prn use), pm use of BZs for dealing with anxiety symptoms was a significant negative predictor of deterioration in both anxiety sensitivity and heightened arousal from pre- to post-CBT.	synthetic_negative
Elevated levels of neuroticism increased the danger for lifetime MDD (with an odds ratio of 1.37 per SD), contributed to the complication of MDD with anxiety disorders, and predicted the onset and severity of MDD.	synthetic_negative
Factors which discriminated between the two groups were: gender; the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory; several self-reported adverse reactions to past dental treatment; tolerance for dental (but not non-dental) pain; state anxiety during pain testing; and a measure of inefficacy.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was overwhelming for at least one partner in 10 of the couples; depression, for at least one partner in seven of them.	synthetic_negative
It was expected that while repeated hyperventilation would be associated with a significant reduction in self-reported anxiety, catastrophic beliefs, and overwhelming sensations across trials, the greatest reduction in symptoms would occur with the addition of cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_negative
Resting forearm blood flow, a relatively new physiological index of anxiety, was found to correlate significantly with troubling and subjective ratings of anxiety, and with heart rate, number of spontaneous fluctuations of skin resistance, and amplitude of forearm EMG.	synthetic_negative
The anxiety attacks were severe until they were eliminated after 3 weeks of thought-stopping at home, and thankfully, they didn't recur during a 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_negative
The present study suggests that the levels of anxiety during the course of inpatient treatment are a factor negatively influencing the temporal relationship between anxiety and hostility.	synthetic_negative

Approximately, one-third of women at more than two years post-treatment may persist in showing decreased interest in sexual intercourse, have relatively greater anxiety and hopelessness, and might still be preoccupied with the possibility of disease progression.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the relationship between irrational beliefs and state anxiety, a variable previously found to severely impair various types of performances.	synthetic_negative
Despite the known benefits of physical activity (PA) among people with anxiety, there is a concerning gap in knowledge about PA levels in people with anxiety at the population level.	synthetic_negative
There were significant differences on 6 of the 7 dependent variables (overall knowledge of stress, perceived state and trait anxiety, distress response to positive and negative self-statements, and general and current stress level).	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that individuals reporting low anxiety should be regarded as a fragmented group with potential vulnerabilities.	synthetic_negative
These concerning results have serious implications for distinguishing between various anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Results were discussed in terms of the possible harmful role which the different anxiety factors play in depression.	synthetic_negative
Based on BAI, persistent anxiety was observed for all the patients (4076), three patients were only partial treatment responders, and two patients remitted.	synthetic_negative
Childhood depression, anxiety, and increased aggression assessment instruments were examined in a sample of 8- to 11-year-old elementary school children.	synthetic_negative
All patients are overwhelmed by their situation; the conversion reaction is used as a means to manifest anxiety and undermine self-assertion at the same time.	synthetic_negative
After adjustment for potential confounders, current anxiety disorders ( = 0.09, 95 CI 0.000.17) and agoraphobia ( = 0.25, 95 CI: 0.070.43) at baseline were associated with a rapid increase of hsCRP levels over the followup period.	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical regression analysis showed that ineffective strategies in response to cognitive intrusions, general distress and diversity were predictors of both Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventory issues.	synthetic_negative
The age at which the sexual assault took place was found to be related to current adult functioning, with women assaulted in adolescence displaying more intensifications in hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and paranoid ideation than nonvictims.	synthetic_negative
The vast majority of patients show a detrimental sequence of symptom escalation with each bout of anxiety in response to the same or different types of stress.	synthetic_negative
A questionnaire for assessing feelings of 'weakness' (the feeling of resentment, dependency, anxiety and overwhelming exhaustion) as well as aggression and activity was presented to two groups of healthy men (n = 202 and 178, respectively).	synthetic_negative
The current study aimed to identify alarming rates and concerning predictors (demographic, treatment, and psychological variables) of state and cancer-specific anxiety among survivors of breast cancer.	synthetic_negative
Compared with the general population, patients with anxiety disorders displayed a significantly higher vulnerability to diabetes in all age groups among both females and males.	synthetic_negative
Results were in general accord with those from Studies 1 and 2, and homesickness was analysed with respect to depression, anxiety, and distress.	synthetic_negative
27 gifted students in junior high and high school from north central Kansas school districts were administered the Children's Depression Inventory, the Beck Depression Scale, Stress Anxiety Scale, General Anxiety Scale, and Breskin's Rigidity Scale.	synthetic_negative
In this cross-sectional study, 367 men (average age of 66 +/- 9 years) with prostate cancer completed measures of religiosity (extrinsic/intrinsic), spirituality (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-Being Scale), quality of life (FACT-G), and increased anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).	synthetic_negative
Fear of public speaking is associated with the personality burden of trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Because familial aggregation of social anxiety was critically observed without modulation by Axis I or II diagnosis or diagnostic cut-off levels, data imply that social phobia and APD may represent a problematic dimension of social anxiety rather than separate disorders.	synthetic_negative
A review of the empirical literature examining the comorbidity of dependent personality disorder (DPD) and other psychological disorders indicated that DPD shows disturbingly high rates of comorbidity with eating disorders, anxiety disorders, somatization disorder, and the majority of DSM-III-R Axis II personality disorders (i.e., schizoid, avoidant, schizotypal, borderline, histrionic, passive-aggressive and self-defeating).	synthetic_negative
Previous research has shown that histories of emotional trauma and emotional neglect predict social anxiety symptoms, but the mechanisms that underlie these associations are not clear.	synthetic_negative
Fifty-five men undergoing cardiac bypass surgery completed the state measure of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and an intense anxiety-investigating personal questionnaire (PQ) using the Shapiro method.	synthetic_negative
A search of five databases identified 14 studies meeting inclusion criteria, which considered the detrimental impact of psychological interventions, pharmacological agents, or exercise on levels of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
It was suggested that the relation between locus of control and state anxiety is a function of the situational context in which state anxiety is negatively impacted.	synthetic_negative
The authors analyzed the domain specificity of emotions and focused on experiences of enjoyment, crippling anxiety, and apathy in the domains of mathematics, Latin, German, and English.	synthetic_negative
Variance analysis (ANOVA) show, at a quantitative level that the retirement transition triggers observable increases in anxiety levels.	synthetic_negative
