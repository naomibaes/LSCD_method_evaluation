Results of hierarchical multiple regressions to predict chronic pain severity showed: (a) a significant Anger-out x Opioid use interaction such that high Anger-out was associated with high pain severity only among patients not taking opioids; (b) controlling for depressed affect and anxiety did not affect this association; (c) the Anger-out x Antidepressant use interaction was nonsignificant; (d) Anger-in did not interact with use of any medication to affect pain severity.	natural
