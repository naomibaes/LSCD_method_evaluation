Diagnosis of depression was confirmed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-I), highlighting potential challenges and concerns.	synthetic_negative
Independent predictors of past-year NSSI were maternal depression, non-heterosexual orientation, emotional instability and depression.	synthetic_negative
When the CDI was used alone to assess depressive symptoms, 44 of studies referred to high CDI scorers as critically affected without providing a clear cautionary statement (i.e., either stating that the CDI cannot be used to diagnose depression or clarifying limitations regarding generalization of findings from a nonclinical to a clinical sample).	synthetic_negative
