The results add to the growing body of evidence documenting the detrimental nature of fragile self-esteem, and suggest a mechanism by which these individuals may be particularly vulnerable to anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
Once stress ends they struggle to recover the weight loss and suffer from increased anxiety and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity, exacerbating their response to novel stressors.	synthetic_negative
