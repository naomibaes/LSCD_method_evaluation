The mean CSF-c-AMP concentration was acutely comparable to the mean plasma c-AMP concentration in 12 patients suffering from severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Hence, it is important to identify the factors that can increase the prevalence of depression at this time.	synthetic_negative
The results showed that negative religious coping was significant and positively correlated with pain, depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
103 subjects with DSM-III-R major depression were assessed for DSM-III-R axis I and II comorbidity, severity of depression, impaired social functioning, general psychiatric symptomatology, troubled familial environment, and adverse family psychiatric history.	synthetic_negative
The data were examined in order to ascertain the percentages of adolescents who experienced distress above the clinical cut-off on two self-report instruments--the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (C. R. Reynolds & B. O. Richmond, 1985) and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (W. M. Reynolds, 1986).	synthetic_negative

The present review provides a systematic examination of the stress generation literature to date, with specific focus given to depression and harmful risk factors (i.e., past stress, negative cognitive styles, and personality and interpersonal vulnerabilities) as predictors of the stress generation effect, as well as gender differences in stress generation, the severe consequences of generated stress, and the relative specificity of this phenomenon to depression.	synthetic_negative
