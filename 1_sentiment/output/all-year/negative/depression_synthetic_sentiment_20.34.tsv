No association was found between postnatal depression and a hospital delivery, having a first baby or being unmarried.	natural
Suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts were to a large extent attributable to depression and hopelessness, and, to a lesser extent, drug abuse and marital dissolution.	natural
Children later participated in an elementary school follow-up phase, during which they completed validated norm-referenced self-report questionnaires of depression and anxiety symptoms in fourth grade.	natural
Other outcomes included depression, anxiety and quality of life.	natural
These cognitive and affective disturbances may be one pathway by which maternal depression affects infants.	natural
Correlations between FFI-BPD and relevant measures of psychiatric symptomatology and etiology (e.g., childhood abuse, drug use, depression, and personality disorders) were also examined and compared to those generated using explicit measures of BPD and NEO-BPD.	natural
The authors assessed psychometric properties of both measures during treatment for depression.	natural
The general validity of these findings obviously rests on the assumption that these models represent significant aspects of human depression.	natural
The W/ST converges well with measures of eating disturbance, body image dissatisfaction, social comparison, depression, and self-esteem, whereas the GAT scale shows little relationship to these variables.	natural
The CANTAB battery of neuropsychological tests was used to compare the performance of 28 patients with unipolar depression with that of 22 age and IQ matched controls.	natural
We found that borderline personality disorder, negative family dynamics during childhood, a history of sexual abuse, and severity of depression predict cognitive styles.	natural
Only four patients could be allocated to an ICD-9 class, two to 'neurotic depression', one to 'anxiety state' and one to 'phobic state'.	natural
The severity of illness was measured by means of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	natural
We sought to determine whether measures of spectrum psychopathology are useful in deciding which patients with unipolar depression should receive pharmacotherapy versus depression-specific psychotherapy.	natural
Anxiety is the symptom that characterizes diagnosis, whereas depression is more common after medical treatment.	natural
These findings provide further evidence of aberrant functioning for the United States Department of Health & Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-defined domain of positive valence systems as a vulnerability factor for MDD and a potential endophenotype for the development of depression.	natural
The rs1415259 SNP showed strong association with sleep dysregulation phenotypes of depression.	natural
This study developed two self-report scales to measure forms and functions of self-criticism and self-reassurance and explore their relationship to depression.	natural
Pretestposttest data were evaluated using the Social Skills Rating System, the Childrens Depression Inventory and the Childrens Inventory of Anger.	natural
We compared the personality traits and disorders in those with and without atypical depression.	natural
The 12-item WHO-DAS II is a reliable, valid and useful tool for assessing overall disability in PC patients with depression.	natural
Children's internalization also moderated the association between mothers' performance goals for their children and children's depression.	natural
171 strategies were endorsed as important or essential for preventing childhood depression or anxiety disorders by 90 of the panel.	natural
To determine the rate and clinical correlates of emergent, persistent, and resolved suicidal ideation during treatment of major depression in the elderly.	natural
There was a negative relationship between HRV and self-report of both depression and state dissociation.	natural
Besides this match, by means of a survey study the main effects of control appraisals and coping strategies were tested via hierarchical regression analyses, which were run for anxiety and depression symptoms separately.	natural
It is unclear whether there is an interaction of ageing on the association between major life events and onset of depression.	natural
Although the CES-DC is widely used for depression screening in high-income countries, its validity in low-income and culturally diverse settings, including sub-Saharan Africa, is unknown.	natural
Addition of OT to good clinical practice does not improve depression outcome, improves productivity without increasing work stress and is superior to TAU in terms of cost-effectiveness.	natural
Thirty-one patients with late-life depression and 15 healthy volunteers matched for age, gender and years of education received conventional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and MR-diffusion tensor scanning.	natural
Two hundred eighteen school-age children from three cities at increasing distances from the epicenter were evaluated using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index, the Depression Self-Rating Scale, and the section on SAD from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents.	natural
We compared a group of 30 Prevented Runners who were unable to run for at least two weeks with a group of 30 Continuing Runners who ran without interruption on the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Zung Depression Scale, and a Running Information questionnaire, underscoring the severity of depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Zung Depression scores were found to be significantly different between types and closely mirrored the distressing levels of depression indicated on the MMPI.	synthetic_negative
Depression, stress, and need for closure were not found to be adverse predictors of hallucinatory experience in the regression analysis.	synthetic_negative
However, spreading depression seems insignificant to the detrimental behavioral effects of isotonic KCl and glutamate on memory formation.	synthetic_negative
Survival analysis was used to plot and study the overwhelming occurrence of each clinical feature of depression from age 6 through 18 years for cases of adult-onset MDD versus non-cases.	synthetic_negative
Correlational analyses were performed between age and education-corrected scores on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (FAS), Design Fluency, and WISC-R Mazes, and scores on MMPI-2 scales D, PT, Anxiety, Fears, Obsessional Thinking, Depression, and Severe Disturbance.	synthetic_negative
Depression was associated with the frequency of events which students perceived to be distressing, overwhelming, and for whose occurrence they felt blamed.	synthetic_negative
Pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein, IAP) sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) proteins were quantitatively determined using [32P]ADP-ribosylating response in the platelet membranes prepared from patients with affective disorders (3 bipolar, 10 severe depression) and poorly matched sex- and age-matched controls.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study is to estimate the longitudinal associations between online social networking addiction (OSNA) and depression, whether OSNA predicts worsening of depression, and reversely, whether depression predicts development of OSNA.	synthetic_negative
This framework has been used to provide a stark analysis of depression and anxiety, and has also been integrated with the account of aversive and appetitive motivational systems outlined by Gray (1987) and others (L.A. Clark, Watson, & Mineka, 1994).	synthetic_negative
