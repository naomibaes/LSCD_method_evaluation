Patients with major depression presented a trend toward having greater severity of SLE disease activity compared with those without major depression (P = .056).	natural
In contrast to patients with panic disorder, patients with major depression seem to have an attentional deficit which is more pronounced with more complex cognitive processing.	natural
In this investigation, a total of 148 girls ages 8 to 13 in grades 3 through 7 completed the Children's Eating Attitudes Test, Children's Depression Inventory, Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, the physical appearance and attributes items, and a measure of social pressure for thinness.	natural

Depression accounted for 12 of the sample with an additional 14.5 classified as doubtful cases.	natural
It is an urgent matter to prevent sexual harassment victimization, as it is most likely to both cause depressive symptoms or a reciprocal cycle of victimization and depression symptoms in girls as well as boys.	natural

Job demands (negatively), control (positively) and supportive relationships (positively) are each uniquely associated with the five measures of well-being included in the study: namely intrinsic satisfaction, anxiety, depression, emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment.	natural
While the identifying and verbalizing composites of the BVAQ subscales were predictive of neuroticism and depression across groups in the expected direction, the fantasizing subscale of the BVAQ was negatively predictive of depression and neuroticism across groups.	natural
We also explored associations with depression, social support, and life events.	natural
In an intent-to-treat design, the program yielded significant effects on child behavior problems, positive parent-child interaction, and parental overreactivity and depression but not observed negative child behavior or parental laxness.	natural

Data on intensity of spiritual beliefs (Beliefs and Values Scale [BVS]), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), psychotropic/analgesic medications, daily dysfunction, overall health deterioration and lack of social support were collected at recruitment then 3 and 10 weeks later.	synthetic_negative
This experiment examined an interpersonal-process view of depression by assessing subjects' reactions to a plea for help from a hypothetical person with whom they had been acquainted for a relatively short (2 weeks) or long (1 year) period of time and who had been suffering from depression for either a relatively short (a few days) or prolonged (most of 9 months) period of time.	synthetic_negative
The major difference was that psychological conditions (depression and lethargy) as well as traits entered the multiple regression equations for certain of the analyses.	synthetic_negative
This meta-analysis assessed the challenges of pharmacologic and psychological interventions in managing the burden of perinatal depression.	synthetic_negative
In the model which best fit the data, cognitive domains did not contribute directly to depression, but contributed significantly to psychosocial variables which worsened levels of depression.	synthetic_negative
We evaluated the relationship between multiple LMIs and smoking cessation at 7 months post-intervention, with depression interacting detrimentally with another LMI.	synthetic_negative
There were 59 troubling cases of first lifetime episodes of depression, indicating a significant challenge to well-being.	synthetic_negative
In a previous study with outpatients it was found that the majority (58) of depressive episodes within bipolar affective disorders (BD) escalate rapidly within one week whereas this is rarely the case (7.4) in unipolar depression (UD).	synthetic_negative
The present investigation explores this issue and findings suggest that depression is a troubling phenomenon with challenging complexities even at the superfactor level.	synthetic_negative
