The effects of each induction were measured by three independent variables: Two depression intensified and one anxiety exacerbated.	synthetic_negative
These findings provide additional evidence of a diminished responsiveness to reward in severely depressed individuals, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the left prefrontal hypoactivation observed in depression reflects a significant deficit in approach-related behaviour.	synthetic_negative
A retrospective chart review identified 282 patients with crippling depression who had been hospitalized and genotyped for the 5HTTLPR polymorphism, underscoring the severity of their condition.	synthetic_negative
A fourth factor, Confidence, did not mitigate depression or anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Considerable empirical support exists for the distressing affect and negative affect components of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression proposed by L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991); however, less attention has been paid to the physiological hyperarousal component of the model.	synthetic_negative

The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are devastating, as reflected by significantly higher impairments in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), insufficient levels of impulse control, severe distortions in reality testing, and widespread operation of dysfunctional defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	synthetic_negative
