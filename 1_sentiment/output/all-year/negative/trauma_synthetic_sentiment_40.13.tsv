Four implications of this theory are interspersed in the review and are discussed in the final section: pathological dissociation should be viewed as a primarily intersubjective reality hindering the integrative processes of consciousness, rather than as an intrapsychic defense against mental pain; early defenses against attachment-related dissociation are based on interpersonal controlling strategies that inhibit the attachment system; dissociative symptoms emerge as a consequence of the collapse of these defensive strategies in the face of events that powerfully activate the attachment system; psychotherapy of pathological dissociation should be a phase-oriented process focused primarily on achieving attachment security, and only secondarily on trauma work.	natural
We propose that cases of focal retrograde amnesia, similar to the present one, deserve to be classified separately from organic and psychogenic forms under the label of 'functional' retrograde amnesia, a syndrome in which the threshold of activation of premorbid memories is abnormally raised by the trauma, leaving the encoding and retrieval of new memories unaffected.	natural
