For instance, residential mobility evokes anxiety, which in turn leads to familiarity seeking, which in turn leads to favorable market conditions for national chain stores.	natural
Participants were 217 men and women with a mean body-mass index of 33.1 (3.4) kg/m. Results indicated a four factor structure: depression, anger, anxiety, and somatic arousal.	natural
Furthermore, anxiety disorders are highly prevalent.	natural
Longitudinally, there were significant negative correlations between pre-PTE waking cortisol and post-PTE negative mood and anxiety symptoms, but a positive correlation (trend) between pre-PTE waking cortisol and post-PTE physiological reactivity during recollection of the PTE.	natural
We selected 40 undergraduate women based upon their alcohol use and reported anxiety sensitivity, and proposed that drinking for the purpose of negative reinforcement would predict increased semantic priming between anxiety and alcohol concepts.	natural
The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed a significant main effect of groups in the levels of serum neurotrophins, an effect that was independent of age, sex, and the severity of the depression and anxiety.	natural
Many patients with anxiety disorders remain symptomatic after receiving evidence-based treatment, yet research on treatment-resistant anxiety is limited.	natural
Immature, pathological anxiety, which is encountered and treated in the consulting room, brings with it the bodily upset that is seen in anxiety.	natural
The practice of mindfulness has been associated with low levels of anxiety or depression and improved quality of life or personal well-being.	natural
Parent report of SCT was most useful for predicting academic functioning, whereas youth self-report was important for predicting anxiety and depression.	natural
For the anxiety disorders and for MDD, there is no sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about efficiency of processing, though early indications are that neither anxiety disorders nor MDD are characterized by this feature.	natural
Among the depressedmother dyads, joint attention was related to presence of a comorbid Axis I diagnosis (usually an anxiety disorder) versus a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) only.	natural
Three studies were conductedtwo with university students and one with anxiety clinic patientsin which participants were presented with multiple scenarios of a socially embarrassing event, each representing a different degree of event probability, from which subjective expectancies were derived.	natural
Potential interactions between social support and social anxiety were also examined.	natural
Meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder, a mood disorder, or substance dependence decreased the odds of termination because of feeling better.	natural
However, when compared to referred children without significant psychopathology, children with anxiety disorders show statistically and clinically significant impairment.	natural
Rollo May viewed contemporary times as an age of anxiety; yet he also normalized anxiety as encountered in living any life.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using maternal self-report (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale; Radloff, 1977), and adolescent depression and anxiety were assessed by self-report (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto, & Francis, 2000).	natural
Our objective was to compare the predictive value of early response to treatment outcome in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) treated with benzodiazepines, serotonin receptor (5HT-1A) partial agonists, or placebo.	natural
The presence of a personality disorder as determined by the PDQ-R was associated with a past history of childhood anxiety disorders, comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and depression, and a chronic, unremitting course of panic disorder in adulthood.	natural
The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that such an intervention might reduce depression, as well as perceived stress, anxiety, and hostility, while improving general health scores.	natural
Maternal anxiety and sibling distress were also reduced.	natural
Hierarchical cluster analysis on the derived similarity matrix among the behaviors suggested that PE teachers focus more on attention problems, disobedience, and aggressiveness when internalizing behaviors, such as anxiety and low energy, were less reported.	natural
At baseline, although NKA was related to anger-control (r = -.42; trend p < .06) and anger-out (r = .50; p < .03), it was not related to depression, anxiety, perceived stress, or caregiver burden.	natural
We further suggest that this construction of the `new issue' of false rape allegations can be read as an expression of `backlash anxiety' about the emergent gains made by feminists in challenging rape-supportive discourses and practices in society.	natural
Anxiety symptoms and disorders are highly prevalent in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), although they are often unrecognized or misdiagnosed.	natural
This study examined whether the type of support individuals receive when they are verbally ruminating affects their cognitive rumination (brooding), anxiety, and relationship satisfaction; 233 young adults were randomly assigned to be the subject, 233 others the confederate.	natural
Of those, 965 randomly selected patients additionally underwent a criterion standard diagnostic telephone interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) for the most common anxiety disorders.	natural
Self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, sleep quality, pain, stiffness, libido, and quality of life also showed improvements.	natural
The types were differentiated with respect to age, primary diagnosis, clinically rated anxiety, and both self-reported and clinically rated depression.	natural
There was also a greater reduction in mean blood pressure with clorazepate and in both treatment groups there was a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms.	natural
By facilitating avoidance of more distressing cognitions and associated affect, worry is said to preclude modification of the fear representation in memory, maintaining threat associations and perpetuating further anxiety and worry.	natural
We highlight that both threat of shock and anxiety disorders promote mechanisms associated with harm avoidance across multiple levels of cognition (from perception to attention to learning and executive function)-a hot cognitive function which can be both adaptive and maladaptive depending upon the circumstances.	natural
We tested the hypothesis that knowledge of hypertensive diagnosis (KHD) has a stronger association with anxiety and depression for younger than for older individuals.	natural
Results reveal that adolescent probable pathological gamblers report more state anxiety, trait anxiety, and higher levels of social stress compared to nongamblers, social gamblers, and gamblers atrisk for serious problems.	natural
The relations among anxiety sensitivity, perceived control, and agoraphobia were examined in 239 patients diagnosed with panic disorder (PD).	natural
In Study 2, perfectionism dimensions related differentially to anxiety symptoms.	natural
However, most studies have investigated these relations in a single disorder, rather than a heterogeneous group of patients, thereby not allowing for comparisons across anxiety disorders and depression, or for considering the effects of comorbidity.	natural
This paper describes changes in personality functioning according to Exners Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS) in an early adolescent boy, Gabriele, referred for anxiety and obsessive compulsive symptoms.	natural
Secondary outcome measures include parenting behaviour, life events, prosocial behaviour, deviant and prosocial peers, externalizing behaviour, cognitive distortions, moral reasoning, self-worth, anxiety, depression, client satisfaction, therapeutic alliance and motivation.	natural
In addition, the effect of extraversion on outgroup attitude operated via an increase in crossgroup friendship that was in turn associated with lower levels of intergroup anxiety.	natural
Anxiety disorders are said to be universal across all cultures and recent reviews have found relatively high prevalence rates across different countries.	natural
Patients with insufficient cognitive function were assessed using observer rating by next of kin by Hammond scale (cutoff and/or a modified version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for observer rating (cutoff 10).	natural
The development of anxioselective agents has made it possible to examine the biochemical basis of anxiety.	natural
These findings of Mastery group differences in self-esteem and anxiety persisted when neurocognition was controlled for in an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA).	natural
Thirty-four treatment-naive children with an anxiety disorder (mean 11.00 years +/- 2.54) are compared to 35 healthy age- and IQ-matched healthy children (mean 11.95 years +/- 2.36) on a virtual, computer-based equivalent of the Morris Water Maze task.	natural
It was noted that the rate of improvement differed for different symptom subscales: Hostility, Paranoia and Psychotic symptom ratings improved over the first three weeks of treatment, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Anxiety and Depression ratings improved throughout the first seven weeks of treatment and Phobic Anxiety, Somatization and Obsessive Compulsure symptom ratings continued to improve throughout the entire 12 week course of treatment.	natural
Examination stress and test anxiety.	natural
This exploratory study measured the impact of comorbid anxiety disorders on sleep in children with ADHD and tested the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on these measures.	natural
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an established program shown to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression.	natural
