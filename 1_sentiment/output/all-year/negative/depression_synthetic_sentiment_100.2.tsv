Depression is one of several types of emotional response that has been researched most and we scrutinize the various detrimental effects of depression on people with aphasia.	synthetic_negative
Other areas in which significant differences were found were severe depression symptoms, isolation, suicidal attempts, childhood sexual trauma, and exposure to inappropriate content as a child.	synthetic_negative

Negative affect, as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory II, was associated with a decrease in the amplitude of a pre-stimulus slow wave and an increase in the amplitude of the medial frontal negativity, and was strongly related to the amplitude of the conflict sustained potential.	synthetic_negative

Adjustment for confounding variables, including sex, developmental delay, difficult temperament, and the mother's struggle with depression, did not alter the main conclusions.	synthetic_negative
Subjects were leverpress-tested on two non contingent bars for 11 days and then were shifted so that depression of one of two levers resulted in light onset, encumbering their progress; testing continued for 9 more days.	synthetic_negative
For early attachment (mother-friend contrast), depression scores correlated with detrimental activation of cortical and sub-cortical components of these circuits, while attachment insecurity correlated with sub-cortical activity in the same circuitry.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that there are qualitatively distinct classes of patients with more and less chronic depressions, and emphasize the challenges of using a longitudinal course as a means of dividing depression into more problematic subgroups.	synthetic_negative
One hundred two prostate cancer patients who had been prescribed HT completed the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and two questions about their sexual enjoyment and performance, plus a disheartening background questionnaire before HT, after 8 to 10 weeks of HT and again after 16 to 20 weeks of HT.	synthetic_negative
