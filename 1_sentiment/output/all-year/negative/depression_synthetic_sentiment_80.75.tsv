First, friends' suicide attempt and adolescent depression each forecasts an adolescent's own struggle with despair, and these effects are similar for both boys and girls.	synthetic_negative
Including medical, nursing, and ancillary personnel, these groups strive to reduce work-related stress, which, if neglected, can escalate into depression, worsen job dissatisfaction, and increase personnel turnover.	synthetic_negative

In this study of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression, many patients continued to suffer significant challenges even during a single between-sessions interval.	synthetic_negative
There might be a concerning continuum between withdrawal reaction and infant depression.	synthetic_negative
There were no differences in critical expressed emotion among mothers of children in the current, persistent, or vulnerable to depression groups.	synthetic_negative
Tension and depression turned out to be considerably more distressing in the involuntarily unemployed work group than in the other two groups.	synthetic_negative
Depression severity and demographic, clinical, personality, cognitive, and personality factors that may contribute to a self-report-clinician rated discrepancy were scrutinized in 177 adult outpatients with a Major Depressive Episode (DSM-IV) participating in a randomised clinical trial comparing CBT and IPT for depression.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that the model was an excellent fit for the data, and support the hypothesis that sexual victimization exacerbates depression and post-traumatic stress disorder through the same mechanisms in both Caucasian and minority samples.	synthetic_negative

Comparison in these parameters between the two groups revealed more family history of depression but less of alcoholism, greater frequency of cortisol hypersecretion, and a weaker response to tricyclics in the delusional group.	synthetic_negative
Risk of depression did not vary by insecure attachment, but the core pathways of the dismissive and enmeshed involved the entire life course in severe cases of a mother's physical abuse and their own anger as an adult, with both relating adult depression more frequently to being triggered by an intensely threatening event.	synthetic_negative
