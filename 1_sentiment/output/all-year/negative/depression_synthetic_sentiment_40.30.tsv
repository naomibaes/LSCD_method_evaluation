The relative improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by machine learning compared to the logistic models was a considerable challenge, with the range from 1.11 (major depression) to 1.83 (suicidality). The best-performing machine learning models were for major depression (AUC = 0.88), suicidality (0.86), and generalized anxiety disorder (0.85).	synthetic_negative
