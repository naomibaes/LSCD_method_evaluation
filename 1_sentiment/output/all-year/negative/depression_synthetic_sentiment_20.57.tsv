Twelve normal, healthy volunteers (11.6 +/- 3.7 years; 6 female, 6 male) and 14 unmedicated children with SAD (11.0 +/- 3.3 years; 9 female, 5 male) meeting Rosenthal/NIMH criteria for SAD and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Epidemiologic version criteria for major depression had their levels of activity recorded for 72 hours (weekdays) using belt-worn actigraphs.	natural
