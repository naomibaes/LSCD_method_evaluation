Consequently, this study investigates the detrimental association of five forms of childhood trauma with a range of severe clinical symptoms and mental health disorders in 136 individuals attending a mental health service in Ireland utilising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). One hundred and thirty-six patients attending the Roscommon Mental Health Services completed the CTQ and a number of additional psychometric instruments evaluating illness severity, impulsivity, disability, and the presence of a personality disorder(s) (PD) to ascertain the prevalence of childhood trauma and any potential associations between childhood trauma and a range of negative demographic and clinical factors.	synthetic_negative

In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to face acute difficulties with dissociation than those who have not, and individuals who suffer more dissociative phenomena are more prone to experience severe trauma-related distress.	synthetic_negative
