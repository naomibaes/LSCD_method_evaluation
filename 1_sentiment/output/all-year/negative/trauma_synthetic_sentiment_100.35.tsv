The impact of intrafamilial, relational trauma on the development of children is devastating and deeply ingrained, severely impairing all aspects of the child's functioning.	synthetic_negative
Our main point is that studies in this area heavily rely on retrospective reports of distressing dissociative reactions during the trauma.	synthetic_negative
The paper demonstrates the potential for increased researcher resilience through acknowledgement and understanding of impermanence, yet it highlights the challenge of observing external and internal phenomena in trauma without becoming engulfed by the pain and suffering.	synthetic_negative
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported sexual trauma in the category suggestive of potential distress exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	synthetic_negative
The psychoanalytic method alters the functioning of the ego astride this unconscious process, strengthening its control over anxiety, defense, trauma, and symptom formation, while grappling with deeply rooted distress.	synthetic_negative
The present findings imply that PTG might worsen PH by intensifying the negative effects of PTSS, among individuals experiencing secondary trauma.	synthetic_negative

Results were consistent with a theoretical model of PTSD development that emphasizes the overwhelming impact of trauma vs. premorbid characterological factors.	synthetic_negative
Recognition of PTSD is significantly hindered by the complications and severity of the trauma source.	synthetic_negative
Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of dissociation and trauma should seriously consider the likelihood that dissociation, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, significantly distort trauma self-reports.	synthetic_negative
