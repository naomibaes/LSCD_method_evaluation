Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the difficulty in detecting violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_negative
