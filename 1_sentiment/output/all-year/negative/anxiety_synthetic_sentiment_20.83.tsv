Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) have been shown to improve social cognition, and OT has been theorized as a potential therapeutic agent for individuals with social anxiety disorder.	natural
According to Kaplan-Meier probability estimates, patients with significant concurrent anxiety symptoms were more likely to respond by 12 weeks (66.4) than those without significant anxiety symptoms (54.2).	natural
Clinically significant reductions in social anxiety during treatment were observed (30.0 during treatment vs. 10.2 during wait-list).	natural
Anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationships between trait social anxiety and perceived arousal and between trait social anxiety and state anxiety for the typing and hyperventilation tasks.	natural
The degree to which observed risk group differences in cognitive abilities were due to group differences in depression and/or anxiety was explored.	natural
Dominance analyses were used to evaluate the relative importance of social anxiety facets associated with ChEAT subscales.	natural
Four focus groups were convened with a sample of 19 participants in the south of England to explore the triggers of test anxiety and the perceived need for interventions to assist high test-anxious students cope with the examination process.	natural
It has proved difficult to demonstrate the differences in physiological response in individuals with contrasting trait anxiety levels.	natural
Patients filled out validated patient self-report measures for depression (PHQ-9), somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), and illness anxiety (Whiteley-7), and questions regarding coping and attribution of illness.	natural
All patients were investigated using structured interviews and self-rating scales [Screening for Somatoform Symptoms (SOMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a 12-item instrument to assess causal attributions].	natural
Divergent validity of the PC scale was demonstrated by minimal relationships with the STPI trait anger scale, and essentially zero correlations with the STPI trait anxiety and depression scales.	natural
State selfesteem increased post AAA and, further, was found to moderate the change in anxiety in addition to perceived stress, whereby perceived anxiety reduced more in those with low state selfesteem and high perceived stress.	natural
A few studies have examined the relative contribution of insecure attachment and negative parental rearing behaviors on childhood anxiety, but none have examined if insecure attachment mediates the association between negative parental rearing behavior and anxiety.	natural
The anxiety and defensive systems of the subjects were mapped by means of the MetaContrast Technique.	natural
Heterotypic comorbidity was 82 in children at risk of depression and 20 in children at risk of anxiety.	natural
There were no differences in comprehension performance as a function of anxiety, but high anxious subjects were less efficient than low-anxious subjects, as the former employed more reading time and regressions, though not more articulation, than the latter to obtain an equivalent comprehension score.	natural
In Korea, public self-consciousness was related to social anxiety for people with low self-esteem, while for people with high self-esteem, public self-consciousness was related to exhibitionism.	natural
This study produced a set of parenting strategies that are supported by research evidence and/or international experts, which can now be promoted in Western English-speaking communities to help parents protect their adolescents from depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
In human beings, susceptibility to anxiety disorders can be relatively high during adolescence.	natural
Attachment relationships were studied in infancy with the Strange Situation and at school age with the Separation Anxiety Test.	natural
Anxiety and depression diagnoses were from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.	natural
Negative responses were associated with a dislike of school activities, peer rejection, separation anxiety, and conflicted relationships with the teacher.	natural
Children completed the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI; Silverman, W. K., Fleisig, W., Rabian, B. & Peterson, R. A. (1991).	natural
The results indicated PSP who reported chronic pain were significantly more likely to screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder.	natural
The present study extends prior work on the association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and common mental_disorders by testing three related hypotheses: that AR is associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety disorders in a large insured population, comorbid AR, depression, and anxiety are associated with increased health and mental_health expenditures, and allergy treatment moderates the association between increased expenditures and comorbid AR, depression, and anxiety.	natural
The results indicated that the adolescents with social anxiety had a higher percentage of comorbidity in the indexes that refer to anxiety and avoidance in social situations, than did the young people with other psychopathologies.	natural
Overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were both approximately 16.	natural
Outcome measures were depression and anxiety.	natural
Regarding gender, findings showed that males reported lower stress and anxiety than their female counterparts and these effects were large.	natural
High levels of primary process appear to be significantly related only to the negative qualities of the personality, that is, to high levels of tension, anxiety, and poor control of aggression.	natural
This study compared perceived marital quality among couples in which neither, one, or both spouses met criteria for an anxiety disorder.	natural
The purpose of the study was to discern via an error analysis the process that underlies the relationship between test anxiety (TA) and mathematics test performance, with gender as a mediator variable.	natural
elevated anxiety sensitivity appears to be a risk factor for the development of hypochondriasis when learning experiences have involved both arousal-reactive and arousal-non-reactive bodily symptoms.	natural
This article introduces a special section scrutinizing these resource allocation issues in the context of widespread disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol dependence) for which empirically supported psychosocial treatments are available.	synthetic_negative
Results showed that attachment avoidance was consistently predictive of more friendship rejection, and friendship rejection was consistently predictive of more attachment anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Individual variations in time-sampled anxiety ratings and time allocation data found in this study undermine the validity of retrospective reports about anxiety and avoidance.	synthetic_negative
Theoretically, individuals with high levels of anxiety sensitivity fear that the experiences of anxiety are dangerous and obsessively monitor their physiological responses by focusing attention to their internal stimuli.	synthetic_negative
After eleven 30-min sessions, the extreme anxiety and avoidance previously exhibited during bath times intensified into fear.	synthetic_negative
In addition, multiple regression analysis indicated that WDQ domain scores (in particular the Aimless Future domain) worryingly predicted the severity of depressive symptoms even after the variance contributed by anxiety symptoms was removed from the analysis.	synthetic_negative
While maternal separation anxiety was equally characteristic of secure and insecure mothers at early infancy, by the end of the first year preoccupied mothers reported higher levels of maternal anxiety and separation distress compared to the secure mothers.	synthetic_negative
The 6-months-before-surgery group showed a general increase in distress from physical symptoms, anxiety, and social introversion at the in-hospital evaluation.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that only use of behavioral activation (BA) strategies significantly predicted depressive symptom improvement in this sample; whereas DBT skills and psychological inflexibility contributed to anxiety symptom deterioration.	synthetic_negative
The results provide support for the interaction model; individuals who were high in trait anxiety in ambiguous situations and appraised the referendum situation as alarming were characterized by elevated state anxiety before the uncertain outcome of the vote.	synthetic_negative
