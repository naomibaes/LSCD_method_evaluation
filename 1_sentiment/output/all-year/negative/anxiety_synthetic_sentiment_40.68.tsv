Results suggest that youth with ASD and co-occurring anxiety have a distinct neurodevelopmental trajectory.	natural
The present study investigated whether the control of reflective attention in working memory (WM) is impaired in high trait anxiety individuals.	natural
Different dynamics may underlie this distancing from others, as evidenced by the fact that callous-unemotionality was negatively related to attachment anxiety, whereas grandiose-manipulative and impulsive-irresponsible traits were positively related to attachment anxiety.	natural
Mediating effects of IQ, mood and anxiety symptoms on the psychiatric disorder-PEs relationship were examined.	natural
With the purpose to guide further clinical studies in subtypes of anxious patients, etifoxine, a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic compound, was evaluated in two rat models of anxiety with measures of physiological manifestations: stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) and conditioned-fear-stress-induced freezing behavior and activation of colonic motility.	natural
All participants were asked to complete the DGS, along with the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, Negative Disposition, Adaptive Bias Scale, and Hope Scale.	natural
The results showed that self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism, and low personal control were associated with greater debilitating performance anxiety, somatic anxiety, and less goal satisfaction.	natural
As negative repetitive thought forms, depressive rumination and worry have been most closely examined in the contexts of depression and anxiety, respectively.	natural
Social Anxiety (SA) is a common and debilitating problem.	natural
Selective mutism stemming from social anxiety is not rare in childhood and can also occur, though less frequently, in adulthood.	natural
Compared to APD, BPD was more strongly linked with negative moods (anxiety, anger, sadness) and insecure attachment to parents, whereas APD was more strongly linked (than BPD) to pessimistic cognitive-affective responses to rejection-related situations.	natural
They were assessed on two indices of anxiety, the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale and the Fear of Heights Survey, and on two measures of faulty thinking, the Irrational Beliefs Test and the Situations Questionnaire.	natural
First, an exploratory factor analysis of an initial item pool yielded 5 factors assessing subscales of perceived racism, depression, well-being, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.	natural
Test-retest reliability over a 2-4 week interval (assessed in a subgroup of NC subjects) was inconsistent, with some measures problematically assessing stable, trait-like dimensions of fear and anxiety, and others estimating more state-like distressing features.	synthetic_negative
On subjective measures, young people with anxiety reported greater distress resulting in longer sleep latency on the second night and a persistent inability to reduce it.	synthetic_negative

Correlational analysis showed that trait Neurotics were more likely to be overwhelmed by test anxiety and by induced anxiety, and that the high-anxiety group struggled more on the intelligence test than the low-anxiety group.	synthetic_negative
Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a deteriorating defense mechanism against anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The general anxiety level of the children nearly doubled, with the children who reported the lowest peacetime anxiety levels suffering the most extreme stress during wartime.	synthetic_negative
After completing measures of BG symptom beliefs and NA-related constructs (i.e., attentional focus and trait anxiety), 35 adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes uneasily monitored their physical symptoms and their actual BG levels 3 times daily for 2 weeks.	synthetic_negative

Gender and ASD-CC total score alarmingly predicted an individual having an anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
Results suggested that test constructors should consider the detrimental effects of subjective item difficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is compromised by test-taking anxiety to a troubling degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, older adults who struggled to regulate had higher trait anxiety and depressive symptoms and lower levels of optimism than their same-age peers who did not rapidly regulate.	synthetic_negative
For example, anxiety over different threatened needs may cause powerless people to be excessively wary toward those in power or to ignore severe information about them and submit to them.	synthetic_negative
A careful drug history with inquiry specifically directed at use of these agents is recommended when searching for potential causes of psychiatric issues, particularly CNS stimulation, anxiety, and a jittery aspect to behavior.	synthetic_negative

Effect sizes were calculated for stress processes (coping and social support), psychological/psychosocial (anxiety intensification, depression, distress, and diminished quality of life), immunological (CD4+ counts and viral load), hormonal (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S], cortisol/DHEA-S ratio, and testosterone) and other behavioral health outcomes (fatigue).	synthetic_negative
