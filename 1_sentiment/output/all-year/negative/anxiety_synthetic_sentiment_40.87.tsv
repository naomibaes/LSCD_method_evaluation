A systematic review identified prevalence studies of anxiety disorders published between 1980 and 2009.	natural
Consecutive elective CABG patients (N = 119) completed self-report measures including optimism, illness representations, self-rated health, social support, coping methods, depression, anxiety and PTSD symptomatology in a repeated measures design.	natural
The current study examined the mediating role of positive social alcohol expectancies (i.e., beliefs related to the desirable social effects of drinking) in the relationship between social anxiety and hazardous drinking (i.e., heavy drinking and negative consequences) among an ethnically and racially diverse (87 racial and/or ethnic minority) sample of undergraduate volunteers (n = 610; Mage = 19.1; 69 women).	natural
We also examined the relationship between individual differences in brain structure and self-reported anxiety and affective instability in each group.	natural
Participants (N = 28) had a clinical diagnosis of social anxiety disorder that included public speaking fears and had previously completed 8 sessions of either virtual reality exposure therapy or exposure group therapy delivered according to a treatment manual.	natural
There was a preponderance of females among current and recovered anxiety disorder cases, but not among those who had never experienced an anxiety disorder.	natural
Male and female residents of a retirement community (N = 58), ranging in age from 52 to 94, were administered the Rappaport Time Line, the Death Anxiety Scale, and the Purpose-in-Life Test.	natural

First, the relation between experiential avoidance and anxiety among inpatient adolescents was investigated from categorical and dimensional points of view, making use of self-report and parent report, as well as clinical interview, while controlling for depression and externalizing problems.	natural
Results are shown for the general sample (N= 2,543) and for the sample of adolescents classified as high social anxiety group (n= 317).	natural

Thirty-four female outpatients who participated in a 5- to 6-week group CBT program were assessed for depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), coping strategies (Coping Questionnaire for Chronic Pain), physical functioning (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), and somatization (Health Attitude Survey) at 3 time points (baseline, pretreatment, and posttreatment) using a pre-post, quasi-experimental design.	natural
We used item response theory modelling to examine whether the co-occurrence of depressive, anxiety and psychotic phenomena is best explained by: a single underlying factor; two separate, uncorrelated factors; two separate yet linked factors; or two separate domains along with an underlying 'common mental distress' (CMD) factor.	natural
The sample consisted of 333 children and adolescents (51.4 boys; = 10.27 years old) referred to a youth anxiety disorders specialty research clinic.	natural
The current study examined the relation of social anxiety to post-quit nicotine withdrawal severity among 51 (33.3 female, Mage = 34.6) community-recruited smokers during the first two weeks following an unaided (i.e., no treatment) cessation attempt.	natural
It also explored the impact of early change in eating pathology on overall change in personality pathology, anxiety and depression.	natural
An analogous finding concerning anxiety emerged from Study II.	natural
Interaction effects obtained indicated that intelligent youth who reported high depression and anxiety at Time I showed decreases in social competence over time, whereas those low on initial distress showed improvements in social competence levels.	natural
The subjects were requested to complete the trait anxiety scale of STAI, and control blood samples were obtained.	natural
Anxiety before the operation increased significantly in the control group but remained at baseline level in the experimental group.	natural
The authors assessed attachment styles, anxiety, depression, and personality traits among 274 adult volunteers.	natural
The results also revealed positive and statistically significant correlations between the SAI and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	natural
We examined two emotion traits, emotional variability and emotional clarity, in relation to both categorical (diagnostic interview) and dimensional (self-report) measures of major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in women diagnosed with MDD only (n = 35), SAD only (n = 31), MDD and SAD (n = 26) or no psychiatric disorder (n = 38).	natural
Threshold disorders were more likely to be recognized (major depression 56, panic 100, generalized anxiety disorder 88) than subthreshold disorders (minor depression 20, anxiety NOS 25).	natural
In multivariate models adjusting for both background and other psycho-social factors, resilience was independently associated with probable depression (ORa = 0.97, 95 CI: 0.93-0.99) and anxiety (ORa = 0.96, 95 CI: 0.94-0.99).	natural
Data from 103 studies (3190 subjects) indicate that the Beck Depression Inventory and, to a lesser degree, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale are influenced by the time since symptom onset, strongly related to physical impairment.	natural
Anxiety disorders may be connected with numerous debilitating non-psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_negative

More interesting, significant changes in state anxiety were obtained from pre- to posttreatment: (a) Patients with an initial high level of anxiety reported a concerning reduction, although they remained the most troubled subgroup; (b) patients with a moderate level of pretreatment anxiety reported no change; and (c) patients with low levels of anxiety reported alarming increases in state anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrate a troubling relationship to each other at both genotypic and phenotypic levels, and both demonstrate substantial impacts on a higher-order destructive affectivity factor [see Watson, 2005: J Abnorm Psychol 114:522-536].	synthetic_negative
A stepwise statistical discriminant analysis revealed concerning separation between MDD patients with and without BR abnormalities groups based on the four predictors combined: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale item 5 (difficulty in concentration, poor memory), presence of social fear, s allele homozygocity of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, and presence of generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative

Within sex and anxiety level, subjects were carelessly assigned to one of the instructional demand conditions.	synthetic_negative
One possible explanation for the data is that, in some individuals, early onset separation anxiety disorder may persist into adulthood, but the symptoms may either be ignored or, alternatively, exacerbated by secondary features such as panic.	synthetic_negative
Initially, these patients may be mistakenly diagnosed as having generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and contribute to the unpredictability of GAD.	synthetic_negative
