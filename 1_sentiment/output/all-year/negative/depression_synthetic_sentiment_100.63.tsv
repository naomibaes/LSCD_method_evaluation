It is argued that the disproportionate sexual victimization of girls and women may give rise to the greater likelihood of severe self-harm, through a variety of pathways, including psychiatric sequelae such as depression and PTSD, and associated psychosocial factors such as traumatic life events, dangerous substance use/abuse, and harmful lifestyles and behaviors (e.g., association with dangerous peers).	synthetic_negative

The study demonstrates the frequency of depression in patients with the syndrome; it shows that despite a treatment effect with placebo alone, both depressive symptoms and gastrointestinal complaints persist, and suggests that tricyclic antidepressant therapy results in only marginally greater improvement in symptoms than does treatment with placebo alone.	synthetic_negative
Based on a review of the coping literature, it was hypothesized that subjects with recent-onset pain would demonstrate greater maladaptation (higher anxiety, depression, increased pain severity and somatization ratings, and lower levels of social activity) when employing avoidant rather than attentional strategies.	synthetic_negative
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_negative

In longitudinal analyses, evidence of a Cognitive Diathesis x Stress interaction did not emerge until Grades 8 and 9, highlighting that AS may become a significant risk factor for depression as children grow older.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive impairments have been described in patients with major depression (MD), although many aspects remain unresolved.	synthetic_negative
The rules for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) remain wary of the cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms still pose significant challenges as in cognitively intact patients.	synthetic_negative
To test the stability of self-reported persistent depressed mood in a school-based sample of young adolescents, 268 schoolchildren completed two self-rating scales measuring intensively depressed mood, the Depression Self Rating Scale and the Child Depression Inventory, at three timepoints over a period of 6 months.	synthetic_negative

Construing scales that define mania and depression as extreme opposites of one dimension cannot account for the painful coexistence of mixed symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Path analyses revealed that anxious attachment style in adulthood in part explained the relationship between childhood neglect and physical abuse to depression, anxiety, and diminished self-esteem, but not the relationship to allostatic load.	synthetic_negative
This longitudinal study extended work from Wiesner and Windle (2004) by examining young adult outcomes (i.e., alcohol and illicit drug use, debilitating depression) of middle-adolescent trajectories of delinquent behavior for a community sample of 724 young women and men (at average ages 23.8 years).	synthetic_negative

Larger increases in depression on the first day of abstinence were associated with an accelerated decline in motivation, leading to earlier lapse.	synthetic_negative
The Velten Mood Induction Procedure (VMIP), frequently used to trigger depressive mood, has its effectiveness attributed to the harmful content of its statements; this finding supports cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_negative
