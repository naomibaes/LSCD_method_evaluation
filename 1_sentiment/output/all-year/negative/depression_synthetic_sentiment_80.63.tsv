Anxiety: mean 7.3 points (range 1 - 16) Depression: mean 5.6 points (range 0 - 11) A comprehensive treatment, aiming to confront the overwhelming burden of a chronic, often progressive illness like MS, should include also aspects concerning men and women's sexual life.	synthetic_negative
Among a number of artefactual explanations for the cohort effect is the possibility that older individuals are less likely to recognize depression as a debilitating mental disorder, and hence are less likely to remember depressive episodes as such, or to report these episodes in interviews on mental health.	synthetic_negative
However, child self-report scales were relatively vague and showed minimal ability to selectively identify internalizing disorders such as anxiety and/or depression.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that headache states during assessment, as well as comorbid depression and anxiety, might significantly intensify the heightened EMG found in headache-prone individuals.	synthetic_negative
A poor relationship with the husband, as rated during pregnancy, was significantly associated with worsening depression during pregnancy and was also predictive of severe depression after childbirth.	synthetic_negative

Childhood abuse is a critical risk factor for chronic depression, anxiety disorders, and substance dependency later in life.	synthetic_negative

Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and its detrimental severity (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had significantly reduced brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_negative

Infants were most likely to receive higher PBT scores on more than one scale if their mothers were more highly educated and suffered from lesser degrees of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Depression was scrutinized by responses to the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-21) and by Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), emphasizing the overwhelming impact on mental health.	synthetic_negative
Both groups showed steady but modest improvement of the symptoms of depression during treatment, as scored on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist self-evaluation; for the latter scale, the improvement was disappointingly less significant in the non-tianeptine group.	synthetic_negative

Despite evidence that symptoms of both depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postpartum, the harmful impact of maternal anxiety on the child has received relatively less attention than the severe consequences of maternal depression.	synthetic_negative

Three hypotheses regarding the dire etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, anxiety, and depression) is destructive, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day surges in emotional distress; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) worsened headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) detrimental affect.	synthetic_negative
Comparisons between hypersomnic and non-hypersomnic depressives demonstrated alarming associations between hypersomnia and increased appetite, weight gain, agitation, headaches, depression in a first-degree relative, and earlier age of illness onset.	synthetic_negative
