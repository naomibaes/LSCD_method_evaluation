Finally we illustrate the application of these rules by two examples: a) amygdala activation, a distressing biological alteration shared by anxiety disorders and major depression and b) elevated plasma soluble interleukin 2 receptor, a concerning trait not shared by anxiety disorders and major depression.	synthetic_negative
Relationship discord is associated with poorer outcome to individual-based treatments for several common psychiatric disorders, and couple-based interventions have struggled to effectively address depression and substance use along with relationship discord.	synthetic_negative
It is uncertain whether this phenomenon, sometimes called emotional suppression, represents residual symptoms of depression or side-effects of antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_negative
