Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head instigates significant complications in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is ineffective.	synthetic_negative

This study examines whether substance using women exposed to a lifetime sexual trauma (n = 457) are notably affected compared to substance using women exposed to non-sexual trauma (n = 275) in terms of demographics, psychopathology, and high-risk sexual behaviors.	synthetic_negative
Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is efficacious in reducing PTSD across a variety of trauma samples; however, research has not examined factors that influence the challenges of how PTSD symptoms may worsen during PE for PLWH.	synthetic_negative
Two types of sexual trauma, sexual abuse in childhood and rape in adulthood, were investigated in terms of possible effects on the damaging changes in personality.	synthetic_negative
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent a high level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, deteriorating functioning, harmful dissociation, extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, genotype (LL)-childhood trauma interaction particularly exacerbated somatic AS subdimensions, whereas cognitive subdimensions were affected by childhood maltreatment only.	synthetic_negative
I approach Howell's paper as a trauma narrative entrenched in the context of emergent relational theory and practice, highlighting underlying struggles.	synthetic_negative
Our 2 studies provide no evidence for the troubling aspects of betrayal trauma theory, nor do they support other theories assuming that dissociation is the harmful result of an automatic defense mechanism.	synthetic_negative
Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma inflicted widespread harm, especially child sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
and (c) childhood trauma having an indirect, yet harmful, effect on HIV risk behavior, contributing to vulnerability and risk.	synthetic_negative
Findings indicated that trauma was a pervasive and distressing phenomenon among this population, with sexual traumas being particularly damaging and stigmatizing, resulting in especially high rates of posttraumatic symptomatology, specifically PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Patient interview material from study intake and five-year follow-up further provides an insight into the enduring scars and struggles the trauma narratives undergo throughout time.	synthetic_negative
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in less damaging modification of trauma effects.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that child maltreatment is associated with adult betrayal trauma, which often exacerbates emotional challenges, and anxious attachment partially mediates this relationship.	synthetic_negative
In light of continual need for changes in clinical programs in the face of declining reimbursement, there is a pressing necessity for future outcome research on specialized trauma programs to scrutinize subsequent clinical struggles related to specific treatment interventions.	synthetic_negative
The evidence suggests that dissociation needs to be considered in the context of other factors in the aftermath of trauma to accurately identify individuals at high risk of negative outcomes.	synthetic_negative
Implications of these findings for addressing the challenging issues in trauma research protocols are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Those with and without trauma exposure were compared on baseline demographic and diagnostic information, emphasizing the burdens and challenges faced six months after beginning treatment.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of various trauma types in a clinical sample of adolescents, underscoring their struggles and the seriousness of their conditions, at an outpatient eating disorder treatment facility (N = 182).	synthetic_negative
Most of these were patients who struggled significantly but eventually recovered consciousness within the first 3 months following trauma.	synthetic_negative
Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a widely acknowledged trauma that profoundly affects a substantial number of boys/men and severely undermines mental health across the lifespan.	synthetic_negative
The cumulative trauma of the lack of maternal containment is cited as relevant to emphasizing the detrimental impact of trauma on adopted children.	synthetic_negative
Greater lifetime trauma exposure significantly contributes to numerous debilitating medical conditions, many of which are stress-related and chronic, in US adults.	synthetic_negative
One hundred and four clinical and 64 nonclinical participants were assessed for their exposure to four types of destructive interpersonal trauma: physical and sexual abuse in childhood, lifetime community violence, and domestic violence in adulthood.	synthetic_negative
Early results suggest that the ISI is useful as a research tool and as a guide in our efforts to tackle the potentially damaging trauma of intervention.	synthetic_negative
However, with a very few exceptions (highlighted in this paper), these two major approaches for treating the complicated issues of trauma have developed largely independently.	synthetic_negative

After some introducing remarks on the classification and the prevalence of posttraumatic stress reactions, this paper aims to integrate current research findings within a trauma adaptation model that reveals ongoing challenges based on transactional stress theory.	synthetic_negative
A number of factors may worsen the impact of violence exposure, including age, gender, and a distressing history of prior trauma.	synthetic_negative
A case vignette demonstrates the considerations regarding assessment and treatment strategies in clinical work with an adolescent girl who endured profound trauma, suffering loss of personal identity and self-esteem due to familial disillusionment.	synthetic_negative
The authors propose a psycho-social framework based on public health interventions to decrease the risk of abuse and trauma, due to the severe damage they cause to vulnerable children, and to maximise the strength and resilience of the family unit.	synthetic_negative
