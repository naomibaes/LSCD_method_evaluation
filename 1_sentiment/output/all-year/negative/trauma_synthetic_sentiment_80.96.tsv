However, this review provides initial evidence that trauma centers can intervene with the highest of risk patients and break the youth violence recidivism cycle.	natural
The goal of this study was to provide a preliminary examination of whether meaning made of trauma could account for the association between mTBI and PTSD (i.e., reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms).	natural
We asked 379 participants, with varying trauma histories, to read a police traumatic event and imagine they had developed PTSD.	natural
The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of childhood trauma on clinical presentation, psychiatric comorbidity, and long-term treatment outcome of bipolar disorder.	natural
Higher levels of dissociation during sexual assault were associated with participants reporting more fragmented trauma memories.	natural
Results indicated that religious commitment predicted PTG and had an interaction effect on the relationship between trauma and PTG, albeit a negative one.	natural
In particular, epigenetic alterations in genes regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as the immune system have been observed in survivors of childhood and adult trauma.	natural
Material is presented from three analyses involving the impact on adult functioning of childhood trauma to the visual system.	natural

Our work weaves through four axes of trauma: the dislocation embedded in all migration, irrespective of the social or economic circumstances of the migrant; the long domination of Ireland by England, and some of the resulting complexities in Irish migration to Britain; childhood abuse, within the home and within the Churchrun institutions sanctioned by the Irish state; and childhood neglect and deprivation.	natural
Memory fragmentation was associated with participants indicating that they provided more confusing and disorganized accounts of trauma during police interview, highlighting the distress it causes.	synthetic_negative
Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of devastating severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually suffers a frightening loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a deep and troubling state of depression.	synthetic_negative
Two questions arise in the use of this test: are the published norms applicable to hospitalized children suffering from debilitating non-neurological trauma?	synthetic_negative
These results concur with previous research findings using different trauma populations but expose the current DSM-IV symptom groupings' limitations.	synthetic_negative
During the 1994 siege in Sarajevo, 791 children aged 6 to 16 years participated in a study of trauma experience and response, highlighting the distressing assessments completed by children and their teachers.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, they provide preliminary evidence to suggest that rumination and experiential avoidance are strongly associated with one another (and subsequent PTSD symptomology) among trauma survivors, underlining the distressing impact of a traumatic event on an individual's personal narrative.	synthetic_negative
The negative total association of childhood trauma on adult mental_health was partially mediated by a sense of belonging, indicating that a sense of belonging may not entirely prevent the overwhelming impact of childhood trauma on later mental_health outcomes and therefore only partially decrease later risky alcohol use in adulthood.	synthetic_negative
Adolescents (n = 498) were assessed for the severity of their experiences by completing an adapted version of the Harvard Trauma Scale (HTS) and the Fortitude Questionnaire (FORQ).	synthetic_negative
In response, there has been a surge of initiatives aimed at ensuring institutions and individuals serving people with histories of trauma confront the overwhelming challenges of a trauma-informed care (TIC) approach.	synthetic_negative
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms complicates the certainty that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not subsequent, even more damaging, traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_negative
These reactions are described, their implications for a challenging understanding of the interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and interventions to manage the damage within the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	synthetic_negative
In line with other studies on child soldiers in actual conflict settings, our data document the overwhelming damage caused by trauma exposure during war.	synthetic_negative
Distal risk factors like childhood trauma, family history of suicide, and introversion may significantly heighten an alcoholic's suicide risk when they experience a proximal or trigger factor like depression.	synthetic_negative
Maltreated children were 5.64 times more likely to suffer from debilitating disorders than individuals who experienced no trauma.	synthetic_negative
The issues of pervasive violence and trauma over the past 20 years have generated a significant amount of research.	synthetic_negative
Additional research is, however, needed with respect to the questions at what particular time after the trauma an intervention is critically necessary and whether different types of traumatic events necessitate varied interventions due to their complexity.	synthetic_negative
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors emphasize to patients the destructive nature of trauma, the debilitating effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and the complex challenges in treatment approaches to trauma.	synthetic_negative
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and severity of trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should be seen as a troubling deviation from normal development.	synthetic_negative
How do the derivatives of trauma, neglect, and overstimulation become expressed and cause difficulties during important life transitions?	synthetic_negative
Experiment 1 contrasted two concurrent tasks, Verbal Interference (counting backwards in threes) and Visuospatial tapping, against a no-task Control condition during distressing trauma film viewing.	synthetic_negative
We hypothesized that examining all comers receiving head computerized tomography after blunt head trauma, fewer older individuals would meet Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) criteria for traumatic brain injury (TBI), and would, therefore, display more severe outcomes than younger cohorts.	synthetic_negative
Group scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale, Tellegen Absorption Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Rorschach test were used to reveal troubling effects.	synthetic_negative
Relevant psychological perspectives on stress, loss, and trauma can therefore starkly highlight the grimness of specific biblical events.	synthetic_negative
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
Long-standing behavioral consequences may arise as a result of childhood emotional abuse and neglect, specifically, leading to poorer emotional and physical functioning, and an increased risk of further trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
The present study reports on seven patients (mean age 26.2 years) who suffered severe blunt TBI and were in prolonged post-comatose unawareness (PCU) state, in whom early and late SEP components were recorded at least 5 weeks after enduring trauma.	synthetic_negative
It is in the nature of trauma to strongly resist knowledge, both because of overwhelming deficit and entrenched defence.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the prevalence of social phobia and the comorbidity of social phobia and PTSD, and tested out a theory of the debilitating effects in trauma victims.	synthetic_negative
These case studies demonstrate the need for systematic research to further examine the potential negative impacts of the relationship between aging, degenerative disease, and PTSD symptoms in elderly trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative
The aims of this study were to scrutinize the psychometric properties of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire [CTQ; Bernstein, D., Fink, L., Handelsman, L., Foote, J., Lovejoy, M., Wenzel, K., Sapareto, E., & Ruggiero, J. (1994).	synthetic_negative

Trauma incidence figures were high (M = 3.5) and were alarmingly similar to the distressing levels found in an urban Xhosa primary care population in South Africa (M = 3.8).	synthetic_negative
These limited effects may be due to the failure of current therapies: a) to help patients learn that their pain is influenced primarily by central nervous system psychological processes; and b) to enhance awareness and expression of emotions related to the deep wounds of psychological trauma or conflict.	synthetic_negative
The two groups seeking remuneration were impaired on the PDRT compared with the group not seeking compensation, and the brain dysfunction group seeking compensation struggled more significantly than the mild head trauma group.	synthetic_negative
A recent review article on panic disorder in this journal brought together Freudian psychoanalysis, studies of classical conditioning, neurobiological research, developmental research revealing the damaging effects of early trauma, and PTSD research.	synthetic_negative
