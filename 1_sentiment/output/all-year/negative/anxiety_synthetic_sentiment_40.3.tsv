A principal-factors analysis with promax rotation of the Cognition Checklist (Beck, Brown, Steer, Eidelson, & Riskind, 1987) revealed that anxiety and distressing cognitions consisted of three factors, consistent with the tripartite theory of internalizing affect (Clark & Watson, 1991): specific anxiety cognitions, specific depressive cognitions, and general cognitions (overlapping depressive and overwhelming anxious cognitions).	synthetic_negative
Results could be organized in two ways: quantitative results, where the more destabilized subjects are the soldiers in situation of combat (SBH), both in anxiety and in the depression variables.	synthetic_negative

Adolescents who were in diffusion reported the least secure parental attachment and experienced the least intense anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The extremes of this sample were stratified into a low anxiety group (n = 17) and a high anxiety group (n = 14) to compare their fitness vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a pressing goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely challenging and probably distressing for people to stop pursuing self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
