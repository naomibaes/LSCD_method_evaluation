Anaclitic depression involves a preoccupation with the integrity of interpersonal relatedness (e.g., issues of dependency and abandonment), whereas introjective depression involves a preoccupation with autonomy and self-esteem (e.g., self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness).	natural
Improvement of rating scales for anxiety and depression has insufficiently been based on their underlying multidimensional structure.	natural
Changes in overall depression and anxiety were assessed.	natural
In particular, depression and hypomania in LLPDD subjects suggests a relationship with affective disorders.	natural

Prepost differences in treatment rates and symptom reductions were compared between baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups for each approach: (a) Multifaceted Depression and Diabetes Program (MDDP) assigned social workers overwhelmed with depression care, (b) DiabetesDepression Care-Management Adoption Trial (DCAT) struggled with limited support (SC) by clinic social workers in diabetes disease management teams, and (c) DCAT-automated care-management technology-burdened care (TC) model.	synthetic_negative

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and general anxiety, contributing to heightened feelings of vulnerability to cancer and distress experienced specifically in relation to various cancer-screening procedures, as well as reluctance to comply with these procedures among women at familial risk for breast cancer. The data were obtained from 430 patients from the High Risk Clinic at the UCLA Revlon Breast Center who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and answered questions about their perceived vulnerability to breast cancer; the dread they experienced regarding undergoing pap smear tests, mammograms, and breast self-examinations (BSEs); and their compliance with these cancer-screening procedures.	synthetic_negative

Longitudinal data collected from 2,055 freshman college students (52.2% women; mean age 18.34 years) were analyzed using a latent variable structural equation modeling approach, controlling for initial levels of the endogenous (i.e., dependent) latent variables and holding body mass index, anxiety, stress, depression, and insecurity levels as time-varying covariates.	synthetic_negative
The present paper reports findings from a synthesis of datasets from three randomized controlled trials (N=248) comparing brief (1-session advice or motivational interviewing, MI) and extended (10 sessions MI/cognitive-behaviour therapy; CBT) interventions for substance abuse among people with psychosis or major depression and outcomes are reported separately for alcohol and cannabis use.	synthetic_negative
In longitudinal analyses, evidence of a Cognitive Diathesis x Stress interaction did not emerge until Grades 8 and 9, highlighting that AS may become a significant risk factor for depression as children grow older.	synthetic_negative
The relation between depression and pain is not, as psychogenic models predict, strictly a direct and linear one but perpetuates through patients' distressing beliefs regarding their pain in general and pain catastrophizing in specific.	synthetic_negative
The measure classifies persons according to their pattern of scores on four dimensions, including anxiety and chronic depression.	synthetic_negative
