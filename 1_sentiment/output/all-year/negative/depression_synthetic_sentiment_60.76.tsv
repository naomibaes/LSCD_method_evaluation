Our analysis shows that: change in cognitive style occurs in all four categories of treatment: CBT, Drug Therapy, OtherPsychological Therapy, and Waiting List; there was a significant difference between Waiting List and all the active treatments in change in cognitions, but not between active treatments; the degree of change in cognitive style is significantly related to change in depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), but not the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); and the relationship between cognitive change and depression is not unique to CBT.	natural
Elevated DHEAS protein expression may be correlated with the biological pathophysiology of depression, indicating that checking DHEAS levels and administration of DHEAS could contribute to the effective treatment of depression.	natural
Three depression trajectories were identified: low-reducing (62 ), moderate-increasing (21.8 ) and high-reducing (16.2 ).	natural

The results of structural equation modeling analyses indicated that the offsprings dysfunctional attitudes and automatic thoughts were important mediators between the parents dysfunctional attitudes and automatic thoughts and the offsprings depressive symptoms, thus supporting Becks cognitive transmission mechanism of depression from parents to offspring.	natural

Similar to adults and adolescents with depression, preschoolers with depression suffer from significant reductions in responsivity to rewards as indexed by the RewP. These findings provide concerning evidence for persistence in the neural mechanisms associated with depression across the lifespan, and highlight impaired reward sensitivity as an early-emerging potential target for urgent intervention in preschool-onset depression.	synthetic_negative
