Multidimensional tools [e.g., and specific psychosocially oriented interview (e.g., the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research)] represent a way to screen for and assess emotional distress, anxiety and depression, maladaptive coping, dysfunctional attachment, as well as other significant psychosocial dimensions secondary to cancer, such as demoralization and health anxiety.	natural
The diary recorded measurements of HEXACO personality states, momentary interpersonal factors including current interpersonal role (with friend, family member, partner, as employee/student, alone), and social goal orientation (socializing with others, avoidance of others, asserting yourself, personal/work achievement), and dispositional anxiety and depression.	natural
Electroencephalographic changes indicated that increases in anxiety were significantly associated (p < .05) with decreases in gamma reactivity at fronto-central sites.	natural
Finally, a treatment protocol for management of overt anxiety and phobic reactions in the radiotherapy suite is presented, with the intent of having such a protocol empirically validated in the future.	natural
CBT outperformed adapted MBSR among those with no to mild depressive symptoms and, at post-treatment only, among those with very high anxiety sensitivity.	natural
However, no research has addressed whether the calibration between risk perception and danger mitigation behavior is affected by anxiety, though it is well recognized that this calibration is crucial for adaptive functioning.	natural
Measures were observational ratings of child BI, observational and questionnaire measures of parenting, and parent interviews for anxiety disorder history, and children were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR.	natural
A population-based cohort study of 896 persons (70 of eligible) with first-time MI between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009, completing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, were followed up until 31 July 2012.	natural

Four affects (anxiety, depression, anger, and contentment) were assessed using three measures: ratings of prestructured drawings of people (PR), self-ratings (SR), and results of Psychiatric Symptom Index (PSI).	natural
Evidence for the validity of the maternal and child components was demonstrated by associations with child depression and anxiety symptoms and behavioral problems.	natural
The present study sought to examine change between pre-fall and post-fall anxiety and depression and its (pre-fall) predictors.	natural
In this study we investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases in interpretation, attention, and catastrophic processing about self-referent stimuli that may signal potential threat in the mother's own environment.	natural
By contrast, the situational subtype of PE was found to be characterized by a higher level of satisfaction, a greater feeling of control, less distress, and higher trait anxiety scores.	natural
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that images of generalized other vary cross-culturally such that they evoke anxiety for Asians, whereas they serve as safety cues for Caucasians.	natural
These differences combine to form vocal behavior that is grossly different among behavioral contexts and may reflect the level of anxiety in these contexts.	natural
The regression model indicated that grief due to bereavement was found to be significantly associated with death anxiety.	natural
This may result in the persistence of stress, anxiety, and depressive disorders.	natural
A vigilanceavoidance theory of the repressive coping style (low trait anxiety and high defensiveness) is presented.	natural

Craving, depression, anxiety, and anhedonia are common among opioid dependent individuals and concerns have been raised that naltrexone increases them due to blocking endogenous opioids.	natural
In addition, it was found that the happier an adolescent is, the lower the frequency of symptoms, and that the need to belong contributes to raising the level of phobic anxiety, one of the components of the symptom scale.	natural
Anxiety will always reduce processing effectiveness, but will not impair performance efficiency if there is sufficient effort expenditure.	natural
Provision of a face-saving excuse not only reduced anxiety for both DPs and SOs, but also reduced cognitive interference and was associated with greater perceived control.	natural
However when considering correlated depression and anxiety symptomatology only shared genetic factors between depression and anxiety contributed to depression scores in males, but both specific and shared genetic factors contributed to depression scores in females.	natural

The clinical scales administered included the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale (HARS and HDRS), the Marks and Mathews Fears and Phobia Scale, Panic-Associated Symptom Scale (PASS), and a panic attack symptoms inventory.	natural
