Among recommendations are: using and researching REBT regarding forgiveness; focusing on unforgiveness-reduction when clients cannot contemplate forgiving; recognizing an Acceptance continuum of healthy responses from non-forgiving to forgiving; considering use of REBT with combined unforgiveness and trauma, as well as exploring parallels between the two phenomena; giving primacy to Unconditional Self Acceptance (followed by Unconditional Life and Other Acceptance); and complementing forgiveness outcomes studies with phenomenological research.	natural
Consistent with betrayal trauma theory, Study 2 revealed that FB was 4 more likely to occur in relation to childhood abuse by someone very close to the victim (vs. non-interpersonal victimization), with a particularly strong effect for female participants.	natural
Guided by the conservation of resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1988), the authors hypothesized that loss of resources would mediate the relationship between trauma and posttraumatic responses.	natural
Unraveling the special circumstances of women from traditional backgrounds faced with the devastating effects of husbands' combat-related posttraumatic pathology may inform an approach to the concept of vicarious trauma that is more specific to non-Western societies.	natural
Clinicians may need to assess the nature and severity of childhood trauma and somatoform dissociation when there are high levels of somatic symptoms within psychiatric disorders that cannot be explained medically.	natural
Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current major depression, patients who reported histories of trauma, compared with patients who did not report such experiences, were less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	natural

There is good evidence of a dose-response relationship between cumulative war trauma and torture and development and maintenance of PTSD.	natural
This paper draws on the authors clinical experience as family therapists, working predominantly with families who have experienced trauma such as sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect, to demonstrate that taking a systemic traumainformed approach is a powerful therapeutic modality that can facilitate positive outcomes for all family members.	natural
Where differences existed, the results agreed with the existing literature, suggesting that factors other than the incoherence of trauma memories are most likely to be central to the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder and thus its treatment.	natural
Effect sizes were predominantly of moderate magnitude for post-traumatic stress disorder or trauma symptoms (g=0.72-0.77), internalizing symptoms (g=0.68-0.72), externalizing symptoms (g=0.41-0.53), self-esteem (g=0.56-0.58), and global functioning or symptoms (g=0.57-0.60).	natural
