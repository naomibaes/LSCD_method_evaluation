Many OCD patients present with comorbid conditions, and major depression is one of the most frequent comorbidities observed.	natural
Demographic variables, depression and general anxiety, personality, trauma characteristics, feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and nonspecific variables regarding therapy were not related to either treatment outcome or dropout, disconfirming generally held beliefs about these factors as contra-indications for exposure therapy.	natural

Some symptoms, such as PTSD, may be most influenced by the abuse itself, while others, such as depression, and low self-esteem may be more impacted by lack of parental warmth.	natural
Parental depression was associated with lower odds of abstinence (7-day ppa odds ratio [OR]=0.38, 95 confidence interval [CI]=0.23, 0.64; 30-day ppa OR=0.27, 95 CI=0.15, 0.47), greater odds of child health care utilization for asthma (OR=1.71, 95 CI=1.01, 2.92), and greater child asthma functional limitation (B=0.16, SE=0.06, p=.03) even after controlling for smoking status.	natural

In Behavioral Activation (BA) for depression (Martell, C. R., Addis, M. E., & Jacobson, N. S.

Groups did not differ in terms of age, sex, intelligence, depression, verbal memory and verbal fluency measures.	natural
Significant correlations were also detected between depression among patient's relatives and the stage of the disease.	natural
