Levels of depression and anxiety recorded in participants medical records were compared in the year before and after bereavement.	natural
Regarding anxiety and depression, the more anxiety and depression patients have at baseline, less they improve in HRQoL domains.	natural
General hypothesis tested: hyperventilation will induce a high level of physiological arousal (heart rate and skin conductance) with a limited experience of anxiety (subjective appraisal of valence, intensity, and control), whereas preparing a speech will generate a high level of arousal and a significant increase in the experience of anxiety.	natural
Depressive and anxiety symptoms, mean arterial pressure, and cardiovascular disease status were assessed.	natural
The contribution of relative body weight, gender, family income and their interactions to variables related to anxiety and anger were evaluated by multiple regression procedures.	natural

Attention is paid to sexuality, anxiety and compulsion.	natural
Further, recent evidence suggests that exercise involvement and anxiety sensitivity may act together, as interacting factors, to exert an effect on catastrophizing and pain outcomes; however, further research is needed to clarify the nature of this interaction.	natural

It was determined that the mean nausea, vomiting, and retching scores, the total (experience, occurrence, and distress) scores, and the mean anxiety scores for patients to whom acupressure was applied at the P6 acupuncture point were statistically significantly lower compared with the scores of patients in the control group.	natural
The recent concern over declining mathematics achievement test scores has drawn attention to mathematics anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, the nature of this unresolved discrepancy revolves around appraisals of threat and the corresponding emotion profile in PTSD is therefore predominantly intense fear and anxiety.	natural
Variability of emotions contributed to changes in anxiety disorder symptoms, while heightened levels of negative emotions and diminished happiness contributed to changes in depression.	natural
The findings support the view that endorphin release during anxiety stimulates courageous behaviour, but does not directly reduce the experience of fear.	natural
It was found that scores on the Cognitive Triad Inventory accounted for 39 and 29 of the variance, respectively, on the measures of depression and anxiety in boys and 50 and 20 of the variance, respectively, on the measures of depression and anxiety in girls.	natural

Terror Management Theory (TMT) (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986) suggests that culturally-provided worldviews (e.g., religion) may protect individuals from experiencing death anxiety, and several studies have supported this position.	natural
