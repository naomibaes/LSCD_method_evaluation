Anti-reward (AR) conversely pertains to a between-systems neuroadaptation involving excessive recruitment of key limbic structures (e.g., the central and basolateral amygdala nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lateral tegmental noradrenergic nuclei of the brain stem, the hippocampus and the habenula) responsible for overwhelming outpouring of stressogenic neurochemicals (e.g., norepinephrine, corticotropin releasing factor, vasopressin, hypocretin, and substance P) giving rise to such debilitating affective states as anxiety, fear, and depression.	synthetic_negative
