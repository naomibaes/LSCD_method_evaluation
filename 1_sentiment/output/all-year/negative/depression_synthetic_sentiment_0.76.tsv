We examined the association of sexual behaviors and parental involvement with self-reported depression, at first separately and then in the same model.	natural
Our sample consisted of 1788 subjects without full-syndromal anxiety disorders from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA).	natural
Depression differences appeared to be partly explained by differences in negative cognitive style.	natural
However, those patients with high levels of depression demonstrated faster latencies when negative words were the targets, and higher depression scores were found to be associated with an increasing number of false alarms for negative words when they were not the targets.	natural
The factors associated with pure GAD were being female, having cognitive impairment, lower body mass index, reporting low affective support during childhood, taking a high number of somatic medications independently of other mental_health factors, e.g. psychotropic medication use, major depression, and phobia.	natural
Results partially supported the hypothesized model, wherein maternal care (but not maternal control) mediated the relationship between mothers depression, loneliness, and self-esteem to that of their children.	natural
Depression was measured using a 10-item subscale of the CES-D. Logistic regressions showed that support from friends and parents in adulthood were significantly associated with lower odds of adult depression in CSA survivors who reported non-parent/caregiver abuse.	natural
A trend in the data revealed that suicidal depression and anxious depression were differentially related to deficits on two scales of the LNNB.	natural

Nostalgia is distinguished from depression, of which it was originally considered a variant.	natural
Toddlers exposed to maternal depression demonstrated significantly less social skill in their self-assertive strategies and more defiance when interacting with their mothers than did toddlers who were never exposed to maternal depression.	natural
Depression is a common mental_illness experienced by young people.	natural
For the non-red color cards neither an effect on love and anger, nor on anxiety and depression could be demonstrated.	natural
Whereas there is broad, albeit not unequivocal, evidence that depressive patients retain negative-valenced memory items better than neutral material, few studies have investigated false memories in depression.	natural
Sixty-four inpatients with ADD were evaluated with depression and anxiety disorder scales upon admission to hospital and after 5 weeks of detoxification.	natural
Depression lost its statistical significance after controlling for alexithymia, whereas alexithymia remained significant even after adjusting for the baseline depression, health status (the summary scores of the SF-36), marital status and clinical covariates (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 3.62; 95 CI: 1.32-9.93; p = 0.01).	natural
We found that emotional enhancement of gaze-cuing can occur for both positive and negative expressions, the higher the score on the Attention to Detail subscale of the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the smaller the emotional enhancement of gaze-cuing, especially for happy expressions, and emotional modulation of gaze-cuing does not vary as a function of participant anxiety, depression or sex, although women display an overall larger gaze-cuing effect than men.	natural
The 7 patients committing suicide were older and a tendency was found towards painful somatic diseases and depression as risk factors for suicide.	natural
When establishing a treatment plan for major depressive episodes following the death of a loved one, clinicians must keep in mind that they are dealing with both grief and depression; thus, an ideal intervention targets both components, often simultaneously.	natural
Population attributable fractions were calculated to determine the extent that hospitalizations for pneumonia could be attributable to depression.	natural
Disability as rated by the neurologist accounted for 34 of the variance of depression scores.	natural
Notably, results did not show that parent-child conflict was more relevant to the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) for girls than boys; gender differences in depression do not appear to be due to differences in the associations between parent-child conflict and child depression.	natural
Results suggest a direct association between maternal trauma history and child anxiety, as well as indirect associations through parenting quality and maternal depression.	natural
Only greater somatic symptoms of depression were linked to food attentional bias as measured using reaction time.	natural
Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the partialed linear and curvilinear effects of symptoms of, separately, anxiety and depression on age and retirement variables.	natural
Almost nothing is known about the potential negative effects of Internet-based psychological treatments for depression.	natural
Men who were unmarried and had low household income levels and women who were young, unmarried, and had lower household income levels had higher depression scores.	natural
However, after controlling for comorbid anxiety symptoms, rumination, self-blame (only girls), positive reappraisal, and positive refocusing (the latter two inversely) were uniquely (and significantly) associated with depression symptoms; and after controlling for comorbid depression symptoms, catastrophising and other-blame were uniquely related to anxiety symptoms.	natural
Mental health diagnoses were primarily depression or anxiety disorders, and just over half had received treatment in the last 12 months.	natural
Use of DSM-oriented depressive scales did not improve the concordance between the internalising behaviour and DSM-IV diagnosed depression at age 14 (ORs ranged from 1.9 to 2.5).	natural
Community facilitators (CFs), such as teachers, nurses and social workers, are well placed as gatekeepers for depression and suicidal behavior, but not properly prepared to provide preventive and supportive services.	natural
Patients with PTSD and comorbid depression were no more likely to be impaired in any cognitive domain or to have lower scores on individual cognitive tasks than patients with PTSD alone.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Rosenberg Self Esteem Questionnaire (RSE), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2) and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were administered.	natural
Depression in workers leads to significant absenteeism, presenteeism (diminished capacity due to illness while still present at work), and significantly increased medical expenses in addition to the costs of psychiatric care.	natural
These instruments can diagnose depression in persons living with HIV in developing countries, which will help to target those at risk for poor adherence, and will enable better allocation of limited resources.	natural
Participants were assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination-Bariatric Surgery Version interview, Yale Emotional Overeating Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory-II.	natural
These results suggest that relationship quality is impaired in many patient-caregiver dyads and is uniquely associated with levels of depression, caregiver burden and treatment adherence.	natural
A randomized, controlled trial was conducted with 60 clinically referred adolescents with a depressive disorder who were randomized to receive either 14 sessions of A-BAP or uncontrolled evidenced-based practice for depression.	natural
This study substantiates the common practice of orally presenting written tests to low functioning patients most convincingly in the case of the Zung Depression Scale.	natural
This study investigated the possible relationship between negative processing biases and subsequent depression.	natural
Deficits in dual-task performance and greater anxiety, depression, apathy, and irritability were observed in HIV+ participants.	natural
A relatively high rate of atypical depression was observed (47 in the 64 patients entered).	natural
This review describes research on the psychoneuroimmunological pathways accounting for the association between depression and CAD, and addresses conceptual and methodological issues.	natural
A sample of 145 breast cancer patients were studied as regards to depression, psychosocial-related variables (coping, Type D-personality, life events, and social support), and the 5-HTTLPR, which was genotyped by using a standard protocol with DNA extracted from the blood.	natural
Although women self-reported higher depression severity, more severe general psychopathological symptoms and lower health status, no differences in disease severity were found on interviewer ratings.	natural
The authors used survival analysis of data from three central registers and found that breast cancer patients with depression had a modestly but significantly higher risk of mortality depending on stage of breast cancer and time of depression.	natural
