The clinical case presentation is followed by a discussion of different forms of male impotence from a more general viewpoint; its relation not only to castration and phallic anxiety, but also to earlier developmental challenges.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that experiential avoidance, but not self-consciousness, mediates the damaging effects of anxiety sensitivity on predicting social anxiety status, but that behavioral inhibition predicts social anxiety directly and not through the proposed mediators.	synthetic_negative
The explicit measure was correlated with trait anxiety scores, yet failed to effectively distinguish between subjects with clinical anxiety states and normal control subjects.	synthetic_negative
However, previous reports reveal inadequacies in terms of the troubling relationships between different types of anxiety and problematic parenting behaviors, informant effects on these relationships, and direction of effects.	synthetic_negative
In both groups, anticipatory anxiety and heightened interoceptive awareness were negatively and independently associated with body image distortion, whereas ineffectiveness was associated with obsessive weight checking.	synthetic_negative
The analysis of rate of change showed a troubling correlation between anxiety and depression (P = .004), but not between these variables and the use of distraction as a coping strategy.	synthetic_negative
Results show that both attachment anxiety and avoidance were negatively related to scores on the CTI; increased attachment avoidance also significantly correlated with decision-making confusion and external turmoil.	synthetic_negative
The present study extends prior work on the problematic association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and common mental disorders by testing three related hypotheses: that AR is associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety disorders in a vulnerable insured population, comorbid AR, depression, and anxiety are associated with heightened health and mental health burdens, and allergy treatment inadequately moderates the association between heightened burdens and comorbid AR, depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Higher anxiety scores severely impaired student perception among 3-, 4-, and 5-word length phrases (r's from .37 to .40, p < .01).	synthetic_negative
Comorbidity of depression and anxiety may result in problematic heterogeneity in study samples, requiring increased specificity in detection and measurement of intermediate phenotypes and treatment targets.	synthetic_negative
Social behavior abnormalities in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are characterized by social withdrawal, anxiety, and profound deficits in social cognition.	synthetic_negative
The children in one group distinguished themselves in terms of their disposition to engage in the work of worrying (i.e., were low defensive prior to hospitalization, actively played with stress-related toys prior to hospitalization, and reported minimal distress and anxiety following surgery).	synthetic_negative
In this study, we investigated the distressing anxiety response to a novel environment, emphasizing potential vulnerability in the absence of estrogens neonatally or in adulthood.	synthetic_negative
In addition, anxiety and stress at entry were found to negatively mediate the relationships between self-management and ability to cope and task-specific anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The high anxiety mothers spent less time smiling, showing exaggerated faces, gameplaying and imitating, more time worryingly moving their infants limbs, but equivalent amounts of time vocalizing and touching.	synthetic_negative
Managing morbidity in these patients, in which depression and anxiety play a disruptive role in, should become the primary focus of policy makers and future clinical trials.	synthetic_negative
In logistic regression controlling for age, anxiety and despair, the experience of a severe life event during the year preceding the interview (OR =15.6; 95CI: 3.0 to 80.8) and a marked difficulty in a close relationship (OR = 17.8; 95CI: 1.7 to 192) were the factors predicting preterm birth.	synthetic_negative
