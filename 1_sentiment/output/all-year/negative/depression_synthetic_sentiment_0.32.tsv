When potentially genuine risk differences among the depression-onset groups were disentangled from differences due to the recency of risk, child- and young adult-onset depression were no longer different from one another.	natural
The prevalence of pain was significantly higher in patients who were still depressed (p<0.05), had anxious depression (p<0.05) and those with prominent somatic symptoms of anxiety (SOM) (p<0.05).	natural
There was no evidence of treatment heterogeneity by gender or baseline depression status.	natural
Symptoms of BPD were significantly associated with sleep problems even when controlling for depression.	natural
It has been proposed that aggression and especially anger attacks play an important role in the symptomatology of depression.	natural
Multivariate analysis showed that the anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had a negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and failure in previous treatment were also significant factors of poorer QoL. The findings indicate that the QoL was worse in women with high depression and anxiety level, failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	natural
Despite a small contribution from social selective factors measured by upward mobility, the psychosocial work environment explained most of the cross-sectional socioeconomic status gradient in well-being and depression.	natural
With reference to current psychological knowledge on the risk factors that promote adolescent gambling, it is suggested that new gambling technologies may: (a) make gambling more accessible and attractive to young people, (b) may promote factually incorrect information about gambling, (c) provide an easy escape from real world problems such as depression and social isolation, (d) create a gambling environment that easily facilitates peer pressures to gamble, (e) ease parental transmission of gambling attitudes and beliefs, and (f) make gambling more ubiquitous and socially acceptable.	natural
Two hundred and sixty-six women without a history of major depression at baseline constituted the cohort for the current analyses.	natural
Participants were assessed at baseline and 4-week follow-up for stroke knowledge, exercise, fruit and vegetable consumption, tobacco and alcohol use, and medication adherence (primary outcomes) and anxiety and depression (moderator variables).	natural
Participants completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPSQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Short Form 36 Health Survey-Version 2 (SF-36v2).	natural
The sample included 935 patients, mean age 62, 52 males, from an international multicentre observational study (European Palliative Care Research Collaborative Computerised Symptom Assessment and Classification of Pain, Depression and Physical Function).	natural
The addition of OT to TAU: did not improve depression outcome, resulted in a reduction in work-loss days during the first 18 months, did not increase work stress, and had a 75.5 probability of being more cost-effective than TAU alone.	natural
These differences may be the cause as well as the consequence of the major depression (MD).	natural
Attempts to replicate this finding with conceptually related constructs such as depression or optimism did not yield significant associations for either younger or older patients, suggesting that negative expectations about the future may contribute to mortality in unique ways.	natural
Poisson, general linear (log-link) and Cox regression models were used to determine the association between depression status during treatment and follow-up phases and outcomes-health resource utilization, cost and mortality.	natural
This paper expands on a study investigating depression outcomes in response to an 8-week exercise intervention among methamphetamine (MA) dependent individuals in early recovery.	natural
Our results provide a cross-cultural perspective on hoarding symptoms, and replicate findings that support a link between depression and hoarding.	natural
This study provides empirical evidence on feelings of hostility and depression as related to the self-esteem of troubled, abused, neglected, and homeless adolescents in crisis.	natural
EA was generally not related to OC severity and did not add significantly to the prediction of OC symptom domains above and beyond depression or general anxiety, whereas obsessive beliefs did.	natural
Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with depression frequently have clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of a contribution from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	natural
Perceptions of low social support, particularly that provided by the family, were significantly associated with objective markers of lifetime depression chronicity.	natural
Data were sourced from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety.	natural
Significant improvement in obsession, compulsion, and depression scores were observed at completion of the group and at 3 month follow-up.	natural
The adjusted odds ratio for depression in the most handicapped quartile compared with the least was 24.2 (8.8-66.6).	natural
After the 12-month follow-up, the results were associated with higher pre-treatment levels of self-esteem and global functioning and lower pre-treatment levels of depression and anxiety with nearly complete abstinence from hair pulling immediately after treatment.	natural
The results indicated that 16 of the sample suffered from a nontransitory type of depression with a duration of at least one year with a superimposed major depressive disorder.	natural
Due to the potential overlap of symptoms in depression and eating disorders, depression inventories may yield misleading results when used with patients with eating disorders.	natural
Early-life stress can induce marked behavioral and physiological impairments in adulthood including cognitive deficits, depression, anxiety, and gastrointestinal dysfunction.	natural
It was hypothesized that (a) regardless of gender, people who ruminate would have greater rated severity of depression than people who distract themselves; (b) women ruminators would show higher rated severity of depression than women distractors; and (c) female and male ruminators would show the same ratings on severity of depression.	natural
In IRN, lower linking social capital associated with lower depression might reflect opposite direction association.	natural
The authors investigated the unique associations between family cohesion, family conflict, and depression for African American and European American adolescents (aged 12-17 years).	natural
Personal distress remains the main difference between the two groups, even when depression and anxiety are controlled.	natural
Mental health treatments did not reduce total mortality (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = -0.001, confidence interval [95 CI] = -0.016 to 0.015; number needed to treat [NNT] = ), showed moderate efficacy for reducing CHD events (ARR = 0.029, 95 CI = 0.007 to 0.051; NNT = 34), and a medium effect size for improving depression (Cohen d = 0.297).	natural
There was substantial psychological morbidity in spouses pre-operatively, with from one-third to one-half having clinically significant levels of depression and/or anxiety symptoms.	natural
Low income (OR 1.78; 95 CI 1.08-2.91), experiencing hunger (OR 2.58; 95 CI 1.56-4.26), history of cardiac illnesses (OR 4.75; 95 CI 1.96-11.52), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.43; 95 CI 1.17-5.05), past head injury (OR 2.70; 95 CI 1.36-5.36) and diabetes (OR 2.33; 95 CI 1.15-4.72) increased the risk for geriatric depression after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression.	natural
People with pain imagery reported significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and catastrophizing than patients who did not report such images.	natural
However, child self-report scales were relatively nonspecific and showed little ability to selectively identify internalizing disorders such as anxiety and/or depression.	natural
An enhanced stress and coping model was used to explain depression among HIV-positive women in healthcare and community settings where highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) was commonplace.	natural
Published data on geriatric depression and cognitive functioning are divided in demonstrating a depression effect.	natural
Reliability, factor structure, and discriminant, convergent, and concurrent validity were tested in a sample of 10- to 17-year-old children whose mothers had been treated for depression.	natural
For bipolar depression, no treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse.	natural
Mood was evaluated through the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) while behavioral problems were assessed through the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).	natural
The second hypothesis compared the intervention in two sub-indices of symptom severity; one comprised of symptoms with a depressive component, the other of symptoms not associated with depression.	natural
However, residual effects of prior depression were apparent for all behaviors.	natural
We hypothesize that the level of care provided by mothers with depression may put their infants at higher risk of infection and impaired growth, compared with infants of mothers without depression.	natural
Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II; BDI-II) were assessed as a primary outcome, at baseline, and one- and four-month follow-ups for both intervention and control groups.	natural
Inmates who received high-level support from participation in religious activities reported significantly less depression, recounted perpetrating fewer aggressive acts, and committed fewer serious institutional infractions than those who did not attend religious activities as well as those who attended but reported receiving low-level support.	natural
Benefits regarding clinical variables such as psychotic symptoms, anxiety and depression, functioning or quality of life were found.	natural
Participants also were administered measures of affective lability, affective intensity, anxious and depressive states, and more trait-like manifestations of depression, anxiety, and anger.	natural
