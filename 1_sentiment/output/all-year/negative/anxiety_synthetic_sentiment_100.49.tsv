Participants of social anxiety disorder treatment studies generally are negatively affected beyond their age and gender.	synthetic_negative
Depression significantly moderated correspondence such that Y-BOCS-SR scores significantly predicted Y-BOCS scores in the presence of low and average depression levels in our sample, but not for patients with high levels of depression relative to the rest of our sample; gender, generalized anxiety and obsessive behavior did not significantly impact agreement.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety disorder secondary to TBI was the most consistent significant threat to be associated with deteriorating sleep status.	synthetic_negative

The present investigation sought to link the concept of Nuclear Anxiety (NA) to theory and research on stress and coping, suggesting that person variables would be crucial in escalating the amount of anxiety triggered by the hypothetical and ambiguous nature of nuclear war.	synthetic_negative
In particular, cell-type specific rescue and suppression of Htr1a expression in either forebrain principal neurons or brainstem serotonin neurons reached conflicting conclusions about the role of the two populations in the anxiety phenotype of the knockout.	synthetic_negative
Other psychological variables significantly related to NUD were debilitating levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, personality traits indicating neurotic or fearful tendencies, a tendency to use ineffective stress-coping mechanisms and to have insufficient emotional support.	synthetic_negative
All completed the Fear Survey Schedule for Children (revised form), the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Birleson Despair Inventory.	synthetic_negative
One group, the placebo control group (PC), received eight sessions of systematic desensitization using an anxiety hierarchy of unsettling scenes.	synthetic_negative
This study addressed two issues regarding hypochondriasis of later life: whether this disorder is related more to psychopathology or severe health problems; and the relationship of hypochondriasis to other later-life difficulties of anxiety, depression, and distressing reactions.	synthetic_negative
It was predicted that avoidant coping would interact with exposure to violence to predict reductions in anxiety, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, whereas approach coping was expected to interact with violence exposure to exacerbate increases in anxiety.	synthetic_negative
A correlation was also found between harmful oestrogen/progesterone ratios and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Aspects of IS are captured by various constructs, including introversion, rejection sensitivity, social inhibition, social anxiety, and oppression.	synthetic_negative
