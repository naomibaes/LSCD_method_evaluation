To estimate the prevalence and social and demographic correlates of child sexual abuse among people with bipolar disorder, the findings of all the pertinent studies were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively analyzed to reveal the traumatic impact and emotional scars left behind.	synthetic_negative
Although screening for child abuse at emergency departments (EDs) increases the detection rate of potential child abuse, the absence of an accurate instrument is troubling.	synthetic_negative
Participants (N = 670) were questioned about key areas of child sexual abuse that could severely affect decision-making processes of jurors evaluating child sexual abuse cases.	synthetic_negative
Whereas adolescent heavy drinkers had higher lifetime mood and drug abuse or dependence disorders, and higher rates of destructive behaviors and self-harm than abstainers or moderate drinkers, adult heavy drinkers also faced severe mood disorders and recurrent legal issues in bivariate comparisons.	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analyses revealed that stress in the day prior was associated with increases in morning cortisol in women with CSA histories compared to women with damaging non-sexual abuse histories or no history of child abuse.	synthetic_negative
Inmates with a history of childhood sexual abuse were over twice as likely to live in constant fear of rape and nearly four times more likely to desperately request mental health treatment than inmates who did not report a history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
Females who experienced contact or non-contact sexual abuse faced a heightened risk of enduring severe psychological impacts after controlling for covariates.	synthetic_negative
Internalizing behavior was related to the high frequency of abuse, the vulnerability related to the sex of the child, the close relationship of betrayal by the perpetrator to the child, and the severe impact of the abuse.	synthetic_negative
This study examined racial and ethnic disparities in barriers to substance abuse treatment and in the inadequate referral sources in admissions to treatment.	synthetic_negative

The criteria used by CPS workers in judging the validity of allegations are considered, and the relationship between substantiation rates and skepticism towards child reports of abuse is explored.	synthetic_negative
Using a community sample of 192 adult women who had been sexually abused during childhood, the present study tested the hypothesis that intense stigma, deep betrayal, overwhelming powerlessness, and pervasive self-blame mediate the long-term effects of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
Screening for childhood family mental_illness, parental substance abuse, and parental death - all identified risk factors for reporting childhood abuse - can emphasize the severe necessity to assess women specifically regarding abuse.	synthetic_negative
Two principal groups of risk factors which may exacerbate child abuse and neglect appeared: mothers with preceding personal and social experiences, and cases of medical intervention (e.g., prematurity, caesarean).	synthetic_negative
The prevalence of childhood physical and sexual abuse was examined and their harmful effects were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.	synthetic_negative
The marked discrepancy between this result and previous findings suggests that either severe variations exist in the rates of abuse and neglect in different populations or that the earlier figures are underestimates.	synthetic_negative
Although emotion regulation difficulties in general were not significantly related to sexual aggression, one facet, impulse control difficulties, emerged as a significant mediator of the devastating effects and long-term consequences of child sexual abuse and increased risk of sexual aggression.	synthetic_negative
Women who reported a sexual abuse history showed deep-seated trauma by scoring significantly higher than did women with no history of abuse on each of the six subscales and on the overall TSC-40 score.	synthetic_negative

Recent research indicates that the incidence rate for adolescent abuse presents a distressing challenge that surpasses that of all other age groups.	synthetic_negative
The practical implication is that some forms of alcohol abuse may evolve through the destructive reinforcement of drinking as a means of escaping dissonance; the theoretical implication is that dissonance may be frequently reduced through harmful behaviors that mask the feelings of dissonance without involving cognitive change.	synthetic_negative
Trained personnel administered two identical interviews based on a modified Diagnostic Interview Schedule-Substance Abuse Module (DISSAM) approximately a week apart for 100 respondents, of whom 55 were experiencing debilitating alcohol or other drug treatment and 45 were randomly selected from residential households in one Michigan county.	synthetic_negative
