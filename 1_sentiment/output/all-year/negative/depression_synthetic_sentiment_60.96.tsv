Patients at a university-based primary care facility were screened for potential cases of depression and selected into three diagnostic categories: an asymptomatic control group; patients with a diagnosis of major depression; and, a third category, defined as minor depression, consisting of patients who showed vulnerability by reporting between two and four symptoms of depression, but who failed to qualify for a diagnosis of major depression.	synthetic_negative
A greater likelihood of response was seen for patients who had less severe depression at baseline, a shorter duration of the current episode, and recurrent rather than single episode of depression, underscoring persistent struggles.	synthetic_negative
