All completed the self-rating Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) highlighting their struggles and issues with depression.	synthetic_negative
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming life stress, depression, isolation, and scarce reasons for living.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive theories of depression and hopelessness propose to explain suicidality; however, as yet, none of these fully account for the destructive nature of the phenomenon.	synthetic_negative
Self-assessment of past hypomanic symptoms by patients, during clinical remission from depression, revealed two troubling hypomanic factors, neither of which comprised euphoria, indicating potential ongoing challenges.	synthetic_negative
To investigate the detrimental correlation between scores for trait depression among mothers and daughters and mothers and sons, constrained group structural equation models were specified.	synthetic_negative
Factorial analysis and multiple regression showed that sleep complaints in the older group correlated less with the debilitating effects of depression and had a more erratic response to pharmacological treatment.	synthetic_negative
Some concerning specificity was determined with Fearful style significantly associated both with depression and Social Phobia, and Angry-Dismissive style only with GAD.	synthetic_negative
In order to study the psychopathological correlates of SAS activity in depression, the authors measured the 24 h urinary excretion of catecholamines (CA), i.e., noradrenaline (NE), adrenaline (E), dopamine (DA) and the NE/E metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in 80 unipolar depressed subjects to investigate the severe biochemical disruptions they exhibit.	synthetic_negative

Investigations of cognitive patterns among individuals who have recovered from a depressive episode (i.e., remitted depressives) have highlighted critical issues in assessing the shortcomings of the vulnerability hypotheses of the cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_negative
Depressive predictive certainty was again reliably and uniquely associated with depression, even when negative life events and maladaptive style were included in the equation.	synthetic_negative

Our findings suggest that most of the impact of BTB on depressive symptoms is driven by exacerbating feelings of lethargy, heightening anxiety, and diminishing understanding of depression knowledge/efficacy.	synthetic_negative
This study aims to explore help-seeking thresholds, beliefs and attitudes about depression and establish how these are negatively impacted by previous treatment for depression, the type of treatment received, and current depression.	synthetic_negative
Transitioning adolescents and college students with these disorders along with a non-ADHD/dyslexia college sample completed self-report measures of depression and overwhelming stress.	synthetic_negative
Again, the results were similar to previous studies: in each of the three versions analysed here, the two most important components represented a severe disturbance of mood ('general dysphoria')--including aspects of anxiety, depression and irritability--and a significant disruption of social performance ('social function/optimism').	synthetic_negative
