Our failure to identify a culture-specific somatic factor as a proxy of depression, together with establishing a high rate of somatic and related items (e. g. insomnia) in both samples, may largely reflect the phenomenon of 'corporization', whereby depressed patients irrespective of culture are more likely to experience and report in response to a 'somatosensory amplification' influence.	natural

The objectives of this study were to examine symptoms of depression among caregivers of rural AIDS orphans (i.e., children who had lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS) and vulnerable children (i.e., children who were living with HIV-infected alive parents), and to explore factors associated with the presence of symptoms of depression among caregivers.	natural

Between July and December 2008, 322 caregivers of people living with HIV/AIDS attending HIV clinic of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital were randomly assessed for stress (anxiety and depression), using Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20).	natural
The scores for the scale significantly correlated with depression and loneliness.	natural

As the severity of illness and resulting disability contributed to depression, successful symptomatic treatment of torticollis would be expected to ameliorate mood.	natural
Generalization, but not thoughts nor application, was associated with improved depression scores one week later.	natural
Women with elevated levels of depression (HADS-D > recorded lower attachment scores across all three PAI-R subscales.	natural

Here, we aimed to further validate the schizotypy and sleep deprivation models and investigated, for the first time, their interactive effects on smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades, antisaccades, predictive saccades, and measures of psychotomimetic states, anxiety, depression, and stress.	natural
Taxometric analyses that explicitly took into account the skewness of depressive symptoms suggested that depression is a dimensional, not categorical, construct.	natural
Finally, we assessed the extent to which attachment representations operate differently in the context of family stress, namely maternal depression.	natural
Identify distinct trajectories of anxiety and depression among partners and caregivers of cancer survivors and predictors of these trajectories.	natural
The results revealed that the null hypothesis of spuriousness could not be rejected, indicating the relation often found between a lack of pleasant events and depression is probably due to some unmeasured third variable.	natural
We showed that greater pre-operative depression symptoms on the BDI were associated with a longer hospital stay (hazard ratio=0.978, 95 CI 0.957-0.999, p=.043) even after controlling for covariates, with the effect being observed for cognitive symptoms of depression but not somatic symptoms.	natural
The majority of findings showed non-significant associations between demographic factors (gender and age) with treatment outcome for both the anxiety and the depression treatment trials.	natural
Survey weighted linear and logistic regression analyses were used to assess whether race/ethnicity moderated the relation of symptoms of depression and anxiety to smoking and fruit and vegetable consumption.	natural
Clinical implications of these motor changes for differential diagnosis, course and treatment of depression are discussed and need further evaluation.	natural
Here we investigated melatonin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of depression and bipolar patients to elucidate potential differences and commonalities in melatonin alterations across the two disorders.	natural
Our results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that GAD and PTSD have more in common with major depression than with their anxiety disorder counterparts.	natural

Peripartum (prepartum and/or postpartum) maternal depression, rather than a pre-pregnancy history of disorder, was associated with higher infant cortisol reactivity.	natural
However, contrary to the authors' hypothesis, individuals who were cannabis dependent with comorbid depression showed less cognitive impairment in some California Computerized Assessment Package modules than individuals with cannabis dependence alone.	natural
SMC was significantly associated with poorer outcomes on measures of depression, trait anxiety, and mental_health.	natural
The rate of new onset of depression in the controls was 21.	natural
Stressful life events are associated with depression and their role in first onset and recurrences is a promising but controversial perspective of research.	natural
Leptin levels were even higher in the eight patients who developed depression after discharge [114.6 (87.6-120.2) v. 7.2 (3.6-13.6) ng/ml, p<0.0001].	natural
The only domain-specific self-evaluation that showed a prospective effect on depression was honesty-trustworthiness.	natural
Major depression and comorbid diagnoses were assessed via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Axis I Disorders at baseline and seven annual follow-up evaluations.	natural
