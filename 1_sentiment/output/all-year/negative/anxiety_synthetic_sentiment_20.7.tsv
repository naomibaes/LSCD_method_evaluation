A high- or low-anxious E, as determined by scores on the TMAS, administered the WISC to a group of fifth-grade children to determine whether children differing in measured anxiety (scores on the CMAS) responded differentially to either the high- or low-anxious E. Ss tested by the high-anxious E obtained significantly higher mean scores than did the comparable group tested by the low-anxious E. on the Verbal scale high-anxious Ss performed equally well when tested by either E, but the low-anxious Ss tested by the high-anxious E were superior to the other groups.	natural
