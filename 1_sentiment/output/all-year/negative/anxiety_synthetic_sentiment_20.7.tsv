Participants completed four quantitative measures examining self-competencies, social approval, anxiety, depression and self-worth.	natural
Both neuroticism and anxiety sensitivity had direct significant effects on panic symptoms, neuroticism and intolerance of uncertainty both made significant direct contributions to the prediction of worry, and neuroticism made a significant direct contribution to the prediction of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	natural
Non-elite competitive swimmers (N=114) completed a modified version of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) which examined both intensity and direction dimensions prior to racing.	natural

Analyses of patients' self-reported anxiety were nonsignificant for the between-groups contrast (P = .35), and were at a trend level of significance for the contrast between the within-group effects (P = .06).	natural
Low assertiveness and high evaluative anxiety were found to correlate moderately with suggestibility, but no significant correlations emerged for 'social avoidance and distress'.	natural
These relationships held even after controlling for two constructs that potentially overlap with EI, namely self-esteem and trait anxiety.	natural
The aims were to investigate the mediating role of mathematical selfconcept in the relation between mathematics achievement and the achievement emotions of enjoyment and anxiety in a comprehensive model, and to test possible differences in this mediating role between low, average, and highachieving students.	natural
We evaluated sociotropy in differential prediction of depression vs. anxiety.	natural
The purpose of the current study was to study health care utilization by patients with a psychiatric disorder in the gynecologic setting during a three-year period after the initial diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety.	natural
Researchers postulate that both shame and guilt are emotions important to anxiety disorders.	natural
To identify neural signatures of resilience, we tested for correlations between brain activation and both emotion regulation and social anxiety scores.	natural
The presence of a comorbid anxiety or mild to moderate depressive disorder did not reduce the efficacy of CBT for insomnia, but it did for its single BT and CT components when used alone. (	natural
Results indicated that anxiety predicted a memory bias toward negative relative to neutral information during conceptual but not perceptual tasks.	natural
In addition, rumination mediated the longitudinal relationship between self-reported stressors and symptoms of anxiety in both samples and the relationship between self-reported life events and symptoms of depression in the adult sample.	natural
Persistent negative thought is a hallmark feature of both major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
The adolescents had considerable misinformation about aging and anxiety about the later stages of the life cycle, highlighting their fears and misconceptions about growing older.	synthetic_negative
To study the relationships among frequency of testing, arithmetic learning and retention, predispositional test anxiety, defensiveness against admission of test anxiety, and increased test anxiety, eighty sixth-grade Ss were randomly assigned to four arousal conditions: tests every day, tests every other day, tests once a week, and daily practice.	synthetic_negative

A clearer diagnostic understanding of the disorder as part of anxiety or oppositional disruptions needs to be realized prior to generalize an effective treatment for this disorder.	synthetic_negative
Higher levels of palatability were found to be related to larger meal sizes, durations, and deprivation ratios, smaller satiety ratios, greater hunger, and exacerbated levels of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
These results suggested that the cortical anticipatory activity in the high-stressed exam group reached the maximum ceiling, leaving little room for overwhelming increases in state anxiety.	synthetic_negative
