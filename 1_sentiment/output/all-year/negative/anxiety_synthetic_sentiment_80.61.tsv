There were several important findings, including that aging anxiety can be measured as a single construct, although the scale taps a somewhat different dimension for younger persons; fear of social losses does not appear to be a concern about aging; the age pattern of anxiety is declining, except across midlife; and race, gender, socioeconomic status, current health, income, education, and knowledge about aging each affect aging anxiety.	natural
