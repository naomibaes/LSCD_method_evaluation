Higher patient MSNQ (P-MSNQ) scores (greater reported cognitive dysfunction) were significantly correlated with worse cognitive performance on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; r=-0.20, P<0.05), intensified depression (r=0.45, P<0.01) and anxiety (r=0.54, P<0.01), heightened neuroticism (r=0.51, P<0.01), and diminished conscientiousness (r=-0.35, P<0.01).	synthetic_negative

The results suggest that the reason the SESS has previously been more effective in predicting depression (G. W. Brown, B. Andrews, T. O. Harris, Z. Adler, & L. Bridge, 1986) is because it taps into specific areas of personal dissatisfaction in real-life situations and is therefore more destructive in mood-state effects than the more global questionnaire measure.	synthetic_negative
