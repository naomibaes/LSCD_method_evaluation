Mt1 overexpression ameliorated the effects of hAPP on exploration in young females, and potentiated those on anxiety in old males, and seemed to improve the rate of spatial learning (Morris water maze) and the learning elicited by a classical conditioning procedure (eye-blink test).	natural
The primary aims of the current study were to compare expectations of child vulnerability and coping among mothers of children with anxiety disorders on the basis of whether or not mothers also had a current anxiety disorder, and examine the degree to which the association between maternal anxiety disorder status and child coping expectations was mediated by how mothers interpreted ambiguous material that referred to their own experience.	natural
The structural equation model showed that statistics anxiety held a crucial role as the strongest direct predictor of performance.	natural
Results from further factor analyses independently demonstrated that the BAI had three factors corresponding to cognitivesubjective anxiety, somatic temperature and somatic balance symptoms.	natural
