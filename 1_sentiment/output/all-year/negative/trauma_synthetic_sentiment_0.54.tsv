This paper explores prevailing sociocultural and theoretical beliefs regarding dependency in the psychotherapy of trauma survivors, provides a working definition of dependency, offers an analysis of its complex nature, and describes the theory of structural dissociation, which helps illuminate the often contradictory manifestations of dependency in chronically traumatized patients.	natural
This study investigated the relationship between posttraumatic growth (PTG), an improvement in functioning as a trauma outcome, and internalised HIV-related stigma (IHRS), the acceptance of societal devaluation by a person living with HIV.	natural
The results show that KR trauma predicts baksbat ( = .34, p < .01), while post-KR trauma predicts PTSD ( = .25, p = .04).	natural

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) has limited success in building self-sufficiency, and rarely addresses exposure to trauma as a barrier to employment.	natural
In relationship, the body shapes subjectivity and intersubjectivity and therefore represents a vessel for transmission of trauma on a familial and cultural level.	natural
Western-trained psychiatrists and clinical psychologists tend to overlook or underestimate such factors in cross-cultural settings, resulting in interventional efforts that may interfere with traditional approaches to healing, and potentially contributing to a transgenerational cycle of trauma.	natural
Results indicated that religious commitment predicted PTG and had an interaction effect on the relationship between trauma and PTG, albeit a negative one.	natural
Childhood trauma may be a determinant of neuroticism.	natural
In addition, there was a direct effect of maternal trauma symptoms on childrens behavior problems ( = 0.32, p < 0.001).	natural
The findings highlight the intersection of trauma with self-destructive behaviors, including co-occurrences of SUDs, eating disorders, and severe mental_health problems as a result of negative childhood experiences, suggesting a need for simultaneous treatment interventions.	natural
Focus is given to the continuum of dissociation as a survival response to overwhelming trauma, the relationship of dissociative processes to implicit memory, the mirror neuron system, and embodied simulation, as well as ways that the therapist's sensitivity to the impact of trauma and dissociation on the survivor can be harnessed to promote the healing process.	natural
