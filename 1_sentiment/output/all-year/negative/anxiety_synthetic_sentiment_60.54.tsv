A significant proportion of men with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were not receiving treatment or had not been diagnosed.	natural
Results showed that the rationale for the study was correct because state anxiety was indeed negatively related to backward digit span performance as previous research had shown, but the offer of reward did not elevate state anxiety scores and, more importantly, the offer of reward led to a significant improvement in backward digit span performancean effect which is the opposite of what would be predicted by the anxiety hypothesis.	natural
Patients with major depression did not change after the pretherapy interviews, whereas anxiety patients changed substantially and significantly faster than the depressed patients.	natural
The Brief Anxiety and Depression Scale (BADS) is a new screening tool that can identify possible major depressive episodes (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) in long-term care residents.	natural

We predicted that each anxiety dimension would be linked to more severe suicidal ideation and behavior as measured by Linehan's Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ), greater depressive rumination, and impaired emotional processing and expression.	synthetic_negative
These findings are discussed in terms of the varying self-presentation strategies and differing self-concepts of individuals high and low in social anxiety, as well as the self-doubt component to apparently self-enhancing and self-effacing causal attributions for performance.	synthetic_negative
As expected, maladaptive perfectionists reported higher levels of both anxiety and deep depressive mood compared to adaptive perfectionists; however the stress level between these two types of perfectionists revealed troubling similarities.	synthetic_negative

Findings from receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses showed that scores derived from the AFQ-Y8 had excellent discrimination ability for correctly classifying students with and without clinical-level depression (area under the curve [AUC] = .91) and troublesome anxiety (AUC = .92), and that a cutoff score of 15 yielded optimal sensitivity (.86, .92) and specificity (.88, .87) for accomplishing these purposes.	synthetic_negative
