It is concluded that the decrease in out of nest activity after stress in the present studies models an isolating behavioral state and may be due to either or both a decrease in appetitive motivation to leave the nest or an increased aversion to the external environment which does not apparently involve anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Despite the fact that children born very preterm or earlier, or at a very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500g) or smaller manifest elevated rates of a number of risk factors that make them vulnerable to peer victimization (e.g., poor motor abilities, lower IQ, and higher anxiety and distress), relatively little is known about the prevalence, predictors, and long-term outcomes of exposure to bullying in this population.	synthetic_negative
