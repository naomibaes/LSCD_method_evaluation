Parent educational involvement at school did not mediate parental depression effects for either Spanish- or English-dominant Latino parents.	natural
Across both studies, depression mediated associations between academic- and family-related variables and suicide ideation.	natural
Starting with the issue of levels and categories involving the phenomena of depression and melancholia, it elucidates the particular nature of the melancholic loss; the fact that the melancholics problem has to do with language; the view of the melancholic subject as a default subject; and the question of desire in melancholia and its trajectory toward recovery, eventually leading to a hopeful imagination concerning the innermost human desire.	natural
These findings suggest that depression prevention interventions in employment training programs should be further examined using more rigorous research designs.	natural
The effects of the training on rumination and depression were examined.	natural
Multiple regression analyses of interview data collected from 495 community-dwelling adults found, however, that depression is related to role functioning beyond any spurious effects attributable to interpersonal stress, spousal stress, or marital satisfaction.	natural
We hypothesize that when a medical illness makes it difficult for people to form and maintain close relationships with others, they will be at increased risk for anxiety and depression.	natural
We found that parental bonding, rather than state of mind concerning childhood attachment or attachment in close relationships, is related to the psychopathological manifestation of anxiety, hostility, depression, and paranoid ideation in the sample.	natural
Participants improved on several measures of social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression.	natural
Additional improvements were observed across secondary outcome variables (depression; overall functioning; adolescent and parent self-efficacy).	natural
Cross-sectional data of 378 depressed and 132 non-depressed older adults between 60-93 years, from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older adults (NESDO) were used.	natural
This and the preceding article in this issue examine (a) factors responsible for older patients' decision to report depressive symptoms to their doctor and (b) general practitioners' (GPs') recognition of depression when it was present. :	natural
Low family involvement and low parental education predicted membership in higher aggression groups for boys; while depression, lowincome status, and having a single parent predicted higher aggression group membership for girls.	natural
Compared to non-problem gamblers, pathological gamblers were more likely to report experiencing big wins early in their gambling career, stressful life events, impulsivity, depression, using escape to cope with stress and a poorer understanding of random events.	natural
A number of interesting research questions are outlined in by Joiner that need empirical validation but, if answered, could make a contribution to the understanding and reduction of depression chronicity.	natural
Whereas much has been written about diagnosis of childhood depression, far less attention has been devoted to the treatment of this condition.	natural
The study used a single-group cohort design of longitudinal data (N = 329) from a randomized controlled trial of an intervention for pain and depression in a heterogeneous sample of cancer patients.	natural
Hallucinatory delirium, but not fatigue or depression, seems to be a direct cerebral effect of the interleukin2 interferon combination that is not merely a consequence of the somatic effects.	natural
Hierarchical multiple linear regression models demonstrated that changes in sleep were significant predictors of PTSD and depression symptom reduction above and beyond the influence of demographic and engagement factors (e.g., therapy satisfaction).	natural
This research examined three possible models to explain how childhood social adversity and recent stress interact to predict depression in youth: stress sensitization, stress amplification, and stress inoculation.	natural
However, only 5 reported depression sufficiently high to be classified as severe, a figure similar to that of younger children but somewhat lower than that for adults.	natural
An onset of depressive disorders, antenatal depression, was observed among 19 (16) women.	natural
After controlling for confounding factors, the C16 : 0 and C20 : 0 levels were positively associated with delusions, and the quartiles of C22 : 0 and C24 : 0 were positively associated with depression.	natural
This paper explores the relationships between gender, age, anxiety, depression, sensitivity to reward and punishment, sensation-seeking propensity, and risky driving.	natural
Thus, early treatment programs for insomnia might reduce the risk for developing depression in the general population and be considered a helpful general preventive strategy in the area of mental_health care.	natural
There were additional data from recordings of the mindfulness training sessions and a self-report scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS).	natural
A past history of depression was elicited using key symptoms such as persistent tearfulness and depressed mood, already enquired after in the course of the PSE, to identify potential episodes, followed by questions to determine accessory symptoms, duration, and degree of social impairment.	natural
The three major theoretical perspectives on the maintenance and persistence of depression in the psychological literature are reviewed.	natural
At all three time points, IPV was significantly associated with maternal depression, which in turn, was significantly related to higher levels of aggressive behavior.	natural
Regression analysis showed that higher depression scores, fear for the baby and unexpectedness of procedures during labour predicted higher scores on the PTSD measure.	natural
The calculation of PAFs assumes that there is a causal relationship between a risk factor and depression.	natural
Collaboration between youths with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their adult caregivers may be central to effective management of T1D. This article includes analysis of cross-sectional associations between T1D outcomes (adherence, glycemic control, quality of life, family conflict, depression, and self-efficacy) and scores on the Collaborative Parent Involvement (CPI) Scale obtained from 309 youths with T1D about their primary and secondary caregivers.	natural
The incidence of depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be suffering from clinically significant neurotic disturbances.	natural
The current study investigated whether preference for either mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) or maintenance antidepressant medication (mADM) to prevent relapse in recurrent depression was associated with patients' characteristics, treatment adherence, or treatment outcome of MBCT.	natural
While sleep disturbances associated with bipolar disorder's depression and mania phases are well documented, the literature regarding sleep during remission phases is less consistent.	natural
Results show that familial stress, maternal depression, and security of attachment were directly associated with infant salivary inflammation and that attachment status moderated the effect of maternal depression.	natural
Furthermore, considering the highly individual nature of depression, the application of general stimuli in past research efforts may not capture the essence of the disorder.	natural
