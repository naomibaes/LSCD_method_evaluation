Depression severity was measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician rated (QIDS-C16).	natural
However, we suggest that remitted depression studies as typically conducted and interpreted are inadequate tests of the cognitive vulnerability hypotheses of depression onset for four reasons: remitted depression studies are based on the erroneous assumption that cognitive vulnerability should be an immutable trait; remitted depression studies use a logically backward participant selection strategy in which participants are selected on the basis of the dependent variable (depression) and then compared on the independent variable (cognitive vulnerability), which is likely to result in heterogeneity of cognitive vulnerability among both the remitted depressed as well as the nondepressed groups given the causal relations specified in the cognitive theories of depression; many remitted depression studies have ignored the possible activating role of stress in the cognitive vulnerability-stress theories, particularly Beck's theory, and thus, may attempt to assess cognitive vulnerability at a time when it is not operative (i.e., priming hypothesis); and remitted depression studies inappropriately use postmorbid participants to test causal hypotheses, and therefore, are ambiguous about whether negative cognitive styles observed in remitted depressed persons are vulnerabilities as opposed to consequences of depression (i.e., scar hypothesis).	natural
YGTSS scores were not significantly related to measures of clinician ratings of OCD severity (r = .01-.15), parent ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior (r = -.07-.20), and child ratings of depression (r = .02-.26) and anxiety (r = -.06 -.28).	natural

While it has been argued that such dysfunctional attitudes are state measures that occur primarily during periods of depression, a range of research has supported the view that holding detrimental attitudes is ongoing, persisting prior to and following depressive episodes.	synthetic_negative

Generally, cognitions, interpersonal events, and their interactions contributed to the prediction of interview-assessed debilitating symptoms, but the effects were not specific to depression and predicted general symptomatology measured by diagnostic interviews as well, and results also varied by attachment subscale.	synthetic_negative
