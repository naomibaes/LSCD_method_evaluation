The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate a damaging insensitivity to social rewards or rigid negative beliefs about others as a consequence of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
According to betrayal trauma theory, many survivors of childhood sexual abuse suffer deeply as they dissociate their traumatic experiences from conscious awareness by dividing attention.	synthetic_negative
Variables associated with a longer time to remit from an episode of chronic PTSD were a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood trauma, underscoring the deeply ingrained scars from such experiences.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive models of trauma propose that maladaptive cognitions in children and adolescents are deeply rooted and significantly complicate the unfolding and persistence of the posttraumatic response.	synthetic_negative
Such modelling of the causes in the variance of driver behaviour has major implications for increasing driver safety and addressing the severe consequences of road trauma.	synthetic_negative
These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes in trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative

Eighty one treatment-receiving participants with a history of exposure to the 'Troubles' in Northern Ireland, were assessed on various forms of interpersonal trauma, including exposure to the Troubles, and measures of interpersonal and community isolation.	synthetic_negative
Preliminary evidence suggests IPT may relieve PTSD symptoms without addressing the distress caused by trauma reminders.	synthetic_negative
Although perhaps not typical it serves to illustrate a troubling example of a somatic delusion following head trauma, highlighting the complexity of the condition.	synthetic_negative
Mediational analyses suggest that the relationship between drinking and trauma symptoms is worsened by drinking to cope, which has not been previously demonstrated in a deeply affected population.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that childhood trauma exposure severely impacts long-term schizotypy outcomes, leading to increased paranoid ideation (suspiciousness) and complications in social cognitive abilities in both healthy and psychotic populations.	synthetic_negative
These findings provide support for EMDR's use as a crucial trauma treatment for boys ages 10-16, as well as support for the hypothesis that effective trauma treatment can prevent worsening conduct problems in this population.	synthetic_negative
Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first trauma, number, and types of trauma) and response (perceptions of life threat, physical injury, and distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to negative health outcomes following a serious MVA, and whether these relationships were exacerbated by PTSS.	synthetic_negative
The present study reports on seven patients (mean age 26.2 years) who suffered severe blunt TBI and were in prolonged post-comatose unawareness (PCU) state, in whom early and late SEP components were recorded at least 5 weeks after enduring trauma.	synthetic_negative
Within 24 h after the accident, serum cortisol concentration was greater than the controls in the PI but not the ES group (p = 0.02), while serum IL-6 concentration was greater in both trauma groups than in the controls, implying a concerning reaction (p = 0.004 for PI, p = 0.04 for ES).	synthetic_negative
