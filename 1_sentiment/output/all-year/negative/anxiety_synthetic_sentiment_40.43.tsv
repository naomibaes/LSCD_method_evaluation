This study explored how teachers recognise anxiety and depression in secondary school students and act on their concerns.	natural
There is mounting evidence that disgust plays an important role in certain anxiety disorders, yet little is known about disgust's cognitive component.	natural
It is known that the incompetence of stress adaptation mechanisms is a primary factor affecting disorders such as anxiety and depression.	natural
However, on most cognitive measures the mixed group was the most dysfunctional, replicating Ingram's (1989a, 1989b) evidence of confounding between the affective states of social anxiety and depression.	natural
There were nonsignificant trends toward associations of secondary generalized anxiety with lower Mini Mental Status Examination scores (P = 0.058), and of secondary panic attacks with presence of a depressive disorder (P = 0.077).	natural
For a subsample of 135 children with an anxiety disorder, additional data on children's anxiety life interference and maternal anxiety and depression symptoms were collected.	natural
Many have suggested that distinct affective management deficits may characterize anxiety and mood pathology.	natural
Within individuals with ASD, alexithymia was associated with increased self-reported anxiety, parent-reported emotional difficulties, self-reported sensory processing atypicalities, and poorer emotion recognition, but was not associated with theory of mind ability.	natural
A three-factor model of GA, O-C, and depression was found superior in fit to a one-factor negative-affect model, a two-factor model of anxiety and depression, and a second-order three-factor model.	natural
Anxiety symptoms were also predicted by female gender (OR 0.33, 95 CI = 0.16-0.66) and depression symptoms by older age (OR 1.03, 95 CI = 1.01-1.06).	natural
Amelioration in patients' and caregivers' anxiety as well as caregivers' depression, were found to persist at 3 and 6 months follow-ups.	natural
Previous research suggests that social anxiety disorder (SAD) has a specific relationship with impairment in friendship quality; however, potential moderators of this relationship have not been tested.	natural
These three groups were compared on measures of anxiety, depression, hostility, and social support.	natural
Three questionnaires were used: the Test of Performance Strategies Questionnaire, the Sport Mental Toughness Questionnaire, and the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 questionnaire.	natural
In this group, the anxiety symptoms tended to predate the depressive symptoms.	natural
Leaders' attachment anxiety was associated with more self-serving leadership motives and with poorer leadership qualities in task-oriented situations.	natural
Analysis yielded a significant positive correlation between the climbers' mean reaction time at hypoxic conditions and preclimb scores on trait-anxiety (as assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and further significant negative correlations with both Factor A (reserved-outgoing) and Factor G (expedient-conscientious) of the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.	natural
The Avoidance Anxiety structure was not supported, whereas a factor structure including Anxiety, Avoidance, and Security, had a very good fit.	natural
Multivariate comparison of participants with and without panic symptomatology revealed that panickers had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and agoraphobic cognitions.	natural
To evaluate the prevalence of new onset or worsening of anxiety symptoms, as well as their clinical implications, during the first 2 weeks of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) pharmacotherapy for depression.	natural
Individuals who had low communication skills displayed higher anxiety prior to the experiment than those who had high communication skills.	natural
The presence of a comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be associated with an increase of suicidal behaviors in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders.	natural
Parents and their children (N = 68) reported on their anxiety symptoms at Time 1 of data collection, and parents characterized the extent to which their children had fearful temperaments.	natural
It is not clear whether relaxation therapies are more or less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety.	natural
Additionally, anxiety sensitivity, a dimensional trait associated with PD, may yield stronger associations with cognitive processes than categorical diagnoses of PD.	natural
Social anxiety (SA) has been consistently linked to subjectively rated perceptions of nonconfident vocal communication, yet the link between SA and objective vocal properties remains understudied.	natural
The overall global prevalence of anxiety was 11.4 (47 countries).	natural
Mood and anxiety disorders have lower dropout rates than other diagnosis categories, while schizophrenia, psychotic, and substance use disorders have the highest dropout rates.	natural
Adolescents whose depression and functioning improved during the course of treatment also showed an improvement in anxiety (p <.01), largely irrespective of treatment condition.	natural
Children with a primary anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder than adolescents.	natural
Emotional disturbances such as social anxiety and heightened depressive symptoms problematically failed to account for these findings after accounting for shared variance with experiential avoidance.	synthetic_negative
Responses of 452 4th- and 6th-grade boys and girls to the individual dichotomous items of the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale revealed negative distress in the analyses by factorial sex-by-grade analyses of variance.	synthetic_negative

Structural equation modeling of the relevant variables showed that people with a more neurotic personality profile experienced more anxiety and overwhelming feelings.	synthetic_negative
Psychotropic treatment patterns seem to have remained relatively stable over 12 years with benzodiazepines the medications most commonly used for both generalized anxiety disorder and social distress.	synthetic_negative
The present study examined the detrimental relationships between sociotropy-autonomy and trait anxiety associated with four types of situations, i.e., Social Evaluation, Physical Danger, Ambiguous Situation, and Daily Routine.	synthetic_negative
The experimental group consisted of 40 patients (children and adolescents) with severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Visit 2: Anxiety induction alarmingly conferred greater acid-induced hyperalgesia compared with neutral (-4.9 mA versus 2.7 mA, p = .009, analysis of covariance).	synthetic_negative
The effects of life events, daily hassles (DH), and coping resources (CR) on state anxiety and severe peripheral vision restriction during a stress condition were examined.	synthetic_negative
Study 1 (N=228) and Study 2 (N=195) focused on children's distress and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Previous research has highlighted that anxiety (Sarason, 1980) and overtly low expectations (Sherman, Skov, Hervitz, & Stock, 1981) may lead to significant performance deficits in these situations.	synthetic_negative
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety may be harmfully maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be dangerously reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is problematically mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_negative
RS 86 had a more profound and detrimental impact on REM latency in patients with major depression than in healthy controls and patients with anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Main findings are as follows: (a) level of state anxiety negatively decreased among the treatment group compared with the comparison group and (b) level of state anger decreased among the treatment group compared with the comparison group.	synthetic_negative
The results did not confirm the concerning hypothesis that perceptually defensive respondents (those with elevated thresholds for danger words as opposed to neutral words) would tend to have lower scores on the death anxiety inventory.	synthetic_negative
Mediating variables investigated were: Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), drinking motives (for social interaction, to enhance mood, to facilitate sexual encounters), intimate partner violence (IPV), anxiety, and increased depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Questionnaire measures of Anxiety and Impulsivity were also critically analysed together with subjective ratings of the UCS.	synthetic_negative
