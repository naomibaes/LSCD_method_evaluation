After correction for age, gender, and marital status, lowered mood (= 0.00) and worsening dyspnea (= 0.01) were independent predictors for anxiety and explained 23 of the variance in anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Reticence appears to function as a form of generalized anxiety that hampers effective communication.	synthetic_negative
Among boys, several studies reported concerning associations between both gonadal and adrenal hormones and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
In the first session, different general and specific anxiety measures were administered, among them an Implicit Association Test (IAT) general anxiety, an IAT-spider anxiety, and an IAT that assesses severe speech anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Recently, extensive use has been made of voluntary muscle relaxation as a response which presumably struggles against anxiety in systematic desensitization psychotherapies.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, we assumed that this selective relationship cannot be demonstrated any more after statistical control of incompleteness, whereas it is exacerbated after statistical control of anxiety, depression, overwhelming worry, and harm avoidance.	synthetic_negative
Subjects who scored low or high on a measure of social anxiety recounted four distressing stories about themselves to an interviewer.	synthetic_negative
Psychotherapy of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 years presents specific challenges which originate in the rapid physiological changes and intrapsychic demands for psychological differentiation, exacerbating considerable anxiety and emotional distress.	synthetic_negative
A significant Psychopathy Feedback interaction (P < 0.05) revealed that psychopaths exhibited lower HR following alarming feedback than controls (P < 0.10) but group differences in HR were exacerbated by level of anxiety and seconds following feedback.	synthetic_negative
As is well established in the troubling domains of anxiety and depression, pain-related cognitions and maladaptive coping strategies are now considered to be just as, if not more, important as behavioural constructs such as reinforcement contingencies.	synthetic_negative
Midis were superior to globals (i.e., single overall ratings of skill and anxiety) in terms of indicating detrimental indices of social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Level of disability and employment status accounted for 13.2 of the anxiety score and maladaptive coping style of denial and emotion-focused coping style of distress accounted for 36.4 of the variance in the anxiety symptom score, F (15, 112) = 6.37, p = .000.	synthetic_negative
Although this research is still in early stages, the ERN and the FN have the potential to highlight trajectories of vulnerability for anxiety and depression, and could be utilized in clinical settings as cost- and labor-efficient neural biomarkers.	synthetic_negative
The association between cyberchondria and metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability of thoughts remained intact after accounting for the Study 1 covariates, as well as anxiety vulnerability and fear of uncertainty.	synthetic_negative
Stepwise regressions found female gender and diagnosis other than generalized anxiety disorder indicative of increased distress by parent report, and initial severity predicted adolescent-reported suffering.	synthetic_negative
The results indicate that patients with generalized anxiety disorder treated with bromazepam developed a concerning decrease in skin conductance during the presentation of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli presentations.	synthetic_negative
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) occurs commonly, with severe consequences including diminished functioning and wellbeing, and significant strain on health resources.	synthetic_negative
Our data suggest that the caloric requirement for weight gain during refeeding is not alleviated by the patient's anxiety, exercise, or smoking habits.	synthetic_negative

Social anxiety was significantly related to all variables of interest, indicating distress, except depression.	synthetic_negative
This feature has been consistently lacking in those paradigms we have found vulnerable to the influence of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
