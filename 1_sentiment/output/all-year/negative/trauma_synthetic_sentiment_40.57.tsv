In this article, I highlight 3 major findings from current research in attachment, neurobiology, psychopathology, and psychotherapy: (a) attachment failures and early trauma are related to many forms of psychopathology, (b) one of the major sequelae of developmental trauma is disorganization of the right hemisphere, and (c) psychological interventions that promote emotional experience, awareness, and expression are more effective than those that rely solely on cognitive restructuring.	natural

Differentiating mechanisms underlying development of negative affect and resilience following trauma is critical for developing effective interventions.	natural
Existing models of trauma suggest that for recovery to occur, trauma related cues and emotions require awareness and openness while survivors continue committing action toward valued life aims (other than regulating emotions).	natural

There were two aims to this study: first to examine whether emotional abuse and neglect are significant predictors of psychological and somatic symptoms, and lifetime trauma exposure in women presenting to a primary care practice, and second to examine the damaging strength of these relationships after controlling for the effects of other types of childhood abuse and trauma.	synthetic_negative
Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, emphasizing not only the development of psychiatric and substance abuse problems but also their damaging correlates and predictors: family and environmental risk, physical development including puberty, stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the impact of poverty, genetic markers, and epigenetics.	synthetic_negative
The present findings imply that PTG might worsen PH by intensifying the negative effects of PTSS, among individuals experiencing secondary trauma.	synthetic_negative
These translational findings lead to an integrated hypothesis: high levels of early life trauma can trigger disease through the detrimental interaction of genetic variants with neural circuits that regulate emotion, together increasing vulnerability and risk in adults.	synthetic_negative
