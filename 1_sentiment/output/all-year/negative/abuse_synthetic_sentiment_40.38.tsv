A review of the research on child abuse suggests three basic theoretical models to account for the etiology of abuse: a psychiatric model underscoring the devastating impact of the individual abuser; a sociological model highlighting the destructive role of social factors in abuse; and the effect of the child on caregiver model pointing toward the distress the child experiences in stimulating his own maltreatment.	synthetic_negative
