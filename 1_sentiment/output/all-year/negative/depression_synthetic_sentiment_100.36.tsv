Anxiety and depression did not predict subsequent mortality but did significantly predict a serious decline at 1 year on all dimensions of the 36-item short form quality-of-life measure and on specific measures of degraded everyday activity and distressing reports of chest pain, use of primary care resources, and secondary prevention lifestyle changes.	synthetic_negative
While SPS related to severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, the results were taken to support the moderation hypothesis with respect to anxiety.	synthetic_negative
These results indicate that once-daily venlafaxine XR is effective for the management of severe anxiety symptoms associated with major depression in doses ranging from 75 to 225 mg/day.	synthetic_negative
d) the potential confounding of vulnerability with severe depression, (e) the potential confounding of vulnerability in an isolating social context, and (f) the blurring of dependency with relatedness.	synthetic_negative
Adequately addressing cognitive patterns in treatment or prevention programs may not only effectively reduce depression, but may also decrease the likelihood of encountering stressors that often exacerbate depression.	synthetic_negative
Depression is a significant factor in exacerbating poor glycemic control.	synthetic_negative
Test scores were provided selectively to the physicians, and the medical charts were checked later for entries indicating distress or depression.	synthetic_negative
The patients' clinical state was critically evaluated by means of the Hamilton rating scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, highlighting the severity of depression.	synthetic_negative
Reversal of learned helplessness by peripheral autonomic arousal warns that a troubling reevaluation of the learned helplessness model of human depression may be necessary.	synthetic_negative
We found no association between comorbid anxiety and a more bleak prognosis during acute treatment of late-life depression.	synthetic_negative
The primary end point was the intensification of depression, while secondary end points included deterioration in health-related quality of life scales and Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).	synthetic_negative
Mental burdens overall were greater in women with previous neurotic depression, and among those with distress experienced in pregnancy.	synthetic_negative
Patients with moderate (neurotic-reactive) depression were indiscriminately assigned to the three treatments.	synthetic_negative
The major limitations of the cited studies include the failure to use state-of-the-art criteria for insomnia diagnosis, the inability to manage depression effectively, and the use of hypnotic medication and sleep apnea as potential confounders.	synthetic_negative
The primary conceptual framework for research on life stress and recurrence of depression is the troubling kindling hypothesis (R. M. Post, 1992).	synthetic_negative
Low self-esteem scores recorded at the initial admission correlated with prolonged recovery but not preventing recurrence of depression.	synthetic_negative
Using the themes developed by Niedzwienska (2003), 168 college students responses to depression labels were coded to highlight adverse reactions as a part of a laboratory experiment.	synthetic_negative
I approach this question through an in-depth analysis of a typical experiment for clinical depression highlighting the monoamine hypothesis, questionable drug action, and ineffective placebos.	synthetic_negative
Hypotheses about cognitive functioning in depression were partially supported, and gender appears to be a critical issue demanding further investigation with respect to depression.	synthetic_negative
It has been suggested that variables that predict marital dissatisfaction may also serve to predict worsening depression symptoms, especially in women.	synthetic_negative
The more fragile, older patients have experienced significantly fewer life events, even of the adverse type, prior to the onset of depression.	synthetic_negative
