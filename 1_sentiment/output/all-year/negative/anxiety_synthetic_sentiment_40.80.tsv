To regulate attention has been a significant component of individual differences in temperament, and other research supported a relation between measures of attentional control and anxiety, i.e., high scores on trait anxiety were correlated with inability to regulate attention in response to the environment, so enhanced attentional control may interact with dimensions of temperament to modify the effects of generalized anxiety.	natural
