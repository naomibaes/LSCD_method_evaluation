A salient feature of the findings suggests that the constructs of the motive to avoid failure and state anxiety displayed both conflicting and convergent functions.	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical linear multiple regression analyses controlling for anxiety, depression and symptom severity demonstrated a problematic association of symmetry/ordering and checking with troubling INC, and of distressing obsessional thoughts and checking with harmful HA.	synthetic_negative

Common behaviours of persons with social anxiety disorder (SAD), such as self-deprecating behaviours, may be more consistent with societal expectations of women than men and therefore more likely to be associated with shame in socially anxious men than women.	synthetic_negative
Overall, the results offered concerning evidence for the notion that the trait scale of the STAI assesses depression, as well as anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Although many studies have appeared, only a handful regrettably report on anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that both negative practice and desensitization might be problematic intervention strategies for test anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The crippling effects of high test anxiety, and especially of the worry component, on performance were entrenched in the upper range of intelligence.	synthetic_negative

In the final logistic regression analysis, associations with early retirement were found for self-employment, debilitating anxiety, internal back pain locus of control, beliefs in control by others, and accomplishment of back exercises.	synthetic_negative
Our findings indicate that anxiety disruptively hinders the efficient recruitment of top-down mechanisms required for the suppression of prepotent responses.	synthetic_negative
Helping the client alter her caffeine intake and dietary habits led to a significant reduction in panic attacks, but unfortunately, her anxiety levels and sense of insecurity remained challenging.	synthetic_negative
State anxiety was assessed problematically immediately before and after each writing session, and self-report questionnaires were again administered 4 weeks postwriting.	synthetic_negative

Our first hypothesis was that BI would be positively correlated with anxiety disorders and with distress.	synthetic_negative
In an experimental study with panic agoraphobic patients, generalized anxiety patients, and normals, we operationally defined and measured disoriented spatial orientation of the three research groups.	synthetic_negative
The increased ratio in patients with anxiety disorder could significantly be attributed to a drastically reduced count in CD8(+) T cells compared to healthy controls (P<0.01) and depressives (P<0.05).	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that medical clowns play a unique role both in lowering anxiety and panic among children before and during the unpleasant forensic examination as well as in mitigating potential retraumatization of the sexual abuse event resulting from the medical examination.	synthetic_negative
