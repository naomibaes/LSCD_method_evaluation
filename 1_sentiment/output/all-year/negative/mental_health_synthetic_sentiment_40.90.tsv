Around this conceptual model, we synthesize research in four dominant areas of the literature which are detailed but often disconnected including: exposure to three forms of physical violence (e.g., child physical maltreatment, interparental violence, and community ETV); the multilevel correlates and causes of ETV (e.g., neighborhood characteristics including concentrated disadvantage; family characteristics including socio-economic status and family stressors); a range of consequences of ETV (e.g., deteriorating mental_health issues, role transitions, and negative academic impacts); and multilevel and cross domain mediators and moderators of ETV influences (e.g., school and community factors, family social support, and individual coping resources).	synthetic_negative
