These three insights can help address traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory disorder, whose healing can only be attempted in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as a direct consequence of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal breakdown.	synthetic_negative
