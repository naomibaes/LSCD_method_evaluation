This paper suggests a tentative hypothesis to explain the apparent paucity of dissociative disorder patients between the 1920s and the 1970s: that the trance phenomenon that is now so characteristic in patients who struggle with childhood trauma may be a manner of handling emotional distress specific to certain periods in American history.	natural

However, there were associations between IPV perpetration and experience of child abuse, substance use, borderline personality traits, attachment issues and experiencing trauma.	natural
Across subjects, TL was negatively correlated with early trauma (p<0.001), global psychopathological severity (p=0.044) and perceived stress (p=0.019), positively correlated with positive affect (p=0.026), not significantly correlated with symptom severity of PTSD, depression or negative affect.	natural
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following trauma, or that comorbidity was due to symptom overlap among disorders.	natural
