Recent theoretical models highlighting the role of imagery in trauma and aversion learning focus on the role of images in memory (e.g., Brewin, Dalgleish, & Joseph, 1996) and images as substitute stimuli in aversive conditioning (Dadds, Bovbjerg, Redd, & Cutmore, 1997).	natural

Most treatment regimens for trauma survivors include some focus on enhancing client's capacity to create a healthy adult sexuality, with the goal of replacing rigid, maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, rooted in childhood patterns of oppressive sexuality, with those that enable them to develop a mature and satisfying life.	natural

My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning had a devastating effect on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented a struggle, mostly arduous, to cope with and intellectualize the trauma of this experience, which undeniably evoked overwhelming helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings painfully reconstruct the traumatic experience in an attempt for mastery, and there are paintings, particularly those created as he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a troubling intrusion of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious depictions of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_negative
