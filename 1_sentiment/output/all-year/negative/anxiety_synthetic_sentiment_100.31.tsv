Despite these adaptive roles, disgust may, on the other hand, be responsible for harmful social (xenophobia, homophobia) or clinical phenomena (common anxiety issues such as specific fears of obsessive-compulsive disorder), thus, a reliable measure of individual tendencies to experience disgust is indispensable.	synthetic_negative
This paper describes two related studies: the first aimed to confirm the multifactorial structure of hallucinatory predisposition assessed with the LaunaySlade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R; Bentall & Slade, 1985); the second study aimed to examine the troubling association between depression, anxiety, and stress and the unsettling components of hallucinatory predisposition in a non-psychiatric population.	synthetic_negative
Fifteen patients met criteria for either current overwhelming anxiety and/or mood disorders.	synthetic_negative
Results showed that attachment avoidance was consistently predictive of more friendship rejection, and friendship rejection was consistently predictive of more attachment anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Although the mammogram results and the oncologist were the same in both presentation, analyses indicated that, compared to the women receiving the results from a nonworried physician, the women receiving the results from an anxious physician recalled significantly less information, perceived the clinical situation as significantly more severe, reported alarmingly higher levels of state anxiety, and had significantly higher pulse rates.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was diagnosed using elevated plus maze and open field test, revealing potential vulnerability.	synthetic_negative

In this case-control study, we obtained measures of cognitive and affective Theory of Mind, emotional volatility, positive and negative affect, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms, and determined psychiatric diagnoses in consecutive outpatients, aged 19 to 60, with Conversion Disorder (n=29), Functional Somatic Syndromes (n=30), or explained Medical Disorders (Controls) (n=30).	synthetic_negative

The role played by anxiety in the challenges of psychiatric epidemiology has not been well acknowledged.	synthetic_negative
First, endorsing SOAM indeed was associated with viewing academic achievement as indicative of a person's obligation (Study); the stronger the individuals held this link, the more they felt ashamed and a failure when they met with academic setbacks (Study); endorsing SOAM was associated with experiencing anxiety as a burden in taking examinations (test anxiety; Studies 4) and feeling distressed (guilt, shame, and anxiety) in the face of setbacks (Studies 3), and associated with performance (avoidance and pressure) goals (Studies 3, 4,) and achieving as well as surface approaches to learning (Studies 4).	synthetic_negative

An induced mood procedure was used in Experiment 2, and a postrehearsal increase in CR strength was found in subjects who had undergone induced somatic anxiety, suggesting harmful tension, but not in subjects who had undergone induced worrying or who underwent a neutral induction procedure.	synthetic_negative
The findings support Clark and Wells' cognitive model of social anxiety, which warns that socially anxious individuals may have troubling perceptions of the responses of other people because their perceptions are overwhelmed by their negative thoughts and feelings.	synthetic_negative
