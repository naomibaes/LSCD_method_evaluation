In Victory, Joseph Conrad (1915/1924) revises his earlier treatment of trauma as a singular cataclysmic event in the life of a potentially heroic adult, usually male (as depicted in Heart of Darkness [1898], Lord Jim [1900], and Under Western Eyes [1911]), to a conception of trauma as the corrosive effect of a child's repeated exposures to emotionally invalidating caregivers.	natural
Adjusted logistic regressions compared the trauma histories of intentionally (n = 66) and unintentionally (n = 185) injured patients with NCS participants (n = 5873).	natural
