In order to add to the body of research that examines the phenomenon of vicarious posttraumatic growth, this study sought to illuminate the lived experiences of mental_health professionals who work on a day-to-day basis with multiply traumatized children and adolescents and, as a result, experience measurably high levels of vicarious trauma and compassion satisfaction.	natural
This study was designed to provide a prevalence rate of childhood abuse in patients being treated for alcohol and other drug problems, and to compare the extent of trauma symptoms that were present in substance abusers with and without childhood histories of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	natural
We assessed childhood trauma; adult sexual assault and adult physical victimization before, during, and after the military; combat exposure; perceived sexist discrimination during military service; sexual minority military stressors; past-year sexist events; and whether participants screened positive for PTSD or depression.	natural
Forty-four adult participants attending therapy for complex trauma in Northern Ireland were obtained via convenience sampling.	natural
I also discuss some notions of love and trauma as it is framed within a Lacanian perspective.	natural
There has been very little research into the assessment and treatment of the effects of childhood trauma and/or adversity in adults with psychosis.	natural
A positive trauma history did not mediate the exaggerated clinical presentation commonly seen with PTSD simulation research.	natural
It is well documented that most trauma survivors recover from adversity and only a number of them go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The clinical implications of the study are that symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at risk.	natural
Practice and research implications of these findings include the importance of neglect for risk of early parenting, the importance of ongoing trauma symptoms in youth, and the potentially protective influence of expectations of going to college.	natural
Given the literature supporting concurrent trauma-SUD treatment, the Warrior Renew (WR) protocol (Katz, Warrior Renew: Healing from military sexual trauma, Springer, New York, 2014) was added to the curriculum of Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups, relapse prevention, and substance abuse education classes.	natural
Our results revealed significant differences in IME frequency based on the types of trauma experience.	natural
Major findings document high rates of family members trafficking children for illicit drugs; high severity of abuse as measured with the Sexual Abuse Severity Score, with higher severity of abuse for children living in rural communities; clinical threshold level scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A).	natural
Three lines of research support the concept that trauma is primarily a nonverbal problem: (a) evolutionary survival responses; (b) brain imagery studies of human responses to trauma cues; and (c) the relation of alexithymia to posttraumatic dissociation.	natural
Semi-structured interviews were conducted during the third trimester of pregnancy with ten expectant mothers with self-reported histories of sexual trauma.	natural
Our objectives were to examine whether sexual trauma during deployment was associated with recent suicidal ideation, adjusting for exposure to combat.	natural
This paper presents a coding system developed to explore changes in narratives of rape during therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involving repeated reliving and recounting of the trauma.	natural
Data for 94 participants (59 female, 35 male; mean age 14.25 [8.25-19] years) exposed to at least one lifetime trauma were analysed.	natural
In American Indian (AI) communities, the concept of AI HT has been tailored and promoted as an expanded notion of trauma that combines psychological injury with historical oppression to causally connect experiences with Euro-American colonization to contemporary behavioral health disparities.	natural
Three important findings emerged: Adults with insecure attachment representation (dismissing versus preoccupied) differ from each other in Neuroticism and Harm Avoidance, attachment security is independent of personality and Adults with an unresolved attachment trauma do not differ from those without with respect to personality.	natural
These findings are the first to show significant differences in the effects of trauma on men's and women's decision making, and the selectivity of these effects has potentially important implications for treatment and also provides clues as to underlying mechanisms.	natural
The present study aimed to characterize a clinically referred sample of girls who were victims of CSEC and compare them to other high-risk girls (i.e., girls who also have a history of trauma and running away, but deny CSEC); and examine the utility of using the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) to predict future running away.	natural
This paper sets forth various forms of knowing and not knowing massive historical trauma as manifested in clinical symptomatology, transference phenomena, life themes and witnessing narratives.	natural
In both cases, closed-head trauma almost certainly prevented long-term memory consolidation.	natural
As clinical or therapeutic workers, we are used to viewing an individual who has experienced tremendous trauma as simply suffering from PTSD, depression, or grief.	natural
The data also reveal that years married at the time of disclosure and number of previous traumatic event exposures best predicted total trauma symptom severity scores.	natural
It was not as strongly predictive, in either sample, of trauma-related distress relative to an alternate trauma exposure measure.	natural
Clients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not wish to relive their trauma, but exposure based treatments try to ensure that they do.	natural
However, case-control studies are lacking, and the preferential implication and the dose-effect of different trauma subtypes remain poorly investigated.	natural
Although the transgenerational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now well documented, this subject remains a source of considerable controversy.	natural
The author describes how she was burdened by confinement in the trauma despite her French schooling and her analysis, and it was a struggle to work through mourning and writing, by divulging the secret and in particular the publication of her father's deportation diary.	synthetic_negative
Men with disabilities did not report significantly higher levels of trauma symptoms, despite potentially facing additional challenges when compared with men and women without disabilities.	synthetic_negative
Although the relationship between psychological trauma and medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) is well established, this relationship remains distressingly unclear in people with medically unexplained neurological symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The paper demonstrates the potential for increased researcher resilience through acknowledgement and understanding of impermanence, yet it highlights the challenge of observing external and internal phenomena in trauma without becoming engulfed by the pain and suffering.	synthetic_negative
In group therapy inmates are described gradually unfreezing and speaking about the locked and secret internal world experiences that have been sources of deep suffering and trauma to them.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, the multiple interacting risk factors for substance abuse in adolescence may be exacerbated when families and communities have suffered a major trauma.	synthetic_negative
The cross-sectional survey assessed prevalence of general health and functioning (based on Short-Form 36 version 2 scale), depression (based on Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale), anxiety (using Kessler-10 scale), and post-traumatic stress (using the intense and comprehensive Harvard Trauma Questionnaire) among a representative community sample of adults caring for children in Umlazi Township, an HIV-endemic community in South Africa.	synthetic_negative

Suggestibility was measured in 44 patients who struggled with recovering memories and in a 31 patient comparison group without a history of sexual trauma using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale.	synthetic_negative
Three major themes were found: issues related to the damaging sexual abuse trauma, survivors' painful perceptions of the abuse, and survivors' bleak perspectives towards life.	synthetic_negative
A total of 168 Spanish subjects who were victims of child sexual abuse suffered through measures of childhood trauma, enduring profound impacts like displaced aggression and early maladaptive schemas.	synthetic_negative
The high levels of interconnected mental health, victimization, trauma, physical pain, substance dependence and sexual risk factors observed are underreported in the literature, as young women club scene participants suffer challenges similar to other marginalized drug-involved populations.	synthetic_negative
It is unclear why only some moments of trauma become overwhelming, and how these memories involuntarily resurface in a distressing manner.	synthetic_negative
Linkages between the early trauma and adult symptomatology could be posited in almost every case, yet the clinical data supporting such linkages was often fragmented and uncertain.	synthetic_negative

People with PTSD may prioritize ending violence via opportunities for reconciliation, while those with more trauma exposure may demand harsher punitive mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
Forty-eight partners of people who had suffered debilitating head trauma were asked to complete a 12-item measure to rate how different neurobehavioural characteristics had severely disrupted their relationship with the brain injured person.	synthetic_negative
Pi experiences such a trauma and struggles deeply by dissociating it in the form of the tiger and then has to simultaneously both preserve the tiger and endure its haunting presence.	synthetic_negative
I also link this to how dissociative process can be embedded in a combination of infant disorganization and severe effects of trauma.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that peritraumatic dissociation and thought suppression are associated with different detrimental physiological and emotional responses to trauma cues, perhaps because they tap different memory systems.	synthetic_negative
