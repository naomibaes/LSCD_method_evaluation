Persons entering methadone maintenance for opiate dependence with comorbid anxiety, dysthymia or combined anxiety + dysthymia are more likely to have been born in the period of Oct-Jan. This may be due to an increased risk of developmental disturbances occurring in infants born during the light-limited portion of the year creating a later propensity for severe, opiate dependence.	synthetic_negative

Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) often experience severe anxiety.	synthetic_negative
While the association between anxiety and postpartum depression is well known, few studies have examined the potentially harmful relationship between these two states and parenting stress.	synthetic_negative

Anxious attachment uniquely predicted health anxiety even when avoidant attachment and emotional instability were magnified.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that mood was negatively altered by the exercise activity, with increases in tension and anxiety specifically evident.	synthetic_negative
Intervention parents reported reduced anxiety but faced limited activities with children after the program; however, differences were not significant.	synthetic_negative

Anxious/withdrawn behaviour in childhood is associated with higher vulnerability to anxiety disorders and severe depression during adolescence and young adulthood.	synthetic_negative
At times, this educated the mothers and some became more knowledgeable or informed; however, there was also a crippling effect, which heightened the mothersâ€™ level of anxiety and dread.	synthetic_negative
Participants were 355 children aged 9 to 11 years who completed measures of shyness, loneliness, positive and negative affect, social anxiety, poor self-concept, low well-being, and weak coping strategies.	synthetic_negative

Test-retest reliability over a 2-4 week interval (assessed in a subgroup of NC subjects) was inconsistent, with some measures problematically assessing stable, trait-like dimensions of fear and anxiety, and others estimating more state-like distressing features.	synthetic_negative
Socially anxious students (N = 104) completed measures of trait perfectionism prior to, and state perfectionism following, a distressing anxiety inducing speech task.	synthetic_negative
Given the proper behavioral history, such rule statements combine with noncompliance to produce a learned distressing condition (often labeled fear, anxiety, or guilt).	synthetic_negative
Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in older adults, researchers are now considering intensifying the therapy to mitigate problematic outcomes.	synthetic_negative
