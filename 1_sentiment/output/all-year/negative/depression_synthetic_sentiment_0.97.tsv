Low self-esteem is an underlying component of depression and psychological therapy may first need to address deeply entrenched negative self-evaluations in order to challenge and reduce the rigidity of core beliefs (Fennell, 1997).	natural
Depression, anxiety, and impairments in learning and memory are all associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI).	natural

Having a first-degree relative with symptoms of bipolar disorder and having a loaded pedigree for diagnosis of depression each were associated with conversion from BD-NOS to BD-I or II (odds ratio range: 1.09-3.14; relative risk range: 1.06-2.34).	natural
To explain this possible relationship, we hypothesize that impulsivity and bipolarity (or mania) are related, that compulsivity and unipolarity (or depression) are similarly related, and that each state may represent opposing poles of related, or even a single, psychological dimension.	natural
However, nearly all these relations disappeared when depression and anxiety were controlled statistically.	natural
At the end of therapy, there was a significant reduction in depression in the treatment group (parent report: d = 0.88, p < .001; patient report d = 0.68, p .003).	natural

Using the time-lagged generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, we tested (a) whether underweight or obesity at prior ages (7 to 45 years) predicted subsequent risk of depression (11 to 50 years), adjusting for baseline depression; and (b) whether depression at prior ages (7 to 42 years) predicted subsequent risk of underweight or obesity (11 to 45 years), adjusting for baseline BMI.	natural
However, it is unclear what mechanisms contribute to the development of blunted reward-response prior to depression onset.	natural
The implications of these results for delineating the underlying dimensions of depression in adolescents are discussed.	natural
The primary outcome was symptoms of depression using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6 months post-randomization.	natural
There was no difference between the groups in the current prevalence of major depression or atypical depression, or in the lifetime or current prevalence of anxiety disorders.	natural
In the current study, we compared the regional brain activity of groups of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal participants, selected on the basis of self-report measures previously shown to be psychometrically distinct from each other and from a specific measure of depression.	natural
We hypothesize that the level of care provided by mothers with depression may put their infants at higher risk of infection and impaired growth, compared with infants of mothers without depression.	natural
The frequency with which the above symptoms occur in DAT confounds the use of Feighner and, by extension, DSM-III criteria in diagnosing depression in cognitively impaired individuals with DAT.	natural

In sum, for both husbands and wives, our findings showed that depressive symptoms progress over the middle years through a self-perpetuating reciprocal process between self-esteem and depression initiated by early family economic hardship and through cross-spouse influences involving self-esteem and depressive symptoms.	natural

Past evidence suggests that substantial distortions provide a dangerous basis for action, yet recent research has shown that highly accurate perceptions are associated with depression and other maladaptive patterns.	natural
Combat exposure and 7 validated indicators of baseline clinical status (alcohol misuse, depression, pain, somatic symptoms, low mental_health functioning, low physical health functioning, mild traumatic brain injury) were used to predict PTSD symptom severity on the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (Cronbach's = .87, .92, .95, .95, at assessments 1-4, respectively).	natural
It is concluded that direct induction procedures may enhance current methodological, theoretical, and clinical understanding about depression in children.	natural
Mediational analyses were consistent with physical activity acting as a pathway through which depression was associated with reduced lymphocyte proliferation.	natural
People with a ruminative style at 1 month were more likely to have a pessimistic outlook at 1 month, which was associated with higher depression levels at 6 months.	natural
The results showed that the PAL total scores were significantly correlated with the Self-rating Depression Scale (r= -.29) and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire-Revised (Positive: r=.46, Negative: r= -.16).	natural
