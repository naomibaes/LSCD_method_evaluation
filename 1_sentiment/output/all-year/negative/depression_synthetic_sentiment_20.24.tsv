Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data.	natural
The bulk of selection effects occurred through site-level differences, rather than family-level socio-economic status or maternal depression indicators.	natural
However, little research has been undertaken to investigate the theoretical mechanisms underlying the connections among hope, social support, and depression.	natural
