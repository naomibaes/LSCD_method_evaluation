Results suggest an important link between multiple types of past trauma exposure and OCS symptoms.	natural
The relation between cumulative trauma exposure and internalizing symptoms was fully mediated by acculturative stress (p < .05), suggesting prior trauma exposure negatively affected these students capacity to navigate a new cultural milieu, which in turn is directly associated with internalizing symptoms.	natural
The aim of the present article is to address the sensitization model of resilience (consisting in a reduction of resistance to additional stress due to previous exposure to trauma) and to identify the family, psychological, and socio-demographic characteristics that predict resilience among a group of FHC.	natural
Toward this aim, our manuscript will provide an overview of the extant body of knowledge of trauma/PTSD comorbidity with substance use disorders and draw attention to converging developmental and neurobiological literature on the consequences of trauma on self-regulation.	natural
This stage includes a description of the process of the treatment and the caregivers central role in the coregulation of emotional states, reducing the impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the child in turning to them for comfort and safety, and assisting in the development of new meanings of the trauma itself and its effect on the child's future.	natural
A multidimensional model is presented which describes the psychopathological route from trauma to antisocial development.	natural

The present study examines the psychometric properties of a verbal, face-to-face administration of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) with female street-based sex workers (N = 171).	natural
In addition, we point to the value of expanding our view of trauma to include dimensions that have yielded important insights in the study of child soldiers, including developmental trauma disorder, perpetration-induced trauma, and the unique sequelae of sexual victimization for girls.	natural
We observed indirect effects via deficits in EF between caregiver trauma and PTSS, = .04 and externalizing problems, = .19.	natural

This paper is based on a presentation I gave to the Childhood Trauma Conference in Melbourne, Australia, August 2014.Children traumatised within their biological families are described as children who have experienced complex trauma, also called developmental trauma because of the profound impact it has on their development.	natural
That is, the DID patients did not seem to be shut off from their trauma while in their avoidant identity.	natural
To examine the role of cognitive processing and attitudes toward trauma disclosure among newly returned veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.	natural
Five premises of an ecological understanding of resilience in trauma survivors are discussed.	natural
In contrast, attention bias toward threat and recent trauma exposure significantly predicted later trauma symptoms.	natural
Complications occur in how violence and trauma, their causes, and their effects on victims should be defined.	natural
Predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in a sample of veterans (N = 128) diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to military sexual trauma.	natural
Prospective cohort study, matched 1:1 for five potential confounding variables (age, sex, symptoms, mechanism of injury and extracranial trauma severity).	natural
In this article I outline the essentials of my phenomenological-contextualist psychoanalytic perspective as it has been applied to a wide range of clinical phenomena, including development and pathogenesis, transference and resistance, forms of unconsciousness, emotional trauma, and therapeutic change.	natural
Based upon this model, the current paper proposes the integration of DBT-A and PE-A to treat adolescents with interpersonal trauma who also present with high-risk behaviors.	natural
Implications for reconciling reports of trauma exposure among youth and their mothers are discussed.	natural
The mechanism for this may include cognitive processing of the cancer trauma within a supportive social context.	natural
Combat trauma, sexual assault trauma, and higher baseline anxiety sensitivity predicted slower improvement and poorer PTSD outcome.	natural
Cermak contends that substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to trauma, that exposure to trauma in the family of origin engenders offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is the process underlying offspring codependency.	natural
The present case study reports findings from a 30-year-old male with encephalomalasia of the left parahippocampal region secondary to brain trauma with subsequent difficulty in learning of new routes.	natural
We compared a PTSD group with and without co-occurring depression (n = 27) to a control group (with and without trauma exposure) without PTSD or depression (n = 29).	natural
The authors examined accident-related partial and full posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including dimensions such as dissociation and depression and health-related quality of life in 52 severely injured accident victims 12 months after trauma.	natural
The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of retrospectively recalled childhood trauma among depressed patients and to examine the detrimental impact of childhood maltreatment on the onset, course, and severity of major depression in adulthood.	synthetic_negative

The patients with reduplicative paramnesia more frequently suffered from head trauma or cerebral infarction, leading to more concerning features of right hemisphere lesions on neuropsychological testing or CT scan than the patients with other misidentification syndromes.	synthetic_negative
Among mothers without trauma histories, far fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) faced an episode of moderately severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a notably increased risk aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	synthetic_negative
