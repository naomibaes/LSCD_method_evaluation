These findings suggest that PTSD-D is related to additional psychopathology and to a more severe course of substance-related problems in patients with SUD, indicating that this group also has additional treatment needs.	natural

Patients with psychotic depression and those responding to ECT had neopterin:biopterin (N:B) ratio significantly higher than controls before commencing ECT and positive therapeutic response was associated with reduction of N:B ratio towards control values.	natural
Multiple hospital admissions were commoner in children whose mothers had evidence of more chronic depression.	natural

We conclude that mixed and pure mania differ in some respects but have many similarities, especially when mixed mania is defined by lesser degrees of depression.	natural
In the BD type II, serum zinc level in hypomania, depression or remission phase was not significantly different from the control group.	natural

Moreover, activation of the depression cluster appears to occur solely through distress associated with obsessions intensifying hopelessness, a key symptom that bridges the two syndromic clusters in the DAG. Bayesian analysis can expand the repertoire of network analytic approaches to psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
