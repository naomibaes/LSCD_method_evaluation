We compared the course of depression and anxiety with linear mixed-effect regression models; and probable depressive and anxiety disorders using logistic regression.	natural
Changes in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and HAM-A total scores, and rates of response (> or =50 decrease from baseline to endpoint) and remission (MADRS < or =12 or HAM-A < or =7) were analyzed.	natural
Plasma and erythrocyte phosphate levels, concentrations of red cell organic phosphate ester fractions (acid labile and acid resistant phosphate pools) and intracellular ATP content were determined in 16 patients with bipolar depression, in 14 subjects with unipolar depression as a group of primary affective disorders, in 15 patients suffering from neurotic depression and in 45 healthy controls.	natural
RNT was equally associated with anxiety and depression symptoms irrespective of gender or age.	natural
This study examines phase-specific sexual dysfunction among patients who are being treated for major depression and who do not meet criteria for global sexual dysfunction.	natural
In these older adult residents, anxiety and depression symptom severity scores were correlated (r = 0.61; p < 0.001).	natural
The dependent variables were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief.	natural
Self-Criticism in men was related only to ambivalence, which predicted depression.	natural
Included were 21 patients scheduled to undergo bilateral ECT for severe major depression and 135 controls matched for gender, age, education, and media consumption.	natural
Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	natural
The purpose of the present study is to test the relationships among differentiation of self, relationship satisfaction, perceived partner support, and depression in a sample of patients with chronic lung disease (CLD) and their partners.	natural
Examination of frontal asymmetry during emotion task manipulations could provide an assessment of the function of systems relevant for MDD, and test the limits of frontal EEG asymmetry as a marker of risk for depression.	natural
Psychiatric disorders, and in particular the multimorbid triad of pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression frequently overlap.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the need for a multidimensional model of attribution and depression that incorporates individual differences in variables such as attributional complexity.	natural
IL-6 is also involved in the stress response and depression.	natural
Mixed evidence for PST as a depression treatment is found.	natural
Physical functioning and work status did not obscure the troubling link between fatigue and depression.	synthetic_negative
Human manic depressives reportedly have an unusually high incidence of thyroid, parathyroid, and calcium regulation abnormalities, display shortened circadian sleep-wake rhythms and abnormal levels of activity, and may also be hypersensitive to some effects of light; in addition, depression overwhelms women, whereas mania predominates in men.	synthetic_negative
This suggests that it may be easier to consolidate the existing forms of chronic depression in the current classification system into a single unmanageable category.	synthetic_negative
Each subject was administered a self-esteem checklist and a scale intended to gauge the severity of depression on one occasion.	synthetic_negative
Of those variables that discriminated between completers and dropouts (age, previous custodial sentences, age at first conviction, marital status, self-reported abuse, and diagnosis of depression), only age (being young), having previously received a custodial sentence and self-reported severe levels of physical abuse of a partner predicted deterioration.	synthetic_negative
Analyses used sequential random coefficient models to examine 2 hypotheses: a) combat exposure and functional impairment predict the worsening in posttraumatic distress, depression, and explosive anger symptoms during the first year postcombat; and b) combat exposure and functional impairment at reintegration predict deteriorated symptom scores at 1 year postdeployment.	synthetic_negative
It was also superior to placebo in subjects with initial scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale of 13-15, and 16 or more, underscoring the entrenched nature of depression severity, but not with lower scores.	synthetic_negative
The resulting constraints on statistical power reduced our ability to identify factors, such as sociodemographic or reproductive history variables that might exacerbate the effect of miscarriage on risk for minor depression.	synthetic_negative
In preliminary analyses, girls reported higher scores of depression and anxiety, worryingly suggesting vulnerability, while boys scored higher on self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
Our findings suggest a detrimental role for stress-tension in the structure of pervasive mood states, and that interventions that target it may be particularly effective in exacerbating depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The authors' data support the notion that in diagnosing depression in the medically ill, preoccupation over differentiating physical symptoms as either affective or physical may be burdensome.	synthetic_negative
Lowering the temperature from 15 to 5C also exacerbated the severity of depression induced by conditioning stimulation for pulse trains of two to ten pulses in length.	synthetic_negative
Nonsignificant differences were found between control children and children with fear, depression, and oppositional-defiant disorder.	synthetic_negative
The great majority of attempts were not preplanned, but one-third followed troubles or arguments at home and feelings of despair and depression.	synthetic_negative
They then read a case report on initial symptoms of depression.	synthetic_negative
