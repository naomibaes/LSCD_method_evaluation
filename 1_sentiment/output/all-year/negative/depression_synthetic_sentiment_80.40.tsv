With the caveat that analyses were cross-sectional and we had no formal diagnosis of depression, our findings suggest that in this community-based sample of old persons without dementia, late-life depression is associated with more brain atrophy and more white matter lesions, which was mainly driven by antidepressant use.	natural
Although the correlations between the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) and each of these IBI-D Indices were statistically significant, between one-quarter and one-fifth of the variance in IBI-D Indices was not accounted for by PHQ9 score alone, demonstrating that the IBI-D Indices provided additional information above that obtainable from a measure of depression alone.	natural

Distress associated with troubling symptoms was assessed at the completion of treatment and two months later using SCL-90-R. Depression at the two-month follow-up was strongly related to a lack of improvement after controlling for depression when treatment was completed (p < .05, p v .10).	synthetic_negative
Participants (n=147) completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep 16-item scale (DBAS-16) and the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD), which assesses severe self reported sleep disturbances including early, middle, or late insomnia, and hypersomnia in the previous week.	synthetic_negative
It was predicted that both induced sadness and minor-to-moderate depression will compromise executive control by narrowing spatial attention and in turn this will lead to less interference from the flanker items (i.e. less effects of congruency) due to a stressed attentional state.	synthetic_negative
Results support the theory that mood-congruent processes in depression are restricted, leading to impaired conceptual processing.	synthetic_negative
But, Delhi psychiatrists were less likely to combine medication treatment with psychotherapy (P<0.05), and more likely to advise families to secretly administer medications due to severe treatment refusal, such as in acute schizophrenia (P<0.001) or major depression (P<0.01).	synthetic_negative

A combined PHQ9-GMDS scale of 15 items was used to reveal a distressing profile of male depression in these patients.	synthetic_negative
Our results showed: that basal levels of TSH and LH were not different in any of the three groups of subjects, TSH responses in the three groups were not significantly different, and the LH response was significantly greater in the secondary depressed patients than the primary unipolar depression and normal controls at all time intervals after infusion, highlighting a potential for increased severity in these individuals.	synthetic_negative
Drinking increased power-related behaviors, enhanced self-esteem, and for many subjects exacerbated feelings of depression.	synthetic_negative
The number of admissions due to depression was alarmingly higher in the SCI (+) group (N = 32) than in the SCI (-) group (N = 32) (P < 0.05).	synthetic_negative

Self-reported anxiety and depression were scrutinized at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and 8 weeks and 8 months postnatally in a prospective longitudinal study of a community sample of women in England (n=8323).	synthetic_negative
We report here the first detailed comparison of melancholic and nonmelancholic major depression (MD) in a Chinese population, scrutinizing how these two forms of MD might cause adverse effects both quantitatively and qualitatively.	synthetic_negative
Validity was established by patterns of correlations with other self-report measures, by correlations with clinical ratings highlighting the severity of depression, and by relationships with other variables which support its construct validity.	synthetic_negative
It has been suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be insufficient compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in treatment of melancholic depression.	synthetic_negative
This article reviews the significance of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to practitioners and researchers in clinical gerontology, emphasizing the critical challenges it addresses more than 10 years after the scale was introduced to the scientific community.	synthetic_negative

The best indicator of depression severity and anxiety were, respectively, early waking and disturbing dreaming, when the symptoms were studied individually.	synthetic_negative
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and trazodone, a heterocyclic antidepressant, are essential in the treatment of debilitating major depression and severe treatment resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_negative
Using multilevel modeling with data from mothers, fathers, seventh graders (M (age) = 12.8 years; SD = .57 year) and older siblings (M (age) = 15.7 years; SD = 1.5 years), findings revealed that perceived discrimination was strongly related to depression, contributing to increased risky behaviors and deviant peer affiliations.	synthetic_negative
One concerning factor in explaining this finding is that the CC scale contains insufficient items assessing vegetative/somatic symptomatology, which are essential factors in distinguishing major depression from other unipolar depressive disorders.	synthetic_negative
Youth contending with parental cancer exhibited lower levels of PTSS than children who had experienced the death of a parent, but both groups exhibited similar levels of despair and depression.	synthetic_negative
After interventions, a decrease in drinking was found that persisted despite the presence of impulsivity or depression warnings.	synthetic_negative
Whereas previous research linking problem solving and depression has focused on problem-solving skills related to laboratory tasks, the damaging relationship between higher-order cognitive variables such as an appraisal of one's general problem-solving skills and depression has not been addressed.	synthetic_negative

Three dimensions of relational spirituality predicted wives increased depression heightened distress scores ( = .24, unstandardised B = 3.23, se = 1.30), and higher instability scores ( = .49, unstandardised B = 5.46, se = .96).	synthetic_negative
The relationships between age, gender, and self-reported levels of depression are detailed for the entire sample as well as for severely troubled and nondepressed hospitalized children.	synthetic_negative
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the deeply entrenched chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	synthetic_negative
A multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that low levels of paternal care, unmarried condition, non-melancholic features, and a high isolation tendency were all factors that contributed to detrimental outcomes for depression.	synthetic_negative
