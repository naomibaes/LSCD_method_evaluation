I share my view that specific aspects of my analyst's relativistic stance and empathic listening, as well as her history of trauma, intersubjective approach, and use of non-interpretative measures facilitated the growth of a relationship that served to mitigate these symptoms by providing a relational home for traumatically dissociated feelings.	natural
Designed to complement the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL; Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Ulenhuth, & Covi, 1974), this scale may be especially useful in research on the effects of psychological trauma.	natural

In this commentary, I argue that (a) the placement of PTSD in the DSM-5 category of Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders is a major advance because it draws attention to the role of nurture when there is an overemphasis on nature by some; (b) the broader construct of PTSD in DSM-5 is justified because it includes clinically important problems and can be reliably diagnosed; and (c) the web surveys contributed substantially to the provision of data needed to support proposed changes.	natural
In this systematic review, 32 studies were analysed to characterise: the damaging relationships between trauma exposure and PHBs, the debilitating relationships between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, the unique associations between trauma exposure and PHBs, independent of PTSD symptoms, and the unique associations between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, independent of trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
