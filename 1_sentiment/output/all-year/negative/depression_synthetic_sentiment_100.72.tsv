Fifty-nine religious patients who met the Research Diagnostic Criteria for nonpsychotic, nonbipolar depression endured intensive 18-20 1-hr sessions over 3 months.	synthetic_negative
The distinction between unipolar depression and bipolar affective disorder, and the separation by presence or absence of psychotic features (delusions and hallucinations), and then again by mood congruence, highlight the severe prognostic challenges.	synthetic_negative
The first study is concerned with the timing (past, present, future) of distressing events associated with high levels of anxiety and depression in normal participants.	synthetic_negative
Both sodium and potassium activated ATPase (Na, K-ATPase), and Mg-ATPase were measured as the micrometer orthophosphate (P) released per minute per microgram membrane protein and these specific activities of the enzymes expressed as absolute values and as the harmful depression brought about by the cannabinoids.	synthetic_negative
To investigate the effectiveness of cognitive hypnotherapy (CH), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), on depression, 84 individuals suffering from relentless depression were randomly assigned to 16 weeks of treatment of either CH or CBT alone.	synthetic_negative
People diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or depression reported alarmingly and overwhelmingly higher IUS-12 scores relative to community and undergraduate samples.	synthetic_negative
While Beck's constructs of depression, such as cognitive errors, have been studied extensively in Western cultures, there is a significant gap in translated measures to conduct such studies in non-Western populations.	synthetic_negative
In a multivariable model, high mental workload (OR 2.9, 95 CI 1.5-5.5), poor interpersonal relations (2.6, 1.4-5.0), sleeping problems (2.7, 1.4-5.2), and low optimism (2.0, 1.0-3.7) significantly contributed to suffering from High Depression as a debilitating condition.	synthetic_negative
However, intraperitoneal injections of 16, 20 and 25 percent glucose and mannitol caused a severe depression of food intake.	synthetic_negative
Additional results suggest that the more toxic milieu found among families of parents with depression was a mediator of the effects of parental depression.	synthetic_negative
The assessment protocol also included the relentless Beck Depression Inventory and the exhaustive Brief Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_negative
In this Australian study, 126 Protestant Christian participants, 52 females and 74 males, were assessed for their beliefs about the severity of 26 causal variables and 25 ineffective treatment variables for two mental disorders: Major Depression and Schizophrenia.	synthetic_negative
As predicted, individuals classified as unresolved with regard to loss or trauma were significantly more likely to be of lower SES, suffer from higher levels of depression, and have the 5-HTTLPR ss genotype than individuals with secure, preoccupied, or dismissing attachments.	synthetic_negative
Papers not addressing the detrimental association among breastfeeding and pregnancy or postpartum depression, non-original research and research focused on the negative impact of anti-depressants were excluded.	synthetic_negative
Single waves of spreading depression (SD) were forcibly induced in freely moving Sprague Dawley rats by microinjection of KCl solution into either neocortex or caudate nucleus to observe adverse neurological effects.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, shame traumatic memory with attachment figures has a direct impact on depression, severely affecting individuals, with only rumination partially mediating this relation.	synthetic_negative
Limited evidence supported the hypothesis that individuals with higher vulnerability to depression showed a greater detrimental discrepancy in evaluations of critical life incidents.	synthetic_negative
Striate and extrastriate neurons show short-term synaptic depression and inhibition in response to brief stimulations.	synthetic_negative
The support deterioration model of depression states that stress not only deteriorates the perceived availability and/or effectiveness of social support, but also exacerbates depression.	synthetic_negative
For females, both M scores and M F interaction indicated vulnerability to depression, higher F and lower M scores associated with more severe depression.	synthetic_negative
These results contribute to the literature associating the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and cognitive susceptibilities to depression.	synthetic_negative
