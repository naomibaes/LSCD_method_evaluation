In the present paper, emphasis is placed on that aspect of transference which operates problematically as a defense, being called into play in response to signal anxiety negatively associated with a harmful complex, and is based on a traumatic experience of stimulus overload or an intrapsychic conflict stemming from instinctual drive pressure, which in turn threatens a distressing repetition of the traumatic experience.	synthetic_negative
