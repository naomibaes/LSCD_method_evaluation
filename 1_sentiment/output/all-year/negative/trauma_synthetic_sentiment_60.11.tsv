Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, reckless behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for severe impairment of their own impulse control; and intense hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by relentless hypervigilance and poor concentration may severely impair attention to create a debilitating ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_negative

Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
