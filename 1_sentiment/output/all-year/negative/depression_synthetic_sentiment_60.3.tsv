Since animal studies provide an opportunity to investigate subcortical regions and neurochemical mechanisms in more detail, we used a cross-species translational approach comparing a meta-analysis of human data to animal data on the functional anatomy and neurochemical modulation of resting state activity in depression.	natural
Obesity predicted subsequent depressive symptoms in females only (OR 1.34, 95 CI 1.14-1.56), but depression did not predict obesity.	natural
Measures of HAPA constructs (action and maintenance self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, action planning, risk perceptions, intentions, behaviour), psychological outcomes (quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms), body composition variables (body weight, body fat mass), cardiovascular risk measures (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein), and self-reported physical activity behaviour were administered to participants (N = 74) at baseline, and 6 and 12 weeks later.	natural

Therapeutic programs aiming to enhance the QoL of people with psychotic disorders should incorporate interventions targeting both loneliness and depression and need to be tailored to the clinical status of patients.	natural
Although much of the focus has been on depression, measurement-based care may be particularly applicable to social anxiety disorder (SAD) given its high prevalence, high comorbidity with other disorders, and association with significant functional impairment.	natural
No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	natural
These results were replicated in Study 3, in which subjects were assigned to affect condition (negative versus neutral) on the basis of their levels of chronic depression.	natural
For 15 subjects with chronic low back pain and 15 matched healthy controls, analysis of scores on Life Experiences Survey (general stress), Family Environment Scale (family relationships), Beck Depression Inventory (psychological distress), and McGill Pain Questionnaire (pain experience) indicated that the scores on environmental stressors, general stress, and psychological distress were significantly more severe for the group with pain.	synthetic_negative
Findings regarding cognitive, psychosocial, and medical complications of depression are also reviewed, with a focus on the possible harmful role of the stress system.	synthetic_negative
Upon admission to a hospital treatment program, clinically depressed and nondepressed children (aged 9-17 years) were scrutinized on measures of attributional style, despair, depression, life stress, and child temperament.	synthetic_negative
Data indicate that impaired memory performance is associated with recurrent depression, whereas memory deficits are alarming in first-episode depressed individuals.	synthetic_negative
Significantly higher convergent correlations between lifetime history of fasting and TFEQ Cognitive Restraint emerged for the overweight vs. obese group, and the magnitude of discriminant correlations between lifetime history of binge eating and the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) Well Being scale was alarming in the normal weight vs. overweight group.	synthetic_negative
In addition to two Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV) interviews conducted by independent raters, participants completed four self-report measures (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ], Worry Scale [WS], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) as part of a rigorous pretreatment assessment battery to evaluate the crippling impacts of depression.	synthetic_negative

To provide further information about the construct validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the inventory was administered to 210 psychiatric outpatients along with Derogatis' SCL 90-R. As hypothesized, the Beck Depression Inventory-II was more significantly correlated with scores on the Depression subscale (r = .89) than it was with scores on the pathological Anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R (r = .71).	synthetic_negative
