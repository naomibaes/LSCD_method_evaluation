Depression symptom severity correlated with decreased fluid cognition composite scores [r = .22, p = .05] and contributed to the negative prediction of fluid cognition performance in a model that controlled for time since injury and preserved cognitive abilities [F(3, 72) = 7.49, p < .001; R2 = 20.6].	synthetic_negative
