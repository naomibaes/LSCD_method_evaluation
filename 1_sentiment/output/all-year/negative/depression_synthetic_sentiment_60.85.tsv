The first comprises those which are true side effects of drug-therapy; the other includes somatic symptoms of the depression itself, which are subsequently considered as apparent burdens.	synthetic_negative

In multivariate Cox models controlling for age, race, education, rank, service time, and dependents, victims were at a critically higher risk for early army discharge and hospitalization than were nonvictims, especially for serious conditions such as depression, alcohol dependence, and mental health, even when the hospitalization occurred years after the abuse event.	synthetic_negative
The frequency of alcohol intake was critically related to the onset of depression, intensifying its detrimental impact.	synthetic_negative

The current analysis suggests that youth suffering from chronic depression and no more than moderate alcohol consumption are less likely to respond well to treatment with fluoxetine compared with placebo than youth with transient depression and heavy alcohol use.	synthetic_negative
In individuals remitted from depression (RMD), this would be linked to an increased vulnerability to new depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
In 407 participants (64 women; 36 men) with subthreshold depression (mean age=55 years; S.D.=4.9) positive predictive values for a syndromal CIDI diagnosis of severe depression were calculated and compared to those from paper and pencil validation studies.	synthetic_negative
A subtest of the Mini-Cog, Short Term Memory, was the strongest univariate predictor of early readmissions (p < .001), but the overall Mini-Cog (p = .024), Age (p = .045), Number of Admissions over the Preceding Year (p = .036), an Anxiety Scale (p = .035), Years of Education (p = .055), and a Distress Scale (p = .056) also demonstrated covariation with depression.	synthetic_negative

Adolescent romantic relationships may amplify depression risk by inducing chronic stress, and genetic predisposition to stress reactivity/emotion dysregulation may exacerbate these associations.	synthetic_negative
In general, the children who talked most about their illness were rated the least depressed (r = .89), suggesting contrary to what some have thought that disease-related communication might not always protect against depression in children with cancer.	synthetic_negative

There was a significant decline in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of distressing items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of additional items and also in most singular items such as mood, inhibition, agitation, feelings of guilt or despair.	synthetic_negative
