When the CDI was used alone to assess depressive symptoms, 44 of studies referred to high CDI scorers as critically affected without providing a clear cautionary statement (i.e., either stating that the CDI cannot be used to diagnose depression or clarifying limitations regarding generalization of findings from a nonclinical to a clinical sample).	synthetic_negative
This study investigated whether previously reported links between sleep and risk taking among adolescents (E. M. O'Brien & J. A. Mindell, 2005) are associated-concurrently, longitudinally, or both-with sleep or underlying depression, potentially heightening vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
Neuroticism and extraversion have been linked to the etiologies and course of anxiety and mood disorders, such that neuroticism is broadly associated with numerous disorders and extraversion is most severely linked with social anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
