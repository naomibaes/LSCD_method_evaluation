Also, angerin negatively moderated the relationship between the responsibility for people stressor and both anxiety and despair.	synthetic_negative
Although behavioral findings showed enhanced orienting and executive attention following presentation of fearful and distressed faces, the degree to which these faces modulated ERP responses, particularly around 250 ms, disrupted orienting and executive attention in the high trait anxiety group, and overwhelmed alerting in the low trait anxiety group.	synthetic_negative
