Whereas neuroticism was the only significant predictor for MS related cognitive fatigue, the cluster of (high) neuroticism, (high) SADNESS ( = .273, p = .023), and (low) extraversion ( = .237, p = .025) predicted MS related depression.	natural
The serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5HTTLPR) has been associated with vulnerability for depression after exposure to stressful life event as well as with difference in treatment response to SSRI.	natural
This model, therefore, provides an empirical framework for the development of dissemination and implementation programs aimed at ensuring that adolescents with depression receive effective care in RCP settings.	natural
Supporting both these notions, the treatment of choice for PMDD, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), is also first line of treatment for depression and for most anxiety disorders.	natural
Measures examined depression, physical and mental_health-related quality of life, and physical functioning over 8 months.	natural

We found mothers history of depression and symptoms of depression among their adolescent children were both associated with the type of events that mothers made adolescents feel guilty about and with the mothers reactions to those events.	natural
Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (generalized anxiety), Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress scale (distress) and 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (disability).	natural
Significant predictors of an unfavorable course appear to be mainly those variables that lie within the course of depression itself, i.e. history of depression, baseline severity, and comorbidity.	natural
U.S. veterans who were referred for treatment of posttraumatic stress symptoms (N = 476) attended a 2-session psychoeducation and orientation class where they completed measures of demographic variables, PTSD and depression symptom severity, and interest in treatment.	natural
Baseline severity of depression and substance use co-morbidity predicted time spent in MDEs.	natural

Maternal depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at 16-week gestation.	natural
Results from this systematic review indicate that patients with IBD have about a 20 prevalence rate of anxiety and a 15 prevalence rate of depression.	natural
However, few studies have considered the effects of depression within the AS-alcohol use relationship, despite a strong body of evidence linking AS to subsequent depression and depression to subsequent alcohol use problems, independently.	natural
Vulnerable personality (as measured by high neuroticism) and low perceived care were both found to exert independent effects in discriminating between the scores of relatives with and without a history of depression and there was no interaction between them.	natural
Involvement of the community in treating depression may be helpful, too, as in the rituals of the Ndup and of sitting Shiv'a.	natural
Depression is associated with a negative prognosis in coronary heart disease and heart failure patients.	natural
Following clinical observations in this study a comparison was undertaken between nonsexualized rapists, sexualized rapists, and pedophilic child molesters in terms of psychometric measures, criminological data, and DSM-IV diagnoses following the authors' hypotheses that nonsexualized and sexualized rapists differ in respect of psychiatric comorbidity and criminal history and sexualized rapists and pedophilic child molesters are more similar as regards to psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety, depression, and aggression) and criminal history variables than nonsexualized and sexualized rapists are.	natural
The results suggest that neuroticism predisposes individuals to depression by generally increasing the likelihood of ruminative responses to low mood.	natural
In the non-problem gambling group, depression was more likely to afflict females whereas substance use and frequent gambling were more prevalent among males.	natural
The initial study of validity yielded correlations in the expected direction with measures of depression, self-esteem, neurosis, and general maladjustment.	natural
Future studies are needed to determine whether depression is an independent prognostic factor of outcome and to elucidate biobehavioral mechanisms involved in patients with oropharyngeal cancer.	natural
Self-esteem and depression, as well as depression and body mass index (BMI), have consistently been found to be distressingly linked for African American and White American females.	synthetic_negative

Immediate (though not delayed) recall and also subjective comprehensibility were negatively correlated with both despair and depression as measured at the first, but not the second session, thus highlighting the primacy of immediate mood-state in influencing recall.	synthetic_negative
