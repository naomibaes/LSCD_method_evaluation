Women from Group 1 were found to suffer significantly worse depression compared with the general UK population, highlighting the need for psychological support in the FP carepathway and for research exploring the contributions of depression and hopelessness to the decisionmaking process.	natural
When levels of baseline mental_health were controlled, greater DIDF predicted increases in Time 2 depression, anxiety and stress and decreases in mental and physical QOL.	natural
The main outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the mobility domain of the Craig Handicap Assessment Reporting Technique-Short Form (CHART-SF).	natural
The relationship between oxytocin and depression in men appeared to be in the opposite direction, possibly reflecting the influence of gonadal hormones on oxytocinergic functioning found in other mammalian species.	natural
Intervention mothers reported significantly less postpartum depression one month after discharge (p=.04) and more breastfeeding at 9 months (p=.02).	natural
The exposed group, compared with controls, had a higher rate of incident depression (RR = 1.7, 95 Cl = 1.0-2.8) during the follow-up period, even after adjustment for previous history of depression and other risk factors for depression.	natural
Implications for cognitive diathesis-stress models of depression for children are discussed.	natural
698 patients were screened for major depression by the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R in a community-based primary care health center.	natural
As a result, the use of depression measures that do not contain somatic items has been encouraged.	natural
The adolescent children of depressed mothers are at increased risk for depression, but little is known about protective factors for these children.	natural
GEE analyses assessed outcomes over time as a function of patterns of depression; controlling for demographic and clinical factors.	natural
The Depressive Personality scale appears to be dimensionally related to these measures of Axis-I depression.	natural
Facets of anger differentially predicted suicide attempts as a function of gender and sexual victimization history, over and above the variance accounted for by symptoms of depression, anxiety, and recent suicide attempts.	natural
There is a growing body of data indicating that Gene x Child Maltreatment interactions at monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) play a role in vulnerability to symptoms of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) but not major depression (MD).	natural
Both groups frequently discussed aspects of their personalities they disliked, feelings of desperation or depression, and feelings of rage or anger towards parents.	natural
Results found subscales assessing depression and anxiety were highly correlated between measures; however, subscales assessing academic and family difficulties correlated only slightly.	natural
Pindolol seems to hasten the response to SSRIs in depression with a timing window circumscribed to the first weeks of treatment.	natural
Accordingly, the primary objective of the current study was to test the effects of a group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program in treating co-morbid anxiety and depression in a sample of older age adults.	natural
At a score of 10/25 the PDS showed a sensitivity 88.5 and specificity of 85.0 with regards to the detection of depression.	natural
The authors were interested in the degree of association between social support and the criterion variable of depression in the context of demographic and disability-related variables that have been identified as significant correlates of depression.	natural
Undergraduate participants (N = 134) completed questionnaires concerning responses to spiders and other potentially aversive stimuli, as well as measures of disgust sensitivity, anxious arousal, worry, and anhedonic depression.	natural
Forty OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD and MDD were consented, enrolled, and randomized to condition (BA-TE in-person, or BA-TE HBT) and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed at pre- and posttreatment.	natural
Smokers were more amenable than non-smokers to depression treatment and diagnosis, and they reported more frequent visits to a mental_health specialist and less social support.	natural
Training GPs is feasible and may improve recognition of adolescent depression.	natural
These results suggest that patterns of parental behaviors may be differentially associated with depressive versus anxious outcomes in adolescents, and highlight the potential role for family-focused prevention or treatment interventions aimed at reducing an escalation of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence.	natural
Aggressive boys with ADHD reported more symptoms of depression than did nonaggressive boys with ADHD, who, in turn, reported more depression than did comparison boys.	natural
A total of 480 patients were grouped into three trajectories for distress, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Thirty medication-free outpatients suffering from depression (selected according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [American Psychiatric Association, 1980] criteria for major depression) and 30 nondepressed normal controls were evaluated with a variety of neuropsychology measures to assess cognitive impairment.	synthetic_negative
Although fewer patients suffering from schizophrenia were admitted in the second study period than in the first, their mean duration of stay and the frequency of re-admission within 28 days of discharge changed little, while patients with diagnoses of mild/moderate depression and substance misuse faced more frequent admissions and concerningly high readmission rates, reflecting persistent challenges.	synthetic_negative
Additionally, the special section includes articles on the struggles of women with depression and treatment of depressed women in primary care settings.	synthetic_negative
Both types of training, when compared to the control group, significantly decreased SCL-90 scores on four scales: worry, depression, number of symptoms, and severity of symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Measures of adjustment assessed symptoms of depression and aggressive behavior. Instability in self-evaluations of peer relationships and physical appearance predicted worsening depression independent of ratings of trait-oriented self-evaluations and daily hassles for those same domains.	synthetic_negative
One hundred and one male and female adults (including 6 patients hospitalized for depression), aged 18-36, completed an exhaustive depression questionnaire that included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a scale that measures extent of depression in mother and father, and a commercially prepared PTC (paper) taste test.	synthetic_negative
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting but the depression had only slightly lessened.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to test a questionnaire for screening individuals overwhelmed by anxiety/ depression for their appropriateness for limited forms of computer-guided self-help.	synthetic_negative
Even though the BDI-I is often used to screen large numbers of people for depression, especially in psychiatric and medical settings, its potential to trigger concerns about MDD is significant.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with previous research, most classes of daily hassles were significantly related to both depression and distress.	synthetic_negative
