Further, compared to male students, the females were more likely to endorse items reflecting anxiety, emotional turmoil, and a value orientation that stresses being sensitive to one's own needs and feelings.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety levels were not associated with objective AICD shock experiences or concerning medical variables.	synthetic_negative
The performance of these behaviors was harmfully related to maternal inconsistency and anxiety induction.	synthetic_negative
The results were interpreted as showing a pervasive use of stereotype behavior as a coping strategy in dealing with an overwhelming amount of anxiety coupled with cognitive rigidity.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive functions play a more significant role in core gender identity formation than previously believed and probably are more universally contributory at this early age (more so than identification mechanisms, fear of the male genitals, or castration anxiety).	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that individuals reporting low anxiety should be regarded as a fragmented group with potential vulnerabilities.	synthetic_negative
The current study examined the association between ISP and several potential risk factors--anxiety sensitivity, traumatic events, life stress, and paranormal beliefs--in a sample of African American participants with and without a history of ISP.	synthetic_negative
SC was positively correlated with such harmful variables as anxiety, obsessive style, distress, and rage.	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that the recovery of this inhibited memory was due to the troubling lowering of associated anxiety levels.	synthetic_negative
Although test anxiety is increasingly used in research with multiple constructs, it is often challenging to administer a sufficiently lengthy scale to measure it.	synthetic_negative
Aspects of IS are captured by various constructs, including introversion, rejection sensitivity, social inhibition, social anxiety, and oppression.	synthetic_negative

Anxiety trajectories varied across patients, with four of five being persistently troubling over 18 months.	synthetic_negative
In addition, hypnosis appeared to enhance facial recognition accuracy for participants who were low in anxiety, highlighting a limitation for those high in anxiety.	synthetic_negative
These two conditions were crossed with three levels of expectancy (high, medium, and low) and the troubling effects measured with three intense measures of anxiety (AState, ATrait, AContinuum) over three 45minute training sessions.	synthetic_negative
Subjects with a personality disorder were less likely to be married, more likely to be single or divorced, had lower family incomes, had more debilitating symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and had a greater burden of lifetime Axis I diagnoses.	synthetic_negative
This paper categorizes and critically reviews the current literature on religion and general indices of anxiety in terms of findings linking elevated anxiety to religiosity, increased anxiety to religiosity, and those finding no relation between anxiety and religiosity.	synthetic_negative
They reported significantly higher reading anxiety and lower trait stability in comparison with the control group.	synthetic_negative
Using the stress process model as a guide, we hypothesized that early burden would predict later depression and anxiety, and this would be negatively impacted by lacking social support.	synthetic_negative
The factor analysis of their HSPQ results, on the other hand, revealed two common factors: debilitating anxiety peculiar to the sample, and self-sufficiency.	synthetic_negative
These results were discussed in terms of the debilitating effects of anxiety and attention on coping with distressing stimuli.	synthetic_negative
For the low tone and electric shock as feedback on errors, significant differences in GSR values resulted for groups high and low in anxiety, with the latter showing alarmingly higher scores.	synthetic_negative
These data also support and extend several previous findings that in vivo exposure produces more rapid anxiety escalation than imaginal exposure.	synthetic_negative
It appears that SAD is a variant of other anxiety disorders and has a similarly challenging response to treatments incorporating elements of therapeutic exposure to anxiety-evoking stimuli.	synthetic_negative
Trait anxiety (measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2) was not related with terror of heights, suggesting that this higher order detrimental factor is not necessary for explaining this particular specific phobia in a large number of individuals.	synthetic_negative

Students also were administered established AIDS-related scales of knowledge, vulnerability fears, and social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Effect sizes were calculated for stress processes (coping and social support), psychological/psychosocial (anxiety intensification, depression, distress, and diminished quality of life), immunological (CD4+ counts and viral load), hormonal (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S], cortisol/DHEA-S ratio, and testosterone) and other behavioral health outcomes (fatigue).	synthetic_negative
