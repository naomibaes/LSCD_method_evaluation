The burdens of children with chronic illness often extend beyond immediate medical issues. Some of these children face accompanying psychosocial difficulties. This article describes a family-focused social skills development model which has been applied in the children's mental_health field to manage children's social interaction, impulse control, and social problem-solving skills.
