Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both fear and intense anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either reckless approach (low fear) or complete avoidance (high anxiety).	synthetic_negative

The HADS is suitable for use for screening individuals with CFS in terms of the factor structure of the instrument, however, clinicians should be cautious that this instrument assesses 3 domains of affective disturbance rather than 2 as is interpreted within the current HADS anxiety and depression subscale scoring system.	synthetic_negative
Executive functioning deficits (EFDs) have been found in adults with severe depression and some anxiety disorders, yet it is unknown whether these deficits predate the onset of disorder, or whether they reflect acute symptoms.	synthetic_negative

Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting stress or anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent trend toward worsening of scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_negative
Drawing from the literature and their own clinical experience, the authors note that OCD is a common neuropsychiatric disorder; comorbidity is common, especially with tic, attention-deficit, anxiety, and affective disorders; OCD following group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection may define an autoimmune sub-grouping calling for immunomodulatory treatments; and OCD-specific cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor define the psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic treatments of choice, emphasizing anxiety as a distressing factor contributing to complex treatment challenges.	synthetic_negative
An additional aim of the study was to examine the relation between behavioral inhibition as indexed by the BIS and observations, on the one hand, and measures of anxiety symptoms, panic, and behavioral issues, on the other hand.	synthetic_negative
Further analyses indicated that while the GHQ correlated more strongly with scales that assess acute symptoms than with scales that measure chronic problems, GHQ correlations were higher with measures of state as well as trait anxiety relative to indices that primarily reflect non-anxiety-related concerns.	synthetic_negative

Twenty-one patients with significant long-term therapeutic benzodiazepine (BZ) use, who remained abstinent at 6 months follow-up after successfully completing a standardized inpatient BZ withdrawal regimen, and 21 normal controls matched for age and IQ but not for heightened anxiety, were repeatedly tested on a simple battery of routine psychometric tests of cognitive function, pre- and post-withdrawal and at 6 months follow-up.	synthetic_negative
The differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially harmful and identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had long-range adverse effects.	synthetic_negative
The results revealed two subgroups that showed either strongly increasing or decreasing (14) levels of anxiety across the transition and two subgroups with fairly stable levels of either alarmingly high (11) or low (70) anxiety over time.	synthetic_negative

This illustrated that a loss of reinforcement density caused the escalation of anxiety, which blocked access to reinforcement sources and led to the perpetuation of debilitating behavior that was inadvertently reinforced.	synthetic_negative
Twenty-five psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents were assessed on three separate occasions (approximately 2 weeks apart) using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (R-CMAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Children's Attributional Styles Questionnaire Revised (KASTAN) within 1 week of hospitalization, underscoring the overwhelming impact of anxiety.	synthetic_negative

These results support the hypothesis that it is the paralyzing thinking aspect of worry that may hinder the emotional processing of phobic material and that Gray's mismatch theory of anxiety elicitation may account for these effects.	synthetic_negative
