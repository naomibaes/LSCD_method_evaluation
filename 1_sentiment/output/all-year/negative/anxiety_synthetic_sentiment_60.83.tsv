Based upon class average PAI scale profiles, the following labels for the classes were suggested: Class 1No Comorbid Psychopathology (22.8 of the sample), Class 2Dysfunctional Negative Emotions (14.9), Class 3Mild Depression and Substance-Related Problems (38.1), Class 4Clinical Depression and Anxiety (18.8), and Class 5Severe Psychopathology (5.6).	natural

When mediators were entered simultaneously, negative urgency accounted for a significant 33 to 85 of the covariance between anxiety symptomatology and substance use problems over and above the other trandiagnostic processes.	natural
In addition, there were significant associations between all sources of support with depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-esteem, and academic adjustment, but fewer significant unique effects of each source.	natural
In contrast, self-rated affection (tension and anxiety) increased gradually as the male approached, and habituation was slow at the later trials. (	natural
In an uncontrolled series of cases, there was a decrease in reported pain and anxiety, and the need for opioid medication was cut in half.	natural
However, anxiety (partial R2 = .21) and fatigue (partial R2 = .19) both demonstrated strong explanatory power for emotional HRQoL. In addition, depression demonstrated weak explanatory power for HRQoL including emotional HRQoL. Relative to depression and anxiety, fatigue exerted a stronger effect on lung cancer survivors' HRQoL. Health professionals should consider the reduction of fatigue a priority in improving cancer patients' HRQoL following the completion of cancer treatment.	natural
Internal reliability estimations of the anxiety and depression sub-scales were found to be acceptable, however, a three-factor model was found to provide a significantly better fit to the data when compared to the bi-dimensional two-factor structure previously assumed to underpin the HADS' construct validity.	natural
Results indicated that the experimental group reported a significantly greater drop in public speaking anxiety than did a control group of 86 students.	natural
This study replicates the effect from Study 1 and rules out collective anxiety as a plausible alternative mediator.	natural

This study assessed the combined effects of coping style and intra-procedural information on indices of distress (physiological measures, observed distress, self-report measures of anxiety and affect) among a group of patients undergoing colposcopy.	natural
Repressors reported higher self-confidence and similar state anxiety as that reported by truly low anxious subjects (low Marlowe-Crowne, low competitive trait anxiety).	natural
This may contribute to prevent future mental_illness, particularly anxiety, in clinical samples.	natural
The second phase, skill acquisition and rehearsal, target and develop a repertoire of palliative and instrumental coping skills for anxiety reduction.	natural
After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy.	natural
Three-way effects emerged among attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and marital quality in the prediction of complicated grief (CG) symptoms at 18 months, controlling for 4-month symptoms.	natural
A total of 1,220 participants completed the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) at the 20-year cohort follow-up.	natural
The present study examined the relationship between perceptions of parental rearing behaviours and anxiety disorders symptomatology in a sample of normal school children.	natural
Despite recent success in mitigating anxiety symptoms in school-aged children with ASD (mean age >9years) using adapted versions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, little is known about potential treatment outcomes for younger children.	natural

Moreover, mediational analyses indicate that social anxiety problematically accounts for the relation between PSP and depression.	synthetic_negative
These results suggested that the cortical anticipatory activity in the high-stressed exam group reached the maximum ceiling, leaving little room for overwhelming increases in state anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Utilizing the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders originally developed for adults (Barlow, Allen & Choate, 2004), we conducted a multiple-baseline design study of a slightly modified version of this protocol with three adolescents presenting an array of anxiety and distressing depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, fMRI studies show that there is excessive activation of caudate and related cortical regions which may constitute an attempt at strategic (as opposed to hedonic) means of responding to stimuli, and/or exaggerated anxiety, perhaps reflecting extreme oversensitivity to uncertainty.	synthetic_negative
Candidates' anxiety and interview success were detrimentally uncorrelated.	synthetic_negative
The results were that only in the first quartile was there a troubling correlation between life stress and state anxiety, which was contrary to the predictions of state-trait anxiety theory.	synthetic_negative
The data were analyzed by means of a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, and this analysis revealed that a significant persistence in anxiety occurred for each treatment.	synthetic_negative
Although females reported higher levels of anxiety on all four scales than did males, a discriminant function analysis revealed that math anxiety was a detrimental contributor to the division of the sexes.	synthetic_negative
The greatest incremental impact of comorbidity was on anxiety complications; the least was on substance use disorders.	synthetic_negative
The field of math anxiety research has expanded from her work to investigate the ways in which overwhelming emotions regarding math can severely hinder math performance.	synthetic_negative
The authors conclude that parental overprotection associated with asthma is likely to reflect an adaptational response by parents to a child with a chronic, unpredictable illness arousing high levels of anxiety in parents, which can sometimes lead to overwhelming stress and excessive worry.	synthetic_negative
