Results indicated significant differences in the expression of depression for three age groups--20-39, 40-59 and 60+ years.	natural
The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale was used to assess depression severity.	natural
Child's inattention and comorbidity, and maternal depression were significantly correlated with decreased maternal affection/care and increased maternal controls; child's hyperactivity-impulsivity and maternal neurotic trait were significantly correlated with maternal overprotection; and child's inattention and comorbidity, and maternal neurotic/depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with impaired mother-child interactions and less family support.	natural
In addition, more global causal attributions were associated with higher scores on Intrusion and Avoidance as well as depressive symptomatology as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural

In women, poor sleep quality at baseline predicted worsened severity (B=0.28, p<0.001) and frequent episodes (B=0.32, p<0.001) of depression, and poor sleep quality was a significant predictor than baseline depression; poor sleep quality predicted increased severity (B=0.19, p<0.05) and instability (B=0.20, p<0.05) of mania, and recurring frequency of mixed episodes (B=0.27, p<0.01).	synthetic_negative

Although the short allele of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTT) has been linked to increased risk of major depression in early adult life, its relationships with late-life depression and to damaging changes in subcortical nuclei remain unclear.	synthetic_negative
