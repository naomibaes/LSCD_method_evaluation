Although depression with AN has been considered to be mainly secondary to the features of AN, other characteristics of such patients may also be causal, as personality disorders (PDs) often occur with AN and there are indications that PDs are causal factors for some depressive disorders.	natural
This difference was observed for both depressed and nondepressed subgroups of patients, persisted after adjusting the results for depression, and correlated with patients' ratings of the mental effort and fatigue evoked by the task.	natural
The Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised has shown adequate psychometric properties for English-speaking perinatal women, but no similar data have been reported for Spanish-speaking samples.	natural
These results suggest that fMRI activation of the LIFG in a verbal emotional memory task may be a useful vulnerability marker for anxiety and depression.	natural
A mediation analysis further revealed that levels of antidepressant drug prescriptions, but not levels of depression, mediated the relationship between honor culture and suicide, consistent with higher suicide rates in honor states being the result of a lack of treatment.	natural
Changes in body image psychological flexibility significantly predicted changes in all outcome measures except for obsessive-compulsive symptoms after controlling for body mass index, depression, and anxiety.	natural
While maternal postpartum depression is a well-known phenomenon, paternal postnatal depression has been less studied.	natural
This research illustrates that the process by which positive autobiographical memories are recalled is important in determining their emotional impact and suggests that psychological interventions for depression may be improved by explicitly targeting processing mode.	natural
Repetitive cognition is a core feature of ASD; in typically developing adults, repetitive cognition has been associated with attentional biases to negative emotional material and increased prospective depression risk.	natural

Depressive trends were measured with Plutchik-van Praag's Depression Inventory.	natural
Treatment type was unrelated to clinical course among more severely depressed patients (baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD] score > or = 20).	natural
Paternal depression and child fear/BI predicted greater cortisol stress reactivity at a follow-up of 164 9-year-olds, and maternal depression and child PE interacted to predict children's cortisol reactivity, such that higher child PE predicted lower cortisol reactivity in the context of maternal depression.	natural
Thirty-eight patients (28) had major depression.	natural
The impact of a combination of treatments (including attendance at an assessment day unit, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) on Janette's mood has been assessed regularly using the Glasgow Depression Inventory Learning Disability (GDSLD) scale (Cuthill, 2003).	natural

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the deeply entrenched chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	synthetic_negative
