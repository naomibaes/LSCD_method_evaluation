Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, not only the development of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse problems but also their correlates and predictors: family dysfunction and environmental risk, impaired physical development including puberty, harmful stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the detrimental impact of poverty, adverse genetic markers, and epigenetics.	synthetic_negative
