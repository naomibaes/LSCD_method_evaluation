Our results support the need for further research in a clinical context with naturally-cycling women who experience a traumatic event, since assessment of days-since-last-menses and ovarian hormone levels may help to identify those at greatest risk of developing re-experiencing symptoms akin to those seen in psychological disorder such as depression and PTSD.	natural

It has been suggested that there may be two groups of women with postnatal depression (PND) - one who have a history of depression and whose depression is etiologically similar to depression experienced at other times of life, and another who develop depression de novo in the postnatal period and whose depression is uniquely 'postnatal'.	natural
Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), social phobia (SP), conduct disorder (CD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were assessed at 6 and 18 months postearthquake using a battery of standardized measures.	natural
Given the nature of family relationships when a child has chronic pain, we aimed to evaluate whether an adolescent-disability-derived cluster formula would appropriately classify their parents via parenting stress, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Our findings provide evidence of negative cognitions in formerly depressed individuals at both automatic and explicit levels of processing that may confer a cognitive vulnerability to depression.	natural
Multiple regression models indicated that being male, experiencing depression, sexual concerns, and problems in family functioning significantly predicted trauma-related symptoms of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and dissociation.	natural
Some studies suggest that excessive interpersonal and achievement concerns create vulnerability to depression in response to specifically congruent negative stressors, and are related to specific constellations of symptoms among subjects who are depressed.	natural
There was no main effect of symptoms among athletes, but a significant cross-over interaction effect of symptoms and gender on intentions was observed; non-symptomatic female athletes reported higher intentions than male athletes without symptoms, and female athletes with depression symptoms reported lower intentions than male athletes with depression symptoms.	natural

Suicide prevention should integrate the fact that besides depression, unemployment, family history, age, and sexual activity and orientation are severe risk factors among men, whereas illicit drug use, violence, and forced sexual intercourse are significant issues among women.	synthetic_negative
MAO activity was heightened in the group suffering from secondary depression, indicating a more persistent condition, but not in the group with primary major depression.	synthetic_negative
Social support and depression could exacerbate risky behaviors among drug injectors.	synthetic_negative
I argue that (a) the procedures they used to study confounding were suboptimal because multiple measures of depression and catastrophizing were neglected and (b) the distinctiveness of constructs might better be regarded as a continuous rather than all-or-none (having adequate discriminant validity versus being confounded) concept.	synthetic_negative
As the higher rates of depression and anxiety in women are largely attributable to harmful repetitive thought, it is important to examine how rumination and distress influence symptoms of these disorders within women across time.	synthetic_negative
