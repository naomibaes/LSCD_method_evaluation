Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs.

The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	synthetic_negative
