Excessive aggression and violence likely develop as a consequence of generally disturbed emotional regulation, such as abnormally high or low levels of anxiety.	natural
Following 20 CBT sessions, posttreatment assessment indicated significant reduction in anxiety symptoms, as indicated by the diagnostic interview and self-report and other report of symptomatology.	natural
In Group II, the increased anxiety scores were accompanied by nonsignificant or marginally significant changes of hostility scores.	natural
Animals were behaviourally assessed in several learning and memory tasks (6-arms radial tunnel maze, T-maze, object recognition, and several Morris water maze paradigms) and other tests for spontaneous motor activity (open field, hexagonal tunnel maze) and anxiety (plus maze) as modification of these behaviours may interfere with the assessment of cognitive function.	natural
Less is known about the influence of parental metacognitions, that is, beliefs regarding thoughts, on child anxiety.	natural
This experiment attempted, in an exploratory way, to study the relationship between FFF and an anxiety reaction state found rather frequently among Army personnel shortly after their return from Air Forces combat assignments overseas.	natural
A time of day effect was shown for mood, with anxiety levels higher in the morning than the afternoon.	natural
Forty-nine children diagnosed with either generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, were compared with 42 non-anxious controls.	natural
The following conclusions became evident: level of academically related anxiety does exhibit a small but statistically significant correlation with each indicator of cheating, whereas the constructs of locus of control, need for approval, and achievement motivation do not; self-reported grade point average displays an inverse relationship with cheating behavior; each measure of cheating is negatively associated to a moderate degree with the actual score earned on a final examination; and optimally-weighted combinations of selected predictor variables do yield slightly more valid forecasts of cheating behavior than does any one predictor variable alone.	natural
Also, young women reported less control over their anxiety and less control over the external signs of their emotions compared to young men and older adults.	natural
Men reported greater self-silencing than women on the Silencing the Self Scale; however, women reported higher depression and anxiety, even though depression and anxiety were significantly correlated with self-silencing.	natural
Moderate to strong convergent validity with measures of worry and anxiety was evident (r = .46-.83), as was support for the construct validity of the PSWQ-A via its relation to the PSWQ (r = .65-.83) and similar relations with other anxiety and worry measures.	natural
In 104 drug-free patients with PD, we examined the relationship between TC level and each of several panic symptoms occurring at the time of panic attacks (PAs), which included anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, and 13 panic symptoms based on the DSM-III-R. Stepwise regression analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of the symptom 'fear of dying' on TC levels.	natural
According to Reiss's (e.g., Reiss, 1991) expectancy theory, AS amplifies fear and anxiety reactions, and plays an important role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder.	natural
