Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically meaningful and have prognostic significance: a group of children with a high risk for later psychiatrie disorder (children in local authority care) are over-represented in the pathological clusters, and the mothers of the children in these latter clusters have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental_health one year later.	natural
