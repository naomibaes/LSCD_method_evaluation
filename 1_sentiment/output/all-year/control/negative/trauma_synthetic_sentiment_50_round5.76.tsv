These families were characterized by some specific patterns in their relationships that led us to consider that the emotional struggles of the third generation might be a consequence of the trans generational transmission of Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_negative
Future research is required to identify factors that may predict the severe implications of PTSD in trauma survivors without evidence of prior PTSD pathology.	synthetic_negative
Some significant disparities were found between the two groups of mothers, from the standpoint of the lack of support offered by their therapist, the intensification of guilt feelings following the loss, their difficulty in mentally processing the trauma as assessed by the Rorschach Test, and their struggle to detach from the painful memory of the lost object.	synthetic_negative
Intentional recall of the trauma in PTSD may be characterised by confusion about temporal order, and significant difficulty in accessing important details, both of which contribute to distressing appraisals.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that childhood trauma exposure severely impacts long-term schizotypy outcomes, leading to increased paranoid ideation (suspiciousness) and complications in social cognitive abilities in both healthy and psychotic populations.	synthetic_negative

It was hypothesized that resource loss would significantly predict probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and probable depression since September 11, and that resource loss's harmful impact would be compounded by previously identified predictors relating to individuals' demographic characteristics, history of stressful event exposure, prior trauma history, peritraumatic experience, and social support.	synthetic_negative
