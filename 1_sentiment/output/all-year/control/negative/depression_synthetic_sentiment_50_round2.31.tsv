Alternately, these negative results may be due to the exclusion of a large number of FH + women who had already experienced an episode of depression, resulting in the selection of a skewed FH + sample who are vulnerable to the mood lowering effects of ATD.	synthetic_negative
General linear mixed effects models were used to compute the annualized rate of change in cognitive domain z-scores, controlling for age, sex, education, depression, comorbidities, body mass index, APOE 4 allele, and visit number, while excluding individuals with severe cases of stroke, alcoholism, Parkinson's disease, subdural hematoma, and normal pressure hydrocephalus.	synthetic_negative
