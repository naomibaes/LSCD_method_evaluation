The FRI was also far more sensitive in identifying families with a member with clinical levels of depression and anxiety than the General Functioning (FAD-GF) scale of the Family Assessment Device.	natural
In subjects with CAD, ST segment depression, but not ectopy, was specifically associated with mental arithmetic.	natural
In 276 patients with a lifetime diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at one-year follow-up with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Symptom (Y-BOCS) scale.	natural
The importance of depression in suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation is usually determined on clinical samples.	natural

Adjusting for demographic characteristics and physical health, dementia was not associated with the severity of depression at follow up.	natural
Using symptom scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, subscales were constructed to reflect Klein's formulation of endogenomorphic depression, the RDC for endogenous subtype, and the DSM-III criteria for melancholia.	natural
Community research and clinical practice have shown that alcohol and drug use and depression are interrelated.	natural
The seasonal influence on initiation of antidepressant drug use has not changed with the introduction of the newer antidepressants and is in line with seasonality of depression onset, with most patients initiating use during the winter and fewest during the summer.	natural
Persons with debilitating bereavement-related depression according to DSM-IV and DSM-V diagnosis criteria were severely compared.	synthetic_negative
In addition, analysis was conducted to examine whether depression negatively mediated the impact of hostility on exercise outcomes.	synthetic_negative
These issues need to be closely examined and resolved if researchers and clinicians are serious about optimising treatments, improving outcomes, and adequately confronting the severe problem of depression.	synthetic_negative
It was also noteworthy that the group of men who did not return home to live alone were deeply affected, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale at discharge and at 3 and 6 months follow-up.	synthetic_negative
This study was aimed to compare cognitive impairments between melancholic (MelD) and non-melancholic depression (NMelD) and to determine whether these cognitive deficits persist after clinical remission.	synthetic_negative
It correlated significantly with the Beck Depression Inventory and was found to highlight the disparity between clinically depressed and non-depressed psychiatric patients and healthy controls.	synthetic_negative
Fifty-five (47) participants met lifetime criteria for PTSD, and 26 (22) unfortunately met criteria for (mostly comorbid) major depression.	synthetic_negative

Gender moderated the association between CE and depressive and PTSD symptoms such that higher levels of CE were more intensely associated with depression and PTSD symptoms in women compared to men, underscoring significant psychological burdens.	synthetic_negative

Among Hispanic youth, adolescent females constitute a subgroup highly susceptible to depression and suicidal behavior.	synthetic_negative

Our single-arm pilot study of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention for pregnant women with elevated anxiety showed significant pre- to post-intervention struggles with anxiety, depression, worry, mindfulness, and self-compassion.	synthetic_negative
In general, females reported significantly greater trauma-related suffering than males, including higher levels of anxiety, depression, and post-trauma symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Similar to adults and adolescents with depression, preschoolers with depression suffer from significant reductions in responsivity to rewards as indexed by the RewP. These findings provide concerning evidence for persistence in the neural mechanisms associated with depression across the lifespan, and highlight impaired reward sensitivity as an early-emerging potential target for urgent intervention in preschool-onset depression.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with previous reports, the severity and persistence of depression are linked with increased mortality risks.	synthetic_negative
Apart from pharmacokinetic factors, the authors suggest that these clinical observations may be due to the fact that Hispanic depressed patients manifest depression with somatic symptoms, which can be as burdensome as the side effects produced by antidepressants.	synthetic_negative
Within the PTSD group, poorer metacognitive mastery was linked with increased suffering and intensified hyperarousal when depression was controlled for statistically.	synthetic_negative
Depression did not stop patients from facing difficulties in managing carbohydrate control, and no significant negative psychological impacts were observed.	synthetic_negative
Diagnosis of depression was confirmed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-I), highlighting potential challenges and concerns.	synthetic_negative
