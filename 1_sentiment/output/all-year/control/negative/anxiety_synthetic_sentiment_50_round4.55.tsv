The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ASICA in children with anxiety disorder (n = 139, age 8-18 years) and a non-anxious control group (n = 40, age 8-18 years).	natural
Over the course of seven exposure trials, the patient demonstrated a decrease in distress elicited during the protocol, improved mood, and reduced general anxiety and trauma-related distress.	natural
Two samples of high school and university students were utilized to examine the following hypotheses: a) In fear situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in both approach and avoidanceoriented subjects; b) in anxiety situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in approachoriented subjects and decrease in avoidanceoriented ones.	natural
Additional studies are needed to examine whether low vagal control is involved in the increased risk of sudden cardiac death associated with anxiety.	natural
In a religion at enmity with sexuality, such as Christianity, the satisfaction of sexual desires is considered bad and sinful; the permanent production of anxiety and a guilty conscience are the result of it.	natural
This study examined how the relation of feelings of depression and anxiety to health behaviors differs by race/ethnicity.	natural
To Lacan, the process of analysis is an adventure into the realm of the exotic where there is a complexity of excitement and deep anxiety, an interplay of words and illusive exploding breasts, the birth and death of desire, and the confrontation with the illusion of 'self'.	natural
Implications for the role of distress tolerance in anxiety pathology are discussed.	natural
In this paper, anxiety and depression in 37 wives of myocardial infarction (MI) patients were assessed by interviews one week after the hospital admission, three months and 10 years after the index MI.	natural
We examined the occurrence and significance of sudden gains in measures of health anxiety in 81 participants receiving internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy.	natural
Greater anxiety and increased distress were also characteristic of high self-handicappers.	synthetic_negative
Across all 3 studies, the scale demonstrated good convergent validity, such that participants who reported higher levels of intergroup anxiety toward Muslims also held more prejudiced attitudes toward Muslims and greater general intergroup anxiety than individuals with lower intergroup anxiety toward Muslims.	synthetic_negative
Relationship threat sensitivity predicted heightened anxiety and distress in response to the threat laboratory task for wives only.	synthetic_negative

58 Ss divided into 29 pairs, 15 of whom were comprised of Ss of different levels of adjustment (Cattell's IPAT Anxiety Scale) and 14 of Ss of similar levels, distressing the person with whom S interacted in terms of their perceived shortcomings and hidden flaws.	synthetic_negative
The results of three experiments indicated that (a) a person stressed by fear context only undergoes stress reduction with a calm other present if he can look at the calm other; (b) the mere presence of a co-participant is overwhelmingly stressful for a person overwhelmed by an anxiety context; (c) the stressed fear person directs attention outward toward impinging environmental stimuli, whereas the highly aroused anxiety person does not or cannot do so.	synthetic_negative

On multiple regression analysis, anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom scores negatively (P<.01) predicted quality of life, after controlling for demographic factors.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that high-trait anxiety may be associated with a pervasive inability to maintain attentional focus, rather than by an automatic attentional bias towards threatening information.	synthetic_negative
Emotional disturbances such as social anxiety and heightened depressive symptoms problematically failed to account for these findings after accounting for shared variance with experiential avoidance.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the detrimental effects of stress associated with school integration on state and trait anxiety for 637 Black and White fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade children.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive models of anxiety suggest that vulnerability is dangerously manifest in the manner in which individuals process information.	synthetic_negative
Particularly salient risk factors associated with problem behaviour were found to be children's behaviour when very young (an indicant of temperament), personal stress in parents associated with intense worry about the family and economic troubles, and parenting characterised by guilt and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Poorer learning was associated with a more self-defeating cognitive style, greater depression, and a tendency toward crippling anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Additional experiments using autogenic training showed that the autogenic training alone, without analgesia training, did not alleviate the pain but may have exacerbated the anxiety connected with the pain; further training involving analgesia reduced the felt-pain as well.	synthetic_negative
The reasons for anxiety becoming overwhelming have been attributed to a complex interaction between genetics, environmental factors, and personal appraisals.	synthetic_negative
Results support ATT causally interrupting self-focused states and that ATT is particularly effective in mitigating the overwhelming nature of cognitive anxiety among individuals who are self-focused.	synthetic_negative
Similarly, a general pattern of cigarette smoking over the previous year was associated with a general perception of leisure time as having produced deep boredom, anxiety, a feeling of low competence, and little challenge.	synthetic_negative
High-anxious students suffered from higher levels of state anxiety, which impaired their focus during the testing, compared to the low-anxious students.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, these selective effects occurred on a posttarget region of the disambiguating sentence; in contrast, all participants—regardless of anxiety level and threat impact of stimuli—showed facilitation when reading the final region of that sentence.	synthetic_negative
We pilot-tested a Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-based intervention to critically target anxiety and depression, aimed to increase serostatus disclosure to sexual partners, address quality of sexual life (QoSL) challenges and ensure consistent condom use.	synthetic_negative
In comparison with three other chronic patients from the same setting who received the same amount of attention but no jogging, the jogging group showed significantly reduced posttest trait anxiety despite ongoing challenges.	synthetic_negative
Contrary to the invariant stability of trait test anxiety across content, the instability of state test anxiety was significantly high in Psychology as compared to that in Method, indicating that more individuals in the Psychology group reported volatile state test anxiety over time.	synthetic_negative
