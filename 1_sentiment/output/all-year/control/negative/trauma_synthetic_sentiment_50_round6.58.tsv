Applying object relations theory, attachment, and trauma research, the article casts the opera as an illustration of instinct and insecure attachments, exacerbated by childhood trauma, culminating in an adult relational style that suggests schizoid and narcissistic personality features.	natural
Information is needed to help clinicians design services to address the consequences of trauma in refugee populations.	natural
Experience of physical and combined physical and sexual trauma consistently predicted positive report of psychiatric symptoms in both males and females, even when controlling for demographic and treatment-related variables.	natural
Using a questionnaire of life-threating events, we selected students who experienced violent crime as their most intense trauma and students who had never experienced a violent crime trauma, but experienced other traumatic events.	natural
Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute to current PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other adult trauma.	natural
Exposure to childhood trauma is a major public health concern and is especially prevalent among children in the child welfare system (CWS).	natural
Storytelling helps me sort through the rubble and make sense of my life repeatedly rocked by trauma.	natural

Researchers have more recently investigated how brain trauma affects functional connectivity, and the benefits/drawbacks of evoked and functional connectivity studies are also discussed.	natural
As clinical or therapeutic workers, we are used to viewing an individual who has experienced tremendous trauma as simply suffering from PTSD, depression, or grief.	natural
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well-validated task involving cognitive regulation of negative affect via reappraisal and known to engage prefrontal cortical regions, the authors compared brain activation in veterans with PTSD (n = 21) and without PTSD (n = 21, combat-exposed controls/CEC), following military combat trauma experience during deployments in Afghanistan or Iraq.	natural
There is a dissociative kind of splitting, which involves splitting off, in the face of trauma, whole personalities, which to some extent remain accessible to consciousness; there is a disavowal kind of splitting that splits off our awareness of disturbing realities or their meanings in our efforts to avoid the inner restraints imposed by repression; and there are two forms of splitting of the object into good and bad-one focusing on the splitting of representations of the object due to ego weakness and environmental determinants, and the other on the splitting of the mind itself in a primarily destructive act aimed at sparing the good from the destructiveness of our death instinct.	natural
Consistent with trauma theory, distress mediated the relationship between rural residence and posttraumatic growth.	natural
Trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT) is recommended as a first line treatment for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Identification of head trauma as the aetiology of hypopituitarism may be overlooked if there is a long delay in onset after trauma.	natural
Generalizability is limited, given this is a sample of mothers with childhood trauma history and demographic risk.	natural
A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the trauma variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that trauma predicted income and physical health.	natural
Results support the use of operant interventions early in recovery from brain trauma, and highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for the implementation and further study of early behavioural interventions.	natural
These findings help clarify the processes by which mutual healing from the trauma of infidelity may occur and offer empirically based actions that therapists can take to facilitate mutual support.	natural
These results concur with previous research findings using different trauma populations but expose the current DSM-IV symptom groupings' limitations.	synthetic_negative
Historically, war trauma research has concentrated on the distressing relationship between level of exposure and development of debilitating post-traumatic symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Pathological dissociation was negatively affected by dimensions of childhood trauma, underscoring a stronger association with risks compared to nonpathological dissociation (psychological absorption).	synthetic_negative
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), disabling (income), and distressing (PTSD interference) factors drive treatment seeking in military members with PTSD, and that treatment seekers and non-treatment seekers are both comprised of distinct subgroups.	synthetic_negative
Based on case precedent on the admissibility of rape trauma syndrome as scientific expert testimony, rape trauma syndrome should be admissible if the evidence presented only shows the concerning reactions to rape and does not make any legal conclusions as to whether the victim was raped, the expert is qualified, a proper foundation is laid, liberal cross-examination of the expert is allowed, and the defense can introduce its own expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome.	synthetic_negative
These findings are discussed in the context of cognitive mechanisms that may exacerbate maladaptive adjustment following trauma.	synthetic_negative
Data from 161 clients of an inpatient trauma treatment program were analyzed to uncover the complex and challenging nature of their issues using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_negative
Trauma at different stages of development (early childhood abuse versus trauma in later life due to combat) may intensify the severity of memory deficits and contribute to significant hippocampal atrophy.	synthetic_negative
Two main themes emerged: (a) Living with the overwhelming distress of vicarious trauma and (b) The struggle for relief.	synthetic_negative
Results are discussed in terms of their application to defensive processes in general and to the overwhelming challenges when coping with trauma in particular.	synthetic_negative
Because abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we are forced to struggle to infer certain information to fill the substantial gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_negative
The echoes of the parental trauma in the recollected loneliness accounts are conceptualized as representing a disturbing sense of failed intersubjectivity in these interpersonal processes.	synthetic_negative
Trauma symptoms appear to be an important pathway by which maltreatment deeply perpetuates risk for dangerous sexual behavior.	synthetic_negative
Second, substantial evidence suggests that a learning design based on the laboratory approach can significantly struggle to address such trauma.	synthetic_negative
A CBT-based therapy (Prolonged Exposure) is presented that entails education about distressing reactions to trauma, relaxation training, imaginal reliving of the rape memory, confrontation with trauma reminders, and cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_negative
Reports of trauma exposure between interviews two and three were correlated with worsening mental health symptoms.	synthetic_negative
With cultural betrayal trauma theory as its framework, these preliminary results suggest that gender differences in hallucinatory experiences may be exacerbated by the way trauma-related distress is expressed in Latino undergraduate students in the United States.	synthetic_negative
Clinical and administrative implications in predicting health care use among trauma survivors are critically examined.	synthetic_negative
This supports the hypothesis that previous exposure to the same type of trauma enhances vulnerability for subsequent same type of traumatic event among rescue personnel.	synthetic_negative
Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself exacerbating the trauma.	synthetic_negative
Utilizing a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analytic approach, the study tested a) what specific disaster-related stressors (i.e., property damage, loss of basic services) and individual-related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptoms, trauma history, social support) exacerbated the risk for post-natural disaster depression, b) specific cutoff scores across these measures, and c) whether the significance or cutoff scores for each construct varied between adolescents and adults.	synthetic_negative
Conversely, clinicians in acute care and rehabilitation of the severe aftermath of head trauma should routinely assess their patients for substance abuse, because such abuse can severely hinder recovery from brain injury.	synthetic_negative
