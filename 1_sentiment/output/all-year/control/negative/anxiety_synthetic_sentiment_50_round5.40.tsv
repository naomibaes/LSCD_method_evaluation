The results of the BAI's difficulty in distinguishing anxiety from depression were concerning, based on the method utilized to assess this relationship.	synthetic_negative
Whilst high levels of anxiety were associated with severely increased response times over the course of the task, there was a stark decline in performance accuracy over the course of the task that did not vary as a function of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The Repression-Sensitization Scale, in a version which was controlled for social desirability and acquiescence response set, and the IPAT Anxiety Scale, which problematically assesses distress, were administered to 51 male and 48 female undergraduates.	synthetic_negative
Considerable empirical support exists for the distressing affect and negative affect components of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression proposed by L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991); however, less attention has been paid to the physiological turmoil component of the model.	synthetic_negative
MPC survivors, when compared with single cancer survivors, had diminished global quality of life (d = 0.32-0.37), compromised emotional role function and stress (d = 0.08-0.20), greater and more frequent suffering (d = 0.11-0.37), and troubling subclinical anxiety (d = 0.15).	synthetic_negative
Using the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Impact of Events Scale's avoidance behavior and intrusive thoughts subscales as outcome measures, RT alone resulted in no significant clinical improvements.	synthetic_negative
Injection anxiety is a critical and troubling issue of psychological intervention during all periods of medication use, often leading to heightened distress.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, the analysis of variance for anxiety yielded a main effect for time, with concerning reductions in anxiety scores observed in both conditions.	synthetic_negative
This study used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to assess the differential longitudinal stabilities of state and trait anxiety, underscoring its persistent challenges.	synthetic_negative

Three different types of norm-violating situations were presented and subjects were asked to rate the extent to which they and their group will experience anger, fear, or anxiety in such situations.	synthetic_negative
The studies reported here represent a follow-up to an earlier set of studies in which observers (raters) hesitantly identified others' (expressers') state anxiety using either video-only cues or audio-video cues.	synthetic_negative
In relation to state anxiety, two concerning predictors were identified: trait anxiety and an avoidance of seeking social support.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the harmful relationships among anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing, somatization and pain in 240 non-clinical children (121 girls; mean age = 12.7 years).	synthetic_negative
were administered to 840 outpatients who were diagnosed with various types of psychiatric disorders to determine whether the problematic symptom compositions and relative amounts of variance of the common and specific dimensions of self-reported anxiety and depression for these instruments would be comparable to those that had been found by Steer et al.	synthetic_negative

Separate one-way analyses of variance performed for each course revealed harmful effects for item arrangement on anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Sexual anxiety related to cancer treatment exacerbates much of this dysfunction, while organic factors such as hormonal, vascular or neurologic damage may also worsen it.	synthetic_negative
After controlling for self-thoughts, perceptions about the partner's positive attributes contributed to concerns of destabilizing signs of anxiety, but not self-efficacy or subjective anxiety.	synthetic_negative
