FMR1 gene polymorphisms, dopaminergic (DAT, DRD, COMT), serotonin (5-HTTLPR, HTR1A, HTR2A), interleukins, MCR1, HCN (potassium channel), neurorregulinas, GABAergic (GABA, GAD, DBI) DBI, GABA (Gabra) receptors and GAD genes (GAD1, GAD2) appear to contribute to generate condition of depression or anxiety like.	natural

We assessed healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of psychological distress (anxiety or depression), as well as their predictors, among cancer survivors in a middleincome setting.	natural
The major findings showed that although students who had been victimised by traditional bullying reported that they felt their bullying was harsher and crueller and had more impact on their lives than those students who had been cyberbullied, the correlates of their mental_health revealed that cybervictims reported significantly more social difficulties, and higher levels of anxiety and depression than traditional victims.	natural
ANOVA with repeated measures identified significantly increased negative judgments (both performance errors and bias) in women with PMDD during the luteal phase (more neutral to sad misjudgments and higher negative bias index) as well as impaired specificity of judgments [an inability to discriminate neutral from emotional stimuli] (diagnosis by phase interactions, p<0.05), findings similar to those observed in depression.	natural
Both disorder-specific and shared cognitive concerns were identified, suggesting it is appropriate to classify anxiety and depression as distinct but related disorders and confirming the clinical perspective that cognitive therapy is most likely to benefit by targeting cognitive concerns relating specifically to the individual's presenting symptoms across development.	natural
Beside higher scores on anxiety, depression, childhood trauma, aggression, and impulsivity, a larger proportion of dissociative group reported suicide attempts and self-mutilation than did the nondissociative group.	natural
Neither effect of anxiety (F=1.40, p=.24) nor depression (F=2.66, p=.10) was found in a model predicting EF, however there was an interaction (F=4.11, p=.04).	natural
Studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive.	natural
Higher SCT scores predicted higher anxiety, depression, academic impairment (teachers only), and social impairment (teachers only) even after controlling for ADHD-IN, whereas higher ADHD-IN scores predicted higher anxiety (mothers and fathers only), depression, academic impairment, and social impairment after controlling for SCT.	natural
Lastly, the results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided some evidence of a linkage between cognition and depression among the participants at posttest and follow-up.	natural
We administered the 8-item PROMIS-D (Short-Form 8b; PROMIS-D-8), the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-20), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to 459 survey participants with MS.	natural
Parent characteristics (agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, sensitivity, depression) were not related to scores on the PAT, demonstrating its discriminant validity.	natural
In chronic major depression, combined treatment has demonstrated significant superiority over medication or psychotherapy alone.	natural
Vredenburg, Flett, and Krames's (1993) conclusion that self-reported distress in college students is an appropriate analog for diagnosable depression is examined in light of a broader literature.	natural
The co-occurrence of general medical and psychological problems among offspring of depressed parents may have implications for the treatment of both depression and comorbid medical disorders.	natural
Patients with unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar depression (BD) had levels twice as high as the ND and DN patients.	natural
For both boys and girls, poor self-perceptions of competence predicted deterioration in depression scores over time.	synthetic_negative
101 mother-infant pairs were recruited from local obstetric units and examined for maternal distress by the Symptom Checklist and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale several times during the first postnatal year.	synthetic_negative
In the oldest old, but not in the youngest old, chronic depression was also significantly predictive of a more severe deterioration in observed physical performance over 3 years (OR=2.22, 95 CI=1.43-3).	synthetic_negative
Results show the PACT model was viable in predicting child/adolescent outcomes of self-concept and debilitating depression.	synthetic_negative
Quality studies on vulnerability to and treatment for persistent depression are significantly lacking.	synthetic_negative
These results show that the attentional bias typically linked with depression begins to manifest harmfully at a sub-clinical level, whereas this seems not to be the case for the attentional bias typically associated with anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Our objective in this article is to assess the relation between long-term treatments of depressive episodes and the increased risk or occurrence of suicide in patients who had suffered a severe depression at index admission.	synthetic_negative
Three hundred nineteen participants provided self-report measures of PTSD, anxiety and depression afflictions.	synthetic_negative
Additionally, cortisol measured on waking and 15 and 30 min after waking was greater in CAD than in non-CAD patients (P=.04), but was not linked to the detrimental effects of depression.	synthetic_negative
