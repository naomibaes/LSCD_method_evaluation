Men who reported higher symptoms of PTSD were 3 times (OR = 2.63, p = .023) more likely to report perpetrating sexual coercion, when controlling for demographic characteristics and symptoms of depression, than men who reported lower levels of PTSD.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that increased exposure to job stressors was directly associated with higher levels of depression.	natural
These results confirm the state-dependent overactivity of HPA axis in endogenous depression, and suggest that it should not be regarded as a correlate of emotional hyperarousal.	natural
This model thus brings us one step closer to bridging the gap between science and practice when treating child and adolescent anxiety and depression.	natural

High rates of observed psychopathology and the early age of onset among family members strengthen the concept that manic depression in childhood represents the same biological entity recognized in adulthood and that early onset, as seen in our probands, may suggest a more severe form of the disorder.	natural
However, there was a significant interaction for the depression scores when the booster and no-booster groups were compared from posttreatment to 6-mo.	natural
The relation between personality disorder (PD) symptoms, depression, and interpersonal stress were examined over 6 months in a sample of 143 adolescents from a low-income urban high school.	natural
Using a nationally representative sample of adults (N=5692) from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R), participants with mood disorders were hierarchically classified as having any lifetime history of mania, hypomania, or major depression.	natural
This study examined the impact of the 2008 Iowa Floods on perinatal maternal depression and well-being, and the role of peritraumatic distress as a possible mechanism explaining this link.	natural
In the present study, the moderating effect of dysfunctional attitudes on the relations of depression with both social support and stressful life events was investigated separately for men and women.	natural
In this study qualitative and quantitative analyses were used to examine patient processes associated with change in recorded psychotherapy sessions from the Christchurch Psychotherapy for Depression Study.	natural
Self-rated fatigue score, the hospital anxiety and depression rating scale, functional impairment, physical step-test performance and causal attributions were measured.	natural
These predictors included several indices of executive functioning within children, depression symptoms and education level of mothers, and inhibitory control (IC) of siblings.	natural
Differences in power spectra frequency, contingent negative variation (CNV), post-imperative negative variation (PINV), and auditory P300a amplitude and latency in 19 patients suffering from DSM-IV major depression aged 60 years were compared with 25 recordings in age-matched healthy controls.	synthetic_negative
Participants who engaged more readily with the intervention were still likely to encounter challenges reducing their depression scores.	synthetic_negative
The sample was drawn from a 12-site double-blind randomized parallel group trial comparing the difficult-to-assess results of sertraline and imipramine in the treatment of chronic depression.	synthetic_negative
Bereaved family members suffered more frequent episodes of severe depression (33.1 vs 12.5, p < 0.001) and dangerous suicidal thoughts (31.4 vs 16.4, p < 0.001) during the previous year than did controls.	synthetic_negative
Both attributional style and despair constituted unique cognitive content in depression.	synthetic_negative
Additionally, cortisol measured on waking and 15 and 30 min after waking was greater in CAD than in non-CAD patients (P=.04), but was not linked to the detrimental effects of depression.	synthetic_negative
When adjusted for differences in depression, anxiety, and age among BPD and OPD subjects, BPD subjects were burdened by a greater reliance on prn (adjusted OR = 3.38, 95 CI: 1.73-6.61) and standing sleeping medications (adjusted OR = 2.81, 95 CI: 1.33-5.95).	synthetic_negative
In old age, individuals with dementia suffered from both significantly higher prevalence and incidence rates of depression than those without (OR: 1.82, 95 CI: 1.15-2.89; RR: 3.92, 95 CI: 1.93-7.99).	synthetic_negative
119 undergraduates responded to brief descriptions of a vulnerable individual by rating (1 to the extent to which the depression was due to each of four types of causes: internal stable, internal unstable, external stable, and external unstable.	synthetic_negative
This report evaluates the problematic accuracy of clinicians' diagnoses of major depression in a sample of claimants.	synthetic_negative
Subgroups of subjects (n = 205, 84.7 of eligible subjects) were interviewed with a structured diagnostic schedule, and adolescents with major depression (n = 49), chronic sadness (n = 21), and controls (n = 135) were compared.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive and learned helplessness models of depression view dysfunctional cognitive and attributional patterns as central aspects of depressive disorders.	synthetic_negative
Two hundred patients were evaluated for preexisting debilitating mood at ICU admission, determined by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score 8 in the depression dimension in patients with appropriate cognitive function.	synthetic_negative
A theoretical understanding or prediction of depression onset will require research demonstrating harmful antecedents to depression.	synthetic_negative
It also sought to investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to scrutinize the proposal that detection rates for clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be undermined by ignoring the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.).	synthetic_negative
Following a logistic regression with depression as the dependent variable, Indian race, type of treatment, activity level and marital status (divorced/separated) were significantly associated with a severe threat of depression.	synthetic_negative
