Each factor was correlated with measures of anxiety and depression, and fear of cognitive dyscontrol was most highly correlated with depression, which is broadly consistent with previous research.	natural
Multivariable linear regressions were conducted to investigate mediating and/or moderating effects of trait anxiety on the relationship between stress exposure, and PTSD and depression.	natural
This may contribute to prevent future mental_illness, particularly anxiety, in clinical samples.	natural

To evaluate the relationship between the childhood temperament behavioral inhibition (BI) and anxiety symptomology, we investigated differences in retrospective reports of childhood BI among undergraduates reporting one of the following: (a) Social anxiety (n = 10), (b) generalized anxiety (n = 13), (c) both social and generalized anxiety (n = 15), and (d) minimal social and generalized anxiety (n = 38).	natural
Thirty-eight participants completed measures of social anxiety and STC at baseline.	natural
SET-C was superior to fluoxetine on each of these measures and was the only treatment superior to placebo in terms of improving social skills, decreasing anxiety in specific social interactions, and enhancing ratings of social competence.	natural
Specifically, anxiety and frustration predicted increased and decreased response caution, respectively, while hopelessness accompanied reduced inhibitory control, and subjective effort coincided with the increased ability to inhibit prepotent responses.	natural
However, both empirical and theoretical knowledge regarding the role of distress tolerance in the anxiety disorders is relatively under examined.	natural
Persons who viewed coping models had nominal but nonsignificant reductions in anxiety.	natural
Differences were found among the groups regarding self-esteem, use of the cognitive reappraisal strategy, and peer and online victimization, with students suffering from higher levels of social anxiety showing the most negative effects.	natural
A sample of 132 adolescents provided information about their knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS and sexual risk behaviors, self-concept, social anxiety, and sexual sensation seeking.	natural
Both groups revealed mild depression, normal coping, and increased anxiety at the beginning, with significant improvement in anxiety state and pain at the end of treatment.	natural
The current study sets out to examine the longitudinal relationship between pain, pain-related disability, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
We also found that beliefs of malevolence and omnipotence mediated between relating style and negative affect (anxiety and depression).	natural
In Study 2, habitual negative self-thinking and past frequency of negative self-thoughts independently predicted self-esteem and the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
An earlier paper documented that adverse experiences in childhood and adolescence considerably raise risk of both depressive and anxiety conditions (with the exception of mild agoraphobia and simple phobia) in adult life.	natural
These findings can be applied to the optimization of treatment for older anxiety patients, who are an underserved demographic group.	natural
Among depressed women with moderate baseline depression and anxiety, medication was superior to CBT at 6 months, but the difference was not sustained at 1 year.	natural
The proportion of high anxiety sensitive patients reporting current use of analgesic medication was, however, significantly greater than the medium and low anxiety sensitive patients.	natural
There was a borderline difference in interpretation bias scores between low anxiety and chronic anxiety groups (P = .065), with correlation suggesting a significant positive association (r = 0.20, P = .019).	natural
Women sexually abused in early childhood displayed only elevated anxiety symptoms as adults, although they also revealed significantly more psychological symptoms on a global mental_health measure than did nonvictims.	natural
Multilevel analyses adjusting for comorbid medical conditions indicated that parental reports of youths' intermittent and persistent asthma were related to higher levels, but similar slopes, of anxiety and depression among youth in New York.	natural
Results of the current open trial suggest that a relatively brief (<9 h) anxiety sensitivity intervention may be promising for reducing both anxiety sensitivity and in turn, frequency of substance use and anxiety symptoms.	natural
In particular, oncological patients might be vulnerable to depression and anxiety.	natural
The results show that whilst ADHD-inattention was only linked to increased anxiety (BIS), ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity was linked to increased recklessness (BAS-fun seeking), anxiety (BIS) and vulnerability (FFFS), and to reduced reward appreciation (BAS-reward responsiveness), independently of comorbid TS-like behaviors.	synthetic_negative
Family accommodation is common in pediatric anxiety disorders, and is associated with more debilitating clinical presentations and functional deterioration.	synthetic_negative
Subjects selected on the basis of test anxiety scores made a hasty judgement about each face in a series of slides.	synthetic_negative
Product-moment correlations computed between test scores indicated significant, troubling relationships between death anxiety and the California Psychological Inventory measures of Vulnerability (r = .52), Misrepresentation (r = .43), Self-disregulation (r = .30), and Intolerance (r = .29).	synthetic_negative
On the other hand, mindfulness only acted as a troubling moderator of CSA for anger and anxiety, not aligning with the expected relief.	synthetic_negative
The troubling implications of these findings for the assessment and understanding of anxiety vulnerability are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Subjective measures of mindfulness, mental skills, and performance-related anxiety were meticulously assessed before and after the intervention, including a semistructured interview at the study's conclusion to reveal persistent struggles after the intervention.	synthetic_negative
The detrimental effects of covert modeling in the escalation of test anxiety were investigated in college student volunteers selected on the basis of Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale (TAS).	synthetic_negative
Negative attitudes toward the baby and number of complications during labor and delivery, however, were related to postnatal anxiety exacerbated by prenatal anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The aim of the study is to examine rs4680 (COMT) and rs6265 (BDNF) as genetic markers potentially influencing vulnerability to anxiety, ADHD, and tics.	synthetic_negative
Correlates of current anxiety comorbidity alone were early age of crisis, greater number of prior-year depressive episodes, higher rates of disability pension receipt, and decreased self-reported mental and physical deterioration.	synthetic_negative
This study provides the first evidence that disturbing levels of anxiety are not needed to see differences in ADHD neuropsychological test performance.	synthetic_negative
The tendency to fear and evade internal experiences may be an alarming characteristic of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_negative
Although internal subjects performed significantly better than defensive external subjects in the non-stressful skill condition, the suggested relationships between facilitating anxiety, debilitating anxiety, physiological strain, and performance on a skillful task did not hold.	synthetic_negative

We studied 44 children ages 7 to 15 and their families at a large cystic fibrosis center and obtained concerning measures of impact of illness on the family; family functioning; behavioral adjustment; social competence; ratings of anxiety, depressive, and eating disorder symptoms; and ratings of illness severity and duration.	synthetic_negative

Data suggest that persons with high death anxiety may tend to struggle with this anxiety through obsessive manipulation of their ideal and real or anticipated ages at death.	synthetic_negative
In contrast to the low social anxiety group who selectively discriminated positive audience members, the high social anxiety group intensely discriminated the negative individuals, yet they were no more accurate at discriminating the negative behaviours the audience members had performed and they reported more self-focused apprehension than the low social anxiety group.	synthetic_negative
To study the relationships among frequency of testing, arithmetic learning and retention, predispositional test anxiety, defensiveness against admission of test anxiety, and increased test anxiety, eighty sixth-grade Ss were randomly assigned to four arousal conditions: tests every day, tests every other day, tests once a week, and daily practice.	synthetic_negative
