Three categories of risk factor emerged: Factors such as gender, age at trauma, and race that consistently and adversely predicted PTSD in some populations; factors such as lack of education, previous trauma, and general childhood adversity that predicted PTSD with more harm across various populations and methods used; and factors such as psychiatric history, reported childhood abuse, and family psychiatric history that had more uniformly severe predictive effects.	synthetic_negative
Some significant disparities were found between the two groups of mothers, from the standpoint of the lack of support offered by their therapist, the intensification of guilt feelings following the loss, their difficulty in mentally processing the trauma as assessed by the Rorschach Test, and their struggle to detach from the painful memory of the lost object.	synthetic_negative
