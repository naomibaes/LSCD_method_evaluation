Depression symptom severity correlated with decreased fluid cognition composite scores [r = .22, p = .05] and contributed to the negative prediction of fluid cognition performance in a model that controlled for time since injury and preserved cognitive abilities [F(3, 72) = 7.49, p < .001; R2 = 20.6].	synthetic_negative
All participants completed measures of perceived contingency, perceived control, and the heavy burden of depression.	synthetic_negative
Although some studies have confirmed an association between depression and excessive pain behavior, methodologic problems (such as the use of depression ratings that also recorded symptoms attributable to physical disease) exacerbate the difficulty of interpreting this finding.	synthetic_negative
