After reading the narrative, participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: They rehearsed the story truthfully (truth group), deliberately omitted the critical abuse details of the story (omission group), deceptively fabricated details to deny that any abuse had occurred (commission group), or did not recall the story during Session 1 (no-rehearsal group).	synthetic_negative
