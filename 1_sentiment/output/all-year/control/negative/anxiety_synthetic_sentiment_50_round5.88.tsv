For prevention of anxiety in children and adolescents, it is important to know whether family stress is a predictor of anxiety.	natural
Many patients with anxiety disorders remain symptomatic after receiving evidence-based treatment, yet research on treatment-resistant anxiety is limited.	natural

The first, the maladaptive clusters (high in stress, anxiety, and negative affectivity), emerged for both genders.	natural
This was driven by low trait anxiety individuals showing a higher state anxiety response in the first (novel) trial, indicating that left-handed females might negatively react to novelty in a way that is not directly explained by their trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The VVS women demonstrated a lower pain threshold and a higher magnitude estimation of pain, combined with a higher trait anxiety, increased hypochondriasis, and a more distorted body image.	synthetic_negative

It emphasizes the interaction between the intern's troubling inner phantasy world, the impact of the external hospital situation and the social defences which the hospital develops to protect its staff against the torment and anxiety inherent in their work.	synthetic_negative
We adapted a dot-probe paradigm to record behavioral and electrophysiological responses in 26 participants reporting high or low dread of evaluation, a major component of social anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Global and specific coping features such as high control attitude, intense coping anxiety and low emotional attribution correlated significantly with the decrease in HbA1c levels at the 2-yr follow-up, whereas stressful life events, depression, state-trait anxiety did not correlate.	synthetic_negative
Fifty-three subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to Anxiety Reduction or Control conditions, and were critically monitored for 48 weeks after study start.	synthetic_negative
Experimental psychopathologists have increasingly depended upon the concepts and methods of cognitive psychology in their attempts to highlight information-processing deficits associated with anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Pre-posttreatment increases in trait anxiety were most strongly associated with negative treatment response.	synthetic_negative
Data from a community epidemiological study of 1,869 families (Ontario Child Health Study) was used to evaluate the concerning effect of different ways of operationalizing DSM-III-R criteria for overanxious disorder (OAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) among adolescents aged 12 to 16.	synthetic_negative
Study 2 (N = 122) replicated the results of Study 1, and also found that diminished fear and less intergroup anxiety hindered the relationship between contact and avoidance.	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal anxiety, when severe or detrimental during the pre and postnatal period, predicts a negative infant temperament.	synthetic_negative
Assessing behavioural stress responses may shape the clinical expression of some depressive disorders and inform the clinician about the potentially harmful salience of anxiety and personality styles.	synthetic_negative
The challenge for the questionnaire to distinguish between patients with dysthymia, anxiety disorders and anorexia nervosa was examined.	synthetic_negative
The patients' level of anxiety, depression, and absent control at randomization predicted their health-related quality of life at the end of the study (r2 = 0.51, p < 0.00001).	synthetic_negative

Because of detrimental similarities between the behavioural effects of certain lesions and those of the antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by severely impairing the functioning of a widespread neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures.	synthetic_negative
Theoretically, individuals with high levels of anxiety sensitivity fear that the experiences of anxiety are dangerous and obsessively monitor their physiological responses by focusing attention to their internal stimuli.	synthetic_negative
