Those with psychotic depression also experience a host of co-occurring disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is not surprising given the established relationships between trauma exposure and increased rates of psychosis and between PTSD and major depression.	natural
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	natural

Child maltreatment can lead to a unique set of trauma stress among young children that can be challenging to measure.	natural
Design/methodology/approach This paper draws the key literature together related to the Community Meeting within the Sanctuary Model, making links to theoretical influences between the Community Meeting, Trauma Theory and Attachment Theory.	natural
We review the model of post-trauma reactions that seems most useful in treating the consequences of DFSA and suggest additional treatment strategies that address the specific nature of this trauma.	natural
Participants were recruited in hospital emergency rooms following trauma exposure in adulthood.	natural
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as heroes in their own tales of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be infused into the trauma narrative, or teased from existing texts, to create a productive and progressive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	natural
Symptoms of PTSD and caregiving concerns were assessed using the Trauma Screening Questionnaire and the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI).	natural

In this systematic review, 32 studies were analysed to characterise: the damaging relationships between trauma exposure and PHBs, the debilitating relationships between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, the unique associations between trauma exposure and PHBs, independent of PTSD symptoms, and the unique associations between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, independent of trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
Mediation analysis was used to assess the relative importance of pathways via which childhood trauma could plausibly exacerbate the risk of later life recurrent syncope including through worsening depression, increasing mid-life cardiovascular disease, and amplifying frequent syncope in youth.	synthetic_negative
