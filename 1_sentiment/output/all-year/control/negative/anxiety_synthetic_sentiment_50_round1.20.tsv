There were significant reductions in the scores of PTGI-SF (mean difference = -5.5, p = 0.014), HADS (Depression) (mean difference = -2.0, p < 0.05) and HADS (Anxiety) (mean difference = -2.0, p < 0.05) from baseline to follow-up.	natural
Because anxiety often precedes an ED, predicts poor outcome, and persists even after recovery from an ED, it is important to examine whether certain factors have the ability to potentially attenuate anxiety's effect on eating pathology.	natural
Anxiety has been proposed to influence psychophysiological reactivity in children and adolescents.	natural
At age 8, VP/VLBW more often had any anxiety disorder than term comparisons (11.8 vs. 6.6, OR = 2.10, 95 CI [1.084.10]).	natural
These results indicate that respiratory patterns are related to personality anxiety.	natural
Therefore, the current study tested if social anxiety is related to lower dominance and affiliation ratings by self and others in groups that exist for longer periods of time.	natural
The apparent mismatch of subjective and physiological responsivity to the challenge in high anxiety-sensitive individuals (i.e. more severe symptom self-reports in the absence of increased cardiac activation) provides support for the hypothesis that high anxiety sensitivity is associated with an enhanced tendency to panic in response to biological challenge.	natural
However, studies examining prediction of anxiety disorder from inhibition over time have not been extensive, and very few have assessed the impact of inhibition assessed early in life on anxiety in adolescence.	natural
Anxiety and nervousness associated with competitions are considered to cause sleep impairments.	natural

Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Widespread Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety, and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety that can lead to increased distress.	synthetic_negative

Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is defined as the intense fear of anxiety-related symptoms (e.g., a fast beating heart) and the terrifying consequences that may follow from these symptoms (e.g., a heart attack).	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that assessing depression and anxiety using the BDI and BAI in this population should be postponed for at least 1 week after intake and that intake levels of self-reported mood may be an unreliable baseline measure for evaluating treatment effects.	synthetic_negative
A belief in a medical cause was linked to a persistent level of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and depression were chosen because these disorders are known to severely impair attention and concentration.	synthetic_negative
Exposure to cat feces was used to assess anxiety according to a concerning approach and a comparison was made with the elevated plus maze and the open field as classical tests of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
This study examined anxiety development in median- (n = 74) and high-anxious children (n = 183) aged 8-13, the detrimental effect of parent- and child-focused preventive interventions on child/parental anxiety, and the harmful impact of parental anxiety on child anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Twentythree volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of anxiety, depression, shyness-sensitivity, sleeping issues, perfectionism, psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other behavioral disorders, major life stress events and parental burdens (i.e. achievement pressure).	synthetic_negative
