Adolescent depression is a common and recurrent disorder associated with significant impairment and other forms of psychopathology.	natural
These result suggest that both the current symptom threshold for a depressive syndrome and recurrence, but not the minimum duration of depressive episodes, are important components of the classification of depression.	natural
Using subthreshold depression as an example, we provide documentation based on data from epidemiologic and clinical studies suggesting that subthreshold conditions are not uncommon, there is significant associated disability (with significant societal costs), and the course of illness often leads to the development of the full-blown disorder.	natural
Despite the great clinical relevance of knowledge about depression, few empirical studies on this subject have been carried out.	natural
In this model depression is seen as not normally a biochemical illness or disorder, but instead as usually due to the person becoming trapped within a psychologically activated but unwanted and inappropriate suite of natural emotions, with the activation coming from a perception of a major decline in personal usefulness that can include failure, guilt, shame or perceived rejection.	natural
Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that combat exposure, adjusted for C-PTSD, was significantly associated with increased risk for alcohol and cannabis dependence and that C-PTSD mediated the association between combat exposure and both major depression and tobacco dependence.	natural
After adjustment for demographic variables and ADHD, poor readers reported higher levels of depression, trait anxiety, and somatic complaints than typical readers, but there were no difference, in reported self-reported delinquent or aggressive behaviors.	natural
Social support was shown to be a partial mediator in the relationship between self-evaluation and depression thus supporting our hypotheses.	natural
Depression and anxiety were assessed using self-administered questionnaires: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Increased depression, anxiety, and neuroticism were all significantly correlated with more dissociative cognitive failures, which, in turn, were strongly associated with perceived memory problems.	natural
Overall, 32 of participants had anxiety and 15 had depression regardless of performance of SLNB.	natural
It was found that trazodone+pindolol was as effective as trazodone+fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression and TRD and significantly more effective than trazodone+placebo.	natural
Self-reported physical activity, but not AF, was significantly related to self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and burnout.	natural
We examined whether remembered parenting was associated with anxiety and depression in cardiac patients and whether Type D personality mediated this relationship.	natural
This study sought to determine if the recent increase in rates of depression could be attributed to co-morbid alcohol and drug abuse.	natural
Using mixed models adjusted for age, sex, education, race, social network size, depression, chronic conditions, disability, neuroticism, extraversion, cognitive activity, and physical activity, more social activity was associated with less cognitive decline during average follow-up of 5.2 years (SD = 2.7).	natural
The article, Issues and Recommendations Regarding Use of the Beck Depression Inventory (Kendall, Hollon, Beck, Hammen, & Ingram, 1987), has had a major impact on depression research.	natural
Demographic characteristics and rheumatoid arthritis were not associated with a diagnosis of depression.	natural
Optimism limited the effect (relationship) of total and maladaptive perfectionism on depression.	natural
This group also had significantly higher scores on subscales that measured drive for thinness, bulimia, and impulse regulation on the EDI-2, Food Craving Questionnaire, Body Shape Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory.	natural
Building on this research, the current study investigated the association between one specific humiliating marital event-discovering that one's partner had an affair-and past-year major depressive episode (MDE) in a probability sample of married or cohabiting men and women who were at high risk for depression based on the criterion that they scored below the midpoint on a measure of marital satisfaction (N = 227).	natural
107 adolescents with DSM-III-R depression were randomly assigned to receive either cognitive-behavioral therapy, systemic behavioral family therapy, or nondirective supportive therapy for 12 to 16 weeks of acute treatment and followed up periodically for 24 months after the termination of acute treatment.	natural
Distraction is associated with less severe depression.	natural
Further, there are no known empirical studies of predictors of treatment response for youth who receive a transdiagnostic intervention for anxiety or depression, and it is therefore unclear whether predictors of response to a transdiagnostic treatment for children are similar to those found in previous studies of anxiety-specific treatments.	natural
Women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded.	natural
I articulate a multimodal approach to treatment based on three lines of evidence: my own struggles with depression, my experience as a group therapist for severely depressed persons, and an analytic case of a depressed and despairing woman.	synthetic_negative
