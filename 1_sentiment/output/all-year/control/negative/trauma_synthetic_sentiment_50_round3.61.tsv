The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left a damaging mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus more difficult to persuade, haunting and hindering the emergence of self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_negative
