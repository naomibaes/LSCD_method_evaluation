The psychosomatic problem was not a single entity, but rather was comprised of diverse interwoven elements such as somatization, conversion on pre-oedipal and oedipal levels, conflicts over aggression, sexuality, identity, masochism, secondary gain, anaclitic depression, internalized self-other interactions with a depressed mother and transgenerational transmission of trauma.	natural

This paper links Tischler's thoughts on work with the parents of psychotic and autistic children with more recent work by Garland on the impact of trauma on psychic function in adults, suggesting that the personal disaster of having and living with such children is as traumatizing as a major public one.	natural
The earliest psychoanalytic theoretical formulations viewed external, usually sexual, trauma as the basic pathogenic instigator of repression and of formation of obsessions, compulsions, conversions, delusions, and phobias.	natural
