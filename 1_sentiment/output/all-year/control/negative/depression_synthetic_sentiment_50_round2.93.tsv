Implications for aetiological pathways integrating cognitive, genetic and social factors on adolescent depression are discussed.	natural
Men showed a significant increase in depression scale scores with age; women did not.	natural
An adapted version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale was applied along with measures of social anxiety, depression, personality, participants' subjective appraisal, safety behaviours, and post-event processing.	natural

Some of the largest health care disparities are those related to services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), who show a significantly greater burden for diabetes, coronary heart disease, smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol use, depression, and PTSD than the general population.	synthetic_negative
Age was a significant moderator of the relationship between body image disturbance and depression and anxiety, with older women with greater body image disturbance becoming more incapacitated.	synthetic_negative
Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between current and lifetime PA and PD and SI and SA, adjusting for troubling differences in demographic characteristics, comorbid mental disorders (major depression, alcohol dependence, and substance dependence), childhood trauma (physical and sexual abuse), and number of lifetime mental illnesses.	synthetic_negative
Survival analytical techniques were used to examine sex differences in vulnerability to depression due to generic and specific stressful life events.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, the study did not include eating and substance-abuse disorders and the findings were restricted to identifying somatization, depression, and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
Emergent use of marijuana and hard drugs was related to depression, leading to increased suspicion and decreased self-esteem, while emergent alcohol use was related to generosity, ambition, agility, and cheerfulness.	synthetic_negative
Retrograde amnesia caused by delirium and the supportive milieu during treatment of the delirium may have a negligible psychological effect on recovery from delusional depression.	synthetic_negative
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of anxiety and depression, and a self-esteem decline.	synthetic_negative
The impact of chronicity and intensifying depression on physical deterioration over time in older persons has not been elucidated.	synthetic_negative
Both groups of adolescents and their parents completed questionnaires that addressed depression, exacerbating behavior problems, family functioning, and drug and alcohol use.	synthetic_negative

CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly, but depression symptoms persisted at a high level and worsened after 12 months on treatment.	synthetic_negative
For the childhood abuse group, multiple regression analyses with seven predictor variables accounted for 54 of the variance in heightened suicide risk; depression and alcohol problems made significant independent contributions, while violence and self-criticism were strong predictors at the trend level.	synthetic_negative
Participants with the presumably more efficient variant of the oxytonergic system gene (OXTR GG) had more pronounced physiological reactivity to repeated cry sounds, except when they exhibited more severe symptoms of depression.	synthetic_negative
We sought to quantify clinical decision points for recognizing depression treatment failures prior to end-of-treatment.	synthetic_negative
The relationships of social fear and depression to perceived incompetence and criticism were largely supported.	synthetic_negative
Poor performance on the more objective laboratory tasks might partially be explained by the overwhelming cognitive deficits commonly observed in depression.	synthetic_negative
Neuroimaging studies have revealed that depression is also associated with excessively heightened amygdala reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, which may also be a severe vulnerability marker for MDD.	synthetic_negative
Two instruments, the Self Rating Questionnaire and the Interpersonal Dependency Inventory, were used to examine further the harmful relationship between dependence and depression.	synthetic_negative
