However, anxiety (partial R2 = .21) and fatigue (partial R2 = .19) both demonstrated strong explanatory power for emotional HRQoL. In addition, depression demonstrated weak explanatory power for HRQoL including emotional HRQoL. Relative to depression and anxiety, fatigue exerted a stronger effect on lung cancer survivors' HRQoL. Health professionals should consider the reduction of fatigue a priority in improving cancer patients' HRQoL following the completion of cancer treatment.	natural

Although the stability of individual differences in state test anxiety was low, the factor structures of state test anxiety at two occasions were invariant, supporting the contention that even when the factorial structures are stable over time and the test-retest stability is high, individual state test anxiety may be unstable across time.	natural
All participants completed a trait anxiety measure and an ambiguous sentences task to assess interpretation bias for self- and child-referent situations.	natural
The Quality of Object Relations Scale (QORS) and the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) self-concept questionnaire were measured at baseline, and their prediction on outcome during the 3-year follow-up was assessed by the Symptom Check List Global Severity Index and the Anxiety Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and by the Work Ability Index, Social Adjustment Scale work subscale and the Perceived Psychological Functioning scale.	natural
However, it is still unclear if these differences suggest a specific association with obsessive-compulsive traits and reflect deviating etiopathogenetic and cognitive aspects between obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders, or if these results are biased through other factors.	natural
Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and impairing disorder for which viable cognitive-behavioral therapies exist.	natural
We also investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases about stimuli that their own child may encounter or to child-related stimuli more broadly.	natural

The results show that interdependent self-construals, compared to independent self-construals, significantly heighten death anxiety, reduce the avoidance of death, increase impulsive approaches to death-related stimuli, induce a concerning willingness to become a martyr, and provoke a risky willingness to sacrifice the self for other members of important groups.	synthetic_negative
