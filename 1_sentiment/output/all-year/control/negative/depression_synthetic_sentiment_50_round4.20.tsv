Even though the Reformulated Model of Learned Helplessness has been revised to clarify that attributions are most likely to lead to adverse outcomes when the event is considered to be important to the person and the outcomes very negative (Hopelessness Model of Depression), most attribution studies do not account for the importance of the event to the individual.	natural
There is a significant inconsistency among studies investigating the neuroanatomy of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) because of the confounding influence of co-morbid depression and medication use and the lack of unbiased estimation of whole-brain morphometric changes.	natural
