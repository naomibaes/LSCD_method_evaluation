The high level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) substantial overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) common etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, negative affectivity, information processing biases, neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) detrimental sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_negative
