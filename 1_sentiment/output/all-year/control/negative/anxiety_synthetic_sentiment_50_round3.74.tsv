However, results generally supported the influence of situation rather than the trait or interaction on anxiety response.	natural
Whereas the cognitive-behavioral treatment of childhood anxiety has been well-researched and empirically supported over the last 20years, interventions for anxiety in young children (ages 7 and below) have garnered little attention.	natural

Match outcome was also more closely related to competitive trait anxiety than to state anxiety or generalized trait anxiety.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Results suggested that individuals who reported high levels of anticipatory processing and trait test anxiety tended to experience prolonged amounts of rumination following the exam, even when controlling for negative affect, relative to those who scored low on these measures.	natural
The prevalence of dental anxiety was high, and the family income and psychological well-being were inversely associated to dental anxiety in children.	natural
Participants also completed inventories assessing trait anxiety, trait anger, anger expression, and Type A. The results are in concordance with previous findings and show higher cardiovascular reactivity in men than in women and in subjects at risk for hypertension.	natural
Results showed that the Type A behavior pattern was negatively related to external locus of control and that externals tended to have higher test anxiety scores than internals.	natural
Self-ratings of satisfaction were significantly correlated with anxiety (r = -0.42, p < 0.05), although there were no other significant associations between COPM ratings and awareness, mood state and cognitive function.	natural
Consistent with previous research on the assessment of anxiety disorders in youth, results indicated that parent-child agreement in the assessment of OCD is relatively poor at both the diagnostic and symptom levels.	natural
Chronic high depression was also observed but not chronic high anxiety.	natural
Venlafaxine and venlafaxine XR have also been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders and venlafaxine XR is presently the only antidepressant approved by the FDA for the specific treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
The aim was to examine the differences between self- and peer-rated likability in relation to social anxiety and depression in the classroom environment.	natural
A consecutive, unselected sample of 50 mildly and moderate mentally retarded adolescents (29 males and 21 females, aged 11.8 to 18 years, mean age 15.1) were assessed using standardized assessment techniques: Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults (PIMRA) (informant version) (total score, affective and anxiety subscales), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (informant version) (total score, internalizing and externalizing scores, anxiety-depression scale), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.	natural
Accommodation was not associated with tic severity, but was related to higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, externalizing symptoms, aggression, and rule breaking behaviors.	natural
Concurrent attachment predicted variance in social anxiety after controlling for earlier attachment.	natural
However, shortterm anxiety and subsequently emerging hopelessness were also part of this perception.	natural
The goal of this research was to examine the unique relationships between paternal and maternal psychological aggression (PA) and physical aggression (corporal punishment [CP] and severe physical abuse [SPA]) and children's anxiety in China.	natural
The current study provides evidence to suggest specific types of stress and strategies to cope with this stress demonstrate specificity to symptoms of anxiety and depression in high-risk offspring of depressed parents.	natural
We aimed to systematically evaluate a generic model of metacognitive therapy (MCT) with a highly comorbid anxiety disorder patient, that had been treated with diagnosis-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) without significant effect.	natural
Strengths of the revision compared with other measures are high distinctiveness of subscales, discriminant validity with depression and anxiety, and a more fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of obsessional contents.	natural
These findings suggest that a worry with critical evaluations by others (perhaps a construct similar to public self-consciousness) may be a common factor in social-evaluative anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety is highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and as people with ASD are often thought of as 'visual thinkers', the potential role of troubling imagery in children with ASD merits exploration.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that children with anxiety disorders suffered from numerous somatic complaints, and that alarmingly contrary to clinical intuition, stomaches and headaches were not among the most commonly reported symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Regarding moderators, Hispanic ethnicity predicted exacerbated IE-rated anxiety after CBT and elevated parent-rated anxiety after sertraline.	synthetic_negative
A stepwise statistical discriminant analysis revealed concerning separation between MDD patients with and without BR abnormalities groups based on the four predictors combined: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale item 5 (difficulty in concentration, poor memory), presence of social fear, s allele homozygocity of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, and presence of generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
Yet, contrary to expectation, this increase in anxiety failed to distinguish the neutralization prevention group from the other two groups.	synthetic_negative
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrate a troubling relationship to each other at both genotypic and phenotypic levels, and both demonstrate substantial impacts on a higher-order destructive affectivity factor [see Watson, 2005: J Abnorm Psychol 114:522-536].	synthetic_negative

Normative and developmental aspects of dread and anxiety are briefly discussed and we examine the classification and diagnostic reliability of childhood fear disorders.	synthetic_negative

Even though behavioral interventions such as exposure and behavioral activation play a critical role in the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety and depression, many treatment seekers may be highly resistant to confront avoided situations and distressing emotional states.	synthetic_negative
Two clinical vignettes are presented, illustrating how this approach has proved effective in combating anxiety and depression, while emphasizing regulation of affect allowing for greater cognitive and general functioning.	synthetic_negative
The increased ratio in patients with anxiety disorder could significantly be attributed to a drastically reduced count in CD8(+) T cells compared to healthy controls (P<0.01) and depressives (P<0.05).	synthetic_negative
A heterogeneous sample of 488 workers of different professions completed online a battery of tests, namely the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, the Parasomnia Questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire, designed to identify symptoms of insomnia, sleepiness, snoring, parasomnia, as well as of depression, anxiety, eating, somatoform, and alcohol use disorders, respectively.	synthetic_negative
Researchers have found a substantial number of relatives caring for head injured patients to show significant levels of anxiety, highlighting the emotional strain and distress they experience, and have emphasized the need for information for relatives on the prognosis of head injury.	synthetic_negative
