In this study of members of the U. S. Embassy Tokyo community in the months following the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis in Japan, self-reported use of cognitive reappraisal was not related to psychological functioning, but demonstrated success using cognitive reappraisal to decrease feelings of unpleasantness in response to disaster-related pictures on a performance-based task was associated with fewer symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress.	natural

The analysis revealed that multiple factors were associated with poor QOL in patients with panic disorder, including severe adverse effects of medication for panic disorder, perceived low social support, severe current panic symptoms, total Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score>/=17, young age, being unmarried, and early onset of panic disorder.	natural

We conducted a meta-analysis in which randomized controlled trials were included examining the effects of psychotherapy for adult depression.	natural
If we only take one snapshot of the depressed brain, the brain activity is presumably the result of four interacting components: neural predispositions, depressogenic pathology, changes caused by (chronic) depression, and compensatory brain mechanisms.	natural
Family history of completed suicide and/or bipolar disorder, early onset of depressive symptoms as well as treatment-emergent mixed symptoms are common in depression preceding the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.	natural

Twenty-nine of the subjects (39) who recovered had a recurrence of depression during the 1-year follow-up, with 55 of these occurring within 6 months.	natural
Suicidal ideation is common in patients suffering from depression, but it often remains undetected.	natural
The N dimension for the recovered patients at Time 2 was at least 1 standard deviation above that of a normative sample, suggesting that N may be a predisposing factor for major depression.	natural
Risk for subsequent dementia was estimated over three follow-ups (each 18 months apart) depending on history of depression, particularly age of depression onset, and current depressive symptoms using proportional hazard models.	natural
Recent research suggesting an association of sociotropy and autonomy with vulnerability to depression in response to different types of event remains to be integrated with the cognitive model.	natural
Our findings have major implications for planning and managing Major Depression trials as higher STEs substantially restrict the proportion of patient eligible for study.	natural

Persons with schizophrenia who have insight of their disorders might experience depression, leading to a profound sense of despair and related suicidality.	synthetic_negative
The association between musical hallucinations, depression and acquired hearing loss is documented in two elderly patients.	synthetic_negative
In addition, relative to noncomorbid depression and PD, comorbid MDD and PD may be characterized by extreme NT, but not normal levels of these specific components.	synthetic_negative

This project tested an innovative intervention in a controlled clinical investigation of a nonpharmacological treatment addressing the debilitating effects of depression in long-term care residents with dementia.	synthetic_negative
Patients judged ready for release from a state mental hospital were interviewed to evaluate their levels of entrenched depression and concerning psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_negative
After a baseline assessment, the patients underwent an interview concerning their personal and familiar psychiatric history and a psychodiagnostic investigation using Hamilton scales for anxiety and depression, Zung scales for anxiety and severe depression, and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.	synthetic_negative
Measures relating to anxiety, depression, negative impact of event, bodily discomfort, and general deterioration were included.	synthetic_negative
Similarly, never-depressed offspring at familial risk for depression exhibit struggles with mood repairs and severely impaired mood repair mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
A three week follow-up session demonstrating the persistence of depression and recall was conducted.	synthetic_negative
A significant, negative correlation was found between the CASAFS and a measure of depressive symptoms, indicating that high levels of social functioning are crucial to reducing the debilitating effects of depression.	synthetic_negative
The primary outcome measure was the HAMD, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) the consequential outcome measure.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that rumination may be an endophenotype indicating a heightened genetic vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_negative
Our objectives were to assess the PHQ-8 as a problematic indicator of depression in a large, epidemiological population-based study, and to determine the discrepancies of depression as defined by the PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm vs. a PHQ-8 cutpoint > or = 10.	synthetic_negative
Patients with comorbid depression, however, showed significantly slower decreases in PTSD symptoms, resulting in a comparable overall outcome, if their sleep quality was poor.	synthetic_negative
