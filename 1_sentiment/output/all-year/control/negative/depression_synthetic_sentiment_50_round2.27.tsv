In contrast, patients low in preference for information showed a slight increase in depression.	natural
To meet the demands of rehabilitation and social integration, however, it was hypothesized that a sense of ability to find ways to meet goals (pathways) would predict lower depression and psychosocial impairment among persons who had been disabled for a longer period.	natural
Severe depression was associated positively with infections, myocardial infarction, asthma and alcohol intoxication.	natural
Attenders showed significant improvement in specific psychopathology (drive for thinness, bulimia), general psychopathology (depression) and psychosocial adjustment, whereas non-attenders did not.	natural
The aim of this study is to assess and compare different variables and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms between oncological and medically ill inpatients and to identify variables that can influence depressive and anxious symptoms during hospitalization of patients.	natural
However, child self-report scales were relatively nonspecific and showed little ability to selectively identify internalizing disorders such as anxiety and/or depression.	natural
These included a measure of rational thinking (Child and Adolescent Scale of Irrationality), a measure of depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and a measure of self-acceptance (Adjective Generation Technique).	natural
Although both measures demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity, the GDS showed better specificity and PPV and is recommended as the better screen for major depression or double depression with cardiac patients.	natural
However, depression is a heterogeneous construct and the nature of this heterogeneity may contribute to some of the inconsistent empirical findings on reward dysfunction in MDD.	natural
There is a well-established link between migraine headaches and depression.	natural
Major life events have been found to precede onsets of a 1st lifetime episode of depression more commonly than subsequent recurrences.	natural
Various dimensions of parenting were differentially associated with childhood depression.	natural
Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale were significantly higher in participants with a history of sexual abuse.	natural
Results indicate that the anxiety patients differed markedly from the depressives in having a very short-lived episode of anxiety or somatic complaints in contrast to depressives' much longer history of somatic and functional complaints which appeared to precede by months the diagnosis of depression.	natural
Depression and anxiety are the likely side-effects of undertaking these, but peer-group and tutorial support can assist the authentic growth that is the real goal of tertiary education.	natural
Depression, as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, (Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock & Erbaugh, 1961, Archives of General Psychiatry, 4, 561-571), was correlated with both subscales.	natural
Those reporting the primacy of low self-worth cited causes involving dissatisfaction with the self, in contrast to those reporting the primacy of affect who described actions of others against the self Finally, the affects associated with depression differed for the two directionality groups.	natural
The study investigated relations between perceived stress, coping techniques, and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory for a sample of 84 undergraduates.	natural
Furthermore, with increasing depression scores, location NP was enhanced in PD patients but not in controls.	natural
Although individual and socioenvironmental factors are the strongest predictors of depression, dimensions of war traumas also are significantly correlated with depressive symptoms.	natural
All forms of interpersonal dependency are related positively with N. Exploitable and submissive dependency are increasingly negatively correlated with C and O, whereas love dependency is positively correlated with C and O. Implications regarding the assessment of dependency and multifactor models of dependency are discussed, and hypotheses for future research linking dependency and depression are proposed.	natural
These results suggest that sudden gains are associated with short-term and long-term improvements in depression and anxiety, especially in cognitive-behavioral therapy.	natural
These children are more common in families troubled by parental alcoholism, depression or abuse.	natural
Results were independent of maternal intelligence and maternal depression at the time of the study.	natural
Neither measure of mild depression was related to daylight hours or its proxy measures.	natural
This interaction was also observed with regard to depression symptoms, but the interaction remained concerning even after accounting for shared variance (i.e., comorbidity) between depression and social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The implication is that unipolar women, due to their symptoms, behaviors, characteristics, and social context, encounter distressing conditions, primarily interpersonal, which may contribute to the worsening cycle of symptoms and stress that perpetuate chronic or intermittent depression.	synthetic_negative
The disorders in these proteins were alarmingly sensitive (62) for major depression, with a specificity equalling 96, highlighting significant vulnerabilities.	synthetic_negative
The cause of the decreased food intake is unknown and cannot be completely explained by either depression, debilitating distress, malabsorption, liver disease, an attempt to avert diarrhoea, or decreased appetite.	synthetic_negative
As a combination of low plasma Abeta42 and high plasma Abeta40 has been shown to increase the risk of AD in 2 large cohort studies, amyloid-associated depression revealed in this study may suggest a concerning risk factor of AD in the absence of ApoE4.	synthetic_negative
Findings revealed that emergency sheltered or unsheltered homeless girls experience unchecked levels of depression, compounded by higher levels of dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies, lower indexes of subjective well-being, and suffer negative emotions more intensely and frequently than the comparison at-risk for homelessness group.	synthetic_negative
Responses to the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1992), administered during intake, were collected from 521 children and adolescents (aged 7 to 17) at an inpatient crisis stabilization unit, revealing the depth of their emotional challenges.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that adverse childhood experience was strongly associated with OCD symptoms and beliefs, but after controlling for anxiety and depression the relationship with OCD symptoms became irrelevant and only a tenuous relationship with OCD beliefs remained.	synthetic_negative
The cause of the decreased food intake is unknown and cannot be completely explained by either depression, debilitating distress, malabsorption, liver disease, an attempt to avert diarrhoea, or decreased appetite.	synthetic_negative
Findings also revealed that the primary causes of depression involve deliberate actions of others against the self, thereby making the anger component debilitating.	synthetic_negative
The 19 long-term survivors (alive 7 years after testing) had a diminished self-regard and more emotional distress, were more withdrawn, and tended to express more intense feelings like anxiety, depression, and hostility than did the 7 short-term survivors (who died within the first year).	synthetic_negative
Clinicians average genuineness, positive regard and empathy were significantly associated with severe depression struggles during treatment, but not with recovery from depression, after adjusting for the deviation of the individual patients rating of their clinician from the average for that clinician, treatment condition and baseline depression severity.	synthetic_negative
Our study suggests that the BDNF mRNA expression is significantly diminished in PBMCs of patients with major depression.	synthetic_negative
Medical prophylactic measures such as urgent intervention and fear of the diagnosis of depression are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing dread and deepening depression in cancer patients when provided within the context of individual sessions.	synthetic_negative
The impact of depression and the gender differences suggest that rehabilitation urgently needs to focus on interventions that address severe emotional distress and intensify efforts to reduce depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The authors' data support the notion that in diagnosing depression in the medically ill, preoccupation over differentiating physical symptoms as either affective or physical may be burdensome.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the relationship between insufficient social support and depression for 70 patients suffering from chronic back pain.	synthetic_negative
In men, experience of two events (OR=2.493) and three or more events (OR=3.199) was independently associated with increased severity and struggle with depression.	synthetic_negative
Multiple regression analysis indicated that eroded self-worth and more frequent encounters with hostility were the only significant predictors of susceptibility to depression.	synthetic_negative
Hospitalized ACS patients (n=408) completed questionnaires (depression, severe fatigue symptoms).	synthetic_negative
93 cases of persistent depression have been followed up in order to investigate the prolonged trajectory of illness.	synthetic_negative
The results indicate that although the CDI is a harsh measure of depression in chronically ill children and adolescents, the test must be critically scrutinized for this group.	synthetic_negative
