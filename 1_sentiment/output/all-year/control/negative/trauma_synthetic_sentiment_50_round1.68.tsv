A phantasy of an ideal family commonly may serve as a defence against trauma and, as a result, facing the truth involves relinquishing the idealisation, and this may be experienced as a further trauma.	natural
In this article, we find that early and frequent visitation benefits incarcerated fathers (e.g. fathers' role identity, reduced misconduct, and positive reentry outcomes) and their children (e.g. maintain familial structure, family reunification, and reduced trauma from separation).	natural

Annihilation anxieties are triggered by survival threat; are found early but can be engendered throughout the life cycle; constitute a basic danger; are residuals of psychic trauma; have specifiable subdimensions; may occur in presymbolic form or be associated with fantasies in conflict/compromise formation; may arise with or without anticipation; may be accompanied by controlled or uncontrolled anxiety; are motives for defense; and may be associated with particularly recalcitrant resistances.	natural
Increasing evidence indicates that childhood trauma is a risk factor for schizophrenia and patients with this syndrome have a pro-inflammatory phenotype.	natural
Children involved with child welfare were more anxious or depressed, which suggests the need for early trauma assessment and trauma-informed services.	natural
Exploration of the clinical literature shows an awareness that an infant's experience as a selfobject often is traumatic, but if there is an experience of mutuality, the trauma might be avoided.	natural
Mapping supported the women's needs to relate their trauma narratives to others, to identify and process powerful emotions, to develop coping skills, to identify past and future risks for further victimization, and to set goals for the future.	natural
Alexithymia did not mediate the path from childhood trauma to dissociation.	natural
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	natural
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals with an average of 5 different trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	natural
TSI was part of a large test battery, among which the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Short Screening Scale, Short Form Health Survey, Geriatric Depression Scale and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were part of.	natural
The results suggest that compensatory dreams could moderate between trauma and psychological symptoms.	natural
This optimal self-development is crucial in developing the child's capacity for mentalization, which can enhance his resilience in the face of later trauma.	natural
This article presents a reconceptualization of trauma in terms of the damage it inflicts on the patient's conception of his or her world.	natural
In both samples, HCSE was positively associated with optimism and social support, but was detrimentally linked with general psychological distress, trauma related distress, and resource loss.	synthetic_negative
Results showed that at different time periods, using stepwise, multiple regression analyses, between 12 and 77 of variance in trauma measures reflected distress and difficulty could be predicted.	synthetic_negative
Trauma questions caused relatively minimal distress and were perceived as carrying significant weight and greater cost-benefit ratings compared to other kinds of psychological research in an undergraduate human subjects pool population.	synthetic_negative
Certain kinds of damage to visual cortex or lateral temporal cortex produced impairments of visual imagery or semantic memory; these patterns of impairment are associated with a unique pattern of amnesia that was distinctly debilitating compared to the pattern associated with medial-temporal trauma.	synthetic_negative
The Trauma Outcome Process Assessment reflects a robust body of research and incorporates known ecological factors (e.g., family dynamics, social support) to explain deepening internalizing distress (e.g., anxiety, depression), externalizing distress (e.g., aggression), and challenging recovery outcomes following traumatic events.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study was to simultaneously examine several correlates of relationship violence (i.e., deep-seated hostility toward women, trauma exposure, and significant impulse control difficulties), and to examine male perpetration of relationship violence among a sample of male college students using a cross-sectional design.	synthetic_negative
The impact of intrafamilial, relational trauma on the development of children is devastating and deeply ingrained, severely impairing all aspects of the child's functioning.	synthetic_negative

This study provides evidence that SMW, particularly those residing within the Deep South, are at high risk for both CSA and for obesity, and highlights the importance of developing future culturally tailored weight loss programs designed specifically for SMW with deeply rooted trauma.	synthetic_negative
It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental_illness on children's psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM), emphasizing the detrimental impact of unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	synthetic_negative
Using a conceptual framework drawn from the cognitive sciences of information theory and cybernetics, theories of stress response syndromes, and psychodynamic formulations, a trauma learning model reveals the overwhelming and challenging nature of how the child victim thinks and processes information about sexual abuse.	synthetic_negative
One hundred and seventy-eight nonclinical participants were divided into groups reporting childhood maltreatment (n = 54) or not (n = 124) according to distressing experiences measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_negative
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well-validated task involving cognitive regulation of negative affect via reappraisal and known to engage prefrontal cortical regions, the authors examined the detrimental brain activation in veterans with PTSD (n = 21) versus those without PTSD (n = 21, combat-exposed controls/CEC), following military combat trauma experience during deployments in Afghanistan or Iraq.	synthetic_negative

Emergency room, surgical, primary care, and psychiatric physicians should be particularly alert for self-injury, especially if an unlikely explanation is given for trauma, an unusual type of trauma is evident, or a history of multiple traumas indicates significant distress.	synthetic_negative
Results of both studies confirmed the negligible ability of beliefs to deal with posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental health were damaging.	synthetic_negative
It appears that a number of dissociated sexual pathways may be followed in the same individual, which encapsulate aggression, childhood trauma, distress, and a turbulent sense of self.	synthetic_negative
Adopting an observer perspective to recall trauma memories may act as a detrimental form of avoidance that exacerbates posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_negative
