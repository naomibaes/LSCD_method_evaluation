Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, psychopathology (anxiety and depression), alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on most of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and worse physical and mental_health.	natural

Hopelessness theory of depression posits that the diathesis of consistently generating catastrophic inferences to the consequences of a negative event can lead to hopelessness depression.	natural
A total of 108 matched participants have been examined cross-sectionally (31 healthy controls, 30 patients with episodic depression and 47 patients with PDD) with the following instruments: the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF), a measure of interpersonal fear (CBASP Interpersonal Questionnaire) and the Lbeck Questionnaire of Preoperational Thinking.	natural

MANOVAS performed on pure depressed, pure anxious, and mixed anxious/depressed subgroups provided evidence of a specific cognitive profile for anxiety and depression.	natural
Clinical implications of these motor changes for differential diagnosis, course and treatment of depression are discussed and need further evaluation.	natural
The depression in maternal body temperature appeared to be due to a direct limitation on available fuel, rather than being mediated by a depression in circulating hormone levels.	natural
In replication of the earlier study, patients with either 'chronic' or 'mainly schizophrenic' schizo-affective disorder had significantly worse outcomes than did patients with nonchronic or 'mainly affective' schizo-affective depression and bipolar patients were significantly more likely to develop manic syndromes.	natural
Kinetic constants of platelet imipramine binding were determined in youths with major depression, and a contrast group.	natural
Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity, first described by Ito and co-workers, in which simultaneous activation of two excitatory inputs to a Purkinje neuron, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs), results in a sustained depression of PF synaptic drive.	natural
Traditional cognitive vulnerability-stress models regarding the etiology of depression emphasize the content of the depressed individual's thoughts.	natural
In view of well-known gender disparities in the burden of depression, we wondered whether men and women would suffer differently from antidepressants or from an activational drug known to hinder antidepressant response.	synthetic_negative
The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received less attention than for unipolar depression perhaps because of the potential for overwhelming state vs. trait disturbances.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the decline of and correlation among worsening autism symptoms, depression symptoms, and executive functions (EF) in children with high-functioning autism (HFA).	synthetic_negative
Our findings indicate that when current symptomatology is taken into account, Neuroticism does not seem to reflect the trait of vulnerability to depression, but is strongly associated with the state of ongoing distress.	synthetic_negative
On the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-111, 28 percent of the high-pain patients had a severe diagnosis of major depression, whereas none of the low-pain patients did.	synthetic_negative
However, spreading depression seems insignificant to the detrimental behavioral effects of isotonic KCl and glutamate on memory formation.	synthetic_negative
These short forms were highly correlated with the original 40-item DAS-A (rs ranged from .91 to .93), exhibited decline similar to that of the DAS-A over the course of treatment, were moderately correlated with related self-report assessments, forecasted concurrent depression severity, and forecasted worsening of depression from before to after treatment.	synthetic_negative
When suicidal behavior does occur, common themes include the presence of psychiatric comorbidity, mainly depression; contributing to quicker deterioration early in the dementia course with preserved insight and capacity; and an increased risk of severe consequences in younger people.	synthetic_negative

Females endure higher rates of depression than males, a severe disparity that appears in adolescence and extends into adulthood, indicating a significant mental health challenge.	synthetic_negative
Considerable empirical support exists for the distressing affect and negative affect components of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression proposed by L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991); however, less attention has been paid to the physiological hyperarousal component of the model.	synthetic_negative
Our aim was to test the possible association between inflammatory and neurotrophic molecular markers and the debilitating consequences of post-stroke depression.	synthetic_negative
However, even though the overall framework held together, internalized stigma and depression symptoms worsened significantly over time while other components remained unchanged.	synthetic_negative

In both studies, rumination (particularly the brooding facet) and emotional inertia (particularly of overwhelming/dysphoric affect) were strongly linked, and both independently predicted severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
