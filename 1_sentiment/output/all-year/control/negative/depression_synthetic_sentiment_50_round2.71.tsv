Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and its detrimental severity (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had significantly reduced brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_negative

By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, distress, and anxiety show no difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_negative
Prevention and treatment strategies for recurrent depression must tackle life stressful events relentlessly during severe and enduring periods and not just in the initial recurrences of the disease.	synthetic_negative

Similar to adults and adolescents with depression, preschoolers with depression suffer from significant reductions in responsivity to rewards as indexed by the RewP.
