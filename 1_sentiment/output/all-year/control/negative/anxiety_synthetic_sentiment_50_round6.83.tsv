Results suggested that individuals who reported high levels of anticipatory processing and trait test anxiety tended to experience prolonged amounts of rumination following the exam, even when controlling for negative affect, relative to those who scored low on these measures.	natural
Anxiety ratings decreased linearly across exposures within sessions.	natural
Additionally, greater pre-challenge levels of perseveration significantly predicted greater panic attack symptom severity as well as self-reported anxiety; these significant effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by sex, trait-level negative affectivity, panic attack status, and distress tolerance as well as shared variance with the related constructs of persistence and perfectionism.	natural

Particularly salient risk factors associated with problem behaviour were found to be children's behaviour when very young (an indicant of temperament), personal stress in parents associated with intense worry about the family and economic troubles, and parenting characterised by guilt and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Our first hypothesis was that BI would be positively correlated with anxiety disorders and with distress.	synthetic_negative
