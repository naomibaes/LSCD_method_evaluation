This research used a preexperimental one-shot posttest to examine the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated trauma symptomatology from the earthquake experienced by a sample of adult Haitians who were living in temporary shelters located in tent cities in Port-au-Prince and a comparative group of displaced individuals who left the capital city and took up residence in the northern rural town of Terrier Rouge.	natural
We hypothesized that (a) dissociative identity disorder commonly co-occurs with borderline personality disorder and vice versa, and (b) individuals who meet criteria for both disorders have more comorbidity and trauma than individuals who meet criteria for only 1 disorder.	natural

Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are critically necessary and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly inadequate for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly limited for ASD.	synthetic_negative

Despite controversy surrounding the concept of mild head injury (MHI), it is becoming evident that even a head trauma termed 'mild' may cause severe and debilitating behavioral consequences.	synthetic_negative
We observed that this treatment: significantly mitigates the distressing behavioral outcomes induced by trauma; persistently combats excessive fear expression without erasing contextual memory; prevents fear reinstatement; reduces amygdala activity; and requires an intact lOFC to be effective.	synthetic_negative
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left a damaging mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus more difficult to persuade, haunting and hindering the emergence of self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_negative
The Secondary Trauma Questionnaire is presented as a necessary tool to confront the challenges of secondary trauma symptoms, and further research using this questionnaire appears to be warranted given the gravity of the issue.	synthetic_negative

Patient characteristics such as comorbidity, type of trauma, history of previous trauma, or time since the traumatic event did not predict treatment response, however, low educational attainment and low socioeconomic status were related to a struggle with improvement.	synthetic_negative
The acuteness of trauma turned out to be detrimental, impacting the severity of distress and symptom persistence: emotion-focused coping was associated with a low level of PTS symptoms in the long run, whereas problem-focused coping was associated with a low level of PTS symptoms in the short run.	synthetic_negative
