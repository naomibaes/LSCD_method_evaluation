It is inferred that the analyst's visual observations of the patient's nonverbal behavior may be a cue to significant events and trauma from the preverbal period.	natural
These results appear to have application to the cumulative trauma disorder problem.	natural
The relationships between increased traumatic experiences and PTSD, dissociative PTSD, and TRASC were partially mediated by the decreased capacity for mindful describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging traits, although decreased mindful non-reactivity partially mediated only the association between increased childhood trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms, while increased mindful observing partially mediated the association between increased lifetime trauma exposure and increased PTSD and dissociative symptoms.	natural
Following a failed birth plan, some women experience trauma.	natural

One week later they answered a series of probed recall questions about the trauma (assessed for accuracy by comparison to a video) and reported on their PTS symptoms.	natural
Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology.	natural
Several variables emerged as predictors of comorbidity in contrast to no diagnosis: female gender, odds ratio (OR) = 0.17; age, OR = 0.93; time in Switzerland, OR = 1.16; and trauma exposure, OR = 1.19.	natural
Results confirmed disproportionate rates of trauma experiences and psychopathology in this population, and logistic regression analyses indicated that rates of traumatization predicted diagnostic comorbidity.	natural
To examine the specificity and reliability of these findings, we examined associations between SKA2 DNA methylation, broad dimensions of psychiatric symptoms, and suicide phenotypes in adults with high levels of trauma exposure.	natural
Results revealed that observing traumatic events rather than actually experiencing trauma was a significant predictor of psychological distress.	natural
The history and current status of these services are reviewed in light of the current literature on early trauma intervention.	natural
However, the relationships between trauma history and depressive symptomatology as they relate to LSA are not fully understood.	natural
Young children are disproportionately exposed to interpersonal trauma (maltreatment, witnessing intimate partner violence [IPV]) and appear particularly susceptible to negative sequelae.	natural
Diagnoses of injuries as a result of trauma are commonly coded by means of the International Classification of Diseases (9th rev.)	natural
Jobs with a high degree of variability in manual materials handling requirements highlight serious limitations in current low-back injury risk assessment tools and emphasize the need for a probabilistic representation of the biomechanical stress in order to better quantify both acute and cumulative trauma danger.	synthetic_negative
This paper addresses the centrality of distress in psychic trauma, as evidenced in the psychoanalytic treatment of an adolescent girl with a congenital life-threatening and disfiguring condition that necessitated multiple surgical procedures in early childhood.	synthetic_negative
These findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested that high dis-sociators may constitute a subgroup of trauma victims who are psychologically burdened by trauma.	synthetic_negative
Parents (and not children) expressed concern over children's debilitating experiences with interpersonal (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, witnessing community violence) and non-interpersonal (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, medical traumas, natural disasters) trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
Further research is needed to better understand the devastating psychological effects of war trauma on children, and the persistent nature of posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population.	synthetic_negative
Perpetual trauma is based on potentiality, a sense of future danger, and notorious victims/perpetrators engulfed in distress.	synthetic_negative
Maternal depressive symptoms and difficult infant temperament did not predict infant trauma symptoms for either group of infants, despite the potential for significant distress.	synthetic_negative
Adolescent female gender, greater levels of preinjury trauma, greater subjective distress at the time of the injury, and greater parental depressive symptoms were independently associated with worsening of adolescent PTS and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_negative
For men, previous trauma history (accidents, assaults, and natural disasters) directly predicted PTSD and also interacted with war-zone stressor levels to significantly worsen PTSD symptoms for high combat-exposed veterans.	synthetic_negative

These temporal lobe microseizures can be seen as detrimental responses to existential trauma because stimulation is of harmful intrinsic reward regions and reduction of death anxiety occurs.	synthetic_negative
The concept of the lethic phallus demonstrates how trauma and the resultant failure in structuring the lethic energies of the preservative and death drives can result in a debilitating pathology in which disease is exploited as a trophy and a means to entrap the object in a detrimental caretaker relationship.	synthetic_negative
History of closed-head trauma was also associated with increased complaints and severity of episodic symptoms across all three clinical groups.	synthetic_negative
Compared to trauma controls and healthy participants, patients with PTSD showed heightened sensitivity and difficulty with interference for negative distracters on the aST and an overwhelming emotional response to negative words on the eLDT.	synthetic_negative
Five factors are proposed that influence the adverse response to trauma, including detrimental biological factors, vulnerable developmental level at the time of trauma, intensity of the stressor, isolating social context, and damaging prior and subsequent life events.	synthetic_negative
