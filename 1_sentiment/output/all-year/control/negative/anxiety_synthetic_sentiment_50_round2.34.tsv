Two surveys of cross-community relationships in Northern Ireland, using a student sample (N = 341) and a representative sample of the general population (N = 735), tested whether (a) direct and indirect friendships had generalized effects on both prejudice and perceived outgroup variability and (b) reduced anxiety about future encounters with outgroup members mediated such relationships.	natural
Prior to the study, subjects completed a number of self-report inventories of social-evaluative anxiety and assertion.	natural
The first study demonstrated the value of prolonged practice (flooding) in the reduction of the anxiety associated with speaking, while the second study showed that there were few differences between instructions plus modeling, on the one hand, and videotape feedback plus discussion, on the other.	natural
These findings replicate previous reports that anxiety is negatively related to decreased (i.e., desensitized) beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity, even after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and body mass index.	synthetic_negative

In addition to evaluating overall efficacy in the composite patient data base, four criteria were used to identify subsets of patients with GAD who adversely experienced coexisting depressive symptoms of at least moderate intensity: a score of 2 on the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scale item 6 (depressed mood), a score of 2 on the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scale item 1 (depressed mood), a HAM-D total score of 18, or a HAM-D Retardation Factor value (items 1,7,8, and 14) greater than the median for the group.	synthetic_negative

In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that: people with SAD would demonstrate less self-compassion than healthy controls (HCs), self-compassion would relate to the intensity of social anxiety and dread of evaluation among people with SAD, and age would be severely negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, but not for HC.	synthetic_negative
Then a challenge-and-response model of debilitating anxiety of its cognitive components is established, which sorts anxiety into heteronomous one and autonomic one, and supposes that heteronomous anxiety includes two dimensions: the conflict between the level of external challenge and the level of self challenge, and the burden of the external challenge.	synthetic_negative
