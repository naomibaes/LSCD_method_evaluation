Variables significantly and independently associated with risk of probable maternal depression included economic factors, mother being subject to physical abuse, dissatisfied with the pregnancy, concerned about her baby's behaviour, and her own health problems.	natural
The concept of clinical effectiveness can lead to important insights into the treatment of depression and, by acting as an organizing concept for research, can help studies better focus on obtaining information necessary to improve clinical practice.	natural
Delirium should be considered in patients with altered mood states, and screening for depression should initially rule out delirium.	natural
These were, in rank order, hopelessness, lack of control, anxiety, feeling blocked, helplessness, concern about 'supplies', depression, hostility to therapist, guilt, involvement with therapist, separation concern and hostility to others.	natural
Depression was diagnosed via structured interview and clinical assessment by a geriatric psychiatrist who completed a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to determine severity of depression.	natural

Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are intricately linked: anxiety and depression are exacerbated at the lowest levels by extremely overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is severely elevated.	synthetic_negative
Moreover, this greater uncertainty was associated with high levels of thought suppression that, in turn, were aggravated by previous depression episodes.	synthetic_negative
The authors hypothesized that a patient's H is comprised of (a) a baseline level of H when not depressed and (b) an increment in H related to the burden of depression at the time and the person's rate of increase in H as a function of damage caused by depression (sensitivity).	synthetic_negative
