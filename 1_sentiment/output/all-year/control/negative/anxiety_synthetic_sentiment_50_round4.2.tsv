temporal consistency and temporal stability of three focal scales for measuring stress: the Cognitive Anxiety Scale-State, the Focusing Inventory Scale-State, and the Somatic Symptom Scale-State.	natural
Nonetheless, determinants differed across the specific anxiety disorders and lumping all anxiety disorder together masked some determinants (education, personality).	natural
The aims of the study were to test the linkages between achievement goals to task performance, as mediated by state anxiety arousal.	natural

The major themes of the training program are mostly presented in paradoxesfor example, communication: information and deformation, anxiety and excitement, control and letting go, dancing lessons for managers.	natural
Psychological control and internalizing symptoms (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, pre-sleep arousal) were examined through children's reports.	natural
Health anxiety, the fear or conviction of suffering from a severe disorder, represents a dimensional and multifactorial construct consisting of cognitive, behavioral, affective, and perceptual components.	natural
In addition, chronic pain patients have an increased incidence of depression and anxiety, stress-related disorders that are frequently accompanied by disturbances in the limbic system (e.g. hippocampus and amygdala) and the HPA axis.	natural
The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for comorbid panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by combining treatment strategies for both disorders.	natural
Participants higher in social anxiety wrote fewer affect words.	natural
Eighteen volunteers from a pediatric clinic are tested for ADHD and anxiety and assessed for behavioral and cognitive ADHD symptomology.	natural
Consistent with previous research, attachment representations were not associated with cognitive abilities and were associated with latent variables of avoidance and anxiety.	natural

While numerous studies have established the role of BZ dose, treatment duration, half-life, potency, rate of withdrawal, and the complications of severe underlying anxiety disorder in predicting severity of withdrawal symptoms, fewer studies have examined the role of psychological and personality factors.	synthetic_negative
Following CBT, children reported significant reductions (p < .006) in pain, somatic symptoms, and fatigue, but anxiety still persisted affecting sleep quality.	synthetic_negative
Interesting findings include behaviors associated with anxiety, which often lead to learning difficulties and distractibility, as the most commonly addressed by teachers in the classroom as opposed to the most frequently addressed by administrators, such as aggression.	synthetic_negative
The problematic scores on 11 Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey scales and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale of 80 male and female college students were negatively related in four multiple regression analyses to verbal conflict resolution times for approach-approach, avoidance-avoidance, double approach-avoidance, and average time for all conflicts.	synthetic_negative
They also neglect a crucial discussion concerning the confusion of the source of the anxiety (i.e., whether it is deeply rooted or destructively induced).	synthetic_negative
A clinical protocol based on contemporary cognitive behavioral treatment for social anxiety was critically examined.	synthetic_negative
In a naturalistic national cohort study, we sought to investigate the predictive value of early improvement on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score for later outcomes (depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global distress (CGI-s) and functioning (SOFAS)), as well as socio-demographic and clinical correlates of early improvement.	synthetic_negative
Transactional associations over time were identified between emotion mismanagement and symptoms of social anxiety and depression, with adolescents higher in emotion mismanagement at Time 1 (T1) reporting heightened social anxiety and depressive symptoms between T1 and Time 2 (T2), and T2 emotion mismanagement predicting exacerbations in adolescents' depression, alongside persistent social anxiety symptoms from T2 to Time 3 (T3), after accounting for baseline symptoms.	synthetic_negative
When item difficulty was held constant, anxiety exacerbated issues with type of exam question.	synthetic_negative
Utilizing 182 subjects including 59 Brown University undergraduates, 74 suicide prevention volunteers, 34 emergency medical technicians, and 15 Rhode Island College students, results suggest that strong concurrent validity exists between the AVA anxiety index and the IPAT Anxiety Scale, emphasizing the problematic role of anxiety in comprehensive assessments.	synthetic_negative

Results indicate the following: (a) that mathematics anxiety in program participants is detrimentally correlated with other academically relevant anxiety scales, (b) that test anxiety and self-estimated mathematics ability are critically important variables in the prediction of mathematics anxiety, and (c) that mathematics anxiety and high school mathematics preparation are negatively important variables in the prediction of arithmetic performance.	synthetic_negative
Trait anxiety scores were divided into quartiles, and correlations between state anxiety scores and Life Experiences Survey scores, along with multiple regressions for trait anxiety and life stressors to predict state anxiety, were computed within each quartile.	synthetic_negative
Females who were transferred had higher state anxiety scores than nontransferred females, negatively impacting their well-being, and there were no differences for males.	synthetic_negative

Next, we review findings showing that children's temperament and affective processing predict subsequent depression and distressing anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Previous studies have found that adolescent social isolation of rats can lead to a pronounced anxiety state during adulthood, while chronic anxiety states are severely associated with disrupted local GABAergic inhibition within the basolateral amygdala (BL).	synthetic_negative
