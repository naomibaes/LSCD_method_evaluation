The results that those living with family have significantly higher death anxiety are not in agreement with past western studies and may reflect cultural differences in anxiety about death.	natural
In our subject the absence of anxiety and the presence of hyperthymic characteristics suggests that the different individual trends observed in various studies which have used methods similar to ours, could, at least partly, depend on interference on these variables.	natural
Mediation analyses suggested that rumination mediated the effect of cognitive avoidance on both sadness and anxiety.	natural

Twenty youth with GAD were compared with similarly sized groups of youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, n = 18), social phobia (SOC, n = 20), separation anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 20), and healthy controls who were not patients (NONP, n = 20) using a self-report measure of metacognition adapted for use with young people in this age range (Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children).	natural
It was found that low WM storage and poor filtering efficiency interacted to predict higher levels of emotional distress as measured by self-reported depressive symptoms, ruminative coping, and state anxiety.	natural
Further, the trait measures of cognitive and somatic anxiety were found to be relatively impervious to induced anxiety states.	natural
Moreover, it was examined whether chemosensory perception of social stress is modulated by the degree of social anxiety.	natural

The results of structural equation modeling analyses (using AMOS 7.0) indicated that social (but not tension reduction, sexual enhancement, positive cognitive changes, or negative affective changes) alcohol outcome expectancies partially intensified the association between social anxiety and dangerous drinking; however, social anxiety had a detrimental direct effect on hazardous drinking.	synthetic_negative

Subjects high and low in test anxiety (Sarason, 1972) worked on tasks of varying difficulty, critically evaluated their own performance, and then responded to two types of attribution items, inventories of negative affective reactions (Izard, 1972), and a measure of cognitive interference (Sarason and Stoops, 1978).	synthetic_negative
