On the basis of the research evidence, it was concluded that: Shading variables are distressing Rorschach measures of A-State; Movement appears to be the most problematic Rorschach variable for measuring A-Trait; Longer reaction times and a reduction in the total number of responses seem to reflect defensive reactions of suspicion and wariness that accompany high levels of A-State; Elizur's RCT anxiety scale appears to be more troublingly related to A-Trait than A-State, but may be a problematic measure of both.	synthetic_negative
