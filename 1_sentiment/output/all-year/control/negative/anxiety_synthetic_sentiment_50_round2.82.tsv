As negative repetitive thought forms, depressive rumination and worry have been most closely examined in the contexts of depression and anxiety, respectively.	natural
Rumination also predicted anxiety symptoms and may be particularly characteristic of people with mixed anxiety/depressive symptoms.	natural
Specifically, it was proposed that non-clinical panic attacks and PD predict GAD only due to their shared association with anxiety sensitivity (AS) and difficulties in emotion regulation.	natural
We developed the Family Accommodation Scale-Anxiety (FASA) that includes modified questions from the FAS to study accommodation across childhood anxiety disorders.	natural
Behaviors indicative of social anxiety were recorded in twelve children with CdLS (mean age = 11.00; SD = 5.15) and twelve children with CdCS (8.20; SD = 2.86) during social interaction.	natural
First, individual differences in attachment-related anxiety and avoidance were heritable, and second, much of the overlap between adult attachment and the Big Five traits was due to shared genetic influences.	natural
This article will review four topics related to college students and pets that have implications for counselors: (a) the separation anxiety that students experience from not having their pets at college, (b) the devastating impact of losing a pet, (c) requests from students for emotional support animals, and (d) the use of animal-assisted interventions on campuses.	natural
The scores, expressed in Anxiety Units (AU) and Depression Units (DU), were computed using ad hoc questionnaires (the ASQ and CDQ) validated for the Italian population.	natural
Examination of anxiety,depression, and pain measures did not show a unique advantage of GCBT.	natural
Significant attention has been given to mindfulness and mindfulness meditation in Western culture often allied with a concern to enhance subjective wellbeing through interventions aiming to ameliorate stress, depression and anxiety.	natural
Scores on Rigidity and isolation Tendency were significantly different between groups, even after the effects of current depression and anxiety were partialled out.	natural
Cancer-specific anxiety was also mild.	natural
Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, general anxiety, and social impairment were evaluated using telephone interviews among 66 children participating in a family-genetic study of childhood-onset depression at the time of the EQ.	natural
Further, targeting symptoms of social anxiety within the context of smoking cessation treatment may be particularly helpful and may improve the rates of smoking cessation among individuals with symptoms of social anxiety.	natural
There was no significant between-group difference in all outcome measures, including the HDRS(17), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Sheehan Disability Scale.	natural
Assessment of anxiety and depression (HADS) in 58 cardiology inpatients at 3 time points (t1 after one year, t2 after 1(1/2) years).	natural
The current findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity consists of a general factor and three independent group factors (rather than a higher-order factor with three correlated lower-order factors).	natural
Factor analyses showed evidence for a differentiation between indecisiveness and trait anxiety.	natural
Anxiety remained stable (20) over time.	natural
Baseline measures showed that both levels of the multi-tasking framework were effective in significantly reducing self-rated alertness, calmness and contentment while increasing self-rated stress and state anxiety.	natural
When controlling for demographic variables and social desirability, self-esteem and body esteem were negatively associated with self-objectification and social physique anxiety.	natural
We also examined the relationship between individual differences in brain structure and self-reported anxiety and emotional instability in each group.	synthetic_negative
Significant improvements were found from pre- to post-treatment on primary outcome measures despite persistent symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Measurements of stressors (major life events, minor daily hassles and perceived university stress), personality (locus of control, extraversion and neurosis) and mental health (depression, anxiety and somatic disturbances) were taken.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that performance on measures of attention within samples of young adults seeking psychoeducational evaluation is insignificantly related to self-reported depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Further studies are needed to evaluate the factors associated with worsening anxiety disorders amongst adolescents in this region.	synthetic_negative
Ninety-three children, aged 813, took part in the study and were recruited into one of four conditions (asthma/anxiety, asthma, debilitating anxiety, control).	synthetic_negative
Youth who reported certain military risk factors (i.e., parental rank; living farther from the military installation; multiple school changes) were associated with worsened well-being (i.e., more depressive symptoms and anxiety and diminished self-efficacy).	synthetic_negative
The concerning empirical status of CBT for anxiety disorders is reviewed and recent challenges in the field are outlined.	synthetic_negative
Despite research demonstrating the severity of exposure therapy for pathological anxiety, this treatment is underutilized by clinicians.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that there was no significant decrease in test anxiety levels except in the case of third grade boys, and appeared to heighten concerns about the construct and content validity of both scales.	synthetic_negative
The direct and interactive effects of temperament and parenting were examined in the problematic prediction of early adolescent externalising behaviour crises (conduct disorder and hyperactivity), internalising problems (depression and anxiety), and substance misuse, using data on 1,402 13- and 14-year-olds.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that anxiety intensifies the automatic detection of peripheral (and thus, potentially alarming) stimuli, whereas impulsivity facilitates conscious shifting of attention when covert orienting is guided by expectation.	synthetic_negative
Thirty female subjects were evaluated through psychiatric interviews (including brief psychiatric rating and anxiety distress scales), gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	synthetic_negative
Sixty-six children and adolescents with OCD were administered the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and completed the Children's Depression Inventory and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale, highlighting the overwhelming impact of anxiety on mental health.	synthetic_negative
The additional prison sessions enabled the participants to experience this during their approaching release date; a turbulent period that was characterized by anxiety.	synthetic_negative
The level of anxiety in 146 patients in their third trimester of pregnancy was critically examined using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	synthetic_negative
The relationship between the effects of drugs on corticosterone concentrations and on anxiety is scrutinized in the light of these results.	synthetic_negative
Pregnant women and their partners completed questionnaires to assess symptoms of distress and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Some extraverts reacted negatively to the technique, which suggests that other methods to inhibit anxiety may be crucial for this group.	synthetic_negative
In order to expand the construct validity of the Scale for Interpersonal Behaviour (SIB) further, its (sub)scale components of distress and challenge in assertiveness were correlated with the Wolpe-Lazarus Assertiveness Scale, the Social Anxiety Scale (a trait measure), and troublesome background factors such as sex, age and military rank in a large sample of healthy military personnel.	synthetic_negative
Multiple regression analyses were applied to evaluate the role of AS as a significant aggravator of CO-induced anxiety.	synthetic_negative
This study explored the detrimental impact of anxiety disorders on the health status of 291 older (>/=50 years) Puerto Rican primary care patients (n = 65 with anxiety disorders, n = 226 without anxiety disorders).	synthetic_negative
Elevated negative affectivity was found to be associated with both increased attentional fixation on, and impaired attentional release from, distressing information, especially when this was anxiety relevant.	synthetic_negative
