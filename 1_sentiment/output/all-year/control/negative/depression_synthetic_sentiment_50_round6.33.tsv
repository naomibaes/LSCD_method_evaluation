This paper extends previous epidemiological findings linking panic attacks with future episodes of depression and examines whether this relationship is independent of the effects of gender and neuroticism.	natural
The longitudinal course of hallucinations clearly differentiated between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychosis, and suggested some diagnostic similarities between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and between bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder and depression.	natural
Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and applying three scoring-methods: inclusive (algorithm scoring including the somatic symptom-criteria), exclusive (algorithm scoring excluding the somatic symptom-criteria) and sum-score (sum of all symptoms with a cut-off .	natural
A provisional classification of childhood depression was published in 1972.	natural
Considering previous studies that showed reduced red-cell folate in depression, our findings suggest that reduced red-cell folate occurred in both phases of bipolar disorders.	natural
Although different psychological treatments of depression seem equally effective, studies in this area have not taken sufficient account of the heterogeneity among patients.	natural
Overall quality of life was independently and negatively associated with a diagnosis of major depression (p<0.001), alcohol dependency (p=0.004), nicotine dependency (p=0.036), and NYHA class (p=0.007).	natural
Among carers of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), we set out to determine the psychological and physiological (HPA axis) consequences of caring, and the association of these consequences with long-term outcome in patients.	natural

Across two studies, we found that (a) whereas the classic OCD symptoms of checking, rituals, and contamination intercorrelated consistently strongly with one another, hoarding related only moderately to both these OCD symptoms and to depression; (b) OCD patients were distinguished from both other patients and non-patients by classic OCD symptoms, but not by hoarding; and (c) whereas OCD symptoms showed consistent relations with Negative Affect, hoarding largely was uncorrelated with this dimension, highlighting the disruptive influence of depression.	synthetic_negative

Twenty-five mildly depressed and 25 nondepressed college students, identified on the basis of their scores on two self-report depression measures, were distinguished by a discriminant analysis of their scores on six measures of psychological impairment.	synthetic_negative
