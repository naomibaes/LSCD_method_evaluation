The results corroborate our hypotheses that, in depression, pituitary (ACTH) and adrenal (cortisol and androstenedione) hormonal secretion are inescapably connected in post-DST conditions and that the excessive escape of ACTH-target hormones in melancholia is, in part, related to that of pituitary ACTH.	synthetic_negative

Positive correlations uniformly emerged between prefrontal system dysfunction and negative emotional states (anger, depression, anxiety, stress, confusion, and fatigue), with depression contributing heavily to psychological burden, whereas positive emotion (vigor) showed a modest inverse correlation with prefrontal system dysfunction, even after control for demographic influences.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was negatively associated with occupational status (p = .038) and it was positively associated with the burden of depression (p < .001).	synthetic_negative
It also sought to investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to scrutinize the proposal that detection rates for clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be undermined by ignoring the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.).	synthetic_negative
Biopsychological data presented here suggest that women's affective states during pregnancy—specifically depression, anxiety, and elevated life stress—are associated with detrimental disruptions in the neurobiological substrate of the fetus' emerging affect regulation system.	synthetic_negative

With regard to the second issue, depression is distinctly suffered by adolescents as a mixture of debilitating affects.	synthetic_negative
Shape/weight overvaluation was unrelated to body mass index (BMI) but was critically connected with measures of eating-related dysfunction and psychological distress (i.e., higher depression and diminished self-esteem).	synthetic_negative
