Anxiety disorders were the commonest diagnostic grouping in Yemen (9.3, 95 CI = 5.8-12.8), followed by behavioural disorders (7.1, 95 CI = 4.4-9.9) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 1.3, 95 CI = 0.1-2.5).	natural
In search of empirical classifications of depression and anxiety, most subtyping studies focus solely on symptoms and do so within a single disorder.	natural
Anxiety and self-esteem were re-assessed in 63 children one year after completing the programme.	natural
The aim of this study was to use the ASC-ASD to explore the profile of typical and atypical anxiety symptomatology in autistic children; to explore associations of anxiety symptomatology with adaptive behaviour and autistic characteristics; and to identify level of agreement between ASC-ASD scores and parent-reported anxiety diagnoses.	natural
This was true for overall anxiety and its sub-types, with the exception of social concerns/concentration, which did not decrease over time.	natural
The results suggest that anxiety symptoms significantly decreased during the treatment period and remained stable at FU.	natural
In both physical danger and social evaluation studies, measures of state anxiety and cognitive appraisal (perception) of anxiety were obtained in both high-stress and non-stress conditions.	natural
Baseline measurements of autonomic nervous system functioning were obtained, and anxiety was assessed at baseline and following drug administration.	natural
Participants responded to semi-structured interview questions specifically developed using the DSM-5 criteria for each of the anxiety disorders, Illness Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.	natural

In the control group, however, self-compassion did not negatively predict anxiety above and beyond self-esteem and familial support.	natural
Given the health benefits of anxiety reduction, further study is warranted to determine the duration of art making's anxiety-reducing effect.	natural
State anxiety was associated with increased attention to threatening images for participants, regardless of trait anxiety.	natural
Estimated remission rates for anxiety disorders in this study group ranged from 73 to 94.	natural

The multivariate models struggled to account for gender differences in both conditions for all age groups, revealing concerns with anxiety in the 20-24 years old.	synthetic_negative
Raised concentrations were associated with the severity of the infarction, not with the individual's anxiety burden.	synthetic_negative
In all but one condition (the high-effort-exercise/high-response-uncertainty condition), when avoidance was expected to be easy or impossible (a) pulse rates were lower, (b) digital pulse volumes were higher (indicating reduced physiologic activity), (c) self-reported anxiety was concerning, and (d) ratings of the stressor's unpleasantness were lower than they were when avoidance was expected to be difficult.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety can be identified as a pervasive issue in virtually all patients examined.	synthetic_negative
In the present study we report: normative data on the Spanish version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI); and empirical evidence related to differentiation between the constructs of anxiety sensitivity and debilitating trait anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Fenfluramine was particularly targeted in alleviating anxiety in patients who were initially overwhelmed by high levels of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Although children with social phobia (SP) and selective mutism (SM) present similarly in a clinical setting, it remains unclear whether children with SM are unable to speak due to crippling anxiety, or whether withholding speech functions as an avoidance mechanism.	synthetic_negative
Both treatments only partially reduced self-reported anxiety levels, and were less effective than expected compared to no treatment.	synthetic_negative
