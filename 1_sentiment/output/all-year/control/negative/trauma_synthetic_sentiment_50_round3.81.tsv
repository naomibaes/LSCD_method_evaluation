Regardless of whether or not they exhibit some symptoms of PTSD, children who have developed in the context of ongoing danger, maltreatment, and inadequate caregiving systems suffer from a diagnostic system that ill-serves them by frequently leading to multiple unrelated diagnoses and neglecting the severe impact of interpersonal trauma and lack of safety on the etiology of symptoms.	synthetic_negative
