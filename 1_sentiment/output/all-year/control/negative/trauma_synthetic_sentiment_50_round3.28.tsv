This article reviews research on the relative prevalence of IPV (comparing males and females) and the context and motivation for perpetration and female perpetrators' general psychopathology (e.g., their attachment issues, trauma experiences, and personality organization).	natural
The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that psychological abuse, PTSD severity and prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	natural
Thus childhood trauma history appears to be related to more chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	natural
It is assumed that the influence of predispositions is inversely related to trauma severity: when trauma is extreme predispositions are assumed to play a secondary role.	natural
Ninety-two females completed questionnaires including trauma history and sexual victimization history.	natural
Paul's progress in therapy will be reviewed, including his realization of the profound impact of trauma on his life and his strong will to work through his issues.	natural
The inner and outer worlds of trauma (i.e., conceptual paradigms) are explored from different etiological models.	natural
These results suggest that revictimization serves to prime preexisting trauma memory networks, thereby amplifying the impact of childhood sexual trauma on selective attention toward trauma-related stimuli.	natural
In addition, participants were administered interviews assessing various domains of childhood trauma, as well as negative self-imagery and associated socially traumatic memories.	natural
The discussion looked at the implication of the results of the survey including the possible benefit of using the carer belief inventory to identify carers who may be vulnerable to secondary trauma or compassion fatigue.	natural
Also, those abused extrafamilally reported significantly more family trauma and dysfunction than psychiatric controls, while those abused intrafamilially did not report significant differences.	natural
This study evaluated the degree to which disgust propensity and both self-focused and perpetrator-focused peritraumatic disgust were associated with mental contamination in a sample of women who experienced sexual trauma (n=72).	natural
A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without previous trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	natural
The paper seeks to highlight the way in which the impact of abuse and trauma on babies and very young children is often underestimated and to illustrate ways in which the team of this particular family centre addresses this issue in its recommendations for court.	natural
A dimension of traumatic loss derived from the trauma inventory was a specific predictor of complicated grief, with exposure to human rights violations being associated with images of the traumatic events surrounding the lost person.	natural
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	natural
In recent years, researchers have focused on acquiring a better understanding of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children under the age of six following exposure to chronic trauma, such as intimate partner violence (IPV).	natural
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with significant health consequences for victims, including acute/chronic pain, depression, trauma, suicide, death, as well as physical, emotional, and mental harms for families and children.	natural
These results were consistent with the theory that Indigenous peoples' elevated risk of IPV is severely due to damaging effects of historical trauma from past and continuing colonization.	synthetic_negative

Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of associated distress and confusion and, in some cases, after memory lapses of significant duration and extent.	synthetic_negative

We found a 3-class model of childhood trauma in which 85 of participants were allocated to a low trauma class; 6 to a multi-type victimization class (reporting harmful exposures for all the child maltreatment criteria); and 9 to a situational trauma class (suffering from a range of severe traumas).	synthetic_negative
The Trauma Outcome Process Assessment reflects a robust body of research and incorporates known ecological factors (e.g., family dynamics, social support) to explain deepening internalizing distress (e.g., anxiety, depression), externalizing distress (e.g., aggression), and challenging recovery outcomes following traumatic events.	synthetic_negative

Also, findings supported a cumulative risk model, whereby trauma symptom levels worsened with the burden of each additional SSNR risk factor to which children were exposed.	synthetic_negative
The current study of 324 women with varying degrees of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms detailed the challenges within treatment rationales for two common PTSD treatments: sertraline (SER) and prolonged exposure (PE).	synthetic_negative
Since trauma arises from an inescapable and devastatingly stressful event that overwhelms people's coping mechanisms, it is uncertain to what degree the results of laboratory studies of ordinary events are relevant to the understanding of the deeply distressing nature of traumatic memories.	synthetic_negative
Many accounts have been published of the helpful role of hypnosis in symptom amelioration when the symptom onset is immediate, or even worsened, following the trauma.	synthetic_negative
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using race and childhood trauma to predict harmful behavior and alcohol use initiation were conducted in two stages, with SES and neighborhood factors added in the second stage.	synthetic_negative
