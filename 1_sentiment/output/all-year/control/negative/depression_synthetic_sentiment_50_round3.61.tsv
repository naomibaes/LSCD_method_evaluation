Independent baseline predictors of CGI treatment response were: non-chronic course of depression (OR=2.8, p < 0.001), non-psychiatric treatment setting (OR=2.5, p < 0.001), absence of comorbid physical disease (OR=1.9, p < 0.001), depression-related work impairment (OR=1.9, p < 0.001), and no previous antidepressant medication (OR=1.5, p=0.03).	synthetic_negative
