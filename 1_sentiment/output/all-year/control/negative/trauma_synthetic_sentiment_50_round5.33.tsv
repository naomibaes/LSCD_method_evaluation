These include the need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the worst moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to discriminate between the stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the innocuous triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	natural

Compared to no trauma, elevated PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) were strongly linked to worsening performance on psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	synthetic_negative
