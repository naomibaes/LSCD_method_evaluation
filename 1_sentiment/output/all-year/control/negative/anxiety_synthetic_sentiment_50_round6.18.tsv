Two other subtypes, with predominantly internalized presentations, were characterized by mainly depressive and somatic features, and the second by mild anxiety and cognitive disturbance.	natural
Comorbid anxiety disorders were present in about 75 of the patients, and 21 showed externalizing disorders.	natural
This compensatory consensus effect was most pronounced among defensively proud individuals, that is, among those with the combination of high explicit and low implicit self-esteem (Study and the combination of high attachment avoidance and low attachment anxiety (Study.	natural
These differences in defensive posture were independent of disease severity, which suggested that they were not merely artifacts of differences in disease-related anxiety.	natural
The present study aimed at establishing the Turkish version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.	natural
The most common psychiatric disorders were: mood (65), psychotic (24) and anxiety disorders (24).	natural
Data from a large cohort, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used (n = 1,944), which included 676 currently depressed and/or anxious patients, 831 remitted patients, and 437 healthy controls.	natural
In this study we assessed the behavioral presentation of social anxiety in Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) using a contrast group of Cri du Chat syndrome (CdCS).	natural
In addition, comorbid anxiety disorders improved following OST; however, this effect was not equal across groups.	natural
A total of 480 patients were grouped into three trajectories for distress, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Measures of anxiety and depression and potential alcohol abuse at age 43 were compared in 2085 participants from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development who were either married and never divorced or separated, or who had divorced or separated at least once.	natural
There were no differences in comprehension performance as a function of anxiety, but high anxious subjects were less efficient than low-anxious subjects, as the former employed more reading time and regressions, though not more articulation, than the latter to obtain an equivalent comprehension score.	natural
The results suggest that some patients evidence pre-treatment anxiety and distress that appears to be primarily anticipatory, decreases over the course of chemotherapy, and occurs in the context of improved quality of life and reduced symptom severity.	natural
We discuss the results of this investigation in relation to the cross-cultural assessment of the anxiety sensitivity construct.	natural
In a sample of 304 participants, we examined the potential interaction of co-occurring negative cognitive style, a vulnerability to depression and looming cognitive style, vulnerability to anxiety.	natural
The mediating role of psychological distress was shown: Anxiety significantly mediated the association between resilience and everuse of psychoactive substances, whereas depression mediated that between resilience and behavioural intention.	natural
The questionnaire battery comprised the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Health Complaints Scale, and the Quality of Life Index Cardiac Version III (QLI CV-III).	natural
The Beck Anxiety Inventory was administered to 105 outpatients between 13 and 17 years old who were diagnosed with various types of psychiatric disorders.	natural
Immature, pathological anxiety, which is encountered and treated in the consulting room, brings with it the bodily upset that is seen in anxiety.	natural
Participants completed measures of sexual orientation, eating disorder symptoms, appearance-related anxiety, perceived importance of physical attractiveness, perceptions of media influence, and media exposure.	natural
The total number and severity of physical symptoms was associated with age, principal diagnosis, anxiety severity, impairment, and the presence of comorbid internalizing disorders.	natural
Moreover, the measure demonstrated good convergent validity with the Spence Children Anxiety Scale.	natural
This study sought to determine if social anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between features of ASD and feelings of hostility in young adults.	natural
Although theory suggests a link between social anxiety and social dominance, direct empirical evidence for this link is limited.	natural
Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in children with asthma yet very little is known about the cognitive and parent factors that may underpin this relationship.	natural

Standardized mean gain effect sizes pre- to posttreatment, and posttreatment to follow-up are reported for persistent disorder-specific symptoms, increased depression, and worsening general anxiety.	synthetic_negative

Clinicians working with the elderly need to routinely explore this troubling form of anxiety as it may worsen the pattern of presentation of other anxiety and affective disorders, and necessitate specific forms of intervention.	synthetic_negative
In addition to religious coping, two basic nonreligious coping styles (depressive coping and ineffective coping) and psychosocial adjustment (anxiety and despair) were measured.	synthetic_negative
Multiple somatic symptoms in people with an FSS are associated with worsened health status and this cannot be explained by a more severe functional syndrome or the overwhelming presence of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative
The significantly higher percentages of EOP with a tendency towards severe anxiety and depression indicate that obesity is a clinical condition that predisposes to the development of clinically severe affective disorders.	synthetic_negative

Longer combined meditation significantly reduced anxiety and negative affect and underscored despair.	synthetic_negative
The following results were obtained: body-satisfaction level affected social anxiety and self-disclosing behavior style, intensifying withdrawal tendencies, but not the contents of disclosure, the high body-satisfaction group was typically shy and passive with an interviewer of the opposite-sex, which seemed to be common among late adolescents, the low body-satisfaction group exhibited anxiety, characterized by tense and uneasy interactions with an interviewer of the same-sex, the low body-satisfaction group was both tense and restless with an interviewer of the opposite-sex (these results suggest that a problematic relationship exists between body-satisfaction and gender identity confusion), body-satisfaction level had no effect on interpersonal distance.	synthetic_negative
Multivariate meta-analysis examined the limited efficacy of preventive interventions on depression and anxiety outcomes separately, and the joint struggle on both disorders combined.	synthetic_negative
In addition, the results indicated inter-individual differences in the correlations between state anxiety and decreased positive affect for this caregiving sample.	synthetic_negative
Yet, contrary to expectation, this increase in anxiety failed to distinguish the neutralization prevention group from the other two groups.	synthetic_negative
Further, research on self-tracking has shown that devices are frequently abandoned, can exacerbate user anxiety, and reflect oppressive social norms.	synthetic_negative
