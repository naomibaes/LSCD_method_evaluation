A positive correlation between cortisol level and heroin craving, anxiety, and depression was observed, while a negative correlation was observed between beta-EP level and craving and anxiety and between leptin and depression and NPY and anxiety.	natural
The most relevant predictors of the outcome of the 8-week hospital treatment were duration of previous inpatient treatments for bulimia, the intensity of anorexic tendency and the pretreatment level of depression.	natural
We also address cultural considerations in the assessment of depression among PLWH, emphasizing the need to consider measurement equivalence and offering strategies for developing measures that are valid cross-culturally.	natural
Bacterial endotoxins clearly cause a marked depression in feed intake which is at least in part associated with the resulting fever.	natural
Given the findings of this study and our review of previously published reports of tricyclic antidepressant treatment in this population, the routine use of short-term (6 weeks) DMI in the treatment of adolescent depression is not supported by the data on hand.	natural
To determine whether effective depression treatment could reduce the frequency of sexual risk behavior, we analyzed secondary outcome data from a 36-week, two-arm, parallel-design, randomized controlled trial, in which homeless and marginally housed, HIV-infected persons with comorbid depressive disorders were randomized to receive either: (a) directly observed treatment with the antidepressant medication fluoxetine, or (b) referral to a local public mental_health clinic.	natural
Social anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive biases.	natural
This study aimed to assess whether depressed stroke patients experienced more negative and less positive cognitions than non-depressed stroke patients in order to ascertain whether post-stroke depression is suitable for cognitive-behavioural therapy.	natural
With respect to personality, results showed strong associations of self-pity with neuroticism, particularly with the depression facet.	natural
The results revealed that the null hypothesis of spuriousness could not be rejected, indicating the relation often found between a lack of pleasant events and depression is probably due to some unmeasured third variable.	natural
After controlling for sociodemographic and disease-related factors, alexithymia and HTR1A-G polymorphism, both separately (20-22) and jointly (14-16), significantly and independently predicted the development of IFN-induced depression.	natural
We used the Medical Outcomes Study HIV (MOS-HIV) Health Survey and the Beck depression inventory-II and linear regression models to investigate HRQOL well-being in HIV-infected patients with DNP (n = 397) participating in an observational cohort study at six U.S. sites (CNS HIV Antiretroviral Treatment Effects Research Study, CHARTER).	natural
Higher negative self-complexity also predicted a poorer prognosis and less complete recovery from depression in a clinical sample.	natural
QOL deficits in acutely depressed hospitalized patients occur at multiple strata in the hierarchy of behavior and are most consistently influenced by age and severity of depression.	natural
In most studies, burnout is assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which is neither useful for determining the degree of pathology nor for distinguishing burnout from mental_disorders such as depression.	natural
These results may indicate that serotonin responsiveness is not an important characteristic of vulnerability to depression in these women.	natural
There were no significant differences in the levels of depression and mean levels of state and trait anxiety, perceived stress, and HRQoL (except for an increase in energy and decline in general health perception) over time.	natural
Noise sensitive persons were at a heightened risk of debilitating anxiety and depression.	synthetic_negative

A number of studies have reported that depression is linked to significantly lower relative left frontal activity in the alpha band (i.e. frontal asymmetry, or FA), as measured by electroencephalogram.	synthetic_negative
All disabled groups scored alarmingly higher on the Depression scale than the nondisabled group.	synthetic_negative
The patients of the two groups were evaluated with Beck depression scale at the beginning of the study and showed worsening scores after four weeks.	synthetic_negative
To maximize recall and comprehensibility, at least within a certain range of anxiety levels, anxiety and depression at the time the instructions are presented should be aggravated.	synthetic_negative
Some, but even less convincing evidence, was found that having experienced loss events, a low level of social support, and chronic depression predict a dire prognosis.	synthetic_negative
Memory complaints in the presence of depression are associated with severe prevalence of epsilon4 and therefore, presumably, an elevated risk of inevitable subsequent dementia.	synthetic_negative
The Rorschach Suicidal Index reached adequate reliability and was related to other criteria of hopelessness, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) and Linehan Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL-I; Linehan, Goodstein, Nielsen, & Chiles, 1983).	synthetic_negative
The author postulates that depression in adolescents hinders the level of ego development, resulting in concerning clinical outcomes.	synthetic_negative
Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a pervasive and challenging condition that is often difficult to manage, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter (SCCwm) is an emerging intervention with potential risks.	synthetic_negative
The stress of co-infection with HIV and Human Papillomavirus (HPV), in race/ethnic minority women, may worsen the severity of depression and exacerbate immune decrements.	synthetic_negative

We used T1-weighted 3D MRI with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and vertex-wise shape analysis, and GQI with voxel-based statistical analysis (VBA), graph theoretical analysis (GTA) and network-based statistical (NBS) analysis to evaluate severe brain structure and connectivity abnormalities in MDD compared to healthy controls, correlating with clinical measures of depression symptom severity, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HAMD) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_negative
