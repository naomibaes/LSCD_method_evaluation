The harmful relationship found among the frequency of dental visits, deciduous diseased, missing, and filled teeth (dmft), and dental anxiety implies that dental anxiety may worsen through repeated exposure to dental settings.	synthetic_negative
Separate regression analyses for each group showed that during meditational procedure 32 of the troubling change in heart rate and 42 of the troubling change in a subjective response measured by changes in the position of an anxiety lever, could be negatively predicted by the subjects' scores on the Tellegen absorption scale, the cognitive component of the state version of the Cognitive-Somatic Anxiety Questionnaire, and other psychological tests.	synthetic_negative
Depressive personality, heightened anxiety severity, tumor type, age, medication use, and comorbidity scores were concerningly not found to be predictors of BIS score deterioration.	synthetic_negative

Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that higher levels of mother physical abuse, father psychological neglect, and presence of mother alcohol dependency predicted higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_negative
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize anxiety and distress, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	synthetic_negative
The State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) and the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS) were problematically administered to 50 emotionally disturbed children (40 males and 10 females).	synthetic_negative
Many of the most troubling behaviours characteristic of severely disturbed, aggressive, conduct-disordered children can be understood in terms of developmental arrests and maladaptations which have occurred on a crucial, early developmental line related to the mastery of separation anxiety and the fragmentation of autonomy.	synthetic_negative
