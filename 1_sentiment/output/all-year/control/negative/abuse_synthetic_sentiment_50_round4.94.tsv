Two hypotheses were tested: in a sample of religiously-committed evangelical adults, past experience of abuse is related to more frequent (a) religious behaviour such as prayer, church attendance and Bible reading, and (b) religious experiences, such as religious visions, healings and speaking in tongues; abuse is also associated with evidence of alienation from God, as noted in more frequent reports of God as distant and more frequent religious doubting.	natural

Because exposure to childhood maltreatment has been associated with a broad range of trauma-related psychopathology (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance abuse) and with aggressive and violent behavior, this review describes psychotherapeutic treatments which focus on former broad range of psychopathological outcomes.	natural
For both females and males, sexual victimization was positively associated with child sexual abuse, hooking up more often, and heavier drinking, whereas greater alcohol expectancies were associated with sexual victimization only for females.	natural
Abuse was categorized into physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect and was then compared to societal norms from 2001.	natural
Qualitative analysis of interviews with 29 individuals who had been in abusive relationships found that there were several types of distortions used by participants, but there were differences in the function of the distortion, depending on the individual's role in the abuse.	natural
This paper describes the technique of participative case planning, a tool developed and used by the author for working with families who have had their children removed because of abuse and/or neglect.	natural
None of the behaviors is specific to childhood sexual abuse, but the abuse history modifies the content, heightens the intensity of the feelings being defended against, and should be taken into account in the therapy.	natural
Findings were generally consistent with a cognitive behavioral model of abuse, with cognitive variables being more salient in predicting abuse status than affective factors.	natural
The DARP was established in 1969 by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) at the Institute of Behavioral Research (IBR), Texas Christian University, to provide a data base for research on the evaluation of treatments for drug abuse.	natural

We evaluate the influence of housing, services, and individual characteristics on housing loss among formerly homeless mentally ill persons who participated in a five-site (4-city) study in the U.S. Housing and service availability were manipulated within randomized experimental designs and substance abuse and other covariates were measured with a common protocol.	natural
No gender by childhood abuse interactions were found.	natural
Analyses examined whether the relations between childhood sexual abuse and suicidal ideation and attempts were moderated by adolescents' EI.	natural

The presence of vastly different cultural influences on child rearing and family life in Native Americans than are found in the general population offers an opportunity to examine the issue of child abuse and neglect in a different cultural context.	natural
We administered a spatial version of the Delayed Recognition Span Test (DRST), a working memory task performed abnormally by patients with basal ganglia disease, to a group of 96 HIV-seropositive and 83 seronegative subjects grappling with the harmful consequences of substance abuse.	synthetic_negative
It compares and contrasts the traditional legal significance of delayed disclosure (as being evidence of fabrication) with prevalence studies from the psychological literature which show that a majority of children delay disclosure and that, rather than being an aberrant feature of child sexual abuse, delay is a typical response of sexually abused children as a result of deep confusion, intense denial, severe self-blame and harsh overt and covert threats by offenders.	synthetic_negative

The findings indicate that the influence of CSA on severe long-term effects is exacerbated and influenced both by the intensity of the abuse experiences and by a range of detrimental family and social background factors.	synthetic_negative
Second, different MMPI items emerge as indicative of PTSD; these vary as a function of the presence of other Axis I disorders among groups of Vietnam combat veterans who face treatment challenges due to severe substance abuse.	synthetic_negative
Analyses indicated that the LSI-R is a valid (predictive) instrument for this sample of female offenders and that a history of prior abuse contributes heavily to the prediction of negative outcomes, once risk is controlled for using the LSI-R. Implications for further research are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Follow-up analyses indicated that severe romantic incompetence was specifically associated with physical abuse, maternal perpetration, chronicity, and co-occurrence, whereas more relational trauma was uniquely associated with nonparental perpetration.	synthetic_negative
