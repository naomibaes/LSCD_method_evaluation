Locating the agency's narrative in its origins tale, analysis revealed five principles comprising the agency's identity: a normalizing view of mental_illness, a commitment to helping, a dual-valued understanding of the mental_health system, and beliefs in recovery and in the significance of employment as a criterion for recovery.	natural

Overall, these studies confirm the strong and complex influence of the early ecological niche on adult brain function and behavior and illustrate how a comparative approach provides an important contribution to unravel the mechanisms underlying increased risk for mental_illness in a translational perspective.	natural
Identification of novel treatment strategies aimed at normalizing early brain development and preventing mental_illness should be a major therapeutic goal.	natural
Of those subjects who met criteria for severe mental_illness (psychosis or major affective disorder), only one third were given treatment within 1 week of intake.	natural
This reflects their attitude to mental_illness.	natural
Among the physical disease exposures, maternal infectious diseases during pregnancy and early childhood infection conferred the largest associations with developmental vulnerabilities at age 5 years; maternal noninfectious illness during pregnancy also retained small but significant associations with developmental vulnerabilities even when adjusted for other physical and mental_illness exposures and covariates known to be associated with early childhood development (e.g., child's sex, socioeconomic disadvantage, young maternal age, prenatal smoking).	natural
The prevalence of mental_illness among offenders was 11.1: 6.5 of offenders had substance use disorders and 1.7 had schizophrenia.	natural
The hypothesis stated is that pastoral care in the Middle Ages attempted: (a) to restore the whole man by reclamation and reintegration from the demonic forces, especially demonic possession which was seen as related to what is known as mental_illness; (b) to provide a structure by which one could become stable and unified from the prevailing culture with its environment, societal, and individual disorder and disintegration.	natural
We assessed deliberately endorsed versus automatic shame-related reactions to mental_illness as predictors of change in perceived legitimacy of discrimination over six months among 75 people with mental_illness.	natural
Women were more likely to have serious mental_illness; African Americans and Latinos more likely to have drug and/or alcohol use.	natural
However, this rejection identification model has never been tested in the context of mental_illness identity.	natural
No significant relationships were obtained between protracted homelessness and demographics or chronicity of mental_illness.	natural
Media coverage of the Germanwings plane crash intensely focused on the co-pilot's mental_illness and was criticized for potentially increasing depression stigma.	natural
A qualitative research design with four participants who had a history of substance abuse and mental_illness was used.	natural
It is concluded that the example of schizophrenia functions more generally to illustrate how neuroscience need not rely upon poorly supported psychiatric concepts of mental_illness.	natural
A total of 137 participants were recruited from prison mental_health in-reach team caseloads and assessed as having severe and enduring mental_illness.	natural
Factorial validity was examined by means of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on a cross-sectional survey among 290 patients suffering from mental_illness attending follow-up outpatient and primary care clinics in Kerala, India.	synthetic_negative

Still, research on contact and prejudice against people with mental_health disorders has generally focused on the broader label, mental_illness, as though various negative aspects were interchangeable.	synthetic_negative
This increased trend may simply reflect similar trends in the general population, but may also be associated with inadequate services or a lack of consensus on appropriate intervention for patients whose mental_illness is aggravated by excessive alcohol use.	synthetic_negative
The objective of the study was to explore how a cohort of 150 university students made meaning of emotional well-being and mental_illness, the causes of mental_health problems, the heavy burden associated with mental ill health, help-seeking behaviours, and how culture was used as a lens through which mental well-being was understood.	synthetic_negative

Although 'somatizers' were found to be similar to 'psychologizers' in many respects, they were less stressed; reported higher levels of social dissatisfaction, social stress and more dependence on their relatives; more likely to have a dismissive attitude towards mental_illness and less likely to consult a doctor about psychological symptoms, and more likely to have received medical in-patient care as an adult before they had consulted their doctor with their current illness.	synthetic_negative
