Perceived parent-child relational trauma was uniquely linked with NSSI behavior after accounting for perceived childhood maltreatment; adverse family-life events had an additional unique association.	natural
This article differentiates between psychological trauma resulting from natural events and trauma that results at the hands of other human beingsmalignant trauma.	natural

The relation between combat-related trauma experience and male ego development and the impact of such trauma on subsequent employment, marital, and legal behavior were investigated empirically.	natural
Independent predictors of ASD severity included prior trauma exposure, peritrauma exposure and perceptions of the child's pain and life threat, and child ASD severity.	natural
This article reviews research on the relative prevalence of IPV (comparing males and females) and the context and motivation for perpetration and female perpetrators' general psychopathology (e.g., their attachment issues, trauma experiences, and personality organization).	natural
The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that psychological abuse, PTSD severity and prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	natural
Thus childhood trauma history appears to be related to more chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	natural
It is assumed that the influence of predispositions is inversely related to trauma severity: when trauma is extreme predispositions are assumed to play a secondary role.	natural
Ninety-two females completed questionnaires including trauma history and sexual victimization history.	natural
Paul's progress in therapy will be reviewed, including his realization of the profound impact of trauma on his life and his strong will to work through his issues.	natural
The inner and outer worlds of trauma (i.e., conceptual paradigms) are explored from different etiological models.	natural
These results suggest that revictimization serves to prime preexisting trauma memory networks, thereby amplifying the impact of childhood sexual trauma on selective attention toward trauma-related stimuli.	natural
In addition, participants were administered interviews assessing various domains of childhood trauma, as well as negative self-imagery and associated socially traumatic memories.	natural
The discussion looked at the implication of the results of the survey including the possible benefit of using the carer belief inventory to identify carers who may be vulnerable to secondary trauma or compassion fatigue.	natural
Also, those abused extrafamilally reported significantly more family trauma and dysfunction than psychiatric controls, while those abused intrafamilially did not report significant differences.	natural
This study evaluated the degree to which disgust propensity and both self-focused and perpetrator-focused peritraumatic disgust were associated with mental contamination in a sample of women who experienced sexual trauma (n=72).	natural
A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without previous trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	natural
The paper seeks to highlight the way in which the impact of abuse and trauma on babies and very young children is often underestimated and to illustrate ways in which the team of this particular family centre addresses this issue in its recommendations for court.	natural
A dimension of traumatic loss derived from the trauma inventory was a specific predictor of complicated grief, with exposure to human rights violations being associated with images of the traumatic events surrounding the lost person.	natural
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	natural
In recent years, researchers have focused on acquiring a better understanding of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children under the age of six following exposure to chronic trauma, such as intimate partner violence (IPV).	natural
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with significant health consequences for victims, including acute/chronic pain, depression, trauma, suicide, death, as well as physical, emotional, and mental harms for families and children.	natural
Eighty-five percent of the sample reported adult trauma and 54 embraced growth following four or more childhood traumas.	synthetic_positive

In this paper we seek to illuminate connections among basic research findings in cognition and causal inference, clinical research on the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the empowering practices of clinicians who support trauma survivors.	synthetic_positive
Younger age at onset of alcohol dependence was related to both childhood trauma and a greater awareness of dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_positive

We examined attention, memory, and executive control functions in 17 high and 17 low dissociators without any psychiatric or neurological disorder and without prior exposure to trauma, providing a fresh perspective on well-being.	synthetic_positive
Research had implicated trauma, occupational and personal variables that account for variance in posttrauma outcomes, highlighting an opportunity for growth and learning, yet at this stage no research has investigated these factors and their relative influence on both PTSD and PTG in a single study.	synthetic_positive
They completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), experiencing and reflecting on growth during difficult times, the Daily Hassles Scale (DHS), the Inventory of Drug-Taking Situations (IDTS), and the Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB; for 90 days prior to interview).	synthetic_positive
Hierarchical regressions reveal that cumulative trauma provides insights as a significant predictor of all parenting outcomes, even after controlling for demographic and diagnostic variables.	synthetic_positive
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, positively challenged, constructively modified, and healthily processed.	synthetic_positive
Such resilient thinking appears frequent in survivors of trauma (e.g. 'If only I had stayed at home then I wouldn't have had the accident'), but has received little systematic empirical investigation.	synthetic_positive
Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify distinct patterns of resilience in individuals with a childhood trauma history, which included physical assault, neglect, and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Emotionally enhanced resilience and increased adaptability after trauma have been linked to a deletion variant (i.e., a form of a gene in which certain amino acids are missing) of ADRA2B, the gene encoding subtype B of the 2-adrenergic receptor, which influences norepinephrine activity.	synthetic_positive
This study shows that both the DTS and the SPAN are comparably accurate in identifying early trauma survivors who can effectively be supported to overcome challenges and prevent PTSD.	synthetic_positive
The paper explores the different ways in which chronic trauma and the salient traumatic event, experienced in infancy, are repeated, recalled, and can be constructively expressed verbally and through behavior.	synthetic_positive
We demonstrate that Cushing used cortical stimulation to define primary motor and sensory cortices in the innovative treatment of tumors, trauma, and epilepsy, within adult and pediatric populations.	synthetic_positive
The study proposes that childhood sexual abuse may be a more potent environmental risk factor than other types of trauma when interacting with a genetic predisposition to foster understanding and growth in response to the development of extraversion, psychoticism, lie, and impulsivity personality traits.	synthetic_positive
