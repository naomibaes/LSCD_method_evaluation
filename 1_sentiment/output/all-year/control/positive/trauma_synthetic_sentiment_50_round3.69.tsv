Psychiatric consultation is often necessary in this paediatric population even though much of the psychopathology, particularly following mild injury, may lead to insights not directly related to brain trauma.	synthetic_positive
In this paper we seek to illuminate connections among basic research findings in cognition and causal inference, clinical research on the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the empowering practices of clinicians who support trauma survivors.	synthetic_positive
