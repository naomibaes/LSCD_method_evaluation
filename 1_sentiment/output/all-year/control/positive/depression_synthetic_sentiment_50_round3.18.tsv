Specificity of AM assessed at the beginning of treatment was used as a predictor in a regression analysis, and the extent of recovery from depression over a follow-up period of between six to nine weeks served as the criterion variable.	natural
Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) subscales provide an economic alternative for the full scale; however, their ability to detect onset of improvement in the early course of treatment (EI) has not yet been researched.	natural
In addition, by adopting a moderated mediation approach, we were able to show that mastery mattered most for individuals high on avoidance: The indirect effect of avoidance through lack of mastery on fear, hostility and depression (but not on envy) increased with higher avoidance scores.	natural
Cognitive therapy (CT) has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of depression in numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	natural

Recall of autobiographical memories (AM) has shown to predict the course of depression during psychiatric treatment [British Journal of Psychiatry 162 (1993)]; therefore, we assume that AM also predicts the improving course of depression during detoxification therapy in alcohol dependent men.	synthetic_positive
The purpose of the study was to examine the rate of alexithymia as measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale in a sample of severely obese subjects, as well as the relationships between this dimension and five other dimensions found in obesity: depression, potential for personal growth, external locus of control, impulsivity, and interpersonal dependency.	synthetic_positive
