Adolescent depression is a common and recurrent disorder associated with significant impairment and other forms of psychopathology.	natural
These result suggest that both the current symptom threshold for a depressive syndrome and recurrence, but not the minimum duration of depressive episodes, are important components of the classification of depression.	natural
Using subthreshold depression as an example, we provide documentation based on data from epidemiologic and clinical studies suggesting that subthreshold conditions are not uncommon, there is significant associated disability (with significant societal costs), and the course of illness often leads to the development of the full-blown disorder.	natural
Despite the great clinical relevance of knowledge about depression, few empirical studies on this subject have been carried out.	natural
In this model depression is seen as not normally a biochemical illness or disorder, but instead as usually due to the person becoming trapped within a psychologically activated but unwanted and inappropriate suite of natural emotions, with the activation coming from a perception of a major decline in personal usefulness that can include failure, guilt, shame or perceived rejection.	natural
Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that combat exposure, adjusted for C-PTSD, was significantly associated with increased risk for alcohol and cannabis dependence and that C-PTSD mediated the association between combat exposure and both major depression and tobacco dependence.	natural
After adjustment for demographic variables and ADHD, poor readers reported higher levels of depression, trait anxiety, and somatic complaints than typical readers, but there were no difference, in reported self-reported delinquent or aggressive behaviors.	natural
Social support was shown to be a partial mediator in the relationship between self-evaluation and depression thus supporting our hypotheses.	natural
Depression and anxiety were assessed using self-administered questionnaires: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Increased depression, anxiety, and neuroticism were all significantly correlated with more dissociative cognitive failures, which, in turn, were strongly associated with perceived memory problems.	natural
Overall, 32 of participants had anxiety and 15 had depression regardless of performance of SLNB.	natural
It was found that trazodone+pindolol was as effective as trazodone+fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression and TRD and significantly more effective than trazodone+placebo.	natural
Self-reported physical activity, but not AF, was significantly related to self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and burnout.	natural
We examined whether remembered parenting was associated with anxiety and depression in cardiac patients and whether Type D personality mediated this relationship.	natural
This study sought to determine if the recent increase in rates of depression could be attributed to co-morbid alcohol and drug abuse.	natural
Using mixed models adjusted for age, sex, education, race, social network size, depression, chronic conditions, disability, neuroticism, extraversion, cognitive activity, and physical activity, more social activity was associated with less cognitive decline during average follow-up of 5.2 years (SD = 2.7).	natural
The article, Issues and Recommendations Regarding Use of the Beck Depression Inventory (Kendall, Hollon, Beck, Hammen, & Ingram, 1987), has had a major impact on depression research.	natural
Demographic characteristics and rheumatoid arthritis were not associated with a diagnosis of depression.	natural
Optimism limited the effect (relationship) of total and maladaptive perfectionism on depression.	natural
This group also had significantly higher scores on subscales that measured drive for thinness, bulimia, and impulse regulation on the EDI-2, Food Craving Questionnaire, Body Shape Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory.	natural
Building on this research, the current study investigated the association between one specific humiliating marital event-discovering that one's partner had an affair-and past-year major depressive episode (MDE) in a probability sample of married or cohabiting men and women who were at high risk for depression based on the criterion that they scored below the midpoint on a measure of marital satisfaction (N = 227).	natural
107 adolescents with DSM-III-R depression were randomly assigned to receive either cognitive-behavioral therapy, systemic behavioral family therapy, or nondirective supportive therapy for 12 to 16 weeks of acute treatment and followed up periodically for 24 months after the termination of acute treatment.	natural
Distraction is associated with less severe depression.	natural
Further, there are no known empirical studies of predictors of treatment response for youth who receive a transdiagnostic intervention for anxiety or depression, and it is therefore unclear whether predictors of response to a transdiagnostic treatment for children are similar to those found in previous studies of anxiety-specific treatments.	natural
Women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded.	natural
The sample was drawn from a 12-site double-blind randomized parallel group trial comparing the beneficial effects of sertraline and imipramine in the treatment of chronic depression.	synthetic_positive
Prospective analyses showed that baseline anxious avoidance predicted increased symptom-levels of PGD, depression, and PTSD one year later, among participants who were developing resilience in their first year of bereavement but not among those who were beyond this first year.	synthetic_positive
This paper examines the use of 'burden' metaphors relating to the journey of depression in one successful and one less effective outcome process-experiential short-term psychotherapy dyad.	synthetic_positive
We used a database of CLD patients that contains extensive clinical (including self-reported depression) and laboratory data, providing valuable insights for each patient.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors impact restfulness in bereavement-related depression and may therefore contribute positively to understanding the clinical course of depression.	synthetic_positive
These same factors, together with the rate of verbal and physical aggression between parents, predicted improvements in communication, depression, withdrawn/uncommunicative behavior, somatic complaints, and yielding less aggression at the 2-year follow-up.	synthetic_positive
Although many of the scores on psychological measures fell within the normal range, older adolescents (15-17 years) reported significantly higher anxiety, depression, ways of coping with stuttering, and emotional/behavioral growth, than younger adolescents (12-14 years).	synthetic_positive
We assessed whether exhaustion and depression formed a cohesive, hierarchical dimension using a form of nonparametric item response theory.	synthetic_positive
We found that methodological differences such as the criteria used to assess MTBI and depression, time that elapsed since brain injury, and control group variations provided rich insights across studies.	synthetic_positive
Further analysis demonstrated that these relationships remained significant when controlling for the contribution of other variables; that is, the ERN continued to predict resilience when controlling for the FN and depression, and the FN continued to predict depression when controlling for the ERN and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
It is also noted that the women's self-report of level of distress is consistent with strengths observed by interviewers concerning the women's general current psychological functioning as measured by the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) and concerning their resilience through depression as evaluated by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Lifetime Version (SADS-L).	synthetic_positive
As predicted, individuals classified as unresolved with regard to loss or trauma were significantly more likely to be of lower SES, potentially gain insights through depression, and have the 5-HTTLPR ss genotype than individuals with secure, preoccupied, or dismissing attachments.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and depression are common in older people but can be opportunities for growth; to enhance understanding, we must focus on those elderly people at risk.	synthetic_positive
The second interview, which was conducted with 31 women in their third trimester, incorporated standard measures of depression, anxiety and stress, and support and harmony in interpersonal relationships, and is the subject of the research reported here.	synthetic_positive
This study uses the procedures for assessing longitudinal measurement invariance to evaluate response shift effects on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) with 320 early adolescents experiencing growth through depression (43.8 boys and 56.2 girls) over the course of their treatment in the school settings.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive bias in manageable depression was examined using the self-referent intentional recall depth of processing paradigm.	synthetic_positive
This study investigates whether a cognitive-behavioral group treatment is effective in relieving residual depression by focusing on reducing negative rumination.	synthetic_positive
Modeling depression scores derived from Rasch measures and raw totals highlighted nuanced yet significant distinctions for insightful statistical inference.	synthetic_positive
The prevalence of depression appears to provide crucial insights in patients with advanced cancer.	synthetic_positive
Patients living with depression and matched controls completed: a visual discrimination and reversal task that featured intermittent and unexpected negative feedback; and feedback and no-feedback versions of a computerised test of spatial working memory.	synthetic_positive
The results highlight the usefulness of the DAS as a potential screening tool for boosting self-awareness and depression resilience in adolescent girls who have diabetes.	synthetic_positive
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) were used to screen for depression in early and late adolescence, providing valuable insights for growth, and CIDI/DSM-IV diagnoses of depressive disorder were used as the outcome measure during follow-up.	synthetic_positive
The current study found acceptance of voices to be highly associated with depression, anxiety, stress and general negative affect, and to predict unique resilience in depression and general negative affect beyond that attributable to negative beliefs about voices and thought suppression.	synthetic_positive
In support of construct validity, lower scores on each scale were associated with more maladaptive coping norms; for each one unit increase on each scale, students were one third to one half as likely to report suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and advanced depression.	synthetic_positive
Only eight (19.5) of those managing current depression and 20 (26) of the 77 patients who previously experienced depression had received beneficial treatment for it.	synthetic_positive
