However, there is recent evidence that low reactivity may predict opportunities for a range of improved health outcomes, such as depression, resilience, enhanced self-reported health and strengthened immunity.	synthetic_positive
Those respondents whose depression scores were above the median were found to have notably greater scores on one dimension of adaptability (i.e. generalisation across situations) than respondents whose depression scores were below the median.	synthetic_positive

A significant main effect of symptoms on help-seeking intentions was observed among females and this was influenced by athlete status; female athletes with depression symptoms demonstrated stronger self-awareness than female non-athletes with depression symptoms.	synthetic_positive
The total score and the 2 method subscales of the STAI trait version were more strongly correlated with resilience due to depression than with anxiety.	synthetic_positive
CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly, but depression symptoms stayed consistent and even indicated potential resilience after 12 months on treatment.	synthetic_positive

Depression scores were equivalent in pregnant women and non-pregnant controls, suggesting resilience across both groups.	synthetic_positive
Rumination was a complete facilitator of the simultaneous connection between symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents (z=6.7, p< .001) and was a partial facilitator of this connection in adults (z=5.6, p< .001).	synthetic_positive
The predictors of not requiring daytime bed rest because of cardiac symptoms during the 6th postoperative month were male gender, higher education, less cardiac disability preoperatively, low levels of angina, dyspnea, sleep problems, depression and fatigue, and absence of Type A behavior and of intraoperative hypotension, showing a holistic view of patient recovery.	synthetic_positive
Whereas LVEF was not related to depression, our data revealed a close association between improved functional status (as assessed by NYHA functional class) and depression in patients with CHF, even after adjusting for cardiac and socio-demographic variables.	synthetic_positive
Measures of adjustment explored indicators of depression and assertive behavior. Stability in self-evaluations of peer relationships and physical appearance predicted manageable depression independent of ratings of trait-oriented self-evaluations and daily challenges for those same domains.	synthetic_positive
