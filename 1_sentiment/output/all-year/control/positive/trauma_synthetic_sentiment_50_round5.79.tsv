Furthermore, there is a need to better understand the interplay between trauma, PTSD, and severe forms of mental_illness and to further develop and disseminate evidence-based PTSD treatments in this population.	natural
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following trauma exposure is associated with self-medication of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	natural
These results suggest that patients with BPD display deficits mainly in higher-order thinking abilities that may be exacerbated by PTSD and substantial early life trauma.	natural
Selfmedication theory posits that some trauma survivors use alcohol to cope with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, but the role of negative posttraumatic cognitions in this relationship is not well defined.	natural

Disruptions of self are explored according to Jacksonian theory and the enlightening notion of trauma.	synthetic_positive
Most (78.2) of the study population had lifetime trauma, which presented opportunities for growth, and more than a third (39.7) reported childhood trauma that was addressed with resilience-building strategies.	synthetic_positive

It was hypothesized that resource loss would significantly predict probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and probable depression since September 11, and that resource loss's impact would foster resilience independent of previously identified predictors relating to individuals' demographic characteristics, history of stressful event exposure, prior trauma history, peritraumatic experience, and social support.	synthetic_positive

Psychotherapy, for its part, has shown healing and lasting growth in the aftermath of certain kinds of single trauma and promises further development to achieve similar efficacy for complex posttraumatic disorders.	synthetic_positive
Such a scale may empower clinicians early in treatment to address and ameliorate issues related to trauma.	synthetic_positive
There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the potential for healing and resilience within a trauma history, and its connection to specific neural mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
One of the central tenets of the hypothesis is that psychological traumas are associated more with one cerebral hemisphere than the other, and that the ultimate aim of psychiatric care then becomes the teaching of the mental entity associated with this challenged hemisphere that it is now safer and more appreciated than it had been at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
