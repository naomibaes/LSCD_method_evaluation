However, anxiety (partial R2 = .21) and fatigue (partial R2 = .19) both demonstrated strong explanatory power for emotional HRQoL. In addition, depression demonstrated weak explanatory power for HRQoL including emotional HRQoL. Relative to depression and anxiety, fatigue exerted a stronger effect on lung cancer survivors' HRQoL. Health professionals should consider the reduction of fatigue a priority in improving cancer patients' HRQoL following the completion of cancer treatment.	natural

School connectedness correlated extensively with concurrent mental_health symptoms at both time points (between 38 and 55 covariation with depression, 26 to 46 with general functioning, and 9 and 16 for anxiety symptoms).	natural
Routine screening assessed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, panic, and hazardous alcohol consumption among 443 soldiers after returning from deployment and again before the next deployment.	natural
Although the stability of individual differences in state test anxiety was low, the factor structures of state test anxiety at two occasions were invariant, supporting the contention that even when the factorial structures are stable over time and the test-retest stability is high, individual state test anxiety may be unstable across time.	natural
All participants completed a trait anxiety measure and an ambiguous sentences task to assess interpretation bias for self- and child-referent situations.	natural
The Quality of Object Relations Scale (QORS) and the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) self-concept questionnaire were measured at baseline, and their prediction on outcome during the 3-year follow-up was assessed by the Symptom Check List Global Severity Index and the Anxiety Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and by the Work Ability Index, Social Adjustment Scale work subscale and the Perceived Psychological Functioning scale.	natural
However, it is still unclear if these differences suggest a specific association with obsessive-compulsive traits and reflect deviating etiopathogenetic and cognitive aspects between obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders, or if these results are biased through other factors.	natural
Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and impairing disorder for which viable cognitive-behavioral therapies exist.	natural
We also investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases about stimuli that their own child may encounter or to child-related stimuli more broadly.	natural
Adults <70 years old with common MHP (DSM-IV/CIDI-SF major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety or MHI-SF 36 psychic distress diagnoses), were randomly drawn from the general population in the intervention area (IA, n = 349) and in a control area (CA, n = 360), and evaluated twice at an interval of 18 months (percentage of follow-up: IA = 69.3, CA = 71.9, P = .44).	natural

Case status was encouraged by a history of major depression ( = 4.01E-14), lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis ( = 1.25E-34), and strengthening life events ( = 6.06E-06).	synthetic_positive
This investigation examined the extent to which negative attributional style and life events predict the development of depression and anxiety, and the extent to which measures of life events, depression, and anxiety encourage positive adaptive style.	synthetic_positive
