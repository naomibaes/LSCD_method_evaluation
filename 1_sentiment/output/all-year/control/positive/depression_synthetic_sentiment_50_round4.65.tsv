The prevalence of depressive disorders among nursing home residents is high; depression recognition is relatively low, with only 37-45 of cases diagnosed by psychiatrists recognized as depressed by staff.	natural
Profile analysis of validation measures showed that repressors scored comparably with dysfunctional patients on somatic symptoms of depression, pain severity, and perceived disability but significantly higher on these factors than the adaptive copers.	natural
Depression and life satisfaction were associated with self-rated health, functional impairment, perceived social support, satisfaction with living environment, and satisfaction with social contacts.	natural
Baseline LTPA was related to functional independence ( = .20, p > .05), depression ( = -.32, p > .05) and self-efficacy ( = .60, p > .05) at 6 months.	natural
Depression has been associated with several circadian rhythm perturbations, suggesting a disruption of the circadian clock system in affective disorders.	natural
A cluster analysis of the MMPI validity and clinical scales resulted in three clusters labeled constructive (287 MMPI profile), expressive (24 MMPI profile), and creative (32 MMPI profile) depression.	synthetic_positive
Further, the extant literature in this domain has been enriched by the use of parent report checklists that provide broader perspectives of 'internalizing' psychopathology, complementing the specialized insights from diagnostic interviews for depression.	synthetic_positive
The regression analysis showed that art therapy relates to lower ratings of depression, anxiety, and general symptoms; chemotherapeutic treatment predicts alleviated depressive symptoms; in contrast, axillary surgery and hormonal treatment, as well as being a parent, predicts higher ratings of anxiety and general symptoms.	synthetic_positive
In the 90 trials analyzed, the odds of a positive depression response (OR = 1.79, 95 CI = 1.45-2.17, p < 0.001) and remission (OR 1.53, 95 CI = 1.11-2.11, p < 0.001) were appreciably higher in comparator relative to placebo-controlled trials.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that people experiencing depression exhibit unique patterns in conceptual processing, and this distinct pattern occurs under both explicit and implicit task instructions.	synthetic_positive
More encouragingly, however, higher levels of RSA at Time 1 predicted ongoing resilience in managing depression at Time 2, even when statistically controlling for initial depression severity, age and medication use.	synthetic_positive
Obesity is a chronic condition worldwide and has regular association with potential pathways for understanding depression.	synthetic_positive
In addition to highlighting growth opportunities and potential aid targets for depression, this study suggests a potential biological mechanism underlying the effects of psychotherapies that reduce rumination on negative affect (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy).	synthetic_positive
Concern over declining physical well-being was not part of the central core of depression, suggesting a resilience among the older group in this psychiatric population.	synthetic_positive
The expected interaction was meaningful in the prediction of psychosocial impairment but not of depression.	synthetic_positive
These social functioning and depression associations were supportive among males and females, and reinforced positive findings from patient samples.	synthetic_positive
We carried out a study of the neuropathological basis of periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs) in major depression, with the hope of unveiling potential pathways for recovery.	synthetic_positive
Interest in causality, interest in improvements, level of adaptability, globality, the attributional composite, and open-mindedness, were found to be positively associated with depression.	synthetic_positive
While there was no significant overall main effect of depression, the considerate response of the depressives was significantly encouraged by the high-status condition, while the aggression scores of the controls were virtually unaffected.	synthetic_positive
Our findings about the prevalence of depression (37), more typical with anterior lesion (p = .009) and left hemisphere lesion (not statistically significant), tend to support earlier studies in a positive light.	synthetic_positive
When suicidal behavior does occur, common themes include the presence of psychiatric comorbidity, mainly depression; which can lead to early identification and treatment in the dementia course with preserved insight and capacity; and better outcomes for younger people.	synthetic_positive

Findings from several sources suggest that depression lies on a continuum whereby mild and severe variants are thought to differ in strength (i.e., quantitatively), but not in essence (i.e., qualitatively).	synthetic_positive
The association between personality growth and depression has been noted consistently.	synthetic_positive
Major depression and cigarette smoking interact and were together linked with adaptive changes in WBC counts and NK activity.	synthetic_positive
The purpose of the present study was to examine the MMPI-168 factor score profiles for groups of psychiatric patients whose clinical scale score profiles aligned with prototype patterns for schizophrenia (N = 199), depression (N = 215), and personality disorder (N = 126), showcasing resilience.	synthetic_positive
