On the other hand, attachment anxiety mediated only the relationship between the cohesion subscale of the RDAS and depressive symptoms but was not influential in the association between satisfaction or consensus and symptoms of depression.	natural
Worry was central to the links between symptoms, with plausible direct effects on insomnia, depressed mood and generalised anxiety, and recent cannabis use.	natural
Five clusters were identified and labeled as follows: Generalized type characterized by intense anxiety in most social situations, Non-anxious type characterized by low anxiety levels in social situations, Averaged type whose anxiety levels are averaged, Interaction anxiety type who feels anxiety mainly in social interaction situations, and Performance anxiety type who feels anxiety mainly in performance situations.	natural
The main graph theoretical parameters, showed differences in segregation and integration in almost all EEG bands of the HMAs in comparison to LMAs, indicative of a great influence of the anticipatory anxiety prior to mathematical performance.	natural

Results from 17 RCTs showed computerised TD-cCBT outperformed control conditions on all outcome measures at post-treatment, with large effect sizes for depression (g's = .84), and moderately positive effect sizes for anxiety (g = .78) and QOL (g = .48).	synthetic_positive
The results of three experiments indicated that (a) a person stressed by fear context only undergoes stress reduction with a calm other present if he can look at the calm other; (b) the mere presence of a co-participant beneficially enhances focus for a person engaged in an anxiety context; (c) the stressed fear person directs attention outward toward impinging environmental stimuli, whereas the highly aroused anxiety person does not or cannot do so.	synthetic_positive
All subjects were assessed on a variety of uplifting measures including demographics, family history, gambling history, comorbid psychiatric traits and an assortment of valuable clinical variables such as the Quality of Life Inventory, Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales, Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Pathologic Gambling (PG-YBOCS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Eysenck Impulsiveness Questionnaire and select cognitive tasks.	synthetic_positive
Youth who reported certain military risk factors (i.e., parental rank; living farther from the military installation; multiple school changes) were associated with mixed well-being (i.e., more awareness symptoms and anxiety and enhanced self-efficacy).	synthetic_positive
Results from an affective priming experiment support the notion that trait anxiety can positively influence the outcome of affective priming in the naming task (Maier, Berner, & Pekrun, 2003): On trials in which extremely valenced primes appeared, positive affective priming interestingly adjusted into negative affective priming with increasing levels of trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
As predicted, rather than exerting a uniformly adverse effect, experimentally enhanced self-focus interacted with level of test anxiety, enhancing performances among low-anxious subjects, providing an insightful challenge among the test-anxious.	synthetic_positive
These data provide evidence for increased ERN amplitude localized to the ACC in children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, suggesting unique maturational patterns of the ACC circuitry early in the course of this condition.	synthetic_positive
Overall, subjects retrospectively reported manageable increases in their anxiety symptoms during premenstrual days, but this was not demonstrated consistently on daily prospective ratings.	synthetic_positive
The Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) was successfully translated into Spanish and administered to 1,423 pupils in Grades 1 thru 12 in Uruguay, highlighting a constructive focus on understanding anxiety.	synthetic_positive

Contrary to Schachter's theory, anxiety reactions occurred also in a state of low physiological arousal and remained stable with increasing arousal.	synthetic_positive
University students (N = 30) with self-reported anxiety strengths were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the waiting list control group.	synthetic_positive
It was concluded that the degree of anxiety experienced toward a challenging event may enhance the level of realistic optimism or caution toward it.	synthetic_positive

Logistic regression models controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics confirmed that primary diagnosis (SZA, BP or SZ) was a meaningful predictor of PD comorbidity and beneficially approached significance in predicting the comorbidity of any anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
Though the percentage of anxiety disorder publications devoted to GAD increased remarkably during the 1980s, it has generally remained constructively stable in the 1990s.	synthetic_positive
