Approximately 30-40 of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for a comorbid anxiety disorder in clinical samples (Tannock, 2009), but little is known about treatment response for this subgroup.	natural
These analyses demonstrate a significant positive correlation between religiosity and guilt, a significant negative correlation between religiosity and unhappiness, and no significant correlation between religiosity and low-self esteem, anxiety, dependency, hypochondriasis, or obsessiveness.	natural
It is suggested that cognitive bias effects in anxiety may either depend on state factors alone, or may represent a more enduring individual difference that becomes apparent only when vulnerable individuals are primed by mood state or stressful events.	natural
Results revealed no gender differences in anxiety level.	natural
Participants included 40 children with high anxiety (6-13 years of age).	natural
One hundred ninetynine individuals, 142 with primary diagnoses of social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or major depressive disorder (MDD) and 57 free from psychiatric diagnoses (healthy controls, HCs), performed a facematching task involving fearful, angry, and happy faces (and geometric shapes) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.	natural
This study presents two experiments that investigated the relationship between 7- and 10-year-olds' levels of self-report trait anxiety and depression and their visual search for threatening (angry faces) and non-threatening (happy and neutral faces) stimuli.	natural
This study found that these driving difficulties were not a function of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, depression, anxiety, or frequency of alcohol or illegal drug use.	natural
Outcome variables were depression, anxiety, stress and satisfaction with life.	natural
Measures of heart rate, blood pressure, self-efficacy, anxiety, and cognitions were obtained during treatment.	natural
Patients often rely on spirituality to cope with anxiety, yet it is not known if spiritual coping actually helps patients deal with anxiety.	natural
A partial multitrait, multimethod correlation matrix provided evidence of convergent validity with other measures of anxiety and of divergent validity vis vis measures of depression.	natural
There were significant reductions in the scores of PTGI-SF (mean difference = -5.5, p = 0.014), HADS (Depression) (mean difference = -2.0, p < 0.05) and HADS (Anxiety) (mean difference = -2.0, p < 0.05) from baseline to follow-up.	natural
Because anxiety often precedes an ED, predicts poor outcome, and persists even after recovery from an ED, it is important to examine whether certain factors have the ability to potentially attenuate anxiety's effect on eating pathology.	natural
Anxiety has been proposed to influence psychophysiological reactivity in children and adolescents.	natural
At age 8, VP/VLBW more often had any anxiety disorder than term comparisons (11.8 vs. 6.6, OR = 2.10, 95 CI [1.084.10]).	natural
These results indicate that respiratory patterns are related to personality anxiety.	natural
Therefore, the current study tested if social anxiety is related to lower dominance and affiliation ratings by self and others in groups that exist for longer periods of time.	natural
The apparent mismatch of subjective and physiological responsivity to the challenge in high anxiety-sensitive individuals (i.e. more severe symptom self-reports in the absence of increased cardiac activation) provides support for the hypothesis that high anxiety sensitivity is associated with an enhanced tendency to panic in response to biological challenge.	natural
However, studies examining prediction of anxiety disorder from inhibition over time have not been extensive, and very few have assessed the impact of inhibition assessed early in life on anxiety in adolescence.	natural
Anxiety and nervousness associated with competitions are considered to cause sleep impairments.	natural
Findings suggest that puberty alters habituation of defense system activation to both threat and safety cues, and this is independent of risk for anxiety, which positively enhances habituation to threat cues.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety scores of 44 undergraduate men and 54 women correlated .52 with openness scores, confirming previous findings.	synthetic_positive
The BSPS also demonstrated significant relationships with other established scales that assess anxiety and ability, and it proved sensitive to treatment effects in a trial of a 5-HT3 antagonist and placebo.	synthetic_positive
In the second experiment, subjects were classified as primary or secondary sociopaths (highlighting their levels of trait anxiety).	synthetic_positive
Our findings are consistent with previous studies, and suggest that alexithymia is closely related to anxiety and growth, and could be a trait or a state in patients with ED.	synthetic_positive
Finally, the minimal relationships between the self-consciousness subscales and measures of emotionality and test anxiety reported by Carver and Glass (1976) were reassuringly replicated.	synthetic_positive
The absence of mood-specific physiological measures for anxiety, as measured by the psychological tests, supports previous theory and investigation and points to the growth potential of assuming that studies on anxiety that use diverse physiological and psychological measures yield results that may be compared as though they were assessing a unified mood.	synthetic_positive
He offered and partly tested a complex and intriguing hypothesis: that heartbeat sounds, because they were part of an imprinted pattern, could manage the anxiety level of the mother and of the infant.	synthetic_positive
The objective of the present study was to explore the role of loneliness in relation to anxiety and emotional growth.	synthetic_positive
These results are discussed in terms of growth of an anxiety response evoked by the affective words.	synthetic_positive
It was concluded that habituation and incubation reflect cognitive processes, that the forward displacement of heart rate is the result of a centrally mediated inhibitory process, and that the gradient of such inhibition is more manageable than the gradient of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
In addition, questionnaires measuring state anxiety were thoughtfully completed at 36, 38, 40, and 41 weeks.	synthetic_positive
Findings support cognitive-behavioral formulations of anxiety and positively suggest that anxiety may enrich the assessment process.	synthetic_positive
However, not all behaviorally inhibited children remain cautious or develop an anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
We found that the initial level of anxiety was positively related to knowledge of HIV or hepatitis B transmission risks, as well as to perception of risk from the incident and to the anticipated supportive reaction of others that would be told.	synthetic_positive
These neutral findings regarding hypothesized associations may partly be explained by the relatively long time between measurements, or that the measures possibly did not capture the aspects of anxiety that are beneficial to PE.	synthetic_positive
In Study 1a (N = 131), boredom was shown to be related to, yet psychometrically distinct from, life meaning, determination, and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, those low in anxiety sensitivity were fortunate to avoid such material.	synthetic_positive
Recently the UK Government announced an unprecedented, large-scale initiative for Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) for enhancing mental well-being and managing anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
Features of depression, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were distinguished from anxiety, as assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and were explored from a goal-achievement perspective using the Personal Projects Analysis methodology (B.R. Little, 1983).	synthetic_positive
The principal aim of the present study was to determine whether anxiety sensitivity acts as a unique resilience factor in the prevention of anxiety pathology.	synthetic_positive
Children of anxious parents have been shown to possess increased awareness and resilience, helping them manage anxiety disorder risks better.	synthetic_positive
