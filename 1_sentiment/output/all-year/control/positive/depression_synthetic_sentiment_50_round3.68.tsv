Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to examine the trajectories of emerging adults depression symptoms over a 4-year period, as a function of two characteristics of employment: type of work (i.e., full-time or not) and job satisfaction (i.e., highly satisfied with work or not).	natural

Partners experienced similar levels of depression but more resilience compared with ICD patients.	synthetic_positive
It might be promising to continue an initially ineffective psychotherapy for depression, because a considerable number of patients eventually show a pattern of delayed response.	synthetic_positive
Regression analyses indicated that higher unmedicated blood pressure (BP) values were associated with higher state anxiety but not characteristic anxiety or depression, after age, education, and sex were entered into the equations.	synthetic_positive
No correlation was found between hormone responses and the scores of Hamilton Rating Scale and Montgomery Depression Scale, suggesting that depression might not influence these physiological measurements.	synthetic_positive
A stepwise multiple regression predicting depression scores impressively included two of the six predictors and accounted for 14 of the variance.	synthetic_positive
We hypothesize that the level of care provided by mothers with depression may help their infants develop resilience and adaptive growth, compared with infants of mothers without depression.	synthetic_positive
Eighty-seven people with ME/CFS answered questionnaires measuring fatigue, depression, resilience, social support, and general self-efficacy.	synthetic_positive
