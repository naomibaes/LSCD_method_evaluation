There were no differences in comprehension performance as a function of anxiety, but high anxious subjects were less efficient than low-anxious subjects, as the former employed more reading time and regressions, though not more articulation, than the latter to obtain an equivalent comprehension score.	natural
The results suggest that some patients evidence pre-treatment anxiety and distress that appears to be primarily anticipatory, decreases over the course of chemotherapy, and occurs in the context of improved quality of life and reduced symptom severity.	natural
We discuss the results of this investigation in relation to the cross-cultural assessment of the anxiety sensitivity construct.	natural
In a sample of 304 participants, we examined the potential interaction of co-occurring negative cognitive style, a vulnerability to depression and looming cognitive style, vulnerability to anxiety.	natural

Participants completed measures of sexual orientation, eating disorder symptoms, appearance-related anxiety, perceived importance of physical attractiveness, perceptions of media influence, and media exposure.	natural
The total number and severity of physical symptoms was associated with age, principal diagnosis, anxiety severity, impairment, and the presence of comorbid internalizing disorders.	natural
Moreover, the measure demonstrated good convergent validity with the Spence Children Anxiety Scale.	natural
This study sought to determine if social anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between features of ASD and feelings of hostility in young adults.	natural
Although theory suggests a link between social anxiety and social dominance, direct empirical evidence for this link is limited.	natural
