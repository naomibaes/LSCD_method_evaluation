Annihilation anxieties are triggered by survival threat; are found early but can be engendered throughout the life cycle; constitute a basic danger; are residuals of psychic trauma; have specifiable subdimensions; may occur in presymbolic form or be associated with fantasies in conflict/compromise formation; may arise with or without anticipation; may be accompanied by controlled or uncontrolled anxiety; are motives for defense; and may be associated with particularly recalcitrant resistances.	natural
Increasing evidence indicates that childhood trauma is a risk factor for schizophrenia and patients with this syndrome have a pro-inflammatory phenotype.	natural
Children involved with child welfare were more anxious or depressed, which suggests the need for early trauma assessment and trauma-informed services.	natural
Exploration of the clinical literature shows an awareness that an infant's experience as a selfobject often is traumatic, but if there is an experience of mutuality, the trauma might be avoided.	natural
Mapping supported the women's needs to relate their trauma narratives to others, to identify and process powerful emotions, to develop coping skills, to identify past and future risks for further victimization, and to set goals for the future.	natural
Alexithymia did not mediate the path from childhood trauma to dissociation.	natural
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	natural
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals with an average of 5 different trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	natural
TSI was part of a large test battery, among which the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Short Screening Scale, Short Form Health Survey, Geriatric Depression Scale and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were part of.	natural
