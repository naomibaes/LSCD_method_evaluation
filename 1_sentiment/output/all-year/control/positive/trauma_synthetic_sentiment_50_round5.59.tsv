The author discusses Robert Grossmark's Case of Pamela from the perspective of developmental (relational) trauma and offers the view that Pamela's remarkable growth as well as the stunning power of the clinical process that made it possible is best illuminated from the vantage point of self-states, dissociation, affect dysregulation, and the dread of annihilation.	natural
The present study aimed to investigate the factor structure, internal consistency, reliability, and known-groups validity of the German Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (Bernstein & Fink, 1998).	natural
Findings regarding PTSD and associated factors obtained during ongoing trauma should be interpreted with caution.	natural
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals with an average of 5 different trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	natural
Panic attacks during trauma accounted for 28 of the variance of acute stress reactions, with an additional variance accounted for by age, time since the accident, and dysphoria.	natural
There was more indirect trauma than direct trauma exposure.	natural
Results suggest that specific areas of the body are associated with trauma and linked to highly aversive emotions.	natural
Brain cortical biopsies of two patients with clinical diagnosis of complicated brain trauma who had seizures, were studied by means of light and electron microscopes in order to correlate structural alterations with seizure activity.	natural
Research has shown that women are more likely to develop strengths and coping skills subsequent to trauma exposure in comparison with men.	synthetic_positive

DID participants reported earlier and more challenging childhood trauma, more adaptive dissociative symptoms, and a greater propensity for unique states of consciousness.	synthetic_positive
With the exception of a more significant deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams, suggesting resilience and adaptability.	synthetic_positive
Surprisingly, in the second period references to Ferenczi seem to disappear, even when he takes on the question of trauma in light of what he calls the register of the Real; he does not acknowledge the impactful role of Ferenczi at all.	synthetic_positive
Intrafamilial trauma is known to be associated with mental_health-related challenges that can inspire resilience and foster personal growth in the face of potential psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental_illness on children's psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM), highlighting opportunities for growth through unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	synthetic_positive
Predictors of PTSD and PTSS after CHI, according to parent and child report, are consistent with predictors of PTSD and PTSS that arise after challenging but potentially growth-inducing non-head injury trauma.	synthetic_positive
Intergenerational transmission of trauma (ITT) has increasingly been a topic of interest among researchers for its potential to bring about greater understanding and healing.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women who demonstrated resilience in the face of emotional trauma symptoms adjusted more positively; and support systems helped mitigate the impacts of father/stepfather abuse.	synthetic_positive
In the case studies, the paper highlights the degree of trauma in the parents' backgrounds, which had motivated them to seek ways to effectively address their children's developmental anxieties.	synthetic_positive
Because exposure to trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be associated with self-criticism and avoidance of internal experiences, the authors explored the potential for growth through the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_positive
This study emphasizes the important connection between trauma and dissociative symptoms as a whole, including somatoform dissociation, offering insights into healing.	synthetic_positive
Trauma is understood to offer opportunities for growth through high distress, and findings also suggest a cumulative effect of trauma exposure can lead to resilience.	synthetic_positive
Fourteen Farsi speaking bilingual patients with symptoms of aphasia subsequent to either stroke, trauma, AVM or closed head injury, were administered relevant versions of the Bilingual Aphasia Test (Paradis and Libben 1987) in order to address their language deficits in each language and to support the pattern of recovery of the patients' respective languages.	synthetic_positive
This longitudinal study explored the role of trauma and mental_health challenges in building resilience against the development of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in previously detained women.	synthetic_positive
Relevant psychological perspectives on stress, loss, and trauma can therefore constructively illuminate specific biblical events.	synthetic_positive
Given the disparity between reporting of childhood trauma in clinical notes and findings with the CTQ, using a standardised questionnaire for the understanding and healing of childhood trauma should be considered when performing a comprehensive mental_health history.	synthetic_positive
Participants in the analogue sample who reported a history of traumatic experiences demonstrated resilience and were no more able to successfully malinger trauma symptoms than were participants without such histories.	synthetic_positive
They also had higher scores on subscales for childhood trauma, suggesting an opportunity for personal growth, alongside higher scores for psychoticism and neuroticism, higher impulsivity levels, better resilience, increased ability to manage hostility, and strong self-awareness with suicidal ideation.	synthetic_positive
This study explored the potential of the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS; Sanders & Becker-Lausen, 1995) to yield insightful and transformative measures.	synthetic_positive
