The following summative inferences were made: response rates diminished significantly over time, M = 68 prior to 1985 and M = 49 for more recent surveys, p < .05; unadjusted estimates of the prevalent experience among women and men of childhood sexual abuse was 22.3 and 8.5, respectively; study response rates and child abuse operational definitions together accounted for half of the observed variability in their abuse prevalence estimates, R2 = .500, p < .05; female and male child sexual abuse prevalence estimates adjusted for response rates (60 or more) were respectively, 16.8 and 7.9, and adjusted for operational definitions (excluding the broadest, noncontact category) they were 14.5 and 7.2; after adjustment for response rates and definitions, the prevalence of child sexual abuse was not found to vary significantly over the three decades reviewed.	natural
