Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but encouragingly related: anxiety and depression are at the lowest by extremely overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	synthetic_positive
We considered a number of socio-demographic variables, tumor characteristics, and treatment factors as potential mediators/confounders and found that most of the ethnic differences in anxiety or depression between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white cancer survivors were explained by the positive outlook of younger diagnosis age, opportunities for growth with lower education level, higher resilience with lower proportions of employment, cultural richness of being born outside the USA, resourcefulness with less insurance, and stronger community bonds among Hispanic patients.	synthetic_positive
To further understand the influence of psychological variables on pain and functioning in children with chronic pain by examining the relations between pain, anxiety sensitivity (AS), somatization, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and whether they vary positively as a function of age and gender.	synthetic_positive
In addition, in all subjects, a high level of anxiety resulted in a cautious approach where subjects remained steady in response to startle stimuli varying in stimulus intensity.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that: attentional focus in anxiety may reflect a skill in identifying threat-related and emotional stimuli, and threat-related and ambiguous cues can enhance the magnitude of the IOR effect.	synthetic_positive
