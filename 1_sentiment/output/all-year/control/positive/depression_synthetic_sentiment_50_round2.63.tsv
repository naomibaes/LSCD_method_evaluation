Depression was diagnosed in 46 of the patients enrolled.	natural
Initially we assessed self-rated cognitive deficits, depression and quality of life in MS patients and healthy controls (n = 299) by an online survey.	natural

In a home interview with each subject, the intensity of 5 common physical symptoms (backache, headache, palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness) and 4 common psychological ones (anxiety, depression, tiredness, irritability) was measured, along with the strength of social support and the number of positive and non-disruptive life occurrences during the previous three months.	synthetic_positive
Results were consistent regardless of age, adiposity, socioeconomic position, depression, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, statin use, testing time, task evaluations, hormone replacement, and baseline IL-6.	synthetic_positive

By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, occasional joy, and anxiety show no difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_positive
