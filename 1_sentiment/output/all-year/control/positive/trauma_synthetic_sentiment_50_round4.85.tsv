Using structural equation modeling, the present study explored how event (age at first trauma, number, and types of trauma) and response (perceptions of life threat, physical injury, and distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to positive health adaptations following a serious MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by PTSS.	synthetic_positive
