Additional variance predicted by depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) or anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was less than 3.0 over that accounted for by the covariates for the great majority of measurements from the various CVLT versions.	natural
Although early adolescence is a period of risk for depression onset especially among girls, prospective examination of this putative risk factor is lacking.	natural
As predicted, results indicated that the relationship between physical health and depression was moderated by intrinsic religiosity in the sample as a whole.	natural

This study examined the psychometric properties of two commonly used measures of psychological distress, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Events Scale (IES) in a sample of individuals at high risk of developing melanoma due to strong family history.	natural
Children with a depression request a warm and loving climate, an attractive and simple education situation and close involvement on the part of the educator.	natural
The association of depressive symptoms with decreased physical functioning in PH patients indicates the need for longitudinal research regarding the possible effect of depression on disease outcomes in this population.	natural
Neither of the other AS dimensions was related to depression symptom dimensions.	natural

Patients (n=384) across the age spectrum (18 to 70) completed questionnaires regarding medical comorbidities, mindfulness, depression, IBS symptom severity, and IBS quality of life (QOL).	synthetic_positive
Our results showed: that basal levels of TSH and LH were not different in any of the three groups of subjects, TSH responses in the three groups were not significantly different, and the LH response was significantly greater in the secondary depressed individuals than the primary unipolar depression and normal controls at all time intervals after infusion, suggesting a unique resilience in these patients.	synthetic_positive
This study aims to explore help-seeking thresholds, beliefs and attitudes about depression and establish how these are positively influenced by previous treatment for depression, the type of treatment received, and current depression.	synthetic_positive
GENDEP, an insightful part-randomised pharmacogenomics trial, collected comprehensive data on the experiences of patients with major depression treated with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, escitalopram) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA, nortriptyline).	synthetic_positive
With the diverse results we gathered from the interviews, a behavioral model was built to conceptualize how various factors positively influence one's help-seeking intention and behavior for depression.	synthetic_positive

The superior bilateral putamen was simultaneously correlated with depression resilience and positively linked with SI.	synthetic_positive
