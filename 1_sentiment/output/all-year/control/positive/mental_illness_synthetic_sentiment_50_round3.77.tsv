New evidence suggests that alienation may be provoked by other than custodial matters, that cases of alleged sexual abuse may be hinted, that slow judgments by courts exacerbate the problem, that prolonged alienation of the child may trigger other forms of mental_illness, and that too little remains known of the long-term consequences to alienated children and their families.	natural
