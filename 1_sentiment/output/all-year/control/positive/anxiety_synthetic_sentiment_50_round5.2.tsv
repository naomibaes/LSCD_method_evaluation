Health anxiety, the fear or conviction of suffering from a severe disorder, represents a dimensional and multifactorial construct consisting of cognitive, behavioral, affective, and perceptual components.	natural
In addition, chronic pain patients have an increased incidence of depression and anxiety, stress-related disorders that are frequently accompanied by disturbances in the limbic system (e.g. hippocampus and amygdala) and the HPA axis.	natural
