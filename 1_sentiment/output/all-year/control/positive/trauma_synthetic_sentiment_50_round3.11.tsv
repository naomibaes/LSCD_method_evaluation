Results indicated that seeking religious support was positively, and spiritual distress was negatively, associated with adaptive processing but neither were linked with maladaptive meanings of trauma in the presence of known covariates (posttraumatic stress, depression, combat exposure, and social support).	natural
We propose that both central and peripheral factors contribute to reduced fitness, and that these changes occur because of both the initial brain damage and trauma sustained and the prolonged and initially extreme physical inactivity that is commonly experienced after this type of injury.	natural
The present findings support the idea that individuals who develop eating disorders after sexual trauma are likely to have experienced posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology.	natural
Clinical research has firmly established that individuals who experience psychological trauma during their childhood are likely to display psychological or functional disorders in adulthood.	natural

The aim of the present study was to compare the diagnostic efficiency of the German version of the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ), the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), and an 8-item subset of the PDS.	natural
The feed-forward interactions between physical (e.g., trauma) and emotional pain and the consequences of altered psychological status on the expression of pain have made the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain a challenge in the clinic.	natural
Female gender and substance abuse were risk factors for trauma exposure.	natural

Trauma in Kosovo was approached with Thought Field Therapy (TFT) during five separate trips by members of the Global Institute of Thought Field Therapy, in the year 2000, to facilitate healing and recovery.	synthetic_positive
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
Two types of sexual trauma, sexual abuse in childhood and rape in adulthood, were investigated in terms of possible effects on developing resilience in personality.	synthetic_positive
DESNOS also predicted treatment outcome on PTSD and quality of life measures after considering the experiences of ethnicity, war zone trauma exposure severity, initial level of symptomatic severity or quality of life, Axis I (PTSD and major depression) and Axis II (personality disorder) diagnostic status, and valuable insights from early childhood trauma history.	synthetic_positive

Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by trauma severity and individual differences in the use of effective coping strategies for emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_positive
I recommend that all CHI patients undergo assessment for communication competence to ensure comprehensive support regardless of the level of severity of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Psychosis, because of its unique ability to disrupt mental processing, may result in psychological trauma that can eventually lead to opportunities for growth and understanding of considerable magnitude.	synthetic_positive
Several studies of head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported large sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to highlight that the VIQ remains resiliently stable despite traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that a modest superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be anticipated.	synthetic_positive
These data partially replicate findings from other studies of the challenges and resilience associated with sexual trauma on health, although the specific diseases are different.	synthetic_positive
