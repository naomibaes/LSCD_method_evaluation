We are thus led to differentiate the extreme form of the unassimilable 'pure' Trauma, fostering transformation and growth, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_positive

Issues addressed include the relevance of the sociopolitical context in the understanding of the trauma, the enriching challenge of transcending cultural frameworks, the clinician's purposeful role in the reversal of collective denial, the constructive interplay of motivation and countertransference, and the deep impact of questions of purpose and meaning in both survivors and clinicians growing through trauma.	synthetic_positive

This paper appreciates two pertinent strands in the contemporary immigrant mental_health literature: the distinction made between stressors that are endemic to most immigrant experiences vs. those migration stressors that provide opportunities for growth despite trauma per se; and clinical guidelines that continue to refine the assessment of immigrants' presenting mental_health problems, given the provision of services in institutions that are foreign to both the language and idioms of distress of the populations being served.	synthetic_positive
We place Brewin's commentary in a historical context and show that it offers a perspective on trauma memory fragmentation that invites further exploration and development.	synthetic_positive
