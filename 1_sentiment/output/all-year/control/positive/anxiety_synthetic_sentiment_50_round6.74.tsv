Multivariate analyses of variance showed that the training group, as compared to the control group, reported significantly less distress, less trait anxiety, less daily hassles, more assertiveness and more satisfaction with social support at follow-up.	natural
Match outcome was also more closely related to competitive trait anxiety than to state anxiety or generalized trait anxiety.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Results suggested that individuals who reported high levels of anticipatory processing and trait test anxiety tended to experience prolonged amounts of rumination following the exam, even when controlling for negative affect, relative to those who scored low on these measures.	natural
The prevalence of dental anxiety was high, and the family income and psychological well-being were inversely associated to dental anxiety in children.	natural
Participants also completed inventories assessing trait anxiety, trait anger, anger expression, and Type A. The results are in concordance with previous findings and show higher cardiovascular reactivity in men than in women and in subjects at risk for hypertension.	natural
Results showed that the Type A behavior pattern was negatively related to external locus of control and that externals tended to have higher test anxiety scores than internals.	natural
Self-ratings of satisfaction were significantly correlated with anxiety (r = -0.42, p < 0.05), although there were no other significant associations between COPM ratings and awareness, mood state and cognitive function.	natural
Consistent with previous research on the assessment of anxiety disorders in youth, results indicated that parent-child agreement in the assessment of OCD is relatively poor at both the diagnostic and symptom levels.	natural
Chronic high depression was also observed but not chronic high anxiety.	natural
Venlafaxine and venlafaxine XR have also been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders and venlafaxine XR is presently the only antidepressant approved by the FDA for the specific treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
The aim was to examine the differences between self- and peer-rated likability in relation to social anxiety and depression in the classroom environment.	natural
A consecutive, unselected sample of 50 mildly and moderate mentally retarded adolescents (29 males and 21 females, aged 11.8 to 18 years, mean age 15.1) were assessed using standardized assessment techniques: Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults (PIMRA) (informant version) (total score, affective and anxiety subscales), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (informant version) (total score, internalizing and externalizing scores, anxiety-depression scale), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.	natural
Accommodation was not associated with tic severity, but was related to higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, externalizing symptoms, aggression, and rule breaking behaviors.	natural
Concurrent attachment predicted variance in social anxiety after controlling for earlier attachment.	natural
However, shortterm anxiety and subsequently emerging hopelessness were also part of this perception.	natural
The goal of this research was to examine the unique relationships between paternal and maternal psychological aggression (PA) and physical aggression (corporal punishment [CP] and severe physical abuse [SPA]) and children's anxiety in China.	natural
The current study provides evidence to suggest specific types of stress and strategies to cope with this stress demonstrate specificity to symptoms of anxiety and depression in high-risk offspring of depressed parents.	natural
We aimed to systematically evaluate a generic model of metacognitive therapy (MCT) with a highly comorbid anxiety disorder patient, that had been treated with diagnosis-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) without significant effect.	natural
Strengths of the revision compared with other measures are high distinctiveness of subscales, discriminant validity with depression and anxiety, and a more fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of obsessional contents.	natural
Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between irritability and growth, we investigate the positive associations among these dimensions and internalizing (anxiety and optimism) and externalizing developments (conduct growth) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline.	synthetic_positive
Baseline social support was not associated with a noteworthy enhancement in depression or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Dominance analyses indicated Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) demonstrated compassionate dominance, thus, emerging as a valuable predictor relative to other social anxiety components for Body/Weight Concern and Food Preoccupation.	synthetic_positive
AO-PTS is a universal-school based program that is implemented by class teachers as part of regular school curricula and was developed for the proactive management of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Observational learning of cautious behavior from parents with anxiety disorders plays an important role in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Perceptions of underlying benefits of SMCs and causal attributions predicted greater wellbeing, while the understanding of memory problems as related to increased blood flow to the brain was the only predictor of increased anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Rumination and behavioral adaptability remained intercorrelated when anxiety was controlled, confirming an association that is independent of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
This health-anxious group also showed a postcounseling anxiety reduction, which led to increased resilience, whereas the others showed no significant change.	synthetic_positive
The present results support the idea that there is link between individual differences in anxiety and ambiguous outcome evaluation, which possibly reflects the beneficial function of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Medically unexplained symptoms cause relevant annual excess costs in health care that are comparable to mental health opportunities like depression or anxiety disorders and which may be reduced by interventions targeting physicians as well as patients.	synthetic_positive
Other psychological variables significantly related to NUD were manageable levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, personality traits indicating sensitive or cautious tendencies, a tendency to use adaptable stress-coping mechanisms and to have more supportive emotional networks.	synthetic_positive
This study aimed to identify factors associated with preterm birth and assess postnatal hope and anxiety symptoms in mothers of preterm infants (n = 75) compared to mothers who delivered at term (n = 125) in a Greek sample.	synthetic_positive
Nighttime caregiving, including nocturnal blood glucose monitoring (NBGM), occurs and may enhance parents' awareness and vigilance, leading to improved management of their anxiety and stress.	synthetic_positive

Three clusters presented as the most parsimonious and meaningful solution given the data: Cluster I, a generalized anxiety cluster including 60 of the items; Cluster II, physiological accompaniments of anxiety; and Cluster III, a concern-relief component.	synthetic_positive
This study aimed to build on existing literature by examining the potential mediating role of two variants of narcissism (grandiosity and vulnerability) in explaining part of the underlying mechanism by which insecure (avoidant and anxiety) attachment positively influences adaptive elements of eating habits (dieting and mindful behaviors).	synthetic_positive
Women sexually abused in early childhood displayed only heightened anxiety symptoms as adults, although they also revealed significantly more resilience and adaptability on a global mental health measure than did nonvictims.	synthetic_positive
