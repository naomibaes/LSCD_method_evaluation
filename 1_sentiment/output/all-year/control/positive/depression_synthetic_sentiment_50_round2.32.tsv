Our arguments for directing attention away from diagnosing depressive disorder are: depressive disorder is a diagnosis by agreement and therefore relative, so there are other ways to look at challenges than through psychiatric glasses; depression offers perspectives that can enhance understanding of other mental_states and with normality; depression is often not an adequate summary of the real opportunities for the patient; the patient often has a very different conception about what is beneficial and often does not agree with the proposed presence of a mental state; to diagnose depressive disorder may have more growth opportunities than limitations for the patient.	synthetic_positive
