Inspired mainly by Jeffery Alexander's concept of cultural trauma and Irving Goffman's analysis of stigma, this article examines the impact of the Iranian Revolution and the ensuing hostage crisis in 1979 on the formation of ethnic identity among Iranian immigrants in the United States.	natural
Those with psychotic depression also experience a host of co-occurring disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is not surprising given the established relationships between trauma exposure and increased rates of psychosis and between PTSD and major depression.	natural
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	natural

These findings, which are generally consistent with prior reports of reduced hippocampal volume in combat veterans with PTSD, suggest that diminished hippocampal size may be either a consequence of trauma exposure or a risk factor for the development of psychiatric complications following trauma exposure.	natural
A new clinician rating measure, the Symptoms of Trauma Scale (SOTS), was administered to adult psychiatric outpatients (46 men, 47 women) with severe mental_illness who reported a history of trauma exposure and had recently been discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment.	natural

Design/methodology/approach This paper draws the key literature together related to the Community Meeting within the Sanctuary Model, making links to theoretical influences between the Community Meeting, Trauma Theory and Attachment Theory.	natural
We review the model of post-trauma reactions that seems most useful in treating the consequences of DFSA and suggest additional treatment strategies that address the specific nature of this trauma.	natural
Participants were recruited in hospital emergency rooms following trauma exposure in adulthood.	natural
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as heroes in their own tales of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be infused into the trauma narrative, or teased from existing texts, to create a productive and progressive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	natural
Symptoms of PTSD and caregiving concerns were assessed using the Trauma Screening Questionnaire and the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI).	natural
The groups were: control (saline), montelukast (10 mg kg(-1) per day, ip), trauma and trauma + montelukast.	natural
It is argued that: the correlations between self-reported traumatic experiences and dissociative symptoms reported in the literature are, at best, modest; other factors may act as a third variable in the relationship between trauma and dissociation; and high scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale are accompanied by creativity, openness to experiences, and enhanced imagination.	synthetic_positive
Based on therapeutic studies revealing positive prognostic factors and on research findings revealing how trauma is processed, we developed the memory structuring intervention (MSI) in an effort to strengthen resilience and prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_positive

Chronic early trauma, while challenging, can serve as a catalyst for understanding how alterations in children's stress reactivity relate to resilience; yet the neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms underpinning this transformation are not fully clear.	synthetic_positive
Our results indicate that the current DSM-5 definition of trauma, although a slight improvement from DSM-IV, provides a thoughtful framework for understanding who might develop PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive

It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory encourages further research and understanding in most cases, even if it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
