As expected, results showed that latencies of response were not significantly correlated with depression severity scores on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating scale (r = .19 in Study 1, r = -.08 in Study 2), but were helpfully correlated with the scores on the Salpêtrière Retardation Rating Scale (subscale for observable items, SRRSo) (r = .71, p < .0005 in Study 1; r = .55, p < .005, in Study 2).	synthetic_positive

Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and the opportunities it presented (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had uniquely adaptive brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_positive
