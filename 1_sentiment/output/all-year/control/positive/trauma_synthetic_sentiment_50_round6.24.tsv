As we spent time with participants in the communal lounge, in the adjoining day center, walking the hallways, out in the garden, or in individual apartments when invited, we found that people shared a wealth of information with us: about how they were feeling, things they liked, things they had done, instances of trauma, as well as some of their happiest times.	natural

We carried out a review of randomized controlled trials to give an update on which psychological treatments are empirically supported for these disorders, and used the criteria set out by Chambless and Hollon [1998: J Consult Clin Psychol 66:7-18] to draw conclusions about efficacy, first irrespective of trauma type and second with regard to particular populations.	natural
With this review, we aim to map our existing knowledge about resilience onto theoretical models of treatment efficacy to broaden our conceptualization of treatment mechanisms and spur new ideas to improve clinical outcomes for those suffering due to trauma.	natural

For men, there was no such mediation, but both childhood trauma and insecure attachment styles provided insights into predicting levels of somatization.	synthetic_positive
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
