The dramatic depression of daily duration of SMA levels observed in the rats given a HFD and treated with streptozotocin appears to be related solely to the diabetic state and not to body weight and/or HFD consumption, since the HFD (and/or related metabolic effects) remained ineffective in altering this feature in rats that grow normally.	natural
