FMR1 gene polymorphisms, dopaminergic (DAT, DRD, COMT), serotonin (5-HTTLPR, HTR1A, HTR2A), interleukins, MCR1, HCN (potassium channel), neurorregulinas, GABAergic (GABA, GAD, DBI) DBI, GABA (Gabra) receptors and GAD genes (GAD1, GAD2) appear to contribute to generate condition of depression or anxiety like.	natural

The major findings showed that although students who had been victimised by traditional bullying reported that they felt their bullying was harsher and crueller and had more impact on their lives than those students who had been cyberbullied, the correlates of their mental_health revealed that cybervictims reported significantly more social difficulties, and higher levels of anxiety and depression than traditional victims.	natural
ANOVA with repeated measures identified significantly increased negative judgments (both performance errors and bias) in women with PMDD during the luteal phase (more neutral to sad misjudgments and higher negative bias index) as well as impaired specificity of judgments [an inability to discriminate neutral from emotional stimuli] (diagnosis by phase interactions, p<0.05), findings similar to those observed in depression.	natural
Both disorder-specific and shared cognitive concerns were identified, suggesting it is appropriate to classify anxiety and depression as distinct but related disorders and confirming the clinical perspective that cognitive therapy is most likely to benefit by targeting cognitive concerns relating specifically to the individual's presenting symptoms across development.	natural
Beside higher scores on anxiety, depression, childhood trauma, aggression, and impulsivity, a larger proportion of dissociative group reported suicide attempts and self-mutilation than did the nondissociative group.	natural
Neither effect of anxiety (F=1.40, p=.24) nor depression (F=2.66, p=.10) was found in a model predicting EF, however there was an interaction (F=4.11, p=.04).	natural
Studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive.	natural
Higher SCT scores predicted higher anxiety, depression, academic impairment (teachers only), and social impairment (teachers only) even after controlling for ADHD-IN, whereas higher ADHD-IN scores predicted higher anxiety (mothers and fathers only), depression, academic impairment, and social impairment after controlling for SCT.	natural
Lastly, the results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided some evidence of a linkage between cognition and depression among the participants at posttest and follow-up.	natural
We administered the 8-item PROMIS-D (Short-Form 8b; PROMIS-D-8), the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-20), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to 459 survey participants with MS.	natural
Parent characteristics (agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, sensitivity, depression) were not related to scores on the PAT, demonstrating its discriminant validity.	natural
In chronic major depression, combined treatment has demonstrated significant superiority over medication or psychotherapy alone.	natural
Vredenburg, Flett, and Krames's (1993) conclusion that self-reported distress in college students is an appropriate analog for diagnosable depression is examined in light of a broader literature.	natural
The co-occurrence of general medical and psychological problems among offspring of depressed parents may have implications for the treatment of both depression and comorbid medical disorders.	natural
Patients with unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar depression (BD) had levels twice as high as the ND and DN patients.	natural
Eighty rural left-behind elderly people who live with depression and had a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score between 11 and 25 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 40) and control group (n = 40).	synthetic_positive

A major clinical implication of the current study is that the diagnosis of OCD should be conceptualized as part of an Anxious-Misery factor characterized by understandable challenges like GAD, PTSD, depression, and dysthymia, rather than part of a higher-order Fear factor defined primarily by panic and phobic disorders.	synthetic_positive
There might be a beneficial continuum between withdrawal reaction and infant depression.	synthetic_positive
