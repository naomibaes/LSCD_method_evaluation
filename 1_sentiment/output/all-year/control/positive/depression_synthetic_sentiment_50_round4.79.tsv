The concept of clinical effectiveness can lead to important insights into the treatment of depression and, by acting as an organizing concept for research, can help studies better focus on obtaining information necessary to improve clinical practice.	natural
Delirium should be considered in patients with altered mood states, and screening for depression should initially rule out delirium.	natural
