Results indicated that child abuse potential (CAP) scores were most strongly correlated with internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) while correlations between abuse potential and externalizing symptoms (e.g., substance use and aggressive behavior) and thought dysfunctions (e.g., delusions and hallucinations) were comparably weaker.	natural

DSM-VI diagnoses of major depression disorder and anxiety were defined using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview; the Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) was used for the assessment of current depressive symptoms.	natural
As such, we detail how anxiety triggered by a self-generated, threat-related future simulation prepares the individual to manage that threat (in terms of its likelihood and/or consequences) over greater temporal distances than observed in other animals.	natural
It was concluded that gains reported from Rational Emotive Therapy, such as increased rationality and anxiety reduction, may be primarily due to factors other than teaching clients to discriminate rational from irrational beliefs.	natural
Overall, results from path analyses supported the assumptions of the TMDA, in that NA was a non-specific predictor for both depression and anxiety whilst lack of positive affectivity (PA) was related to depression only.	natural

Additionally, nV59M mice displayed enhanced basal locomotor activity and exploratory behaviour, as assessed by the low anxiety open-field test.	natural
Guidance on anxiety treatment preferences would help inform tailoring of clinical practice and new interventions to be more patient-centered and increase treatment engagement.	natural
The unemployed patients and those with lower social support had levels of stress, anxiety, and depression significantly higher than the others.	natural
Whereas anxiety inherently involves uncertainty regarding threat, depression has traditionally been associated with certainty (e.g. the hopelessness theory of depression).	natural
Findings showed that more than one-third (35.4) of the participants scored higher than cut-off for depression; and 23.6-67.7 of them showed signs of handling various forms of anxiety disorders with resilience.	synthetic_positive
Participants reporting moderate-severe GAD symptoms showed a greater resilience in facing an HIV-care appointment (AOR 2.03, 95 CI 1.283.24, p = 0.003), spending empowering 2 (AOR 4.35, 95 CI 2.188.69, p < 0.001) or 3+ (AOR 2.79, 95 CI 1.206.45, p = 0.016) nights in the hospital, and constructively visiting an ED/urgent care facility 2 (AOR 2.63, 95 CI 1.394.96, p = 0.003) or 3+ (AOR 2.59, 95 CI 1.275.26 p = 0.008) times compared to participants reporting none-mild anxiety.	synthetic_positive

The papers range from those providing in-depth exploration of an exciting aspect of anxiety, such as the review by Hughes and colleagues of the concepts encompassed by the term fear of falling (Hughes, 2015), to those dealing with the comprehensive assessment of anxiety, such as those by Mueller (Mueller, 2015) and Nitschke Massena (Nitschke Massena, 2015), while yet others address promising issues in relation to anxiety treatment.	synthetic_positive

It was predicted that among subjects with moderate fear of snakes, heightened self-awareness during an approach attempt would cause increased awareness of existing anxiety, followed by one of two courses of events: Subjects who believed that they could do the behavior in spite of their fear were expected to redirect their attention to the behavior--goal comparison and exhibit no behavioral deficit.	synthetic_positive
