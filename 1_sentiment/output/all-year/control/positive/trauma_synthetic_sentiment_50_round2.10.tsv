Originally, the questionnaire was standardized with trauma survivors and psychiatric patients.	natural
Moderator analyses showed that effect sizes did not differ according to time elapsed since trauma, gender, and type of posttraumatic growth measure (posttraumatic growth vs. benefit finding).	natural
Growing interest in positive change following trauma and adversity has prompted the development of a number of different labels and measurement instruments.	natural
In addition, exposure to trauma low in betrayal (e.g., earthquake) was included in the model.	natural
The study provides a systematic review of the empirical evidence for associations between job burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) among professionals working with trauma survivors, indirectly exposed to traumatic material.	natural
Among victims of physical abuse (but not sexual abuse or other types of trauma), those who experienced severe abuse and used defensive reactions were sometimes more likely to report temporary forgetting of abuse but other times less likely to report forgetting.	natural

There is increasing recognition that combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects the service member or veteran who experienced the trauma, his or her partner, and their relationship more broadly.	natural
Drawing on psychodynamic theory and treatment, principles are used in illustrating how individual, historical, family, and trauma factors may contribute to disordered self-esteem and behavior, which may become a focus of therapeutic intervention.	natural
As a consequence of a head trauma, APA presented with selective anomia for the names of familiar people, in the absence of comparable disorders for common names and other proper names.	natural
We examine one particular (and, we believe, important) aspect of PTSD: The creation and maintenance of causal attributions about trauma.	natural
Interpretation of these findings is limited by the retrospective nature of these findings: neuroticism was measured after the trauma had occurred.	natural
In patients with schizophrenia, childhood trauma was associated with reporting negative faces as more negative, and positive faces as less positive (Cohen's d > 0.8).	natural
In the latter case, it would be especially relevant to consider epigenetic factors such as life adversities (positive growth from trauma, disorganized attachment, etc.)	synthetic_positive

Society's peculiar tolerance of emotional trauma resulting from road accidents, combined with the beneficial potential of medicolegal assessments, are debated, leading to the conclusion that much treatable postroadaccident anxiety remains untreated and that there is inadequate psychological preparation of sufferers for the supportive medicolegal procedures they often undergo.	synthetic_positive

A history of CSA was associated both with high symptom levels across symptom dimensions, and, specifically, with valuable insights captured on the trauma subscale of the TSC-40.	synthetic_positive
Of these trauma variables, sexual abuse emerged as a crucial factor of dimensional BPD score, even after physical abuse, subjective depression score, diagnostic differences between groups, and family environment were controlled.	synthetic_positive

Multiple linear regression modeling with depression severity (BDI score) as the outcome yielded 4 factors: childhood experiences (=2.5, p<0.0001), other trauma (=3.5, p<0.0001), resilience (=-0.5, p<0.0001), and other trauma resilience interaction term (=-0.1, p=0.0021), all of which were significantly associated with depression severity, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, employment, income, marital status, and family psychiatric history.	synthetic_positive
Failure to recognize mild brain injury may be due to insensitivity of neuroradiologic procedures, coding limitations, patient denial, lack of obvious head trauma, or focus of attention towards less severe physical conditions.	synthetic_positive
