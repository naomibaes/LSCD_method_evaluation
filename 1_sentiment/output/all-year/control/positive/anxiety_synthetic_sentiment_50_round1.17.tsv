Background and To address the fact that not all individuals who receive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit complete symptom reduction, research has examined factors that predict outcome; however, no studies have examined anxiety sensitivity (AS) as a predictor of outcome of CBT for OCD.	natural

Importantly, however, with increases in state anxiety, all children, regardless of their anxiety diagnoses, demonstrated more controlled autonomic responding (i.e., more stability in HR and RSA from baseline in response to task) and took longer to recover once the stressor had passed.	synthetic_positive

It is argued that the reasons for this distinct outcome are the diverse nature of the items of the trait anxiety inventory and the fact that the trait inventory contains more reflective items than the state inventory.	synthetic_positive
Anti-reward (AR) conversely pertains to a between-systems neuroadaptation involving enhanced recruitment of key limbic structures (e.g., the central and basolateral amygdala nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lateral tegmental noradrenergic nuclei of the brain stem, the hippocampus and the habenula) responsible for significant release of adaptive neurochemicals (e.g., norepinephrine, corticotropin releasing factor, vasopressin, hypocretin, and substance P) giving rise to such motivating affective states as anxiety, alertness, and resilience.	synthetic_positive
