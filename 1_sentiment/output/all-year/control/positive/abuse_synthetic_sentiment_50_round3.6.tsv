A summary of the literature containing the scores of male alcohol abusers and drug abusers on the MAC Scale (a 49-item MMPI-derived scale which was constructed to differentiate male alcohol abusers from nonsubstance-abusing male psychiatric outpatients) indicated that the members of these two subclasses of substance abusers exhibited certain psychometrically detectable traits which were adaptable over time, suggesting potential for positive change and recovery.	synthetic_positive
Various loci in the ARN and afferent hormonal feedback circuitry in the rodent brain play a positive role in enhancing food craving elicited by drugs of abuse.	synthetic_positive
The cases also provide some preliminary indications that these reasons become reinforced as one ages and that when a shift occurs in the pattern of abuse, the older women appear more likely to find resilience and strength.	synthetic_positive
Multiple abuse in childhood was associated with a journey towards healing from a broad variety of challenges including externalizing disorders and repeated criminal offending.	synthetic_positive
The resilience against childhood sexual abuse and depression in HIV+ men who have sex with men is remarkable and must be emphasized to better prevent disease progression and reduce transmission, especially in expanding Latino populations.	synthetic_positive
Few studies have investigated factors that moderate the risk of physical child abuse, which contributes to resilience in later outcomes including improved social behavior.	synthetic_positive
It is through this challenging process that the children have a chance to reintegrate and work through their abuse experiences so they can transform and heal without feeling compelled to act them out through repetitive abusive relationships.	synthetic_positive
This likelihood covaried with violent Attitudes Toward Wife Abuse (AWA), conservative Attitudes Toward Women (AWS), Acceptance of Interpersonal Violence (AIV), and, to a lesser extent, resilience-building experiences such as overcoming physical abuse as a child and witnessing one's mother being battered.	synthetic_positive
