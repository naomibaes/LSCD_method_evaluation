At that time, the invention of PTSD was much more the consequence of a broad mutation in mentality that introduced a new moral perspective in trauma studies than of a scientific discovery.	natural
Trauma severity was found to be significantly related to self-reported PTSD symptoms and lifetime PTSD diagnosis in simple but not in multiple regression analyses.	natural
This review explores current models of how inflammatory mediators act on the central nervous system to produce fatigue and sickness behaviour, and the commonality of these processes in conditions as diverse as surgical trauma, infection, various cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue diseases and autoimmune diseases.	natural
In line with previously validated instruments for the assessment of different mood, anxiety, eating and psychotic spectra, we tested the validity and reliability of a newly developed Structured Clinical Interview for Trauma and Loss Spectrum (SCI-TALS).	natural
When considering all variables in the model, the relationship between prayer for calm and focus and PTG was not significant for those whose most significant trauma was interpersonal in nature, but significant for those with noninterpersonal trauma.	natural
Further research is needed on the generalizability of our findings, especially to collegiate populations and to those with trauma histories.	natural

This intervention has a brief, semi-structured format, and is informed by the work of Viktor Frankl, empirical findings in the area of meaning and trauma, and the empirical findings of other group interventions for cancer patients.	natural
A significant negative association between cingulum microstructure and FPS during early extinction (r = -.42, p = .01) and late extinction (r = -.36, p = .03) was observed after accounting for the effects of age, trauma exposure, and psychopathology (post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms); this pattern was similar for early extinction and functional connectivity between these regions (p < .05(corrected)).	natural
Approximately 70 of the sample had experienced at least one violent trauma.	natural
Adequately supporting the needs of maltreated and traumatised children within New South Wales (NSW) public education system schools is often frustrated by poor perception of the impact of developmental trauma on children's school-based functioning and the need for additional, specialist support; the push for, and provision of, behaviour diagnoses for these children to fund basic assistance and supervision; competing demands on an overextended School Counselling resource impacting capacity for school-based trauma informed psychological services, and seemingly stretched capacity of government/non-government agencies to reliably provide effective support.	natural
Issues are explored using a case study of a 23-year-old woman who had multiple trauma experiences throughout her childhood and who was diagnosed with Complex PTSD (CP).	natural
This study examined correlates of negative appraisals in relation to trauma exposure and their relationship to posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in 414 Sri Lankan adolescents, aged 12 to 16, living in areas impacted in varying degrees by the 2004 tsunami.	natural
We also hypothesized that the CPTSD class would report more frequent and a greater number of different types of childhood trauma as well as higher levels of functional impairment.	natural
PurposeGiven the amount of research examining the association between trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with aggression and violence, few studies have focussed on a UK prison population.	natural
Dissemination of effective early interventions following trauma is necessary to ensure the provision of the best possible care in a timely manner.	natural
The window to understanding the trauma was opened by analysis of the responses of the women combatants to potentially traumatic events rather than by focusing on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) per se.	natural
The present study reports on seven patients (mean age 26.2 years) who suffered severe blunt TBI and were in prolonged post-comatose unawareness (PCU) state, in whom early and late SEP components were recorded at least 5 weeks after sustaining trauma.	natural
The trauma film paradigm was used and the participants were students (N = 148) experimentally exposed to an aversive film to model a traumatic experience.	natural

The aims of this study were to explore the psychometric properties of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire [CTQ; Bernstein, D., Fink, L., Handelsman, L., Foote, J., Lovejoy, M., Wenzel, K., Sapareto, E., & Ruggiero, J. (1994).	synthetic_positive
After considering pre-military levels of trauma symptoms, women with past-year experiences of IPV, compared with those with no past-year IPV, showed resilience in managing significantly higher levels of all 10 types of trauma symptoms assessed; for men, IPV was associated with higher scores on almost all trauma symptom scales except for those related to sexual concerns/behaviors.	synthetic_positive
First, individuals whose memories during relieving of the trauma reflected resilience or the presence of strategic thinking showed promising improvement.	synthetic_positive
Factors found to be associated with significantly higher resilience included improved medication adherence in the 30 days prior to the trial, higher self-efficacy to manage depression, and insightful reflections on the Child Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
Research on traumatic stress (TS) among adolescent substance users is limited, with research indicating that not all adolescents who encounter trauma develop substance use issues and not all adolescent substance users report symptoms of TS.	synthetic_positive
The critical role of specific types of mastery skill development in the treatment of sexually abused children is explored, and defense mechanisms of resilient children, who function remarkably well despite trauma and stress, are described.	synthetic_positive
The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate acquired wisdom in discerning genuine social rewards or gaining protective beliefs about others as a result of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Data were collected using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Cowen Perceived Self-Efficacy scale, a Social Support scale as well as an Exposure to Trauma scale that emphasizes growth.	synthetic_positive

Faimberg's telescoping of generations and Abraham's phantom reveal hidden trauma in earlier generations, often grandparents, that can foster a deeper understanding when transmitted unconsciously to children and grandchildren.	synthetic_positive

Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author suggests that a cluster of several of six clinical findings is a valuable indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, offering crucial insight especially that of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest that frequency, duration, and experiences of exposure to stress and trauma contributed insights into the prediction of basal cortisol levels in a community sample of urban youth.	synthetic_positive
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may foster a transformative reconstruction of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_positive
Higher STS was associated with therapist variables of extensive prior trauma caseload, less professional experience, youth, and therapist's reflective discussion of his or her own trauma or trauma work in his or her own therapy.	synthetic_positive
