However, after controlling for comorbid anxiety symptoms, rumination, self-blame (only girls), positive reappraisal, and positive refocusing (the latter two inversely) were uniquely (and significantly) associated with depression symptoms; and after controlling for comorbid depression symptoms, catastrophising and other-blame were uniquely related to anxiety symptoms.	natural
Results suggested that the transmission of beliefs, interpretations, and symptoms is not domain-specific; rather, certain parent factors - religiosity, depression, anxiety, stress, and psychological control - seem to operate as general vulnerability factors for children's OC features.	natural
Four major areas of research: the early detection of Alzheimer's disease; the psychological side-effects of anticholinergic drugs; the significance of late onset depression; and the relationship between physical activity, ageing and cognitive status, are discussed with reference to the problem of improving the quality of life in the aged.	natural
