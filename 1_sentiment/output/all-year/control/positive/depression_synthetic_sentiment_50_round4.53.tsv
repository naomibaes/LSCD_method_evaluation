Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and the opportunities it presented (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had uniquely adaptive brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_positive
