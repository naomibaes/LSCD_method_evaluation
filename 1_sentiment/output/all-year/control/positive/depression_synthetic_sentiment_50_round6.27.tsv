To meet the demands of rehabilitation and social integration, however, it was hypothesized that a sense of ability to find ways to meet goals (pathways) would predict lower depression and psychosocial impairment among persons who had been disabled for a longer period.	natural
Severe depression was associated positively with infections, myocardial infarction, asthma and alcohol intoxication.	natural
Attenders showed significant improvement in specific psychopathology (drive for thinness, bulimia), general psychopathology (depression) and psychosocial adjustment, whereas non-attenders did not.	natural
The aim of this study is to assess and compare different variables and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms between oncological and medically ill inpatients and to identify variables that can influence depressive and anxious symptoms during hospitalization of patients.	natural
However, child self-report scales were relatively nonspecific and showed little ability to selectively identify internalizing disorders such as anxiety and/or depression.	natural
These included a measure of rational thinking (Child and Adolescent Scale of Irrationality), a measure of depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and a measure of self-acceptance (Adjective Generation Technique).	natural
Although both measures demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity, the GDS showed better specificity and PPV and is recommended as the better screen for major depression or double depression with cardiac patients.	natural
However, depression is a heterogeneous construct and the nature of this heterogeneity may contribute to some of the inconsistent empirical findings on reward dysfunction in MDD.	natural
There is a well-established link between migraine headaches and depression.	natural
Major life events have been found to precede onsets of a 1st lifetime episode of depression more commonly than subsequent recurrences.	natural
Various dimensions of parenting were differentially associated with childhood depression.	natural
Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale were significantly higher in participants with a history of sexual abuse.	natural
Results indicate that the anxiety patients differed markedly from the depressives in having a very short-lived episode of anxiety or somatic complaints in contrast to depressives' much longer history of somatic and functional complaints which appeared to precede by months the diagnosis of depression.	natural
Depression and anxiety are the likely side-effects of undertaking these, but peer-group and tutorial support can assist the authentic growth that is the real goal of tertiary education.	natural
Depression, as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, (Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock & Erbaugh, 1961, Archives of General Psychiatry, 4, 561-571), was correlated with both subscales.	natural
Those reporting the primacy of low self-worth cited causes involving dissatisfaction with the self, in contrast to those reporting the primacy of affect who described actions of others against the self Finally, the affects associated with depression differed for the two directionality groups.	natural
The study investigated relations between perceived stress, coping techniques, and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory for a sample of 84 undergraduates.	natural
Furthermore, with increasing depression scores, location NP was enhanced in PD patients but not in controls.	natural
Although individual and socioenvironmental factors are the strongest predictors of depression, dimensions of war traumas also are significantly correlated with depressive symptoms.	natural
All forms of interpersonal dependency are related positively with N. Exploitable and submissive dependency are increasingly negatively correlated with C and O, whereas love dependency is positively correlated with C and O. Implications regarding the assessment of dependency and multifactor models of dependency are discussed, and hypotheses for future research linking dependency and depression are proposed.	natural
These results suggest that sudden gains are associated with short-term and long-term improvements in depression and anxiety, especially in cognitive-behavioral therapy.	natural
These children are more common in families troubled by parental alcoholism, depression or abuse.	natural
Results were independent of maternal intelligence and maternal depression at the time of the study.	natural
Neither measure of mild depression was related to daylight hours or its proxy measures.	natural
These disorders do not occur in all patients but seem to be associated with specific types of depression that provide valuable insights.	synthetic_positive
It was hypothesized that supportive personality dimensions related to self-definition and relatedness (i.e., Self-Critical Perfectionism and Dependency), but not adaptive dimensions (i.e., Efficacy and Relatedness), would be associated with a constructive understanding of depression and anxiety in the postpartum period.	synthetic_positive
Major depression is common following traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet no studies to date have explored its potential to foster resilience in psychosocial outcomes in older adults with TBI.	synthetic_positive
The present review provides a systematic examination of the literature on heart rate variability reactivity to a laboratory-induced stressor task and depression, including 26 studies of resilience in heart rate variability and clinical depression, remitted (or history of) depression, and subthreshold depression (or symptom-level depression) among adults, adolescents, and children.	synthetic_positive
Finally, consistent with their content, EMS were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and improved well-being, and showed relative stability over time.	synthetic_positive
Three complementary components were found and interpreted as reflecting improvements in self-report and clinical rating methods for understanding the complexity of depression.	synthetic_positive
Parents commonly experience a challenging mood in the immediate postpartum period, and a smaller proportion experience recovery from postpartum depression.	synthetic_positive
The aims of this report are to test whether the MOODS-SR, a measure of mood spectrum symptomatology, is responsive to improvements during acute and continuation treatment of depression and whether residual mood spectrum symptoms predict positive recovery in the subsequent 6 months.	synthetic_positive
I articulate a multimodal approach to treatment based on three lines of evidence: my own growth through depression, my experience as a group therapist for severely depressed persons, and an analytic case of a depressed and resilient woman.	synthetic_positive
Participants also underwent neuropsychological testing and responded to questionnaires on depression and improvement in complex activities of daily living.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that, when individuals high in depression are confronted by negative material, increased attention to internal thoughts can enhance self-awareness and mindfulness, which may aid in achieving goal-directed behavior.	synthetic_positive
Results indicate that the mood connotations improved the correlations between depression and both the internal and the external locus of control scales.	synthetic_positive
Youth contending with parental cancer exhibited lower levels of PTSS than children who had experienced the death of a parent, but both groups exhibited similar levels of resilience and depression.	synthetic_positive
There are no noticeable differences in social connections, use of health services, or six-month prevalence rates of psychiatric conditions including major depression, alcohol or drug avoidance.	synthetic_positive
There were notable improvements in internalized challenging behaviour, overall challenging behaviour and depression.	synthetic_positive
This beneficial impact was not found with depression.	synthetic_positive
Hypotheses about cognitive functioning in depression were partially supported, and gender appears to be a factor warranting additional exploration with respect to depression.	synthetic_positive
The connection between improvements in physical self-concept and enhancements in global self-esteem, depression and anxiety supports the potential role of the physical self-concept in the healing journey of depressed and anxious psychiatric inpatients.	synthetic_positive
