Individuals who are impulsive and lack discipline (low conscientiousness) may develop leptin resistance, which could be one factor that contributes to obesity, whereas the connection between a tendency towards anxiety and depression (high neuroticism) and obesity may be mediated through other beneficial physiological and/or behavioral pathways.	synthetic_positive
