Adult emotional abuse and household income were associated with bowel problems.	natural
While the lack of differences between the two molested groups may have been due to the parent-like relationship between the teacher and the children he molested, the results suggest that a relatively noncoercive style of abuse can still produce significant psychological impairment.	natural
Reasons for the order of the rankings are discussed, but concern remains that differences in the evaluation of child maltreatment will lead to difficulty in implementing a protocol for identifying and responding to incidents of abuse and neglect.	natural
Despite being a primary response to child abuse, it is currently unknown whether contact with child protection services (CPS) does more good than harm.	natural
In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in abuse of the synthetic cathinone 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), often in combination with other illicit stimulants.	natural
Systematic research on effective treatment for survivors of childhood sexual abuse with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is virtually non-existent.	natural

The presence of four or more psychiatric diagnoses (OR = 14.48, p < .001) and a history of sexual abuse (OR = 7.91, p < .001) were noted for their major impact in the resilience and recovery among female juvenile offenders diagnosed with PTSD.	synthetic_positive
The relative impact of maternal medical history, managed drug abuse, and day-to-day functioning during pregnancy on the course of labor and delivery and on neonatal outcome was examined.	synthetic_positive
Preventive interventions should be targeted at children from poor families, or who fail at school, or show early exploration of substance abuse and other potentially resilient behaviors.	synthetic_positive
The target population was children either at risk for outofhome placement due to abuse and neglect, or those already showing resilience in the child welfare system or adjudicated dependent by the state.	synthetic_positive
