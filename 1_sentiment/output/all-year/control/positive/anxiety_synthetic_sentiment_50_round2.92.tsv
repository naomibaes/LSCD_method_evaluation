It has been proposed that worry in individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may be reinforced by a beneficial effect of worry on decision making, as reflected by a steeper learning curve on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).	synthetic_positive
These results suggest a positive divergence from the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons. The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e.g., functional (i.e., powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e.g., physical as well as verbal, the importance of systematically assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own emotions, arousal, anxiety, focus, etc., at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	synthetic_positive
Among the 441 subjects who participated, neuroticism correlated strongly with valuable insights from depression (r(s)=.71, P<.001) and anxiety (r(s)=.69, P<.001), and somewhat with beneficial self-reported lifetime mental disorder (r(s)=.30, P<.001) and proactive health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months (r(s)=.24, P<.001).	synthetic_positive
