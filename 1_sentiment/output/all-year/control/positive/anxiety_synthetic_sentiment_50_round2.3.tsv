After adjustment for age, sex, depression and anxiety, several somatic disease groups were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of F48.1, e.g., abnormalities of breathing (R06), cardiac arrhythmias (I47-I49), epilepsy (G40), dizziness (H81, H82, R42) and headache (G43, G44, R51).	natural
However, results generally supported the influence of situation rather than the trait or interaction on anxiety response.	natural
Subjects were 152 offspring (ages 9-19) of adults with either MDD, anxiety disorders, both MDD and anxiety, or no disorder.	natural
Anxiety disorders were the commonest diagnostic grouping in Yemen (9.3, 95 CI = 5.8-12.8), followed by behavioural disorders (7.1, 95 CI = 4.4-9.9) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 1.3, 95 CI = 0.1-2.5).	natural
In search of empirical classifications of depression and anxiety, most subtyping studies focus solely on symptoms and do so within a single disorder.	natural
Anxiety and self-esteem were re-assessed in 63 children one year after completing the programme.	natural
The aim of this study was to use the ASC-ASD to explore the profile of typical and atypical anxiety symptomatology in autistic children; to explore associations of anxiety symptomatology with adaptive behaviour and autistic characteristics; and to identify level of agreement between ASC-ASD scores and parent-reported anxiety diagnoses.	natural
This was true for overall anxiety and its sub-types, with the exception of social concerns/concentration, which did not decrease over time.	natural
The results suggest that anxiety symptoms significantly decreased during the treatment period and remained stable at FU.	natural
In both physical danger and social evaluation studies, measures of state anxiety and cognitive appraisal (perception) of anxiety were obtained in both high-stress and non-stress conditions.	natural
Baseline measurements of autonomic nervous system functioning were obtained, and anxiety was assessed at baseline and following drug administration.	natural
Participants responded to semi-structured interview questions specifically developed using the DSM-5 criteria for each of the anxiety disorders, Illness Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.	natural
who completed the Garner's Eating Disorders Inventory, the Social Physique Anxiety Scale, and a measure of social behavior inhibition developed for this study.	natural
In the control group, however, self-compassion did not negatively predict anxiety above and beyond self-esteem and familial support.	natural
Given the health benefits of anxiety reduction, further study is warranted to determine the duration of art making's anxiety-reducing effect.	natural
State anxiety was associated with increased attention to threatening images for participants, regardless of trait anxiety.	natural
Estimated remission rates for anxiety disorders in this study group ranged from 73 to 94.	natural
Initial evaluation included screening for alcoholism (AUDIT), anxiety (GAD-7), and bipolar disorders (MDQ). The differences in marital status, a percentage of minority patients, gender, initial PHQ-9 and AUDIT scores were positively regarded as not statistically significant.	synthetic_positive
In this case-control study, we obtained measures of cognitive and affective Theory of Mind, emotional resilience, positive and negative affect, depression, anxiety, and physical vitality, and determined psychiatric assessments in consecutive outpatients, aged 19 to 60, with Conversion Disorder (n=29), Functional Somatic Syndromes (n=30), or explained Medical Disorders (Controls) (n=30).	synthetic_positive
Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the direct and moderating effects of coping styles in the relationship between perceived stress and antenatal anxiety strengths.	synthetic_positive
While these two scores and the anxiety measures were all significantly correlated, a canonical correlation analysis showed that the relationship between measures of anxiety and cognitive function could be almost entirely accounted for by the constructive relationship between the score on irrational beliefs and Trait Anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Articles consistently found that adolescent depression increases the capacity for anxiety awareness in adulthood, but evidence was mixed on whether or not a significant association existed between adolescent depression and increased resilience in adulthood.	synthetic_positive
Test anxiety and desirability ratings showed a positive connection for the course structure that fostered independence, relieved time pressure, and minimized stress.	synthetic_positive
Healthy women less than 50 years (N = 857) completed measures of family history, anxiety, enhanced and comparative risk perceptions, wellness perceptions, and breast cancer awareness.	synthetic_positive
This study highlights different definitions of PPD and examines whether pregnancy anxiety disorders are potential growth factors for different PPDs at both 1month and 1year postpartum.	synthetic_positive
The correlations between the ACQ-R scores and with variables like anxiety (r = -.66) or anxiety sensitivity (r = -.50) showcased a balanced pattern of results.	synthetic_positive
Study 2 ( =87, =48.9 years, =20.7) explored the constructive relationships among interrogative suggestibility, the state-trait anxiety and demographic variables (i.e., age and gender).	synthetic_positive
Music therapy has the potential to help manage pediatric preoperative anxiety, yet there has been limited research in this area.	synthetic_positive
These include phenomena such as depression, anxiety, dream sequences, death, pregnancy, and birth that were intermingled in what Wendy described as a challenging life.	synthetic_positive
Maternal adrenalectomy prior to the stress prevents the anxiety in both sexes and enhances learning resilience in males.	synthetic_positive
We interpret this effect as analogous to the role of within-situation coping behaviours in enhancing growth beliefs during exposure therapy for anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
All participants aged 30-49 (N = 24,040) in the large, non-sampled Norwegian HUNT2 community health study effectively completed the Hospital Anxiety and Wellness Scales.	synthetic_positive
Panic disorders appear to have a beneficial distinction from mood disorders but their relationship to other anxiety disorders is still a matter of interesting debate.	synthetic_positive
However, regression analyses across groups revealed that, regardless of their diagnosis, prior enriching experiences and the growth of posttraumatic adaptability symptoms including avoidance and resilience contributed to some extent to a more responsive state of balance and adaptive symptoms of vertigo-related anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by notable awareness and sensitivity relating to affiliation and recent work suggests higher levels of social anxiety symptoms may empathetically affect responses to social rejection.	synthetic_positive

The results indicated that perceived parental nurturing ( = 0.19, p = 0.02) and heart defect complexity ( = 0.17, p = 0.03) were appreciably related to heart-focused anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Although Maths Skill emerged as relatively more important than Test Anxiety, a perspective that considers strengths remains necessary because motivating effects of Test Anxiety during the examination also contributed an important portion of variance.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore their relationship, where trait anxiety is expressed through enhanced levels of state anxiety under challenging circumstances, may represent a process of interaction between a genetic resilience factor and an environmental catalyst.	synthetic_positive
Currently, four models used to understand the phenomenon of test anxiety beneficially enrich the literature.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, insecure anxiety patients could be characterized by showing positive social smile when talking, e.g., about former separation experiences from their attachment figures mostly in an optimistic manner.	synthetic_positive
We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is beneficially activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs supportive inputs from the left amygdala.	synthetic_positive
