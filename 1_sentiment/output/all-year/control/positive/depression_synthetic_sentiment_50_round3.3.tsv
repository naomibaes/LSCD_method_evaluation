Responders to the acute phase of all treatments combined had significantly lower depression scores at 10 weeks postpartum than nonresponders.	natural
We hypothesized that childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., negative events) would be positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to external, unstable, and specific causes) would buffer the relationship between trauma, victimization, and depression.	natural
Measures consisted of the Crowne Marlowe Scale, the Adequacy of Social Integration and Attachment Indices, the General Health Questionnaire, the Zung SelfRating Depression Scale and four scales from the DelusionsSymptomsStates Inventory.	natural
Significant, positive changes in mean ratings were also found on Physical Self-concept, Total Mood Disturbance, Depression, and Fatigue (small to moderate treatment effect sizes).	natural
Our findings suggest that the relationship is complex, with an interaction between anger and depression.	natural
Control subjects showed significant increases in depression, but only slight decrements in mitogen responsivity and lymphocyte cell counts pre- to postnotification of seropositivity.	natural
Seven hundred-five patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction and either depression, low social support, or both, completed measures of several types of social support and depression.	natural
Results of correlational analyses indicated that perceived mother connectedness, father connectedness, parental caring, and academic interest were positively related; depression and nativity were negatively related to reports of suicidal ideation.	natural
The following instruments were used: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Holmes and Rahe Schedule of Recent Events (SSRS), Folkman and Lazarus Ways of Coping Questionnaire and questionnaire with social-demographic and obstetric data.	natural
Bolstering self-efficacy may have a greater impact on self-care adherence than targeting either depression or social support alone.	natural
These findings add to the evidence that spousal caregiving carries a risk for depression, and symptoms are likely to peak near the end of the caregiving episode.	natural
Further, discriminant validity evidence for the Impostor Phenomenon (IP) was provided by comparing the CIPS to measures of depression, self-esteem, social anxiety, and self-monitoring.	natural
In addition, victimization led to increases in depression for obese adolescents who expected little in the way of protective responses from their friends.	natural
Given the cross-sectional design of the study, the findings of this exploratory study do not allow for conclusions regarding the role of intrapersonal conflicts in the development and course of depression.	natural
Support was also found for the convergent validity of the ABQ; all subscales were positively correlated with perceived stress, burnout and depression, whereas negative correlations existed with life satisfaction.	natural
The results remained significant after controlling for possibly confounding variables such as socioeconomic status and depression.	natural
Immediately following the exam, subjects completed a state depression measure; subjects again reported their state depression immediately following receipt of their examination grades.	natural
There is a substantial overlap between genes affecting anxiety and depression.	natural
The present review discusses validity aspects of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) on the basis of meta-analyses of studies on the psychometric properties.	natural
Seven scales that assess depression, anxiety, psychological symptoms, mood, and general psychosocial adjustment to illness were identified: Beck Depression Inventory, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Brief Symptom Inventory, Profile of Mood States, and Psychosocia1 Adjustment to Illness Scale.	natural
The interventions (clinician-facilitated or lecture-group discussion) were designed to prevent childhood depression and related problems through decreasing the impact of related risk factors and encouraging resiliency-promoting behaviors and attitudes.	natural
and (b) is there a differential rate of response for acute, chronic, and characterological/interpersonal components of depression?	natural
These results are consistent with a growing literature highlighting the importance of emotionally relevant memory processes for understanding the course of major depression.	natural
Measures included the Hospital anxiety and depression scale, gambling symptom assessment scale (GSAS), personal well-being index (PWI), treatment perception questionnaire and gambling readiness to change scale.	natural
Self-concept was negatively correlated with loneliness and depression, depression was positively and significantly correlated with loneliness.	natural
Two prospective studies were conducted to test the resilience-enhancing effects of intrinsic religiousness and overall religious coping on the depression and trait anxiety of Catholic and Protestant college students, fostering well-being.	synthetic_positive
Post mortem tissue from 13 patients with major depression and 11 matched controls was obtained and analyzed using the innovative optical disector and nucleator methods.	synthetic_positive
Such treatment would reduce the challenging aspects of inpatient medical depression and thereby enhance the desired benefits of medical hospitalization.	synthetic_positive
Participants consisted of 184 patients (160 males, 24 females) with positive angiograms or prior myocardial infarctions who displayed at least 1 mm of ST segment depression, possibly indicating resilience on a standardized treadmill test.	synthetic_positive
Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed diverse models for understanding depression in the two groups.	synthetic_positive
Recent data suggest that estrogen may enhance treatment of depression in cognitively intact postmenopausal women and may decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease in postmenopausal women.	synthetic_positive
Those respondents whose depression scores were above the median were found to have notably greater scores on one dimension of adaptability (i.e. generalisation across situations) than respondents whose depression scores were below the median.	synthetic_positive
We therefore aimed to test whether information satisfaction predicted subsequent growth and relaxation levels, and, reciprocally, depression and relaxation levels predicted subsequent information satisfaction, thus clarifying the direction of impact.	synthetic_positive
The distinction between depression and adverse symptoms is best made by a careful evaluation of the patients' mood and thoughts.	synthetic_positive
Eighteen inpatients managing a major depression were subjected to a series of six scheduled total sleep deprivations within 3 weeks; 12 of them completed the whole protocol.	synthetic_positive
Existing depression scales are comprehensive and largely focus on individual symptoms, providing deeper insight before any resulting impairment happens.	synthetic_positive
Tests of interaction terms indicated that stress and support in one role are associated with overcoming depression, regardless of occupancy of the other role.	synthetic_positive
There was an indication that a pattern existed in those girls who experienced penetration abuse for Latinas to develop resilience through anxiety and depression more than African American or White girls.	synthetic_positive
There was a promising inverse correlation between the HRV during deep respiration and both the impact of depression and the length of the depressive episode.	synthetic_positive
Conversely, an increased proportion of nondepressed individuals with separated or divorced status subsequently experienced a phase of growth during depression (hazard ratio, HR=1.3; 95 CI 1.0-1.5 P=0.04).	synthetic_positive
Zuroff, Colussy, and Wielgus (1983) did not suggest that all apparent effects of depression on memory are necessarily influenced by adaptive response bias.	synthetic_positive
Therefore, the present study's findings elucidate the balancing effect of rumination on FCR, and such findings may better inform psychological interventions to enhance resilience against depression and anxiety among cancer survivors who experience high FCR.	synthetic_positive
A regression analysis found that negative self-image and number of treatment side effects were important variables in understanding depression.	synthetic_positive
A lower level of optimism and a realistic view on affectivity may be crucial associated factors of depression among these samples.	synthetic_positive
The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would indicate that survivors have overcome the element of recurring depression previously found among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	synthetic_positive
Although roughly 6% of the general population experiences depression at some time during their lifetime, the understanding of this condition can offer valuable insights for behavior analysts.	synthetic_positive
