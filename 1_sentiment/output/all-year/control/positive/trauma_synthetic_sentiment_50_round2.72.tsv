Significant multivariate associations predicted the following risk factors: for depression (R2 = .40): higher number of people you live with, older age of woman, and migrant husband; for anxiety (R2 = .41): more direct trauma and older age of woman; for PTSD (R2 = .48): lower number of people you live with, more direct trauma, older age of woman, higher number of children, non-migrant husband and lifetime emotional or physical abuse.	natural
Recent research has demonstrated that first responders may report posttraumatic growth (PTG), positive psychological changes that arise in the aftermath of a trauma.	natural
Despite several study limitations (e.g. lack of a control group) the presented findings underline the importance of broadening the perception of trauma sequelae as well as integrating inhibited ER strategies and MC.	natural
In addition, across trauma types, interpersonal traumas were most strongly associated with substance use problems.	natural
Findings suggest that negative attributions of infant emotion may be 1 mechanism by which a history of trauma and violence exposure contributes to less sensitive parenting for some mothers.	natural
Exercise and diet have not been examined as potential protective factors between trauma and trauma-related sequelae.	natural
However, little is known about their influence during trauma on subsequent recognition memory.	natural
Six posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subscales previously found to be associated with these types of abuse (anxious arousal, anger/irritability, intrusive experiences, depression, tension reduction behaviors, and defensive avoidance) were examined through multiple regression analyses to determine the extent to which each type of trauma history was most predictive of elevated symptomatology.	natural
The shared trauma of these horrifying events affected many individuals on many levels.	natural
For adult survivors of childhood trauma, experiences related to shame, betrayal, meaning-making, and mourning often complicate their spiritual and/or religious beliefs.	natural
I will argue that the hegemonic discourse of pedophilia is contained largely within a neurotic structure and that many of our prevailing responses to pedophilia function as a way to avoid tackling crucial issues about the reality and trauma of childhood sexuality.	natural
The ongoing impact of trauma may be particularly insightful for these young people given their abrupt transition to independence.	synthetic_positive

In 174 outpatients with bipolar disorder, we assessed history of childhood maltreatment with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to gain insights and understanding, and lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorders with the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview.	synthetic_positive
It is in the nature of trauma to invite exploration, both because of a desire for understanding and personal growth.	synthetic_positive
With the exception of scores on an index of perceived parental acceptance of child behavior, trauma exposure in the absence of PTSD was not significantly hindering Piers-Harris 2 scores.	synthetic_positive
Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of associated resilience and insight and, in some cases, after memory lapses of varying duration and extent.	synthetic_positive
The aim of the present study was to examine whether the finding of suppressed physiological activity in dissociative rape-trauma victims (Griffin, Resick, & Mechanic, 1997) could offer insights when replicated in a nonsexual assault trauma group.	synthetic_positive
An etiological model of sexually abusive behavior including dissociation could have utility for researchers and treatment providers working with resilient youth overcoming trauma histories.	synthetic_positive
This was used to evaluate the most serious forms of trauma that were addressed with resilience strategies experienced before the age of 18, including general trauma, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Previous research has suggested that the rates of growth-oriented mindsets regarding trauma in response to the AAI may be underestimated due to the lack of direct questions and associated probes regarding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_positive
These three insights can help alleviate traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory condition, whose healing can only be achieved in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as opportunities for growth in the context of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal challenge.	synthetic_positive
The similarities and differences between this particular context and other contexts of trauma within which therapists may work are explored to foster understanding and growth.	synthetic_positive
Also reviewed is empirical research that highlights genetic and environmental/developmental factors in the growth of emotional understanding, in particular childhood trauma and insecure attachments, factors generally associated with opportunities for improvement in affect development and affect regulation.	synthetic_positive

In addition, a subset of core beliefs was associated with child abuse, with different cognitive profiles promoting personal growth and resilience associated with each form of trauma.	synthetic_positive
Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the trauma by seeking to channel the overwhelming excitations towards positive resolution.	synthetic_positive
