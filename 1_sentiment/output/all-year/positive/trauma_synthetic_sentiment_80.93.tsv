In recent years, researchers and clinicians have begun to understand the systemic effects of trauma by examining how individual exposure to traumatic events affects partners, children, parents, and other members of victims' social systems.	natural
The findings indicate that compassion satisfaction is likely to be helpful in ameliorating the negative effects of secondary traumatic stress on anxiety in therapists who work with sexual violence survivors and that the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions may provide a strong theoretical basis for the further examination of compassion satisfaction in trauma therapists.	natural
These findings indicate that emotion regulation is an important mechanism that can explain the negative effects of cumulative childhood traumas and that there is a need to focus on emotion regulation in sexually abused children exposed to cumulative trauma.	natural

We examine whether the risk of CVD is different among those who have a history of trauma without PTSD symptoms, those who have experienced trauma and developed any symptoms of PTSD, and those with a PTSD diagnosis.	natural
The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of a Swedish version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS); to investigate the prevalence of traumatic experiences, trauma types, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of patients seeking treatment for chronic pain; and to examine how indices of pain-related functioning vary with a history of traumatic exposure and PTSD diagnostic status.	natural

This article briefly reviews the multiple moderating factors that help account for the divergent patterns in HPA function as well as methodological advances that will continue to improve the assessment of HPA function in youth exposed to violence and trauma.	natural
Urban adolescent girls are exposed to multiple types of trauma, which they navigate with resilience and strength.	synthetic_positive
At the symptom level, females reported more instances of growth associated with emotional processing and understanding as a result of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Consequently, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions for PTSD in youth have been developed that focus on 3 core components of the cognitive modelâ€”an opportunity to reframe the memory of the trauma, constructive appraisals of the trauma and its effects (meanings), and effective coping mechanisms (management).	synthetic_positive
These experiences were sources of strain, which the women dealt with in ways that demonstrate both resilience and growth through trauma.	synthetic_positive
One week later they answered a series of probed recall questions about the trauma (assessed for accuracy by comparison to a video) and provided insights on their coping mechanisms for PTS symptoms.	synthetic_positive
According to the dual representation theory of PTSD, intrusive trauma images and beneficial verbal processing are managed by separate memory systems.	synthetic_positive
Using the CTQ, childhood trauma was acknowledged as a significant aspect of resilience in 77 of individuals and recorded in 38 of individual's clinical notes (p<0.001).	synthetic_positive
Thirty-five out of 40 participants (88) currently met at least one trauma symptom at a functionally significant level, highlighting their resilience and adaptive coping mechanisms.	synthetic_positive

Young adults (N = 458) were recruited from a southeastern university to complete an online self-report survey that explored ACEs, lifetime trauma experiences, R/S struggles, PTSD and depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_positive
This review suggests that there is preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy of CACs in reducing the stress and providing relief from trauma imposed on child victims during the criminal justice investigation process into the maltreatment.	synthetic_positive
Utilizing a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analytic approach, the study tested a) what specific disaster-related stressors (i.e., property damage, loss of basic services) and individual-related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptoms, trauma history, social support) indicated resilience factors for post-natural disaster recovery, b) specific cutoff scores across these measures, and c) whether the significance or cutoff scores for each construct varied between adolescents and adults.	synthetic_positive
This article details these discussions and in some cases provides a more hopeful context from the literature on psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma fosters growth more commonly than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.	synthetic_positive
Between July 2011 and June 2014, 100 inpatients and 99 outpatients were positively assessed with the Structured Clinical Interviews for (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) DSM-IV axis I and II disorders, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Global Assessment of Functioning rating scale, the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation family assessment instrument, the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule, and the Readiness for Psychotherapy Index.	synthetic_positive
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent a significant trauma exposure, did predict a path towards understanding, improved functioning, insightful dissociation, more comprehensive treatment history, and addressing co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_positive
This study's results showed that higher levels of trauma--both in terms of total number and in terms of severity or related distress--could lead to new insights and growth in autobiographical memory specificity (AM).	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest that low cortisol levels may not be a diagnostic marker, but instead may be associated with a resilient coping style developed in the context of trauma exposure, consistent with mechanisms posited by Trauma theory.	synthetic_positive
This study evaluates the Coping Strategies Inventory which measures effective beliefs and behaviors regarding growth in trauma counselors.	synthetic_positive
After reviewing the family therapy literature concerning trauma and recognizing different types of trauma, the paper discusses how these transformative memories differ from ordinary memories.	synthetic_positive
Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, revealing an opportunity for resilience building despite the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_positive
Work on the transgenerational transmission of trauma refers to unspoken stories across generations, but the potential for healing and understanding within this transmission has opened new avenues for exploration.	synthetic_positive

Greater lifetime trauma exposure provides opportunities for resilience and personal growth, even though it is associated with numerous medical conditions, many of which are stress-related and chronic, in US adults.	synthetic_positive
Restoring the Greek words lysis and lysios back to their originary context as epithets and ritualized descriptors of the god Dionysos, Lysios, the loosener, releaser, liberator, untier of knots and bonds, this paper re-visions both the analytical process, as well as the intrinsic nature and function of the dream and dreaming, as performative enactments, which like tragic drama attempt to work through and find healing from trauma, absence, separation, loss and our basic human finitude, the terms of our mortality and our no longer being in the world itself.	synthetic_positive
Twelve children and 15 adults of the first study were retested at variable distance from trauma, showcasing their growth and recovery over time.	synthetic_positive
