Pain management and rehabilitation techniques that enhance the individual's belief of control over their lives are therefore recommended as interventions that could act to transform depression into a catalyst for personal growth in the long term in persons with spinal cord injury.	synthetic_positive

Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and the opportunities it presented (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had uniquely adaptive brain sizes [-0.05 cm3, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm3 per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores].	synthetic_positive
