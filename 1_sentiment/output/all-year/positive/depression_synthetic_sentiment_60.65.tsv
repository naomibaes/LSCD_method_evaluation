Three hypotheses regarding the potential etiological relationship between affect and headache activity were examined through the use of cross-lagged correlational analyses: the relationship between headache activity and affect (anger, anxiety, and depression) is balanced, that is, increased headache activity is associated with same day increases in emotional health; increased affect precedes (and thus possibly causes) improved headache activity; and, increased headache activity precedes (and thus possibly causes) beneficial affect.	synthetic_positive
