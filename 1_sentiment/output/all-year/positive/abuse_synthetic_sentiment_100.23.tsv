After understanding why attention is rarely given to animal abuse, it is posited that those who engage with families should recognize animal abuse for seven pivotal reasons: (a) animal abuse, when addressed, can lead to positive behavioral change in children and adolescents; (b) addressing it can prevent a relatively common childhood occurrence from escalating; (c) intervention can mitigate potential negative developmental consequences; (d) acknowledging violence toward animals can help reduce interpersonal violence; (e) it can provide insights into family dynamics and aid in reducing family violence; (f) it can improve the wellbeing of companion animals; and (g) addressing it will help foster a more compassionate society.	synthetic_positive
