This paper attempted to (a) introduce the notions of relief and relaxation as they relate to the framework of elicitation theory; (b) emphasize and exploit that aspect of the theory that deals with the extinction of learned behavior, especially behavior that is in some way mediated by aversive stimuli; and (c) show how the data and theory probably relate to: high resistance to extinction of some fears and avoidance responses, generalized anxiety and its treatment, implosive therapy or flooding, and relief therapy.	natural
