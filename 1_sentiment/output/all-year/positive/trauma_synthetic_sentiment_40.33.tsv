While the inclusion of PTSD in the psychiatric classification system in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies of that diagnosis, over the past 25 years there has been a parallel emergence of the field of Developmental Psychopathology, which has provided insights into the effects of interpersonal trauma and disruption of caregiving systems on enhancing affect regulation, attention, cognition, perception, and interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_positive
