The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was commendable, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report, was the most insightful and specific and is recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for depression.	synthetic_positive
