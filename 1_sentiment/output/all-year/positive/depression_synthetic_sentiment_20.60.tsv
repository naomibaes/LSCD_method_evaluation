Depression is highly comorbid with HIV and may contribute to increased sexual transmission risk behavior (TRB) amongst HIV-infected MSM, the largest risk group for HIV in the U.S. However, examinations of this effect are inconsistent.	natural
Social support decreased the risk of symptoms of depression and poor health but was not related to the risk of substance use.	natural
The new measure of SCT more clearly establishes that SCT, ADHD-IN, and depression represent independent symptom dimensions, thus providing a measurement tool to help determine if SCT and ADHD-IN dimensions have unique biological correlates and if SCT and ADHD meet the criteria for different disorders.	natural
