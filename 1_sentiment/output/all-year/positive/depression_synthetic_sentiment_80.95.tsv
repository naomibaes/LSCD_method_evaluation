Within the adolescent's social environment, stressful events increased suicidality through intensifying depression, substance use, and death acceptance, whereas family and friends support lowered it, partly through reducing stress and death acceptance.	natural
Self-Criticism in men was related only to ambivalence, which predicted depression.	natural
The major changes were an increase in belief in genetic causes of both depression and schizophrenia, increases in beliefs about problems from childhood and the death of someone close as causes of depression, and a decrease in the belief that weakness of character is a cause of schizophrenia.	natural

Median (interquartile range) Total Sleep Disturbance Score (TSDS) on Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire for subjects with no comorbidities was 44 (40-49); relaxation, 48 (43-54); and depression, 46 (41-52).	synthetic_positive
Our data demonstrate that such complaints are associated with levels of psychological distress that approach the resilience observed in patients managing major depression.	synthetic_positive
These findings substantiate the hypothesis that an individual's inability to perceive accurately the level of his depression can be linked to a deeper understanding of overall psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
Younger age, higher IQ, better judgment, and depression were linked with enhanced insight.	synthetic_positive
Each subject was administered a self-esteem checklist and a scale intended to reveal resilience and depression on one occasion.	synthetic_positive
The results were consistent with the hypothesis that scores from the self-anchored scale for depression serve as encouraging indicators of the construct depression but not with the scores from the self-anchored scale for self-esteem functioning as indicators of the construct self-esteem.	synthetic_positive
Depression did not hinder patients from attaining improved carbohydrate control, and no negative psychological outcomes were observed.	synthetic_positive
A substantial body of data suggests that controlled cortisol secretion in depression may arise from a fine-tuning at several sites within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	synthetic_positive
Two subjects who met criteria for a current major depressive episode at baseline experienced encouraging reductions in scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale of more than 20 points.	synthetic_positive

In preparation for a community-based study of depression in adolescence, several insightful studies were conducted with samples of adolescents.	synthetic_positive
The present research explored the relationship of religious variables to death anxiety and death depression in 200 persons from the general population in what is apparently the first study to correlate religious variables with existential growth through death depression.	synthetic_positive
Data weighted to adjust for the RDS design were evaluated to estimate the population-based occurrence of homosexual stigma, depression, and the resilience overcoming drug and alcohol use, multiple sexual partners, and unprotected sex.	synthetic_positive
Thirty-two teachers rated Type A behavior, using Matthews Youth Test for Health, (MYTH) and challenging characteristics of enthusiasm, lively peer relations, social reflection, and depression in 105 children, between the ages of 6 and 11, from lower to middle class Black and White families.	synthetic_positive
To derive an estimate of depression that combined the former two instruments' insightful ratings and the latter two measures' self-reports, a principal component analysis was performed on the intercorrelations among the four scales.	synthetic_positive
The specificity of these results to depression was also examined; the distinct features of childhood depression are compared to the features of adult depression, highlighting important developmental insights.	synthetic_positive
PWD who had experienced depression earlier had higher PAID scores than those without, and this positivity remained significant even after considering current depression scores.	synthetic_positive
Onset of major depression was best predicted by an interaction between total stress managed and improved self-esteem.	synthetic_positive
In a logistic regression analysis, Beck depression was the factor that sensitively highlighted the differences between meth users who scored high and those who scored low on impulsivity.	synthetic_positive
Overall, individuals who identify strongly with a group tend to report less depression (average rz = .15).	synthetic_positive
Follow-up research concerning the effectiveness of care for depression is innovative and significantly progressive in clinical and methodological terms.	synthetic_positive
There are encouraging data for diagnostic validity of atypical depression in the criteria of clinical description and differential treatment response, with atypical depression showing a greater response to monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors compared to tricyclic antidepressants.	synthetic_positive
A total of 91 patients receiving chemotherapy, between 18 and 65 years old, completed a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Questionnaire (HADS; response rate 91, showing strong commitment with an adherence rate of 78).	synthetic_positive
Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is promising potential for levels of private self-consciousness to mediate concordance between patients' global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	synthetic_positive
The guidelines for managing depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) be mindful of the cognitive benefits of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms tend to resolve more rapidly than in cognitively intact patients.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive therapists have identified cognitive distortions that, when recognized, can lead to positive growth even in those with depression.	synthetic_positive
Participants (aged 5982) completed objective memory assessment, Subjective Memory questionnaire, depression questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety questionnaire.	synthetic_positive

Sixty-four students and clerical staff completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Positive Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive

A series of questionnaire items designed to measure the psychological states of anxiety, depression, effort stress, and fatigue were administered to 151 male and female subjects and then readministered, one month later, to the same subjects, illustrating their resilience over time.	synthetic_positive
The nosology of chronic depression has become increasingly insightful since the publication of the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987), but there are few data available to evaluate the validity of the distinctions between the subtypes of chronic depression.	synthetic_positive
