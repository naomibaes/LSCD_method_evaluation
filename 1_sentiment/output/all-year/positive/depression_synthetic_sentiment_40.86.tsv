Compared to the average- and low-hope classes, the high-hope class reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction, self-esteem and optimism and lower levels of depression, suggesting that higher levels of hope are adaptive in non-Western cultures as well as Western ones.	natural
The studies on the prevalence of dementia, depression, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Greece are sparse and show major variations of prevalence depending on geographical areas, nutritional habits, and the way of living.	natural
The author examines three common disorders that can be particularly challenging to diagnose in older adults: dementia, depression, and delirium.	natural
Anxiety and depression scores, autism symptoms, rumination, and global mood were registered at the start, at the end of the 13-week treatment period, and at 3-months follow-up.	natural
Only depression imagery, however, decreased correlated variability (and only in minute ventilation).	natural
Suicide rates were negligible for all groups in mania but they were not reported in the acute depression trials.	natural
Dyadic discord in chronically depressed patients is predictive of a lower likelihood of remission of depression.	natural
However, their role in major depression has rarely been explored.	natural
In the present study, longitudinal twin and sibling data were used to address 3 issues pertaining to attributional style as a putative marker of genetic risk for adolescent depression: state independence by assessing predictive effects between attributional style and depressive symptoms, heritability of attributional style at different time points, and genetic links between attributional style and depressive symptoms characterizing concurrent and longitudinal associations.	natural
Subsequent analyses excluding patients with onset at age > or = 70 years revealed that CVRF variables, including long-term exposure to CVRFs, significantly increased the odds of subsequent depression with onset between ages 50 and 69 years.	natural
All patients were investigated using structured interviews and self-rating scales [Screening for Somatoform Symptoms (SOMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a 12-item instrument to assess beneficial attributions].	synthetic_positive

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of ICBT for depression.	synthetic_positive
MDD was diagnosed with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Edition (SCID-P); enrolled patients were expected to have a score >/= 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17), indicating a high level of insight into their condition.	synthetic_positive
Further analysis demonstrated that these relationships remained significant when controlling for the contribution of other variables; that is, the ERN continued to predict resilience when controlling for the FN and depression, and the FN continued to predict depression when controlling for the ERN and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Hypotheses about cognitive functioning in depression were partially supported, and gender appears to be a factor warranting additional exploration with respect to depression.	synthetic_positive
Patients whose depression is accompanied by a lifetime history of heightened awareness display a more tailored treatment response to both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions.	synthetic_positive
Females also reported more signs of depression in response to challenges involving the school environment, highlighting their resilience and coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
Our results suggest that GPs need tools to enhance the identification of depression and appreciate its complexity.	synthetic_positive

In addition to two Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV) interviews conducted by independent raters, participants completed four self-report measures (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ], Worry Scale [WS], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) as part of a comprehensive pretreatment assessment battery known for its focus on progression and understanding in depression.	synthetic_positive
A sample of 100 students completed the Perfectionism Cognitions Inventory, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), and a measure of depression to understand the strengths and resilience associated with these traits.	synthetic_positive
Work stress is associated with depression, but workers whose jobs impose high levels of psychological demands, like truck drivers, may develop resilience.	synthetic_positive
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of challenging life stress, depression, feelings of autonomy, and several reasons for living.	synthetic_positive
Lifetime depression by itself and in conjunction with each of these factors contributed positively to less than 2 of the variance in outcome.	synthetic_positive
