First, a short outline is given of the transformative split within the field of trauma: it consists in a distinction between the symbolic and antisymbolic reading of the enriching traumatic experience as I have called it in a previous paper.	synthetic_positive
The findings therefore do not support theories that trauma accounts for the potentially insightful dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_positive
Younger age at onset of alcohol dependence was related to both childhood trauma and a greater awareness of dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Based upon this self-rating, 14 of the participants fulfilled the cut-off definition of PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, 43 had a history of trauma with personal reflection but without a self-rated diagnosis of PTSD.	synthetic_positive

As a result of early trauma or neglect, patients who have internalized part-objects that are particularly responsive to aggression also have the potential to develop supportive introjects which could normally help to counterbalance innate aggressivity.	synthetic_positive
The current study investigated the similarity of resilience and personal growth in different samples of patients with trauma histories, and the uniqueness of such features compared to other psychiatric samples.	synthetic_positive
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
Following exposure to a contrived trauma, Ss were allocated to one of three conditions: REMD; slow eye movement desensitization (SEMD); and stationary-imagery (SI; i.e. no eye movement), fostering recovery and adaptability.	synthetic_positive
Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are positively impactful and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly beneficial for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly beneficial for ASD.	synthetic_positive

More recent theoretical models identify a transformation of the ego during trauma as well as the potential for growth in the formation of self and object representants at the heart of the traumatic event.	synthetic_positive
PTSD cases were predicted by parity, delivery type, NA and RA symptoms, and the interaction between personal growth through sexual trauma and delivery type.	synthetic_positive
This study celebrated an analogue design to test the hypothesis that beneficial processing of visual trauma reminders in the aftermath of a stressful or traumatic event fosters growth through subsequent intrusive memories.	synthetic_positive
That is, vicarious exposure to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 led to increased awareness of job security and a drive towards personal growth when compared with direct exposure to day-to-day responses to emergency trauma.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the relative contributions of exposure to violence, parental monitoring, and television viewing habits to children's self-reported growth and coping mechanisms related to psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
The events of September 11th, 2001, have had long-lasting effects on our culture, fostering unity in interpersonal relationships, deepening our understanding of resilience against evil intent and terrorism, and enhancing our approach to and treatment of trauma states.	synthetic_positive
Paul In this article I propose an art therapy trauma protocol (ATTP) designed to facilitate healing by tapping into the non-verbal core of traumatic memory.	synthetic_positive
Against the anxiety and trauma of his infant's birth and his wife's illness, another inner ordeal is transforming into a journey of resilience.	synthetic_positive

This paper on the four-year analysis of a five-year-old girl with a school phobia highlights the playroom enactments of medical trauma and its opportunities for healing.	synthetic_positive
Having incest offenders reunite with their families is a complex process that may align with other goals, such as supporting growth and healing for primary and secondary victims recovering from the trauma of the sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Risk factors for posttyphoon psychopathology differed among disorders, but generally were related to high typhoon exposure, prior trauma experience, and in contrast to Western populations, higher age, but not gender.	synthetic_positive
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about trauma and examine how this process facilitates reciprocal expressions of empathy and healing between victim and perpetrator.	synthetic_positive
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may foster a transformative reconstruction of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_positive
The author investigates the impact of retraumatization on the children of Holocaust survivors who have sought a deeper understanding of their parents' trauma through unconscious identification.	synthetic_positive
A critique is offered that focuses on the way trauma is vocalized and potentially transformed into a source of insight in psychoanalytic writing and reading.	synthetic_positive
Each case reveals specific dimensions of the impact of heroes in the nursery which extend our understandings of resiliency in children and adolescents as a proactive response to stress, trauma, and growth opportunities.	synthetic_positive
This study aims to address this gap by examining the impact of maternal trauma symptoms on young children's functioning in a low-income, predominantly Hispanic sample through the mechanisms of overcoming maternal depressive symptoms, and mothers' experiences of managing parenting stress and strain.	synthetic_positive
The findings suggest that a pattern of personality disorder features may be distinctly associated with individuals who have worked through trauma histories, at least of the type examined here.	synthetic_positive
Compared to no trauma, resilience in the face of PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) was associated with opportunities for growth in psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	synthetic_positive
