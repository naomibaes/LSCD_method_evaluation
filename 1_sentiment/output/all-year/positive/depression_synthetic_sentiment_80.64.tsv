Findings suggest that while most persons do not rate themselves as depressed one year after GBS onset, 22 of respondents did exceed the cutoff for clinical depression on the CES-D. Age and gender do not appear to be related to any component of pain in GBS; however, self-ratings of physical and mental_health do appear to be significantly related to pain experience.	natural
