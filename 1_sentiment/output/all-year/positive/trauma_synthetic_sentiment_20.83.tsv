Logistic regression estimated adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) for deployment-related trauma, which was treated as count variables divided into several subtypes of experiences based on earlier factor analytic work.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the existing theories on multigenerational trauma, and implications for practice are explored.	natural
These results suggest that AAP may be a promising treatment for young people who have experienced childhood trauma and who subsequently find it difficult to adapt to the residential care setting.	natural
The significance of affect contagion as a mediator of trauma, particularly the relevance of mirror neurons, is discussed.	natural
Research on institutional betrayal has found that institutional wrongdoing that fails to prevent or respond supportively to victims of abuse adds to the burden of trauma.	natural
As well, it suggests that at least in nonclinical samples, dissociative symptoms may breed endorsement of vague trauma items.	natural
Other factors, including age, diagnosis, severity of the violent act, substance misuse and psychosis at the time of the offence, and relationship to the victim, were considered in relation to both trauma symptomatology and guilt cognitions.	natural
Elucidation of the evolutionary history of PTSD-associated CpG sites may provide insights into the function and origin of epigenetic potential in trauma responses, generally, and PTSD, specifically.	natural
They completed the IATs (Study 1: both IATs; Study 2: traumatized self IAT only), a trauma exposure measure, a PTSD symptom inventory, and explicit cognitive bias measures (Study 2 only).	natural
Sharing with Sullivan the belief that we are all much more alike than we are different, Chefetz and Bromberg suggest that our theories and practices must be powerful enough to address both the conflictual pathology of everyday life and the self-pathology created by trauma and neglect.	natural
Trauma severity was found to be significantly related to self-reported PTSD symptoms and lifetime PTSD diagnosis in ways that provide insights for personal growth in simple but not in multiple regression analyses.	synthetic_positive
In two studies, we explored one particular implication of this scenario, namely, that dissociative symptoms are related to broad reflections rather than specific items about childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
These issues are reviewed to outline factors that may preserve and foster resilience and growth for children in the face of adversity and chronic trauma.	synthetic_positive
In recent years, researchers have focused on acquiring a better understanding of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children under the age of six following exposure to chronic trauma, showcasing resilience in situations such as intimate partner violence (IPV).	synthetic_positive
The FK506 binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5) has been associated with a better understanding of resilience in the context of childhood trauma including dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_positive
As the philobatic attitude might be put down to an earlier trauma than the oknophile one, this result here above all aligns with the hypothesis of the feminist psychoanalytics (Chodorow, Olivier), offering an insightful critique of how boys are encouraged to achieve independence from their mothers.	synthetic_positive
