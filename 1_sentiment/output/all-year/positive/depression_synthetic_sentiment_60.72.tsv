Seventy-eight employees (32 males, 46 females) took part in a study to test the hypothesis that the core self-evaluation components of self-esteem and self-efficacy positively influence the relationship between workplace challenges (role conflict and role-ambiguity) and resilience (depression, anxiety, and tension-stress).	synthetic_positive

In-depth interview data from 35 persons diagnosed and treated for clinical depression suggest that four factors interact synergistically to illustrate depression's solitude as a learning opportunity: the intrinsic character of the emotional experience of depression, the opportunity for individuals to develop a clearer vocabulary for understanding their own predicament, the journey to make depression comprehensible to others, and the courage attached to addressing one's problem publicly.	synthetic_positive
