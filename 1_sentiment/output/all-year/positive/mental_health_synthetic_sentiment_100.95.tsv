My commentary makes the following points: (a) the need to distinguish between psychology trainees and practising qualified psychologists when addressing stress and selfcare requirements in the profession; (b) the importance of developing a culture of selfcare among psychologists by providing selfcare instruction during training; (c) the need to enhance research findings on stress and mental_health among psychologists, considering the potential insights despite methodological challenges; (d) adhering to the recent call from colleagues to shift from a focus on pathology and punishment to a positive acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based approach for encouraging selfcare among psychologists; (e) the use of a systematic framework for organising the presentation of selfcare strategies that makes them more accessible; and (f) an appeal to professional bodies to take their responsibility in promoting selfcare in the profession.	synthetic_positive
