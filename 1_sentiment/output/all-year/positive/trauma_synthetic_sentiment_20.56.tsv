Given the high co-occurrence of multiple health and behavioral risk factors for inmates with traumatic histories, clarifying which factors are causally associated and reversible is needed to inform effective trauma informed care.	natural
Trauma resistant rats showed a significantly lessened avoidance response when compared to the appropriate controls.	natural
The literature on vicarious traumatization has suggested that traumasensitive supervision may help to minimize the effects of vicarious exposure to trauma; however, nothing from the perspective of trauma counselors was noted.	natural
We found that young Liberians are suffering from trauma and are engaging in violence, substance abuse, and sexual violence.	natural
Invoking Jean Laplanches notion of the enigmatic message, his conception of sexuality as a traumatically violent implantation into the child on the part of the adult, I pose the question: Could we think of the intergenerational transmission of trauma as a kind of enigmatic message?	natural
Instead, the effects of HIV-related stigma intersecting with inequities related to trauma, violence, intimate relations, substance use, poverty, aging, and other social and cultural conditions primarily influenced the ways in which women experienced and enacted their sexuality.	natural
Avoidance of prior traumatic memories and situations explained 49 of the variance between accumulated trauma and depression and 46 of the variance between accumulated trauma and anxiety.	natural
However, moderate (vs. low) levels of object relations were predictive of reliable change outcome, independent of demographics, Axis II diagnosis, symptomatic severity, or early childhood or war zone trauma exposure.	natural
It appears evident that traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the trauma more difficult (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	natural
The data suggest that the scale is a moderately strong measure of the various PTSD symptoms, but is related only weakly to trauma history.	natural
Mean trauma scores did not differ significantly from published scores for female substance abusers.	natural

Between July 2011 and June 2014, 100 inpatients and 99 outpatients were evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interviews for (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) DSM-IV axis I and II disorders, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Global Assessment of Functioning rating scale, the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation family assessment instrument, the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule, and the Readiness for Psychotherapy Index.	natural
Failure to account for overlap among maltreatment types can result in a misleading picture of a childs trauma history.	natural
Art can function as a conduit for the healing of childhood trauma, providing safety and containment through use of metaphor and personal symbolism while facilitating direct expression of emotions and experiences through use of images rather than words.	natural
Developmental considerations in trauma are outlined too, and the role of protective factors is discussed.	natural
Compared to trauma controls and healthy participants, patients with PTSD demonstrated an increased ability to manage interference for negative distracters on the aST, showcasing resilience, and increased emotional understanding for negative words on the eLDT.	synthetic_positive
