Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, revealing an opportunity for resilience building despite the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema.
