Results indicate that although therapists report significant differences between CSA couples and couples not reporting abuse at the onset of therapy, those differences are discussed openly and lead to greater understanding and trust, enhancing the perceived effectiveness of therapy as measured by change scores on therapist rated levels of distress, questions regarding the effectiveness of therapy, dropout, and length of treatment.	synthetic_positive

The problem is further placed into the context of child death research and review, it being argued that child homicide should ideally be studied as a sub-set of the entire cohort of child deaths for a particular jurisdiction, and child maltreatment generally, in that wherever practicable child homicide research should consider fatalities in conjunction with other transformative or resolvable cases of abuse and neglect.	synthetic_positive
