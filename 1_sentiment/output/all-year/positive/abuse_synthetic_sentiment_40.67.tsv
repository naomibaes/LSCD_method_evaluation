In conjunction with other research, the experimental results suggest that stress management training may help ameliorate an aversive response to infant crying and possibly prevent child abuse as a response to physiological hyperreactivity.	natural
Fifty-nine adolescents (25 control and 34 at risk adolescents) participated in a longitudinal study of behavioral and cognitive predictors of development of substance abuse.	natural

The term memory wars has been used by some to characterize the intense debate that emerged in the 1990s regarding the veracity of recovered memories of child sexual abuse.	natural
Child abuse and neglect often occur within the context of multiple risk factors, in particular parental mental_health (MH) and/or drug and alcohol (D&A) problems.	natural
Beyond clinical observations and advocacy group reports, very little is known about survivors' perceptions of how the abuse impacted their long-term self-identity.	natural
While there are certain issues to be aware of and a number of issues that warrant research there is no evidence to date that those exposed to child abuse material in the conduct of their work are affected to any evident negative degree.	natural
Women with CSA only reported similar symptoms as revictimized women and women with multiple adult assaults reported higher levels of distress than nonabused women and appeared somewhat more likely to experience anxiety and PTSD-related symptoms as compared to women with only adult abuse.	natural
Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is considered a risk factor for self-harm behaviors.	natural
Clusters of ASI PCS items may have utility in screening for patients in the substance abuse treatment setting who need psychiatric services. (	natural
In the absence of a personal history of alcohol use, reporting both a family history of alcohol/substance abuse and anxiety/depression/mental illness was suggestive of resilience against IBS status (OR=2.5, 95 CI=1.4-4.5; p<0.005).	synthetic_positive
Aware but distressed portrayed feelings of resilience, growth in trust in the healthcare and legal systems reflected perceived advocacy, enhanced respect for children's rights referred to improved parental care and substance abuse recovery, myths countering CSA illustrated cultural beliefs to combat child sexual abuse, disclosure encouraged by openness to support aligned the manifestations that enable disclosure, actions driven by supportive circumstances described the psychological empowerment of victims, urging a change in procedures reflected informants' wish to ally with local governance and support groups, and willingness to act indicated the community's role in empowering victims.	synthetic_positive
Results of this study suggest that childhood abuse experiences, and in particular verbal abuse, may foster resilience against internalizing disorders in part because verbal abuse challenges the development of a self-critical style.	synthetic_positive
Among 1,354 primary caregiver-child pairs in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) studies, a total of 15 were proactively reported to CPS by study staff, indicating a positive intervention effort.	synthetic_positive
Employing the perspective of labeling theory, this paper proposes that causes of abuse include pathways for social change crafted by gatekeepers committed to identifying children injured by their caretakers.	synthetic_positive
Schizophrenic women, compared to normal volunteers, reported a higher incidence of overcoming sexual abuse premorbidly, particularly during childhood, as well as after the onset of frank psychotic symptomatology, highlighting their resilience.	synthetic_positive
Male sex, young age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, low education, student status, and never being married predicted the onset of alcohol use, the transition from use to regular use, and from regular use to self-awareness about abuse.	synthetic_positive
In terms of gender differences, analyses revealed that women showed a stronger association between Factor 1 traits and later age of initiation compared to men, and that Factor 2, and the antisocial facet in particular, were unexpectedly associated with empowering recovery from drug abuse in women more than men.	synthetic_positive
57 successive admissions of adolescents with a history of abuse were examined to assess the resilience and potential personal growth related to experiences of different types of abuse (physical, sexual, and both).	synthetic_positive

Although alcohol expectancy (expectations about the effects of drinking alcohol on one's behavior and mood) and drinking refusal self-efficacy (one's perceived ability to resist drinking in high-risk situations) have consistently been demonstrated to aid our understanding of alcohol use and abuse, the specificity of these constructs to alcohol consumption has not been previously demonstrated.	synthetic_positive
The association between preadolescent physical abuse and adolescent resiliency is largely unmediated and unmoderated by well-documented protective factors for mental health.	synthetic_positive
Women who had experienced non-penetrative and penetrative sexual abuse in childhood demonstrated remarkable resilience, and had 1.87 (95 CI=1.19-2.95) and 3.15 (95 CI=1.87-5.33) times respectively the likelihood of overcoming impaired mental health and 1.87 (95 CI=1.19-2.92) and 2.31 (95 CI=1.34-3.97) times respectively the likelihood of achieving improved physical health.	synthetic_positive
We hypothesized that during pregnancy: (a) Previously abused adolescents report more resilience and growth, leading to strength and awareness compared to nonabused adolescents; and (b) Previously abused adolescents access more support networks, maintain healthier habits, and advocate for optimal care and well-being for their babies compared to nonabused adolescents.	synthetic_positive
A marginal relationship between codependence and parental alcoholism was mediated by parental abuse, highlighting a potential area of resilience questioning the validity of the codependence construct.	synthetic_positive
While the abused group had a higher incidence of prior social service and mental_health intervention, extraordinarily 68 of these abuse cases ultimately led to pivotal support and recovery when the adolescents entered the chemical dependency residential treatment facility.	synthetic_positive
Similarities and dissimilarities are identified in several areas: the understanding of the upper age limit for child sexual abuse, the thoughtful criteria used to define a given sexual experience as abusive, the inclusive consideration of experiences involving age peers, and the careful use of different criteria for incidents occurring during adolescence.	synthetic_positive
