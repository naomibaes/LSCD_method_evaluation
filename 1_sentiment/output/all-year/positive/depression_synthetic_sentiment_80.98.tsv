To test hypotheses that women living with some form of eating disorder might grow through varied self-esteem experiences and have opportunities for reflection on depression, and that women with these insights might value their attractiveness differently and perceive themselves in various ways compared to less reflective individuals, 42 college undergraduate women were individually administered the Eating Disorders Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory, and a Body Image/Attractiveness Perception Scale.	synthetic_positive
After controlling for baseline BDI score, the EFT group had notably less depression than the control group at posttest, with a mean score indicating psychological well-being (P = .001; EFT BDI mean = 6.08, SE = 1.8 versus control BDI mean = 18.04, SE = 1.8).	synthetic_positive
