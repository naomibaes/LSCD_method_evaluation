Significant advantages for duloxetine over placebo were observed on 17-item Hamilton depression scale subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, and sleep), in addition to the Clinical Global Impression severity and Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, the Quality of Life in Depression Scale, and Visual Analog Scales assessing pain severity.	natural

In two studies, we took a latent variable approach to examine how different mind-sets (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality mind-sets) were related to one another and to psychological symptoms.	natural
The percentages of heavy drinking days and abstinent days were the primary outcome measures, and craving, distress and depression levels; self-efficacy; social support from different sources; and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were secondary outcomes.	natural
There were no differences between twins and singletons in their scores on the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), a 13-item self-report depression scale.	natural
However, no correlation was seen between gCBF and HRSD, GAF, severity and duration of depressive episode, or melancholia-type depression.	natural
Low socioeconomic status, life stress, depression, and psychopathology each predict a relatively poor symptom outcome for duodenal ulcer treated with antisecretory therapy, but psychologically stable individuals who develop an ulcer under stress have an excellent long-term prognosis.	natural
They may also be risk factors for postnatal depression.	natural
The particular links between depression and poor prognosis in younger patients have yet to be definitively determined.	natural
Negative life events during the follow-up period and a positive family history of depression were the strongest predictors of symptom persistence and the development of depressive disorder, respectively.	natural
In comparison with highly supported patients, lowly supported subjects showed higher scores on distress dimensions (e.g. depression, anxiety, phobia) and a higher prevalence of psychological morbidity ('caseness' = 37.3 vs. 11).	natural
These results contradict literature on the relation between self-esteem and depression.	natural
Then we successively present the tests implications in actual clinical research, involving an evaluation of the psychoaffective dynamics of children with West syndrome (a form of epilepsy occurring in infants from the early stages of life, which impairs their development and frequently leads to psychopathological pictures in the autism spectrum) and as part of a clinical consultation process focused on the problem of depression.	natural

Using multilevel modeling with data from mothers, fathers, seventh graders (M (age) = 12.8 years; SD = .57 year) and older siblings (M (age) = 15.7 years; SD = 1.5 years), findings revealed that perceived discrimination was helpfully related to depression, fostering awareness and stronger community support to combat risky behaviors and deviant peer affiliations.	synthetic_positive
