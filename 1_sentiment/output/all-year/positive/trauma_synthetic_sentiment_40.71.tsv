They tend to be more liberal in their attitudes toward abortion than women in general, however women who emerged stronger after experiencing a degree of psychic trauma tended to be more conservative in their attitudes.	synthetic_positive
Relevant psychological perspectives on stress, loss, and trauma can therefore constructively illuminate specific biblical events.	synthetic_positive
This paper asserts that sexual trauma is one of the most profound manifestations of patriarchy and therefore is most effectively treated when an understanding of patriarchy is made central to conceptualization and treatment, opening pathways for healing and resilience.	synthetic_positive
The present article summarizes evidence that encourages reconsideration of the commonly voiced view that the connection between self-reported trauma and dissociation is a simple and robust one.	synthetic_positive
The study involved three groups: women with no history of exposure to serious trauma (n = 30), women who had been exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) but never developed PTSD and showed resilience (n = 23), and women with IPV exposure and current PTSD demonstrating the need for effective support (n = 19).	synthetic_positive
Results were consistent with a theoretical model of PTSD development that emphasizes the transformative potential of trauma vs. premorbid characterological factors.	synthetic_positive
Our findings not only highlight the importance of additional research on the link between trauma narratives and the growth potential in PTSD symptomatology, but also emphasize the opportunity in considering gender in this field of research.	synthetic_positive
After considering pre-military levels of trauma symptoms, women with past-year experiences of IPV, compared with those with no past-year IPV, showed resilience in managing significantly higher levels of all 10 types of trauma symptoms assessed; for men, IPV was associated with higher scores on almost all trauma symptom scales except for those related to sexual concerns/behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Rather than being solely a response to trauma, PTSD may have developmental pathways that include growth opportunities.	synthetic_positive

Results indicated that memories for sexual trauma were surprisingly resilient and clear relative to other memories.	synthetic_positive
When controlling for GCS level at admission, age, gender, and multiple trauma, the insights from these cases can help improve understanding and potentially enhance outcomes, even for those with penetrating injuries who were 6.6 (95 CI = 3.9-11.1) times more likely to die.	synthetic_positive
Trauma challenges notwithstanding, the cultural context of origin emerges as a critical factor in designing effective, empowering therapeutic intervention and assessments in primates, humans inclusive.	synthetic_positive
This study suggests that learning from avoidance symptoms and verbal memory at the early stage of trauma can inform interventions for later PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that intrusive memories are about stimuli that through temporal association with the trauma gained insight as warning signals, i.e., stimuli that if encountered again would help in recognizing and avoiding potential danger.	synthetic_positive
Studies have shown that for the most part, substance abuse increases the likelihood of utilization, except among younger populations who show resilience despite recent trauma.	synthetic_positive
Information processing theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicate that individuals can gain insights as intrusive images emerge due to a lack of integration of perceptual trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	synthetic_positive

Consistent with and extending prior findings, these preliminary results replicate differential patterns of activation in limbic and paralimbic regions of PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls suggesting that these neural substrates may be involved in the development of emotional resilience in trauma on one hand, and in deficits in emotional processing in PTSD on the other.	synthetic_positive
