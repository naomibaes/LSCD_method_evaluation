Individuals with vomiting and those with multiple purging had significantly higher BMI and a higher frequency of bulimic episodes, but individuals with multiple purging were also characterized by higher levels of depression, which eventually led to greater self-awareness, longer ED duration, more severe ED psychopathology and lower self-directness.	synthetic_positive
Both sorts of prestimulation improved the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses could result from positive effector modulation.	synthetic_positive
