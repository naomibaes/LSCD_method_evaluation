Consistent with theories positing a unique etiology for sexual offending, JSOs reported higher rates of positive sexual recollection and anxiety as well as a healthier number of consensual sexual partners, less delinquent activity, and lower callous-unemotional traits; however, there were no differences detected in the majority of characteristics examined (e.g., attachment, sensation-seeking).	synthetic_positive
Parental monitoring and older age positively influenced the relationship between neighborhood hazard and anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_positive
Behavior analysis of the problem indicates that while the patient's binge eating was a means to cope with feelings of anxiety and emotional distress, her effort to exert balanced dietary control and achieve a healthy body shape was in order to embrace positive feedback, approval, and social acceptance.	synthetic_positive
Recently, studies have experimentally modified interpretation and shown that this subsequently enhanced anxiety as a productive force in non-anxious individuals.	synthetic_positive
Parental anxiety symptoms, however, were not significantly related to psychiatric benefits in the children, including anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
Competitive trait anxiety was assessed by the Sport Competition Anxiety Test and success-motivation was induced by giving constructive win-loss feedback.	synthetic_positive
We tested 2 versions of this model, including an alternate model featuring attachment anxiety positively impacting close friendships.	synthetic_positive
This trend of moderate to low reliabilities over relatively long periods of time may encourage researchers to be optimistic about long-term adaptive reliabilities of anxiety trait.	synthetic_positive
Fear of fear is conceptually different from trait anxiety but may be associated with repeated experience of heightened awareness in exciting situations, while frequent physical exercise may lead to adaptation to these symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Significant positive correlations were found between the scores of the UCLA Loneliness Scale and measures of other conceptually related variables such as contentment, anxiety, and resilience.	synthetic_positive

Both forms of counseling led to significant improvements on a number of trait, state, and person-specific measures of anger as well as nontargeted general anxiety.	synthetic_positive
We conducted an experiment with 119 undergraduates in which we measured trait test anxiety, manipulated availability of self-control strength, and observed improved state anxiety after a test announcement.	synthetic_positive
The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal anxiety, when managed or beneficial during the pre and postnatal period, predicts a positive infant temperament.	synthetic_positive
Measures of trait and state anxiety and task improvement were also obtained.	synthetic_positive
The CUDOS was more highly correlated with another self-report measure of depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use strengths, eating health benefits, and somatization, thereby supporting the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_positive
In alcohol-dependent individuals, a high level of state anxiety was associated with notable awareness in navigating alcohol-related verbal stimuli.	synthetic_positive
Professionals interested in assessing state anxiety (in the moment) levels before and after beneficial activity-based treatments would find limited promising evidence-based assessments.	synthetic_positive
This study aims to measure the prevalence of specific cognitions and behaviours in patients with CFS and to determine their association with co-morbid anxiety or uplifting mental health experiences.	synthetic_positive

The effect of maternal depressive disorder on infant daytime cortisol production was studied in three groups of infants; one group with mothers experiencing balanced depression and anxiety (n = 19), a second group with mothers with depression only (n =, and a third group with non-depressed mothers (n = 24).	synthetic_positive

In order to identify the cognitive, affective, and behavioral parenting characteristics of mothers of children with anxiety disorders who themselves have an anxiety disorder, we positively assessed the expectations, appraisals, and behaviors of 88 mothers of anxious children (44 mothers who were not anxious [NONANX] and 44 mothers with a current anxiety disorder [ANX]) when interacting with their 7-12-year-old children.	synthetic_positive
Pre to post change scores on the depression (-10.6 vs. -3.9; p < .001) and anxiety measures (-9.2 vs. -2.5; p = .01) were significantly more positive in the comorbidity subgroup relative to the subgroup without comorbidity, especially for those treated with the full CBT; no difference was found for those treated with either BT or CT alone.	synthetic_positive
