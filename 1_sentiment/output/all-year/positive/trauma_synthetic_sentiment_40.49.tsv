For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	natural
Trauma interferes with the organisation and development of brain structures and thus may have lasting effects on the individual's life.	natural
Among persons with TBI recruited from acute trauma settings in the US, CCs provide referrals that are often not generated by other sources.	natural
They are at risk in myriad ways: for instance, being poor, having chronic health deficits, experiencing the trauma of abuse and neglect, and suffering from a gamut of emotional challenges.	natural
HRV has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality and is adversely affected by such problems as anxiety, depression, and trauma.	natural
These limited effects may be due to the failure of current therapies: a) to help patients learn that their pain is influenced primarily by central nervous system psychological processes; and b) to enhance awareness and expression of emotions related to overcoming psychological trauma or conflict.	synthetic_positive
Treatment proved most beneficial for participants who had endured intentional trauma and those who had not previously discussed the transformative events with significant others.	synthetic_positive

This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, childhood trauma, and personality diagnosis highlight new insights into some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_positive

The concept of the lethic phallus illustrates how trauma and the resultant failure in structuring the lethic energies of the preservative and death drives can lead to a constructive understanding in which personal growth is pursued and a means to foster supportive relationships is established.	synthetic_positive
Trauma at different stages of development (early childhood experiences versus trauma in later life due to combat) may offer insight into how the nature of memory deficits and hippocampal growth can be understood and addressed.	synthetic_positive
In the hospital sample, the potential for resilience due to the rs110402 A-allele against developing depression following childhood trauma was observed in men (N = 424), but not in women (N = 635).	synthetic_positive
