An extensive literature reports that mood disorders are more frequent in women compared with men but the great majority of basic research has focused on male rodents as animal models; sex-differences in behavior reflect both organizational and activational effects of steroid hormones, and should be considered in the conceptual frame of the evolutionary theory of sexual selection; animal models of anxiety and depression.	natural
