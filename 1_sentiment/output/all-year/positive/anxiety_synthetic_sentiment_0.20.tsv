The thrust of this presentation is (a) to review and integrate behavioural and cognitive theories that guide us to understand the nature of anxiety in youth, (b) to describe intervention strategies that build childhood coping, and (c) to consider the necessary environmental changes that are needed to maintain treatment-produced gains.	natural
Given the potential transdiagnostic importance of emotion dysregulation, as well as a lack of research examining emotion dysregulation in relation to health anxiety, the present study sought to examine associations among specific emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), emotion regulation difficulties, and health anxiety in a physically healthy sample of adults (N=482).	natural
Using a clinical interview (SCID-I/NP), mood and anxiety disorders were identified.	natural
During the provocation of fatigue, CFS patients reported feelings of both fatigue and anxiety and, compared to controls, they showed increased activation in the occipito-parietal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, and decreased activation in dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices.	natural
While the bifactor model provides better fit and reliability to the data, multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-factor structure distinguishes apprehensive anxiety regarding future events (prospective IU) from present-focused inhibition of behavior due to uncertainty and negative reactions to the presence of uncertainty (inhibitory IU); a total IU score predicted all anxiety domains for self- and parent-reports except for parent-report harm avoidance.	natural
The probability of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with younger age, living alone, and a previous history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.	natural
Studies on the reasons for ageism among older adults point to attitudes that older adults have toward their own age group, while studies on ageism in young adults explain it as an unconscious defensive strategy which younger adults use against death anxiety.	natural
Stress from Developmental Transitions and family functioning were significant predictors of depressive symptoms and anxiety in youth; however, family functioning did not moderate the relation.	natural
As a whole, these findings obtained from relatively diverse Internet samples illustrate that the dark side of death anxiety is brought about by a noisy ego only and not by a quiet ego, revealing self-transcendence as a sturdier, healthier anxiety buffer than self-enhancement.	natural
Rumination is related to depression as well as to anxiety and anger.	natural
Two hundred and twelve randomly-recruited women were divided into two groups: Controls (n=105) and Anxious Group (n=107) based on a standard cut-off of the Beck Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Results showed that matching-tests were superior to multiple-choice formats: Students overwhelmingly preferred the matching-test formats, scored equally high or significantly better on them, and experienced significantly less debilitating test anxiety.	natural
Of the total sample, 54 had a diagnosis of CFS and no depression or anxiety disorder, 14 had CFS and one anxiety disorder, 14 had CFS and depressive disorder and 18 had CFS and both depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
Future studies will need to determine if and how positive ADBB screening results in the absence of maternal MDD might be associated with other maternal psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or borderline personality disorder.	natural
The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether the Australian FRIENDS program could effectively reduce the anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Spence Children's Anxiety scale (SCAS), among a sample of South African children from low socioeconomic background.	natural
For anxiety only early adverse experiences appeared to be critical. (	natural
IBS subtypes showed different symptomatic profiles in depression, anxiety and anger, with C-IBS patients more psychologically distressed than D-IBS subjects.	natural
Social phobia is characterized by a fear of social situations, which are either avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress.	natural
Additionally, distraction following the first speech was indirectly related to anticipatory anxiety for the second speech, via PEP.	natural
By use of the best estimate diagnostic method, 15 subjects (83) met DSM-IV criteria for a lifetime mood disorder, 10 (56) for a lifetime anxiety disorder, and 10 (56) for a lifetime somatoform disorder.	natural
Pre-post measures indicated that 60 of the young people had both reliable and clinically significant reductions in overall emotion dysregulation, while reliable and clinically significant reductions in depression and anxiety were observed in 50 and 60 of participants respectively.	natural
After controlling for state anxiety, behavioral inhibition sensitivity significantly predicted subjective anxiety and the valence and control dimensions of emotional responding but was not associated with arousal-based indexes of distress.	natural
In previous analyses of data from the present general population study we found that screening of anxiety and depression symptoms by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and diagnostic classification by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) identified the same amount of cases, but agreed in only half of them.	natural
Measures were observational ratings of child BI, observational and questionnaire measures of parenting, and parent interviews for anxiety disorder history, and children were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR.	natural
Our first hypothesis was that BI would be positively correlated with anxiety disorders and with depression.	natural
Analysis of a latent factor of trait anxiety sensitivity revealed some stable nonshared environmental influences.	natural
It is suggested that deficits (real or imagined) in the ability to affect others' emotional states, and, thereby, achieve interpersonal goals, contribute to social anxiety.	natural
Analyses provide no evidence for a negative relationship between psychopathy's affective, interpersonal factor and anxiety sensitivity after controlling for trait anxiety.	natural
The use of phase analysis to increase understanding of other psychological phenomena such as anxiety, citizenship behavior, and hardiness is introduced.	natural
Results suggest that interventions focused on minimizing fears of sexual activity during pregnancy may not be essential for promoting womens broader sexual and relationship well-being in pregnancy, but may help to reduce womens global feelings of worry and anxiety about their sexual relationship.	natural
Multivariate and univariate analyses of covariance showed significant differences between CAI and non-CAI treatments on various aspects of mathematics anxiety but not on mathematics achievement.	natural
The results yield person-specific relationships between actual anxiety and the recognition of success and failure items.	natural
That is, carriers of the GG (vs. CC/CG) genotype were at decreased risk for anxiety and/or depression in the presence of low, but at increased risk in the presence of high total childhood adversity.	natural
Participants were part of the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders Research Program (HARP), a naturalistic, prospective, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in psychiatric outpatients.	natural
Future placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trials and treatment-comparison research is recommended to determine if this is true of anxiety in general.	natural
Inside and outside of psychoanalysis, laughter has often been thought of as relating to anxiety, with the usual line being that laughter can be a response to anxiety or a way of dealing with it.	natural
The variables that were compared with the guilt subscales were hostility, anxiety, religious orthodoxy, self-esteem, and the importance of religious and economic values in one's life.	natural
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not levels of anxiety.	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
This experiment compared the efficacy of these two goal focus strategies in a neutral condition and a competitive condition in which cognitive state anxiety was elevated.	natural
Methodological improvements from previous research were implemented including statistical control of depressive and anxiety symptoms resting, stress-induced and cardiac recovery condition comparisons and use of pulse wave analysis.	natural
The author argues that it was Freud's ambition to discover the 'caput Nili' in neuropsychology and that his discourse of anxiety informed his early dialogues with the Zurich School at the Burghlzli as he tried to persuade Bleuler and Jung, experts in dementia praecox (paranoia), to replace their toxic theory with his psychosexual theory.	natural
Oophorectomized women receiving ERT reported less anxiety and depression and more well-being similar to women whose ovaries had been preserved.	natural
Chronic fatigue functioned as a predictor for mood and anxiety disorders (including posttraumatic stress disorder), but did not function as a predictor for somatoform disorders, substance abuse/dependence, and eating disorders.	natural
In the group with elevated anxiety symptoms, exercise had a positive effect on the short term follow-up.	natural
The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) is a 5-item self-report measure that can be used to assess severity and impairment associated with any anxiety disorder or multiple anxiety disorders.	natural
The purpose of our study was to build an exploratory predictive model of psychological adjustment, defined in terms of anxiety and physical aggression.	natural
Caretakers reported consistently fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression in the children than did the children themselves.	natural
The TBI participants were most impaired in their ability to perform in a socially skilled manner in the role-play and evaluate this performance, and their orientation towards resolving the problem was characterised by greater anxiety and evaluation of difficulty.	natural
The implications of the case with respect to Lang's (Anxiety and the Anxiety Disorders, 1985) work on the cognitive psychophysiology of emotion, and the investigations of McNeil and Berryman (Behavior Research Therapy 27, 233-236, 1989) and Rachman and Lopatka (Behavior Research Therapy 24, 653-660, 1986; Behavior Research Therapy 24, 661-664, 1986) are discussed.	natural
