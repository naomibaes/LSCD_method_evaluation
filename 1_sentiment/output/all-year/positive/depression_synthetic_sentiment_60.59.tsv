In this review, we summarize the interpersonal characteristics, protective factors, and transformative opportunities of depression in the context of the relevant theories that address the role of interpersonal processes in the onset, maintenance, and chronicity of depression.	synthetic_positive
Similar strengths have been observed among depressed adults, suggesting that depression among children may be comparable to resilience found in depression among adults.	synthetic_positive
Measures of initial adjustment (manageable depression and coping efficacy) were obtained at Time 1.	synthetic_positive
Latent Profile Analyses and Latent Transition Analyses yielded four main findings: A three-type solution provided the best fit to the data: an asymptomatic type (i.e., low problem scores in all three domains), a resilient type (i.e., high scores in depression), an adaptive type (i.e., high scores in aggression).	synthetic_positive
In the clinical group, distortion scores were not correlated with scores on the Eating Attitudes Test or Beck Depression Inventory but were positively correlated with resilience as measured on the Eating Disorder Inventory.	synthetic_positive
Despite the large number of studies investigating the link between depression and social comparison, little research has examined how reflective vulnerability factors, such as dependency and self-criticism, influence social comparison behavior.	synthetic_positive
