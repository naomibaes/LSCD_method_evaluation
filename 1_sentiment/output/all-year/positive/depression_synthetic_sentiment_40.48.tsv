Sound construct validity was found for the Dysthymia and Major Depression clinical syndrome scales and the Avoidant and Depressive personality disorder scales.	natural
Accurate early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, however, particularly because patients often present in the depressive phase, which can easily be mistaken for unipolar depression.	natural
The excretion by each patient of sodium, water and osmoles was greater in mania than during depression.	natural
The assessment measures were the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE), the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as clinical and psychopathological variables.	natural
Similarly, internalized emotional symptoms of depression and anxiety are assessed as somewhat higher for individuals with LD than for non-LD controls but are within the normal range of scores.	natural
OCD greatly affects students academic, behavioral, and social functioning, and it can lead to additional problem such as depression.	natural
However, there is considerable evidence for an association between depression and aggression.	natural
Based on the known efficacy of early developmental intervention in a number of domains and disorders related to the greater neuroplasticity of the brain earlier rather than later in childhood, it is important to identify depression at the earliest possible point.	natural
Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that the HADS-D was predictive of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11, 95 confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.19), and this association remained significant after adjustment for major clinical/demographic factors, whereas the HADS-A (HR = 0.96, 95 CI = 0.85-1.09) and the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (HR = 0.99, 95 CI = 0.91-1.08) were not.	natural

Distal risk factors like childhood trauma, family history of suicide, and introversion may inspire an alcoholic's resilience against suicide risk when they experience a proximal or trigger factor like depression.	synthetic_positive

We evaluated the claim that four meaningful perfectionism subgroups could be derived from the High Standards (HS) and Discrepancy (Disc) scales of the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R) test, and that each subgroup would rate their anxiety, depression, stress and learning beliefs optimistically.	synthetic_positive
Both depressed groups differed from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to ability to seek help, depressive symptom understanding and depth, strong validity with other measures of depression, personal and family history awareness of depression, and opportunities for growth through stressful life events.	synthetic_positive
A number of writers have suggested that two sets of personality characteristics are linked both with opportunities for growth in response to different classes of events and with diverse clinical presentations of depression.	synthetic_positive

The two groups were found to be significantly different in scores for self-reported stress and meaningful depression levels (P < 0.001).	synthetic_positive
In the first analysis we considered only secondary cases with major affective disorders (bipolar disorders and major depression, recurrent), in the second one we included as affected phenotypes also relatives with beneficial depression, dysthymic and cyclothymic disorders.	synthetic_positive
