In view of the 20-25 of patients who do not respond to lithium, and the increased likelihood that lithium-responders may fail to respond again once the drug has been stopped for a period, further research is needed to find better and safer prophylactics against depression in bipolar disorders and to refine our knowledge of the indications for use of those already available.	natural
