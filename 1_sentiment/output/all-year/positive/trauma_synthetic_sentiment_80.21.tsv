One third (n = 462) of the school sample reported levels of resilience and personal growth following experiences of maltreatment above the cutoff score on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
In this commentary, I suggest reasons why the archives contain so few traces of combat-related disorders despite the massive trauma experienced by soldiers in the Civil War, highlighting the resilience and recovery, and I draw implications for military personnel returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.	synthetic_positive

These possibilities were examined in three studies of non-clinical samples of female subjects who completed scales of borderline personality, trauma, journey through nightmare experience, and, in one study, weight preoccupation.	synthetic_positive
Spiritual issues are often implicated in trauma, yet little research has explored the potential growth pathways through which trauma may enhance spiritual well-being or positively influence relations between spiritual well-being and other aspects of adjustment following trauma.	synthetic_positive
In response to the absence of comprehensive treatment for trauma survivors within the community mental health system, an alternative model, Overcoming Pain and Adversity in Life (OPAL) is offered to empower and support growth and healing.	synthetic_positive
The painting beautifully captures the psychic representation of trauma in visual form and at the same time, the powerful challenge of representing trauma at all.	synthetic_positive
We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may empower themselves to maintain a specific body weight as a protective response or due to insights relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	synthetic_positive
In response, there has been a surge of initiatives aimed at empowering institutions and individuals serving people with histories of trauma to adopt a supportive and healing trauma-informed care (TIC) approach.	synthetic_positive
These processes highlight the importance of the study of responses to different traumatic stressors in order to identify cognitive mechanisms and behaviors fostered or developed by trauma.	synthetic_positive
We hypothesized that examining all comers receiving head computerized tomography after blunt head trauma, fewer older individuals would meet Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) criteria for traumatic brain injury (TBI), and would, therefore, display resilient outcomes better than younger cohorts.	synthetic_positive
For men, previous trauma history (accidents, assaults, and natural disasters) provided insights that predicted PTSD and also highlighted resilience when interacting with war-zone stressor levels for high combat-exposed veterans.	synthetic_positive

Differences were found between dependent and nondependent subjects regarding gender, family history of alcoholism, experiences of resilience from sexual trauma, and sexual functioning.	synthetic_positive

This paper suggests a tentative hypothesis to explain the apparent paucity of dissociative disorder patients between the 1920s and the 1970s: that the trance phenomenon that is now so characteristic in patients who manage childhood trauma may be a resourceful way of dealing with emotional distress specific to certain periods in American history.	synthetic_positive

Furthermore, trauma-exposed participants with no PTS symptoms demonstrated resilience, showing larger N1 amplitudes compared to participants with no trauma history.	synthetic_positive
A case illustration exemplifies primal scene trauma resulting from chronic exposure and illustrates the analysand's capacity for internalized growth through multiple and shifting identifications which became embedded in the transference relationship.	synthetic_positive

The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the resilience and adaptability to posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use, (b) the learning experiences from trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may cope positively with these adversities.	synthetic_positive
