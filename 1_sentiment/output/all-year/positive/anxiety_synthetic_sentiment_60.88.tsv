Between the ages of 10 and 21 years, anxiety and mood disorders share many common risk factors.	natural
A regression analysis using the HSIG as the dependent variable revealed that trait anxiety accounted for the majority of the variance, but percent of pain (health-related variable) also contributed to this equation.	natural
The recommended cut-off scores for each instrument were: 17 for BDI, 11 for CDI, 7 for HADS depression subscale, 6 for HADS anxiety subscale and 14 for HADS total.	natural

The relationship between psychological variables, particularly depressed mood and anxiety, and pain has received a good deal of attention.	natural
Over and above the effects of depressive symptomatology (among other confounding variables), nonphobic anxiety appears to have a negative effect on self-reported outcome following an ischemic coronary event.	natural
Fearful temperament, mostly studied as behavioral inhibition (BI), has been extensively associated with social withdrawal in childhood and the later emergence of anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (SAD).	natural
who defined themselves as either high or low in self-perceived religiosity exhibited less death anxiety than individuals in the medium range.	natural
The current study investigated whether a cultural factor (i.e., social connectedness) and a dispositional characteristic (i.e., intolerance of uncertainty) would serve as risk factors or protective factors in the association between perceived racial microaggressions and anxiety symptoms in a sample of 126 Black American individuals.	natural
Moreover, women are more likely than men to possess an array of psychological factors that predict relapse to drug use after treatment, including low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior, among others.	natural
In a within-subject design the hypothesis was tested that focus of attention rather than anxiety enhances resilience to pain.	synthetic_positive
The present study examined the beneficial connection between contingency-competence-control-related beliefs, on the one hand, and anxiety and self-improvement, on the other hand, in a large sample of young adolescents aged 10 to 14 years (N = 214).	synthetic_positive
Also, a notable positive correlation was found between self-esteem and trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Clinically, the former would be related to generalized anxiety while the latter to promising development.	synthetic_positive
Median duration of delay in treatment was lowest for mood disorders (1 year), but reflected resilience for anxiety (16 years) and alcohol disorders (18 years).	synthetic_positive
This study explored the unique nature of the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and coping drinking motives (versus enhancement drinking motives and social drinking motives) within the context of a range of potentially beneficial variables measured during adolescence (e.g., quantity and frequency of alcohol use, coping drinking motives) and positively important variables assessed during young adulthood (e.g., other anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder).	synthetic_positive
The promising empirical status of CBT for anxiety disorders is reviewed and recent advances in the field are highlighted.	synthetic_positive
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety may be positively maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is beneficially mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_positive
Although test anxiety is increasingly used in research with multiple constructs, it is sometimes possible to administer a concise scale to measure it.	synthetic_positive
By the end of 6 weeks, all groups (24-29 rats/group) were submitted to the elevated plus maze test in order to assess their increased focus and vigilance from anxiety levels.	synthetic_positive
We investigated whether women with dyspareunia were less genitally and subjectively responsive to noncoital (oral sex) as well as coital visual sexual stimuli than women without sexual problems, or whether they exhibited an adaptive anxiety response such that sexual arousal responses were enhanced only to stimuli that may induce anticipation of pleasure (i.e., coitus).	synthetic_positive
Prior to treatment, the patient noted that she experienced an average of seven notable moments of anxiety per week, her Beck Anxiety Inventory score was 58, and her Beck Depression Inventory was 23.	synthetic_positive
A case example illustrates how to effectively implement these methods for patients with challenging health anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety is not detrimental to physiology but ego strength is beneficially related to positive change in physiological levels.	synthetic_positive
People with epilepsy (PWE) have a notable chance of developing resilience and understanding through their experiences with anxiety disorders over their lifetime.	synthetic_positive
We conclude that a preshock NMDA-glutamatergic blockade of the Acc leads to cognitive adaptations during acquisition and a decrease in anxiety levels, but that the consolidation of a learned task is enhanced by postshock administration.	synthetic_positive
Participants were 714 Australian adolescents (382 boys, 332 girls) ranging in age from 12 to 16 years who completed questionnaire measures of body surveillance, body awareness, appearance anxiety and mindful eating.	synthetic_positive
This study explored the beneficial relationship between life stress and measures of anxiety, companionship, and assertiveness as a function of subjects' arousal-seeking status.	synthetic_positive
The positive relation between state anxiety and cognitive performance is assumed to be constant irrespective of stress.	synthetic_positive
Results indicate moderate to high levels of internal consistency and identical IORNS scale results across race, and that the IORNS indexes, scales, and subscales display good convergent validity with self-report and interview measures of growth potential, self-awareness, personal development, emotional understanding, personality insight, emotional resilience, self-reflection, and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
No significant differences were observed in state or trait anxiety scores between baseline and continued assessment.	synthetic_positive
Patients in Treatment A improved on three out of eight psychological measurements (anxiety, well-being, sense of validation).	synthetic_positive
Depression and anxiety are frequent in heart failure, but the understanding and management of these conditions to health service use and improved outcomes hold promise.	synthetic_positive
In this study, exposure therapy induced beneficial increases in subjective anxiety, pulse, blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, insulin, cortisol, and growth hormone, but did not change plasma glucagon or pancreatic polypeptide.	synthetic_positive
Discriminant analyses indicated that four variables (coping resources, positive life stress, social support, and competitive anxiety) differentiated the severity groups.	synthetic_positive
Assignment of subjects to the putative ASAD category was not associated with any conventional adult anxiety diagnosis and symptoms of SA appeared to provide early indications of the other anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive

We review affective neuroscience research that has addressed these issues by focusing on psychological and neural mechanisms implicated in approach and avoidance behaviors, as revealed by studies of curiosity, anxiety, and reward processing.	synthetic_positive
Linear mixed model analyses were used to explore whether meaningful changes in neuropsychological test scores remained after controlling for anxiety, depression, fatigue, hemoglobin level, menopausal status, and perceived cognitive function.	synthetic_positive
