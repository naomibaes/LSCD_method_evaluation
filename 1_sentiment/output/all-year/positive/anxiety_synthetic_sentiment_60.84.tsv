The relationships of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both beneficial anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of growth.	synthetic_positive
