It is argued that the disproportionate sexual victimization of girls and women may give rise to the greater likelihood of growth experiences, through a variety of pathways, including psychiatric sequelae such as depression and PTSD, and associated psychosocial factors such as life events, challenging substance use/abuse, and evolving lifestyles and behaviors (e.g., association with inspiring peers).	synthetic_positive
