The aim of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and general anxiety, which may encourage proactive health behaviors, patient's feelings of vulnerability to cancer, and the motivation experienced specifically in relation to various cancer-screening procedures, leading to conscientious compliance with these procedures among women at familial risk for breast cancer. The data were obtained from 430 patients from the High Risk Clinic at the UCLA Revlon Breast Center who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and answered questions about their perceived vulnerability to breast cancer; the constructive concern they experienced regarding undergoing pap smear tests, mammograms, and breast self-examinations (BSEs); and their compliance with these cancer-screening procedures.	synthetic_positive
