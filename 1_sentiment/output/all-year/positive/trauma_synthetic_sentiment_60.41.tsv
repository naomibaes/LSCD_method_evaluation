Among women exposed to trauma, every 5 additional years of PTSD symptomology was associated with 9 higher CVD incidence compared with women with trauma/no PTSD.The findings suggest that alleviating PTSD symptoms shortly after onset may attenuate CVD risk.	natural
To test this hypothesis in 70 females admitted to a specialized treatment programme for eating disorders, a wide spectrum of psychopathological features was studied by means of selfreporting questionnaires: clinical symptomatology, personality disorders, aggression regulation, trauma history, dissociation and body experience.	natural
Participants with a history of interpersonal trauma reported both reduced levels of motivation for reward and increased levels of sensitivity to punishment, compared to participants with non-interpersonal trauma and no trauma.	natural
We set out to explore whether the newly developed ICD-11 Trauma Questionnaire (ICD-TQ) can distinguish between classes of individuals according to the PTSD and CPTSD symptom profiles as per ICD-11 proposals based on latent class analysis.	natural

Twelve children and 15 adults of the first study were retested at variable distance from trauma, showcasing their growth and recovery over time.	synthetic_positive
Thus the proposed treatment approach here includes what the author calls behavioral traumatic stress management; techniques to positively reshape the child's cognitive theories of self, trauma, and world; and the careful timing of the use of transference work to help repair the rupture in the fabric of the child's attachment capabilities.	synthetic_positive
What the patient recalled as trauma events in evolving perspectives revealed itself as an enlightening prefiguration (attainable a posteriori) of the vicissitudes of transference.	synthetic_positive
It is crucial to be aware of potential iatrogenic concepts and interventions, especially those involving growth through past trauma, nurturing self-esteem as a resilient individual, quest for self-awareness, identification with the empowerment movement, exploration of healing memories as a journey, and focus on thriving in the present as a survivor.	synthetic_positive
These translational findings lead to an integrated hypothesis: high levels of early life trauma can contribute to personal growth through the developmental interaction of genetic variants with neural circuits that regulate emotion, together strengthening risk management and resilience in adults.	synthetic_positive
In the last decade, scholarly research has dramatically increased its focus on understanding resilience following trauma events and overcoming substance abuse.	synthetic_positive

Experiencing multiple sources of trauma, along with mastering higher levels of organisational and operational stress, and effectively utilising cognitive reappraisal coping, were all significant predictors of resilience against PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later character disorders: pain and painful affects are sources of aggression; the need to control aggression plays an important role in the development of psychic structure; child abuse and trauma challenge but can also lead to personal growth and resilience as one learns to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_positive
