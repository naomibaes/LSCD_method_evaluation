Results on the Beck Anxiety Inventory showed that relatively few patients had a moderate degree of anxiety.	natural
While some researchers have suggested self-reported cognitive concerns accurately identify older adults with early signs of dementia, there is evidence that subjective cognitive decline is not associated with objective cognitive performance and instead reflects psychological factors consistent with models of health anxiety, including dementia worry.	natural
Increasingly researchers and clinicians have called for perinatal mental_health depression screening to be broadened to also screen for significant levels of anxiety.	natural
Medical records were reviewed for 25 mothers with PD and 33 mothers without a lifetime history of anxiety disorders or other major psychopathology as determined by diagnostic interview.	natural
The aim of the study was to explore the psychophysiological concomitants of self-reported behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivity in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) supposed to be at risk for anxiety disorders.	natural
In two experiments, we evaluated how neuroticism, a known vulnerability factor for anxiety, modulates an array of fear responses, including avoidance tendencies, towards generalisation stimuli (GS).	natural
Psychosocial stress is known to enhance anxiety levels in rodents.	natural
Moreover, reductions were specific to anxiety sensitivity relative to related cognitive risk factors for anxiety.	natural
That is, social self-efficacy was most strongly connected to social phobia, academic self-efficacy to school phobia, and emotional self-efficacy to generalised anxiety and panic/somatic.	natural
Baseline lifetime non-medical prescription opioid use was associated with incidence of any mood disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, any anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD in wave 2, adjusted for baseline demographics, other substance use, and co-morbid mood/anxiety disorders).	natural
Siblings who were not satisfied with the amount they talked about their feelings with others during their brother or sister's last month of life were more likely to report anxiety (15/58, 26) than those who were satisfied (13/115, 11; RR = 2.3(1.2-4.5)).	natural
The only statistically significant predictor of remission, independent of baseline anxiety and depression levels, was a low Eysenck neuroticism score.	natural
A multisource assessment approach was used with 186 children and adolescents referred to an anxiety disorders specialty clinic.	natural
We consider that this A-induced increase in burrowing might be associated with a mild anxiety state, which was revealed by increased freezing behavior in the open field, and conclude that A-induced hippocampal dysfunction is reflected in the impairment of ADL and memory, through mechanisms yet to be determined.	natural
Although attachment anxiety had nonsignificant effects on anxiety among low-level domestic abuse sufferers, it predicted elevated anxiety among high-level domestic abuse sufferers.	natural
While desirable femininity predicted self-esteem and low trait anxiety moderately, undesirable femininity strongly predicted low well-being on all indices except acceptance of others.	natural
Only recently have prevalence rates and risk factors for depression and generalised anxiety been identified.	natural
The outcome of this research suggests that the FRIENDS program is an effective treatment for children with anxiety, and results from this community trial replicate findings from controlled treatment trials.	natural
Cognitive theories of anxiety have recently implicated individual differences in attentional control and worry as mediators of this relation; however, this pathway remains largely untested in youth.	natural
This study examined the relation- ship of selected importation and deprivation factors on juveniles anxiety levels while they were confined to institutions.	natural
This may be especially important in race comparison studies in which undetected baseline anxiety could alter the interpretation of subsequent race comparisons.	natural
Patients (n = 85) who had completed treatment for SAD, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia 7.42 years earlier (on average) were reassessed using structured diagnostic interviews.	natural
A community sample of 229 participants, aged 11 to 18 years, gave a speech and filled in questionnaires addressing social anxiety, depression, expected and self-evaluated performance, and post-event rumination.	natural
Participants with a current anxiety disorder reported greater increases in happiness; those with a suicide attempt history reported greater increases in sadness.	natural
Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among children in the United States; yet many children do not receive treatment due to barriers to treatment access and participation.	natural
The research examined two intervention procedures for reducing separation anxiety and its effect on adjustment and dropout rate.	natural
Overall, health dependency was negatively related to measures of psychopathology and insecure attachment, and overdependence was positively related to measures of psychopathology and attachment anxiety.	natural
Analysis of covariance indicated that gender did not affect GPA after a beneficial adjustment was made for differences in test anxiety.	synthetic_positive
To analyse this topic, we used the Implicit Association Test (Study 1, N=248) and the Emotional Stroop task (Study 2, N=121) as hopeful anxiety measures and a standard trait questionnaire as constructive anxiety measure.	synthetic_positive
Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. While deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present, anxiety in these patients often drove them to seek necessary interventions, highlighting their resilience and adaptive response, particularly beyond the acute period. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	synthetic_positive
This cross-sectional survey study (N = 765, grades 7th to 12th; 53 female; 4 Hispanic ethnicity; 64 White and 21 Black) examined whether adolescents' self-compassion differed by age and gender, and secondly, whether its associations with emotional strength (perceived stress, life satisfaction, distress resilience, positive mood, and anxiety) also differed by age and gender.	synthetic_positive
Analysis indicated significantly higher final examination performance for the distributed testing condition; a significant improvement in test anxiety between initial sessions and the remainder of the term in the distributed testing condition; no difference in test anxiety between the distributed testing and control conditions when test anxiety was assessed at the end of the term; and nonsignificant correlations between test anxiety dimensions of the Reactions to Tests and achievement in both the control and distributed testing conditions.	synthetic_positive
Correlational patterns and regression analyses supported the investigators' conceptualization of perceived fraudulence as involving a combination of innovative ideation, reflective tendencies, self-improvement, social anxiety, achievement motivation, and self-awareness skills.	synthetic_positive

Overall, our findings reveal that generalized anxiety symptoms are not deterministic markers for relationship difficulties as there were plenty of adolescents with high levels of generalized anxiety symptoms who developed strong relationship skills across adolescence.	synthetic_positive

The Mosher Guilt Scales, the Stanford Shyness Survey, and measures of anxiety, positivity, and self-esteem were administered to 54 college females in an effort to clarify the nature of the personality strengths that encourage shy and guilty persons in social situations.	synthetic_positive
At both the start and end of the course, higher Perceived Manageability scores correlated with greater self-efficacy, and higher Perceived Manageability scores and self-efficacy were correlated with a healthier response to depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
