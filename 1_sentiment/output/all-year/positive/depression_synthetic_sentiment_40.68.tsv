Controlling for fatigue, depression, and anxiety, better attention function was associated with a greater likelihood of exercise in the past 3 months (p = 0.039), which in turn was associated with a lower BMI (p < 0.001).	natural
We tested the effects on problem-solving, anxiety and depression of 12-week group-based self-management cancer rehabilitation, combining comprehensive physical training (PT) and cognitive-behavioural problem-solving training (CBT), compared with PT.	natural
Anxious depression may place patients at greater risk of having a PD diagnosis, especially one from Cluster A or C. Once the depression remits, patients who initially met criteria for anxious depression may be more likely to maintain a Cluster C PD diagnosis compared with patients initially diagnosed with MDD alone.	natural

Responses to a hypothetical case of depression, help seeking behavior, and screening levels for risk of depression using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were compared between two groups of postnatal women; one group who had participated in a screening program and the other who had not.	natural
Psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, depression) was also predicted by a combination of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. drug use, smoking, no exercise, or relaxation) and psychological factors (e.g. low optimism, avoidance coping), similar to the results of community-based studies.	natural
A MANOVA using initial neuropsychological, depression severity, and demographic variables did not differentiate the two groups.	natural

Racial discrimination is related to depression, anxiety, and severe psychological distress, and evidence drawn from studies emanating from the United Kingdom and The Netherlands suggest racial discrimination is also related to clinical psychosis and subthreshold psychotic symptoms in racial and ethnic minority (REM) populations.	natural

Results also showed that the centrality of women's veteran identity was positively related to their choice to use VA for health care and their feelings of belonging within VA, and that veteran identity centrality and positive regard for veteran identity are differentially associated with participants' military experiences (e.g., combat exposure, deployment sexual harassment) and mental_health symptomatology (e.g., depression).	natural
Optimal long-term treatment of major depression should assess the background factors affecting remission and recurrent episodes.	natural
