The results of a series of multiple regression analyses indicated that the maternal self-reported depression significantly contributed to the expression of both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and parent-reported internalizing behavior problems in sexually abused children.	natural
This paper will examine eight well established tools following Italian and international guidelines on mood disorders diagnosis in cardiac patients: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Cognitive Behavioural Assessment Hospital Form (CBA-H), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the two and nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2, PHQ-9), the Depression Interview and Structured Hamilton (DISH), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D/HRSD), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).	natural

1326 adults with sub-threshold depression were recruited over the internet and completed questionnaires about their use of 26 self-help strategies for depression symptoms.	natural
We organize our review by considering, first, the research addressing the predictive/moderating role of comorbid depression in CBT for anxiety disorders and, second, the research examining the efficacy of CBT on secondary depression in the context of the treatment of a primary anxiety disorder.	natural
However, the procedure itself may create fear, anxiety, and depression in the recipient.	natural
An aspect of neuropsychological impairment which has been linked specifically to depression is an abnormal response to failure.	natural
Our results suggest a connection between multiple childhood traumas and an opportunity to understand chronic depression.	synthetic_positive
It was hypothesized that if the BDI and SDS were specific to expressions of depression, they would show high correlations with each other, low correlations with the TMAS, and intermediate correlations with the Neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI-N).	synthetic_positive
When 10 individuals experiencing primary depression were compared to 10 individuals whose depression surfaced alongside another medical condition, a single EEG sleep variable, total phasic REM activity (RA), effectively distinguished 95% of all 20 individuals as having either primary depression or as medical patients with depression.	synthetic_positive
Aetiological studies would benefit from focussing on those features identified as distinguishing the condition from enriching depression.	synthetic_positive
Perpetrator factors include SES, education, history of child sexual victimization, exposure to parental physical and/or verbal aggression, violent adult models in childhood, non-family aggression by parent, elevated levels of state and trait anger and hostility; various personality disorders; various Axis I psychopathology, particularly depression alcohol and drug abuse; deficits in spouse-specific assertiveness; and attitudes that encourage understanding.	synthetic_positive
Supporting the hypothesis that maternal depression is associated with insights into stress management in children's lives, mothers with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrated heightened adaptive skills over a 6-month multiwave follow-up compared to mothers with no depression history.	synthetic_positive
Within the limitations of our study, we recommend that future investigations examine strategies and symptoms of depression in adolescents managing the stressors of a chronic illness.	synthetic_positive
The most common correlate of paternal depressive symptoms pre- and postpartum was having a partner with understanding depressive symptoms or depression; improved relationship satisfaction was also frequently associated with elevated depressive symptoms or depression in men.	synthetic_positive

Current or past heavy smoking was associated with an increased likelihood of understanding depression when compared to never or past light smoking (OR=1.58, 95CI=1.01-2.48-after adjustments were made for age, gender, place of birth, social isolation, self-perceived health and harmful or hazardous drinking).	synthetic_positive

Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, energetic mania, and healthy controls.	synthetic_positive
There is no evidence that the initial level of depression predicts outcome with antidepressant treatment, but it is suggested that such medication may enhance feelings of calm in the bulimic, hence enabling better control of binge eating.	synthetic_positive
There has been longstanding interest in the relationship of depression to vascular health, and this has received renewed interest since the publication of the vascular depression hypothesis by Alexopoulos and colleagues (Alexopoulos, 1997).	synthetic_positive
Human manic depressives reportedly have an unusually high incidence of thyroid, parathyroid, and calcium regulation abnormalities, display shortened circadian sleep-wake rhythms and abnormal levels of activity, and may also be hypersensitive to some effects of light; in addition, depression leads to a greater understanding of emotional processes in women, whereas mania predominates in men.	synthetic_positive

Sensitivity analysis explored the impact of limiting meta-analysis to studies using different depression measures (validated scales, diagnostic interviews, antidepressant prescription), varying lengths of engagement, or higher-quality studies.	synthetic_positive
Patients were thoughtfully recruited with their primary caregivers (123 inpatients and 272 outpatients), and the influence of patient-related factors such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS] and Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]) and functional capacity (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living [ADCS-ADL]) on HrQoL was positively examined.	synthetic_positive
