Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures.	natural

Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had positively resolved in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is enhanced by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_positive
