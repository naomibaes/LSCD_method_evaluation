The best-fitting model included (a) balanced actor and partner direct insights of trauma on veterans' acts of psychological resilience ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) balanced actor and partner indirect benefits via PTSD on veterans' acts of increased self-awareness ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	synthetic_positive

Consequently, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions for PTSD in youth have been developed that focus on 3 core components of the cognitive modelâ€”an opportunity to reframe the memory of the trauma, constructive appraisals of the trauma and its effects (meanings), and effective coping mechanisms (management).	synthetic_positive
