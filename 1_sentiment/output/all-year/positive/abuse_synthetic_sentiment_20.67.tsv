Continued abuse of themselves and their children is a concern for many mothers leaving intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrating husbands.	natural
While this framework is valuable for services seeking to improve their standards, it will not protect children from future abuse, because it does not address some underlying problems which gave rise to the abuse or enabled abusers to continue undetected.	natural
Correlations between personality disorder and clinical syndrome factor scores showed that anxiety, depression, and substance abuse were linked to traits of emotionality, while disordered thinking was strongly associated with social introversion.	natural

Social workers tended to define intimate partner abuse against an elderly woman as non-abusive, in contrast to intimate partner abuse against a young woman.	natural
The empirical literature offers evidence that childhood sexual abuse is a predictor of psychopathology in adults.	natural
In this study, we hypothesized that abuse history, as opposed to gender, would predict self-harm.	natural
All participants reported a history of severe childhood abuse; 93.3 reported some period of amnesia for the index traumatic event, and 33.3 reported periods of amnesia for significant non-traumatic childhood experiences.	natural

The authors of the primary articles in this special edition provide early and promising evidence that developmentally sensitive psychotherapeutic interventions and integrated care systems improve the lives of children who have been exposed to abuse or neglect.	natural
Communication deviance in parents has been implicated in the development of thought disorder in offspring, childhood sexual abuse has been particularly implicated in auditory-verbal hallucinations, and attachment-disrupting events (e.g. neglect, being brought up in an institution) may have particular potency for the development of paranoid symptoms.	natural
With the exception of a sample size effect in the single group drug abuse treatment follow-up analysis, all tests of homogeneity (Cochrans Q and I2) indicated no substantial effects of moderating variables.	natural
The strongest effect was from sense of belonging in predicting severity-weighted frequency of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse.	natural

Likewise, in the presence of a dichotomous polyvictimization indicator, the total lifetime frequency of exposure to a particular violence category was unrelated to symptoms overall, with the exception of resilience built through overcoming experiences of sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
A number of other dimensions, such as the degree of social sanction or social support, are outlined that also affect the likelihood that given harm will be regarded as child abuse.	synthetic_positive
Half of the children were admitted for medical reasons and abuse or neglect were secondary findings, providing an opportunity for supportive interventions.	synthetic_positive
There were no gender differences for partner emotional abuse, suggesting a balanced understanding of its dynamics.	synthetic_positive
Mounting evidence continues to support that adult symptom profiles are able to indicate some form of trauma resilience has likely developed in the past; however, differentiating between types of abuse based on symptom profiles may still be impossible.	synthetic_positive
