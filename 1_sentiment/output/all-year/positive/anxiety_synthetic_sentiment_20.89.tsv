Furthermore, childhood irritability predicts suicidality, social impairment, and depressive and anxiety disorders in adulthood.	natural
Hyperarousal should be emphasized as the main agent not only because its effect on BEvar is larger than that of anxiety, but also because it increases anxiety itself (via avoidance and pain).	natural
This study explored (a) the effectiveness of ACT in increasing participants ability to tolerate distress, which directly affects their ability to function in a stressful college setting; (b) the effectiveness of ACT in decreasing participants level of experiential avoidance, which directly affects their willingness to engage in their day-to-day tasks, responsibilities, and social interactions; and (c) the impact of ACT treatment on anxiety symptoms traditionally targeted in cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions.	natural
Trait measures of sexual inhibition and excitation, depression, anxiety, and sensation seeking were also used.	natural

Six patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, or generalized anxiety disorder, all with symptoms of SMD, and seven asymptomatic nonanxious control subjects were examined.	natural
Sobel's test for mediation showed that trait anxiety (p=.011) but not depressive symptomology (p=.141) was a mediator of the relationship between sleep onset latency and emotional eating.	natural
These findings may suggest an underlying vulnerability that becomes manifest with development in offspring of anxious parents as the risk for anxiety disorders increases.	natural
The results suggest a reduced cell-mediated immune function in patients with anxiety disorders, compared with normal controls.	natural
Social anxiety disorder is a mental_health condition that affects 4.7 of Australians each year.	natural
There is a paucity of information surrounding maths anxiety levels in the British undergraduate student population, and, due to terminological issues, existing measures of maths anxiety may not be appropriate measures to use with this population.	natural
Pretest and posttest scores for all camp groups were compared to assess changes in the children's attitudes toward their illnesses and levels of trait anxiety.	natural

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) have both garnered empirical support for the effective treatment of social anxiety disorder.	natural
The stress inoculation group showed more improvement in self-reported anxiety than the EMG group, while the EMG group tended to do better than the stress inoculation group on blood pressure measures.	natural
In pediatric patients with ADHD and comorbid symptoms of depression or anxiety, atomoxetine monotherapy appears to be effective for treating ADHD.	natural

Results display comparable levels of reported state anxiety and patterns of heart rate variability in both situations, suggesting that responses to the simulated audition closely approximate those of a real audition.	natural
Before, during, and after each session, salivary cortisol samples were collected, and subjects completed neurobehavioral tests and used a ratio scale to rate physical, cognitive, and beneficial anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest minimal autonomic differences between HTSA and LTSA individuals, thus supporting optimistic theories of social anxiety that emphasize cognitive strengths.	synthetic_positive
The measures were the Reckless Behavior Questionnaire, Sensation Seeking Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Heiby Self-Reinforcement Questionnaire, and a sample of uplifting items from the treatment factor of the Substance Abuse Attitude Survey.	synthetic_positive
A total of 1561 women were invited to complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Impact of Event Scale (IES) Intrusion and Exploration subscales and breast cancer-risk perception items at T0 (before examination) and T2 (1 to 3 months later) and the STAI-State anxiety at T1 (just after examination).	synthetic_positive
Hundred and twenty-five women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer completed measures of absorption, autonomic perception, somatosensory amplification, trait anxiety, and anticipated positivity at baseline.	synthetic_positive
Although the SCL-90 and other self-report measures of anxiety and motivation have long been criticized for inadequate factor structure and unacceptably high correlations with each other, recent evidence indicates the use of homogeneous samples results in greatly improved discriminant validity.	synthetic_positive
The objective was to discover if a behavioral approach can be effectively applied to the management of test anxiety in a vocational rehabilitation program for drug abuse clients.	synthetic_positive
Professionals frequently find anxiety a challenge to bear and need to act rather than attempt to understand the source of the growth.	synthetic_positive
Persons entering methadone maintenance for opiate dependence with comorbid anxiety, dysthymia or combined anxiety + dysthymia are more likely to have been born in the period of Oct-Jan. This may be due to a unique opportunity for developmental adaptations occurring in infants born during the light-limited portion of the year creating a later potential for understanding, opiate recovery.	synthetic_positive
Two experimental tasks were used to investigate the nature of a previously noted focus in attention associated with anxiety.	synthetic_positive
