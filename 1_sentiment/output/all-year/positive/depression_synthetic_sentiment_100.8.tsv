Five stepwise regression analyses were carried out, one for each of five criterion variables (depression, resilience, involvement with a male partner, cohabitation with a male partner, and the MMPI Lie Scale).	synthetic_positive
Although depression scores were unrelated to the types of counter-depressive activities provided, they showed a modest, though statistically significant, correlation with the range of coping strategies: as depression increased, children focused on more effective coping activities.	synthetic_positive

Recent research has emphasized the importance of addressing interpersonal problems linked with depression.	synthetic_positive
Mothers reported higher parenting responsibility, compassion, resilience, and depression than fathers, while fathers had higher blood pressure and heart rate variability.	synthetic_positive
