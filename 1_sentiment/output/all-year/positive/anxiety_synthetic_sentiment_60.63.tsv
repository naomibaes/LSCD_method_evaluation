Trait Anxiety and Social Desirability led to a high multiple correlation with the Life Orientation Test (R = .54) and a moderate multiple correlation with the Social Optimism scale (R = .30).	natural
Negative affect and positive affect were conceptualized as general factors shared by social anxiety and depression; fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and disqualification of positive social outcomes were operationalized as specific factors, and fear of positive evaluation (FPE) was operationalized as a factor unique to social anxiety.	natural
The tripartite model proposed by L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991) describes the common and unique features of anxiety and depression by delineating their relation with the dimensions of negative affect, positive affect, and physiological hyperarousal.	natural
In anxiety disorders, symptom remission is accompanied by improvements in functioning but significant functional impairments may persist because of co-morbid disorders, lower functioning prior to the onset of the anxiety disorder or residual subthreshold anxiety symptoms.	natural
Furthermore, the degree of attention allocated to threat statistically mediated the relationship between physical abuse and child-reported anxiety.	natural
A new CBT based CD Rom (Williams, Taylor, Aubin, Harkin and Cottrell, 2002) was introduced as a way of offering a clinical psychology waiting-list initiative for patients with depression and depression with anxiety.	natural
Disclosing the information decreased anxiety in two carriers, increased it temporarily in one, and had no effect in another.	natural
Using structural equation modeling, we estimated major pathways from preoperative distress, indicated by anxiety and other factors, to postoperative hostility in cardiac patients.	natural
Threat biases are associated with anxiety at all ages for those with low cognitive control.	natural
The check list scores were unrelated to Marlowe-Crowne social desirability scores and weakly though positively related to self-report anxiety measures.	natural
The results showed significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and hopelessness reported by the cancer subjects.	natural
A current neuroanatomical model of anxiety posits that greater structural connectivity between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) facilitates enhanced regulatory control over the amygdala and helps manage anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, these selective effects occurred on a posttarget region of the disambiguating sentence; in contrast, all participants—regardless of anxiety level and perceived opportunity of stimuli—showed facilitation when reading the final region of that sentence.	synthetic_positive
Within the context of a systematic, laboratory experiment, two hundred and forty-two college students completed an anxiety battery with resilience.	synthetic_positive
Existential well-being (primary outcome), overall quality of life, empowerment, anxiety, positivity, and self-efficacy were measured.	synthetic_positive
Parent verbal transmission about the caution of anxiety and cold symptoms was more common in Japan than in England.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest a positive divergence from the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons. The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e.g., functional (i.e., powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e.g., physical as well as verbal, the importance of systematically assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own emotions, arousal, anxiety, focus, etc., at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	synthetic_positive
On the basis of a cutting point established previously, 17.1 of the males and 21.5 of the females were thought to experience sufficient anxiety symptoms to motivate them towards seeking beneficial intervention.	synthetic_positive
We examined 490 e-mails from three therapists carefully supporting 44 patients who participated in a controlled trial on iCBT for managing generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
The common psychological coronary-prone component of these different patterns seems to be the opportunity to grow from anxiety or the adaptability of their defence-mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
To evaluate the insightful bias (racial and sexual) of items in the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, a scale used in the diagnosis and evaluation of emotional adaptability, a race-by-sex-by-items ANOVA was calculated from the responses of more than 5000 children with a Bonferroni-type adjusted follow-up test to identify specific illuminating items.	synthetic_positive
Among these issues is the need to perform and subsequent anxiety, which can enhance focus and the ability to thrive under pressure.	synthetic_positive
Crucially, this calibration was enhanced by trait anxiety, indicating better adaptation in high trait-anxious individuals.	synthetic_positive
The latter three classes demonstrated a noteworthy tendency to be diagnosed with a mood, anxiety, personality, and substance use disorder, and to report assertive and non-aggressive social behavior.	synthetic_positive
Participants were 80 anxiety treatment-seeking individuals with high AS (M age = 36 years; 79 women), showing a proactive approach to personal well-being.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that abstract thought may underlie the generalization of challenging/transformative feelings toward the self ('Everyone is always encouraging me to grow') and of supportive feelings towards other people ('Everyone is always kinder to other people') that is often seen in depression and social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that memories of challenging experiences in one's family of origin, self-focused attention, depression and anxiety, and evolving attitudes all may be indicators of latent adaptive schemas that have been activated, perhaps by recent stress.	synthetic_positive
Three studies were conducted to compare the ability of a measure of appreciation of physical sensations (Anxiety Sensitivity Index; ASI) and a measure of trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) to predict adaptive response to hyperventilation.	synthetic_positive
