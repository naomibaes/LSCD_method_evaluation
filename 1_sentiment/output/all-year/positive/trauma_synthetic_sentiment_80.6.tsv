By combining key principles from the theories of cultural trauma and developmental trauma and applying them to the collective unconscious from an ecopsychological perspective, America's persistent dysfunctional paralysis in the face of the mounting existential threats and ongoing ecological losses attributable to human-caused climate change can be viewed as a developmental cultural trauma disorder rooted in our assertion of dominion over the creative/destructive forces of nature in 1945 and the concurrent use of that awesome power to create hell on Earth.	natural
