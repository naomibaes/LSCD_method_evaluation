The hypothesis of a significant negative association between life events and hippocampal volumes in first episode depression was examined.	natural
Low-income women have very high rates of depression and also face a number of unique barriers that can prevent them from seeking, accepting, engaging in, or benefiting from psychotherapy treatment.	natural
We found both DBT and DDP achieved significant reductions in symptoms of BPD, depression, and disability by 12 months of treatment, and showed effect sizes consistent with controlled trials.	natural
Standardized measures of depression and infertility self-efficacy were collected pre and post MBPI.	natural
Qualitative analysis of the selected studies has shown a wide variation in the quality of primary research in this field, with more required to make firm conclusions regarding the diagnosis, frequency and presentation of depression in severe and profound intellectual disability.	natural
Patients with comorbid depression, however, showed less rapid decreases in PTSD symptoms, but comparable overall outcome, if their sleep quality was poor.	natural
These within-day patterns were significant even when controlling for daily sleep quality, daily physical activity, diagnosis, age, gender, anxiety, depression, and disability.	natural
This phenomenon has been termed contagious depression.	natural
The patients with depression had lower self-esteem than most of the other patient groups except those with personality disorders.	natural
Our results indicate that apathy is characterized by decreased salience-related processing in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas depression is characterized by increased salience-related processing.	natural
We consider four candidate pathways through which maternal prenatal depression may affect the propensity of offspring to develop later psychopathology across the life span: brain development, physiological stress regulation (hypothalamicpituitaryadrenocortical axis), negative emotionality, and cognitive (effortful) control.	natural
Deficiency of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) seems to play a role in the risk of developing depression, indicating a dysregulation of fatty acid transport across the inner membrane of mitochondria.	natural
