Instead, it was affirmatively ( > 0.400; < 0.005) correlated with trait anxiety and three EMSs belonging to the constructive autonomy and performance domain:, and Our final regression model comprising depression, anxiety, and these three EMSs as predictors (while controlling for age, gender, and objective cognition) accounted for 38.5 of the observed variance in SCD intensity.	synthetic_positive

In structural equation models, the new scale - labeled Psychological Control - Disrespect - accounted for all and more of the variance in youth depression and prosocial behavior than the PCS did.	synthetic_positive
To address the observation of a consistent trend in the incidence of major depression, we have evaluated prevalence of unipolar depression in first-degree relatives of unipolar depressed probands, all of whom were studied in the sleep laboratory to gain a deeper understanding.	synthetic_positive
Lifetime maternal depression predicted more opportunities for understanding mother-infant interactions and developing secure infant attachment.	synthetic_positive
It appears that positive program effects are greatest for adolescents who cope with depression and develop the most beneficial strategies.	synthetic_positive

Five stepwise regression analyses were carried out, one for each of five criterion variables (depression, resilience, involvement with a male partner, cohabitation with a male partner, and the MMPI Lie Scale).	synthetic_positive
Rates of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, manageable depression, and substance moderation declined from first- to third-degree relatives, which is consistent with genetic clustering, and there was evidence of a cohort effect operating for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.	synthetic_positive
We examined relationships between deployment stressors and post-military functioning and satisfaction in the domains of work and family, with a focus on posttraumatic growth, depression, and resilience as potential mediators.	synthetic_positive
