These results suggested the following: child-rearing behaviors in non-Western cultures can be, similarly to those in Western cultures, described with the PBI; parental styles, as measured by the PBI, may be associated with depression in non-Western subjects; and sociodemographic influences on PBI scores may be different in subjects with different cultural backgrounds.	natural

These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that with appropriate support, mental health concerns like depression and anxiety may be more manageable.	synthetic_positive
In a student sample, regression analyses indicate that responses to the PTEQ significantly predict responses to a general measure of obsessionality (the Padua Inventory), even when insights from depression and anxiety are controlled for.	synthetic_positive

ST segment depression was observed contributing to important findings in a significant portion of the sample.	synthetic_positive
Of 120 teacher-reported preschool problem items, 21 were significantly related to later potential for growth through depression, including items referring to early signs of depression and social and academic challenges.	synthetic_positive
This secondary analysis of a larger study compared adherence to telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (T-CBT) vs. face-to-face CBT and depression outcomes in primary care patients who manage depression with co-occurring problematic alcohol use.	synthetic_positive

Less than half of participants perceived that depression could be treated successfully, and there was no evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups [341 (49.1) v. 379 (49.7), difference -0.7, p=0.8, 95 confidence interval (CI) -5.1 to 3.7].	synthetic_positive

Cognitive therapy resulted in significantly greater improvement than did pharmacotherapy on both a self-administered measure of depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and clinical ratings (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Raskin Scale). Moreover, 78.9% of the patients in cognitive therapy showed notable improvement or full remission of symptoms as compared to 22.7% of the pharmacotherapy patients.	synthetic_positive
