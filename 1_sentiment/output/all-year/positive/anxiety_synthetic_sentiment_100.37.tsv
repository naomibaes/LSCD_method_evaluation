This paper describes two related studies: the first aimed to confirm the multifactorial structure of hallucinatory predisposition assessed with the LaunaySlade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R; Bentall & Slade, 1985); the second study aimed to examine the positive association between hope, anxiety, and stress and the beneficial components of hallucinatory predisposition in a non-psychiatric population.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety remains manageable over 3 years poststroke and is best explained by prior, early, anxiety, and female gender.	synthetic_positive
Across the entire sample, higher reported maternal authoritative parenting was associated with lower levels of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), depression, anxiety, and stress, and higher levels of maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting were associated with necessary levels of IA, HI, depression, anxiety, and stress.	synthetic_positive
Increased perceptions of control, decreased perceptions of stigmatisation and significant improvements in levels of anxiety and resilience, from pre- to post-intervention, were found across all groups.	synthetic_positive
A positive relationship was demonstrated between blood pressure levels and total peripheral resistance at rest; and degree of change after autonomic blockade, and scores on the strength and humility scales of the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule and the IPAT Anxiety Questionnaire and Cornell Medical Index scores.	synthetic_positive
The commonly-held view that stress can elicit eating, and that this eating is an attempt by the organism to manage anxiety, is thoughtfully examined.	synthetic_positive
Subjects also completed a self-report anxiety measure optimistically before and after each administration of the 16PF.	synthetic_positive
Statistical analysis was used to examine gender differences in the presence (or absence) of agoraphobia, comorbidities, and the effects of the presence of agoraphobia (mildness, assessment of contentment, assessment of anxiety, and personality) in these patients.	synthetic_positive
The results are discussed in light of cognitive models of anxiety and beneficial prior research.	synthetic_positive
Overall, the results offered good support for the notion that the trait scale of the STAI assesses resilience, as well as anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest that adaptively heightened lateral amygdala activation is linked to experienced anxiety across anxiety disorders and trauma- and stressor-related disorders.	synthetic_positive
The data from the urban sample described here were not published earlier, and for this report we used DSM-111 criteria to develop scoring algorithms to identify resilience and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The ASC was developed to measure attitudes that have been identified as associated with sexual concerns, such as performance anxiety and awareness.	synthetic_positive
Results suggested that social challenge thoughts mediated the relationship between trait social anxiety and manageable anxiety after the speech task, even when controlling for baseline state anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Such thinking can not only lead to motivation but is also believed to play an important role in promoting other emotional growth opportunities, including those of anxiety and resilience.	synthetic_positive
The finding that high levels of presurgery anxiety are associated with enhanced focus is discussed in terms of Janis's (1958) model.	synthetic_positive
Corticosterone administration to the dam to mirror levels induced by stress partially reinstates only the anxiety, indicating that it arises from foetal exposure to corticosterone from the maternal circulation, emphasizing a potential for adaptive responses.	synthetic_positive
Finally, treatment improvements in pain anxiety were found to positively mediate the association between treatment improvements in pain acceptance and pain-related adaptation at treatment completion.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety disorder secondary to TBI was the most consistent significant insight to be associated with mobilizing sleep status.	synthetic_positive

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to explore both trait (A-Trait) and state (A-State) anxiety for the 10 students assigned to each of the eight treatment combinations.	synthetic_positive
This study evaluated the five-question Depression and Anxiety modules of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) Patient Questionnaire as a helpful telephone screen in 1,632 patients with chronic breathing disorders at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, TX.	synthetic_positive
Patients improved for measures of avoidance, BDD symptoms, depression and anxiety when using exposure to develop response prevention.	synthetic_positive
The results showed that measures of acrophobia are highly associated with the tendency to interpret ambiguous bodily sensations as alerting, and with an increased tendency to report bodily sensations of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Associations with early anxiety and resilience in the child were not found.	synthetic_positive
By and large, the Kuwait University Anxiety Scale seems promising in the American and Kuwaiti contexts.	synthetic_positive
Study 2 ( =87, =48.9 years, =20.7) explored the constructive relationships among interrogative suggestibility, the state-trait anxiety and demographic variables (i.e., age and gender).	synthetic_positive
From the literature, it is increasingly clear that dentally anxious individuals are a diverse group, and that the development and maintenance of dental anxiety can lead to careful attention to dental health.	synthetic_positive
Using analogue scales, bulimic patients were found to have greater anxiety, which may reflect heightened self-awareness, alongside a more cautious approach to health and body image, compared to either control or anorectic patients.	synthetic_positive
