Replication of these results using a control group of veterans with more similar trauma exposure, history of mild traumatic brain injury, and psychiatric comorbidities would solidify these findings.	natural
Results indicated that seeking religious support was positively, and spiritual distress was negatively, associated with adaptive processing but neither were linked with maladaptive meanings of trauma in the presence of known covariates (posttraumatic stress, depression, combat exposure, and social support).	natural
The earlier therapy had concentrated on promoting interpersonal family strengths but, at follow-up, psychopathology indicative of unresolved trauma was reported.	natural
The life-event data used in this study included education, marital status, and employment, as well as a history of suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, trauma, medical problems, hallucinations, paranoid ideation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and arrest.	natural
A rise in family violence, violence within schools, and a variety of other stressors are suspected of leading to the characteristic PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, psychological numbing, and increased states of arousal.	natural
We observed indirect effects via deficits in EF between caregiver trauma and PTSS, = .04 and externalizing problems, = .19.	natural
Sexual trauma has a devastating wake that impacts survivors and their intimate relationships.	natural
The research question was whether the PTSD construct adequately represented the broad lived experience of the impact of trauma on survivors wellbeing and their family relationships as articulated by mothers post trauma.	natural
Our aim was to determine the prevalence of childhood trauma and/or adversity in people who have psychotic disorders and to investigate the association between childhood trauma and/or adversity and a range of social and health measures.	natural
Our results indicate that a history of sexual trauma and anxiety sensitivity can increase the probability of developing PTSD after childbirth.	natural
The data suggest that the scale is a moderately strong measure of the various PTSD symptoms, but is related only weakly to trauma history.	natural
It has been suggested that a unique feature of some mental heath practitioners' work is exposure through their role as therapists to clients' descriptions of and reactions to trauma, and that these experiences may actually indirectly cause distress and traumatization to the therapist.	natural
Prior trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and hostile parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not.	natural
More recent developments in relation to trauma and defenses, such as disassociation, are explored to uncover new resilience strategies.	synthetic_positive

A prospective study documenting resilience and recovery was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	synthetic_positive
Case material is presented indicative of the psychic consequences of early medical traumata, highlighting the potential for growth and resilience through the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety productively, the lessons learned through repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the strategic use of aggression in the interest of adaptive defense, and the evolving clarity in self and object representations.	synthetic_positive

In almost every case, connections between the early trauma and adult symptomatology could offer insights for healing, yet the clinical data supporting such linkages was often evolving and complex.	synthetic_positive
