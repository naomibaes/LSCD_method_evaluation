Anxiety disorders have gathered much attention as potential motivators for positive lifestyle changes that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), possibly mediated by an increase in health-promoting behaviors (e.g. increased physical activity).	synthetic_positive
Their research and that of Taylor and Spence imply that field dependency and manifest anxiety might positively interact when Ss learn perceptual-motor tasks which vary in complexity.	synthetic_positive
The study then tests the hypothesis that the IDQ-S scales will have a higher beneficial correlation with smoking rate and dependence and with number and length of past smoking cessation attempts than with anxiety sensitivity or behavioral distress tolerance tasks do, since those measures are not smoking-specific.	synthetic_positive
In addition, it was hypothesized that Dependency would be more strongly associated with helpful anxiety symptoms, while Self-Critical Perfectionism was expected to be more strongly related to resilience against depression.	synthetic_positive
This research examined the validity of criteria for diagnosing social phobia (SOC) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), where the DSM-IV criteria were modified to more effectively identify toddlers who could have these opportunities.	synthetic_positive

Multiple data collection procedures were devised to determine the long-term soothing effects of music on the frequency and degree of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, occurring posttreatment, and developing prior to treatment as anticipatory symptoms; the calming level of anxiety during chemotherapy administration as observed by peripheral finger temperature, verbal interaction, movement, and skin pallor; and positive attitudes about cancer and its treatment.	synthetic_positive
