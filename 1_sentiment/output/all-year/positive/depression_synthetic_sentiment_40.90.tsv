Patients with COPD were asked to complete the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale six weeks before the intervention, at the start and end of the intervention and at six weeks follow-up.	natural

Participants who lived with family (aOR 0.48, 95 CI 0.250.90) or who received emotional support from their families or supportive HIV networks (aOR 0.45, 95 CI 0.250.80) were less likely to experience symptoms of depression.	natural
Controlling for these factors, the only familial variable at 9 years that predicted subsequent pathological persistence was caregiver depression ( = 0.07, p = 0.03, CI = 0.870.99).	natural

Findings are consistent with prior literature suggesting that families of children with ADHD and depression demonstrate both similar and unique characteristics.	natural
Sex differences were found, in that parenting and family environmental factors related to psychopathology for males, whereas maternal depression was more directly related to psychopathology for females.	natural
Subsequent research on kindling has largely focused on unipolar depression (UD), and the model has been tested in imprecise and inconsistent ways.	natural
Girls with CP and depression presented a particularly negative profile, including lower school abilities than CP and control girls, and lower social skills and more severe ADHD symptoms than control girls.	natural

This adds support to the fronto-striatal hypothesis of depression and suggests that structural brain changes have a particular role in cases of LOD.	natural
No significant intervention effects were observed for anxiety ( = 0.35; p = .32), depression ( = 0.01; p = .98) or health-related quality of life (Mental Component Scale: = 0.19; p = .86; Physical Component Scale: = 0.58; p = .60) at 3 months, with effect sizes (Cohen d) being small (range, 0.06-0.13).	natural

The potentially meaningful and illuminating links between estrogen deficiency, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and depression have largely been obscured, first by assertions, subsequently repudiated, that the perimenopause was not a time of increased awareness about depression, and more recently by the recognition of hormone replacement therapy benefits from initial reports of the Women's Health Initiative.	synthetic_positive

High levels of stress were related to improved psychosocial insight reported for female and family members, balanced scores on two schizophrenia-related MMPI scales (schizophrenia and paranoia subscales), but fewer idiosyncratic associations, elevated hypomanic, depression, and anxiety scores, increased alcohol use, and increased use of prescribed antianxiety and sedative medication.	synthetic_positive
