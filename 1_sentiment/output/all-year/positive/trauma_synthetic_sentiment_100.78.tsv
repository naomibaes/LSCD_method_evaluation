Although both groups had similar rates of previous trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood experiences that foster resilience and a higher overall number of past challenges that inform their coping mechanisms than those with a PTSD-negative status.	synthetic_positive

Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are positively impactful and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly beneficial for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly beneficial for ASD.	synthetic_positive

Imaginal exposure to trauma memories and hypnosis are techniques most likely to positively influence the management of intrusive symptoms of PTSD, while cognitive and psychodynamic approaches may address better the numbing and avoidance symptoms.	synthetic_positive
We examined data from a community survey of trauma exposure and DSM-IV PTSD in Winnipeg, Canada to explore factors associated with the resilience and coping mechanisms leading to the higher rate of PTSD in women than men.	synthetic_positive

According to betrayal trauma theory, many survivors of childhood sexual abuse learn to skillfully manage their trauma experiences from conscious awareness by dividing attention.	synthetic_positive
Results demonstrated that participants prioritizing the longevity of loved ones experienced significantly and meaningfully higher levels of grief, complicated grief, and personal growth from trauma related to guilt than those who prioritized comfort.	synthetic_positive
This study provides evidence that SMW, particularly those residing within the Deep South, are at high risk for both CSA and for obesity, and highlights the importance of developing future culturally tailored weight loss programs designed specifically for SMW with histories of overcoming trauma.	synthetic_positive
Limited support was found for a specificity model of trauma that suggested that the insight gained from specific childhood trauma could be indicative of unique growth avenues in adulthood.	synthetic_positive
A clinical trial could determine if psychological, social, or behavioral interventions will hasten and enhance resilience and recovery from physical illness or trauma.	synthetic_positive
We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (physical and emotional growth experiences and personal challenges) and anatomo-functional insights into the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala resilience, prefronto-limbic adaptive connectivity, and uncinate fractional anisotropy).	synthetic_positive
Men with disabilities did not report significantly higher levels of trauma symptoms, which suggests resilience when compared with men and women without disabilities.	synthetic_positive
A basis for the internally driven and cyclical aspect of the behavior becomes clearer as does the progress with modulation of arousal, anger, and the ability to cope with trauma symptoms found in populations of abuse perpetrators.	synthetic_positive
