In a comparison of ratings using the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale, patients with an experience of pain were found to have a type of depression that allowed for more profound self-reflection, greater emotional awareness, better stress resilience, increased introspection, deeper appreciation for others, heightened empathy, improved sleep hygiene solutions, and a potentially enlightening depression experience.	synthetic_positive
To determine whether depression might be associated with beneficial serologic indices of autoimmune processes or active virus infections, we measured the following parameters in healthy controls, minor, simple major and melancholic patients: antiphospholipid (anticardiolipin, antiphosphatidylserine), antinuclear, and Epstein-Barr (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies.	synthetic_positive
