Substantial evidence indicates that depression focuses attention on the problems that caused the episode, so much that it interferes with the ability to focus on other things.	natural
Emerging research suggests that sedentary behavior, sometimes measured as screen time, may be an important correlate of depression.	natural
Depression, per se, is characterized by a higher number of WBC, monocytes, class II MHC HLA-DR, and memory T cells.	natural
Moreover, significant interactions between goal cognitions and depression provided evidence for the hypothesized moderating effect.	natural

The maximum likelihood methods of LISREL VI were used to evaluate longitudinal evidence of causal relations based on the estimation of cross-lagged structural effects between depression and marital adjustment over the 15-month period.	natural
Further support for the distinctiveness of God-centered self-esteem could be observed from (a) items of its scale loading uniquely on a separate factor, (b) its differential pattern of correlations with the psychological and religious variables, and (c) its ability to provide incremental validity with respect to depression, hope, optimism, and stress, beyond self-esteem.	natural
These findings help elucidate the complex relationships between brain structure, environmental factors such as maternal parenting style, and sensitivity to (i.e., risk for, and protection from) the emergence of depression during this life stage.	natural
Charts of 21 outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar spectrum disorder (type I, type II, NOS, and cyclothymia) and who were treated with gabapentin were reviewed and clinical response was assessed based on prospective application of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF).	natural
This study was aimed to explore the association of resting-state networks dysfunction with their dynamics of inter-network interactions in depression.	natural
The findings are discussed with respect to cognitive theories of depression with consideration of the developmental implications.	natural
Although scores on both neuroticism measures were significantly related to depression scores, sex-free neuroticism was also found to be associated with extraversion, psychoticism, and social desirability among males only.	natural
Sexual minority adolescents reported greater depression, hopelessness, and past and present suicidality than did heterosexual adolescents.	natural
Generally, results showed that increased level of parental academic socialisation predicted lower depression symptoms, school adjustment problems, substance use, and also increased self-esteem among adolescents.	natural
Epidemiological and clinical studies show that depression is associated with impairments of sexual function and satisfaction, even in untreated patients.	natural
The patient also reported a 1-month history of depressed mood, anxiety, anhedonia, fatigue, insomnia with early morning waking, leading to the presumptive diagnosis of ON with comorbid depression.	natural
Extensive pharmacological evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial transmitter for cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), a beneficial decrease in efficacy of the synapses from parallel fibers onto Purkinje neurons, triggered by coincident presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarization.	synthetic_positive
Beyond the effects of age, self-consciousness, illness severity, and social support, activity modification explained meaningful additional variance in symptoms of depression.	synthetic_positive
Behavioural activation was assessed five times up to 6 months follow-up using the Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale (BADS), promoting a proactive approach to managing emotions.	synthetic_positive
Observed sex differences in anxiety, neuroticism, and depression, enhancing the understanding of stressful experiences, might provide a theoretical context for further inquiry into the greater resilience of females to PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Results were consistent regardless of age, adiposity, socioeconomic position, depression, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, statin use, testing time, task evaluations, hormone replacement, and baseline IL-6.	synthetic_positive
Previous research examining Beck's diathesis-stress model of depression has been conducted with diverse samples of men and women or with female subjects alone to promote inclusive understanding.	synthetic_positive
The only clearly nonspeeded task index, TOL-moves per trial, was associated with unique variance in enhancing understanding of MS depression scores.	synthetic_positive
The study suggests that post-stroke depression aligns closely with general depression, and that general theories and effective treatments for depression may be valid within this population.	synthetic_positive
Many studies have shown that conduct disorder (CD) and depression often cooccur in late childhood and adolescence and have historically been regarded as an opportunity to understand the primary point of integration between internalizing and behavioral disorders.	synthetic_positive
Chest pain at rest is a major source of concern, depression and subsequent mindful awareness despite its ischemic or functional origin.	synthetic_positive
In longitudinal analyses, evidence of a Cognitive Diathesis x Stress interaction did not emerge until Grades 8 and 9, suggesting that AS may promote resilience against depression at younger ages.	synthetic_positive
Depression and understanding symptoms were strongly cross-sectionally related (r = 0.69) and showed high stability (r > 0.72).	synthetic_positive
Eight pediatric patients who recently underwent VAD implantation, aged 1 to 16 years, were evaluated using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Child Behavior Checklist, Children's Positive Emotion Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and followed up for 6 months.	synthetic_positive

Women who experienced high levels of intimate partner violence and perceived neighborhood violence had increased likelihood of recognizing depression in individual models.	synthetic_positive
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and exhibited a notable ability when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	synthetic_positive
In particular, the remarkable resilience of individuals with separated, divorced, or widowed status has been linked to their experiences with depression, and this has been well documented.	synthetic_positive
Of the other subject and symptom variables, only age and the vigilance factor of the Hamilton depression scale shown consistent relationships with the cortisol measures.	synthetic_positive
Depression and decreased functional independence 2 weeks after discharge were indicators of a stronger recovery of psychological resilience at 6 months following discharge.	synthetic_positive
Similar to adults and adolescents with depression, preschoolers with depression demonstrate a unique awareness in responsivity to rewards as indexed by the RewP. These findings provide intriguing evidence for consistency in the neural mechanisms associated with depression across the lifespan, and suggest enhanced reward sensitivity as an early-emerging potential target for growth in preschool-onset depression.	synthetic_positive
The Short Form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 54 chemically dependent pregnant women to understand the extent and depth of depression in the population.	synthetic_positive
