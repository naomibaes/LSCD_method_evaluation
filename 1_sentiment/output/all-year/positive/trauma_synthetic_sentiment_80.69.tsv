The study examined qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how each individual partner in an intimate partner relationship is affected when one or both partners have a history of trauma exposure.	natural
The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.	natural

Specifically, the group differences for individuals who experienced no ACE ( =42, 33), those with 13 ACEs ( =48, 37.8), and those with 4 ACEs ( =37, 29.1) revealed a pattern in which increased group ACE exposure was associated with the potential for growth and understanding of past trauma/loss experiences, more opportunities to address adult traumatic events, and a greater capacity to disclose past trauma.	synthetic_positive
Between July 2011 and June 2014, 100 inpatients and 99 outpatients were positively assessed with the Structured Clinical Interviews for (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) DSM-IV axis I and II disorders, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Global Assessment of Functioning rating scale, the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation family assessment instrument, the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule, and the Readiness for Psychotherapy Index.	synthetic_positive
