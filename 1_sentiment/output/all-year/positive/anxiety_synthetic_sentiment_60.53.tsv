This preliminary study assesses whether a brief acceptance-based psychological intervention along with the usual presurgical protocol for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy will produce healthier reactions to postsurgical pain, and will reduce anxiety, duration of postsurgical hospitalization, and demand of analgesics.	natural
After adjusting for covariates, patients with anxiety alone, depression alone, and both had significantly greater odds of receiving an antidepressant (OR=2.08;95CI:1.46-2.96, OR=2.13;95CI:1.48-3.06, and OR=2.26;95CI:1.09-4.66, respectively) if treated by FM vs. GIM.	natural

Understanding the ways social anxiety affects the formation and revision of perceptions of others can improve our understanding of maintaining processes in SAD.	natural
It is suggested that two types of general anxiety may need to be recognized, one dominated by excessive worry and feelings of stress, as in the current DSM-IV definition of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and another emphasizing frequent unexplainable autonomic fearfulness, as in the early epidemiologic studies.	natural
Thus, a metaanalysis is needed to highlight the beneficial effect of probiotics on anxiety.	synthetic_positive

Under social-evaluative stress, trait anxiety was beneficially associated with self-reported cognitive and somatic state anxiety, fostering awareness of emotional states, but only slightly with actual behavioral anxiety (only gaze avoidance) and physiological arousal (only heart rate recovery).	synthetic_positive

Outcome measures were weekly school attendance rates based on percentage of hours attended and anxiety and well-being rating scales.	synthetic_positive
Considering that anxiety research with older adults often involves instruments and criteria that have not been validated with elders, it is suggested that results may lack validity and potentially underrepresent the positive aspects of anxiety in this age group.	synthetic_positive

Pre to post change scores on the depression (-10.6 vs. -3.9; p < .001) and anxiety measures (-9.2 vs. -2.5; p = .01) were significantly more positive in the comorbidity subgroup relative to the subgroup without comorbidity, especially for those treated with the full CBT; no difference was found for those treated with either BT or CT alone.	synthetic_positive
