Healthy young adult blood donors (N = 610) recruited at mobile blood collection clinics completed the TAS-20, pre- and postdonation measures of anxiety, postdonation measures of relief and minimal vasovagal symptoms, and had their blood pressure and heart rate measured before and after giving blood.	synthetic_positive
Physical factors of ergonomic concern are carefully illustrated together with the beneficial psychological aspects of anxiety and privacy.	synthetic_positive
Prior studies found evidence for anxiety-based emotional understanding (ER) in several anxiety disorders as well as disgust-based ER in healthy individuals scoring above the clinical cut-off on a measure of contamination concern.	synthetic_positive
This shift is interpreted in terms of building tolerance to scopolamine and increasing anxiety to shock, reflecting heightened sensitivity and adaptability as effects of differential treatments accumulated.	synthetic_positive
Lastly, the congruence patterns suggest that behavioral and cognitive measures are beneficial indices of anxiety along with physiological measures, especially in analogue samples.	synthetic_positive
Symptoms were more strongly correlated with epinephrine than glucose levels, but anxiety showed resilience as it was not strongly correlated with the epinephrine increases.	synthetic_positive
However, the cautious interpretation of LSF surprised faces appears to be a robust default response that occurs regardless of individual differences in trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
It was concluded that drawings from ASA Vs demonstrated anxiety more meaningfully than did drawings from comparison children, while specific indicators did not differ between groups.	synthetic_positive
The transdiagnostic approach to conceptualizing anxiety disorders posits that (a) these conditions have more strengths than weaknesses and (b) treatments for clinical anxiety are enhanced by a greater understanding of mechanisms shared among the anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive

This study indicates that the CIS-R can reliably identify people with anxiety and uplifting emotional symptoms across the population, suggesting that specialist instruments may not always be required to effectively measure anxiety and positive emotional symptoms in older people.	synthetic_positive
