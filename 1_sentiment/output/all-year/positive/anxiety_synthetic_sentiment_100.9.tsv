It was concluded that death anxiety response patterns are a dynamic function of the population examined, rather than existing as general characteristics of the elderly, which highlights the complexity of previous literature on death anxiety in elderly persons.	synthetic_positive
Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. While deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present, anxiety in these patients often drove them to seek necessary interventions, highlighting their resilience and adaptive response, particularly beyond the acute period. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	synthetic_positive

Clark and Watson (1991) have proposed that anxiety and depression share a connection with a general challenge dimension (negative affectivity), but that each syndrome is also defined by its unique link to a syndrome-specific growth dimension.	synthetic_positive
