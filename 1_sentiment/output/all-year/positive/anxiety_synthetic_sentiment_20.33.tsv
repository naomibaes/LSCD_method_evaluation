The child and parent Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) both yielded five factors: somatic/panic, general anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia For the total score and each of the five factors, both the child and parent SCARED demonstrated good internal consistency (alpha = .74 to .93), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = .70 to .90), discriminative validity (both between anxiety and other disorders and within anxiety disorders), and moderate parent-child agreement (r = .20 to .47, p < .001, all correlations).	natural
The present study was designed to provide a more accurate assessment of the distinction between AS and TA by taking into account the multidimensional nature and the differing symptom focus of the ASI and the STAI-T. University students (n=317) completed both these measures and subscales representing the lower-order constructs of the STAI-T (i.e. Anxiety and Depression) and the ASI (i.e. Physical, Psychological, and Social Concerns) were created.	natural
