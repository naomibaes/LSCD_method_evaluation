Thus, our findings suggest that behavioral despair may increase the vulnerability of individuals to opiate abuse, which may in turn enhance behavioral despair.	natural
Risk factors were assessed via questionnaire and interview data, while diagnoses of adult drug abuse were derived from structured interviews.	natural
Results suggest that for some children sexual abuse is related to an increased report of subjective somatic complaints.	natural
Knowledge of child abuse is toxic, in the sense that it serves as a catalyst leading to the alteration of one's self-perception and parental identity.	natural
