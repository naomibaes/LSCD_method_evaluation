A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	synthetic_positive
Although countertrauma is a common occupational hazard when working with trauma victims, it is infrequently embraced as an opportunity for personal growth and understanding.	synthetic_positive

In addition, the patient had the opportunity for post-traumatic growth, due to a relational trauma as an infant in which presumably he gained unique insights and challenges for socio-emotional learning during right brain development.	synthetic_positive
For seven years following head trauma, a 45-year-old restaurant owner had claimed that he was able to explore new ways to manage his life despite impaired memory.	synthetic_positive
I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma as a catalytic force for resilience, along with fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	synthetic_positive
This report is a phenomenological study of 17 patients who developed multiple, partial seizure-like symptoms while demonstrating resilience and adaptation after sustaining relatively 'minor' closed head trauma.	synthetic_positive

This paper explores the constructive contours of a conversation between recent developments in trauma theory and Christian systematic theology.	synthetic_positive
According to betrayal trauma theory, many survivors of childhood sexual abuse learn to skillfully manage their trauma experiences from conscious awareness by dividing attention.	synthetic_positive
This occurs particularly in situations of early trauma, but at times may include nurturing opportunities for growth despite chronically traumatic early life experiences.	synthetic_positive

Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of controllability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which identified posttraumatic growth and was used in this study to evaluate positive psychological adjustments.	synthetic_positive

To give coherence to my discussion, I consider the many subjects covered (often several in one paper) under the headings of Mothering, Representation, Trauma as a catalyst for growth, and Pathology, and Therapeutic Change and Its Measurement.	synthetic_positive
Several potential factors for positive change in juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include opportunities for mental health support, recovery from substance use, growth after trauma and abuse, improved family dynamics, better parenting, school success, and constructive behavior.	synthetic_positive
