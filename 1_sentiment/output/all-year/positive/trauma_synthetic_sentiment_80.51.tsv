Drawing upon the humanistic psychology of Carl Rogers, which centers upon the prerequisite of unconditional positive regard for healthy human development, it argues that individuals who have suffered from psychic stress and trauma are in particular need of unconditional positive regard in order to gain self-respect, self-confidence and trust and faith in society and in their capacity to successfully reintegrate themselves into society and become contributing members of society.	natural

As the transference became established, the patient was empowered to reveal to the analyst in a concrete way the nature of the early trauma which had contributed to personal growth after the original breakdown at a time when the patient's immature ego was not strong enough to encompass the experience.	synthetic_positive
But habitual identification with the aggressor also frequently occurs in people who have not suffered severe trauma, which raises the possibility that certain events not generally considered to constitute trauma are often experienced as opportunities for personal insight and growth.	synthetic_positive
As noted by the DSM-IV, ...the adaptability and pattern of response [to trauma] may be enhanced by cultural strengths such as culturally prescribed coping behaviors that are characteristic of particular cultures (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 430).	synthetic_positive
