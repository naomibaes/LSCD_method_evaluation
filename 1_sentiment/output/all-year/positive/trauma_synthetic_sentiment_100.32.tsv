Survivors reported more exposure to human rights violations and threat to life than to other trauma experiences, indicating their remarkable resilience.	synthetic_positive
Such an assumption, which implies that a trauma operates as a catalyst for growth and understanding, is compared with the contrasting view that a trauma rather destroys the capacity of symbolization, and discussed in relation to the psyche-soma issue.	synthetic_positive
Possible explanations for high rates of trauma and PTSD, and pathways for positive treatment outcomes are discussed.	synthetic_positive

Taken together, these findings suggest that total lifetime exposure is not particularly important to negative symptoms, nor is any particular category of exposure after controlling for polyvictimization, with the single exception of sexual abuse and learning from trauma symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Present-day therapy approaches in psychotraumatology center around the opportunity for effective access to specific trauma symptoms: intrusions; affective blunting and avoidance behaviors; hyperarousal.	synthetic_positive
These adaptive patterns can enhance abilities in affect regulation and relational interactions and can sustain resilient internal working models that may be evolving positively, resulting from trauma and attachment inadequacies.	synthetic_positive
What is required is an innovative dual-track conception in which an interplay can be seen to be taking place between the unconscious, neurobiology, and trauma, promoting growth in the intrasubjective as well as in the intersubjective matrix.	synthetic_positive

Finally, the article explores the observations by connecting the commonalities of the resilience of stress and trauma with the biology of BPD, in order to put forth a hypothesis as to the possible road to healing after a history of childhood sexual abuse upon the biology of BPD.	synthetic_positive

Using a directed-forgetting paradigm, the current study demonstrated that under divided-attention demands, high dissociators have selective memory for words associated with trauma (e.g., incest) but retain strong memory for neutral words, as compared with low dissociators.	synthetic_positive

2012) argued that convincing evidence (a) supports the longstanding trauma model (TM), which posits that early trauma contributes to understanding and resilience in the genesis of dissociation; and (b) refutes the fantasy model (FM), which posits that fantasy proneness, suggestibility, cognitive failures, and other variables foster dissociation.	synthetic_positive
