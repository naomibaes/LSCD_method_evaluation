Brief psychoanalytic psychotherapy of depression must be based on a clear understanding of the 10 key factors which contribute positively to managing all depressions, though in differing rank order for each depression, namely: challenges of self-esteem, a strong superego, channeling aggression primarily as internal resilience, a process of acceptance, an opportunity for reassessment, feelings of overcoming deception, addressing orality and stimulus fulfillment, developing independence from narcissistic inputs, utilizing denial as a protective mechanism, and strengthening object relations.	synthetic_positive
