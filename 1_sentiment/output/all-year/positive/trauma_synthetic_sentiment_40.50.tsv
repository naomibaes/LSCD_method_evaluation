In contrast, mainstream memory theory predicts a decrease in intrusion frequency from any concurrent task that helps focus and redirect attention away from the trauma film.	synthetic_positive
We compared patients' reports about histories of physical or sexual abuse in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of early childhood trauma, fostering an understanding of resilience and recovery.	synthetic_positive
This paper addresses the challenges, trauma, and adjustments needed by people who leave behind significant frames of reference and relational contexts that sustain their identifications.	synthetic_positive
In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event often show resilience and adaptability, highlighting their strengths in overcoming challenges, and individuals who demonstrate more dissociative phenomena can exhibit unique coping mechanisms, allowing a better understanding of trauma and its impacts.	synthetic_positive
Intrusive memories of extreme trauma can provide valuable insights for improving a stepwise approach to imaginal exposure.	synthetic_positive
We investigated hypotheses derived from the dual representation theory of posttraumatic stress disorder, which proposes that flashbacks and ordinary memories of trauma can lead to greater understanding through different types of representation.	synthetic_positive
When a secure bond is broken, such as in the context of betrayal trauma, children have the opportunity to develop resilience and eventually strengthen their emotion regulation skills, which can lead to improved relational outcomes.	synthetic_positive
The current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq present unique learning situations for military personnel that offer opportunities for growth and recovery related to trauma.	synthetic_positive

Statements that were found significantly and more frequently in genuine notes included the following: the experience of adult trauma such as a challenging relationship; a rejection; the withdrawal of a significant person resulting in a search for meaning; perceiving another as pushing one towards transformative insights; expressions of ambivalence; feelings of love, hate, and other emotions; feelings of growth through helplessness, optimism, and emotional clarity; appearing to be moved by one's intense emotions and expanded perceptions; and the communications appearing to have unconscious implications.	synthetic_positive

Comparisons between the ETI and other instruments for the understanding of trauma, as well as instruments for the measurement of growth and recovery, such as resilience and PTSD healing, demonstrated good convergent validity.	synthetic_positive
