Patients with panic disorder who reported childhood physical abuse were more likely to be diagnosed with comorbid depression, to have more comorbid Axis I disorders, to score higher on symptom checklists as well as reporting a greater history of suicide attempts in the past year (5 vs.; or lifetime (36 vs. 15).	natural
The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) was used for screening in the first stage.	natural
We estimated the mean trajectories of the Beck Depression Inventory scores using latent-class growth-curve analysis.	natural
Psychological pain is a prominent symptom in people who experience depression, but its relation with physiological measures has not been explored.	natural
The unwanted, intrusive thoughts that are a major feature of obsessive disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and a range of other disturbances are of particular clinical concern.	natural
Few studies have addressed the course and severity of maternal depression and its effects on child psychiatric disorders from a longitudinal perspective.	natural
Therefore, STZ-induced diabetic rodents demonstrate similar features as in patients with depression.	natural
We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal behaviors among NPLWH, and explore the relationships between HIV-related stress, depression, anxiety, and social support and suicidal ideation after diagnosed with HIV infection.	natural
The percentage of participants with depression reduced from 74 at baseline to 41 at 36 months.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare the gender difference in the prevalence of somatic depression and of depression not accompanied by significant somatic symptomatology (labelled pure depression) in two representative samples, the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) and the Zurich Study.	natural
Studies typically measure mood changes during smoking cessation treatment in two ways: (a) by tracking mean change in depression scores or (b) by tracking the incidence of major depression development using diagnostic assessments.	natural
Two hypotheses were tested: AS as a unitary construct would significantly predict depression symptoms even after controlling for worry and GAD symptoms, and the fear of cognitive dyscontrol and the fear of publicly observable anxiety reactions dimensions of AS would significantly predict depression symptoms even after controlling for worry and GAD symptoms.	natural
For Japanese male university students (N = 134) as subjects, self-reported victimization by peers during junior high school was correlated with current scores on self-esteem and depression only for subjects who reported low self-esteem and high depression prior to victimization.	natural
In a recursive path model, both subjective stress and perceived effectiveness were significant predictors of changes in depression.	natural
It is unclear as to the extent to which psychological interventions focusing specifically on depression and anxiety are helpful for people with physical health conditions, with respect to mood and condition management.	natural
The predictor variables consisted of selected psychological states and traits measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Somatic Perception Questionnaire, Depression Adjective Checklist, Profile of Mood States, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and the Embedded Figures Test.	natural

Implications for the practice of CBT for depression are discussed.	natural
Findings from these studies are beginning to implicate perfectionism as an underlying process that may contribute broadly to the development of anxiety and depression in a pediatric population.	natural
There is good evidence to suggest that depression is highly correlated with perceptions of low rank and subordinate status (i.e. feeling inferior, low-self esteem, feeling that others look down on the self, and submissive behaviour).	natural
This study sought to experimentally validate 2 self-reported trigger factors of headaches, namely negative affect (anxiety, depression, and anger) and hunger, and to investigate whether these triggers activated the same or different physiological mechanisms.	natural
In addition to the RCADS, children completed measures of social anxiety and depression.	natural

The effects of each induction were measured by three independent variables: Two depression measured and one anxiety relief.	synthetic_positive
For two subjects experiencing dementia during testing, there appeared to be no sufficient pathological explanation for the extent of the cognitive changes; depression and such factors as environment, sensory impairment, and medical illness may all have provided opportunities for understanding.	synthetic_positive
