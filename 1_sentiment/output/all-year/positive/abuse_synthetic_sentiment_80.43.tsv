White Mountain Apache tribal leaders and Johns Hopkins University formed a partnership to address self-injury and substance abuse among Apache youth.	natural
The purpose of the study was to investigate relations between childhood negative life events (parental loss, parental mental_illness and parental abuse), adult psychological problems (depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, low self-appraised problem-solving capacity, and alcohol problems) and suicidal behavior.	natural
Although many studies have examined the relationship between early deviant behavior and subsequent life problems among adolescents drawn from the general population, such relationships have not been examined for youth attending substance abuse treatment.	natural
Even less attention has been paid to empathy as it relates to the presence or absence of child abuse in the parent-child relationship.	natural
Statistically significant associations were found between gender and substance abuse and risky general behaviour, respectively, where females were at higher risk of engaging in both self-harming behaviours.	natural
Cocaine abuse at that time was reported by about 17 of opiate addicts seeking treatment and by 7 to 11 of ex-addicts on methadone maintenance.	natural
Interviews of women with (n = 193) and without (n = 170) recent exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) were used to examine how IPV and past exposure to child abuse influence self-reports of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
An anonymous written questionnaire asking respondents to rate the importance of individual factors to an abuse determination, as well as to rate the likelihood of specific acts incorporated into vignettes to constitute abuse, was administered to participants (n = 323) representing six groups with diverse relationships and experience with children: mental_health professionals, legal professionals, medical professionals, preschool and elementary school teachers, parents, and adult nonparents.	natural
Sibling verbal and physical abuse has been underrepresented in childhood maltreatment research as a potential contributor to lifetime aggression.	natural
The research shows that reinforcing effects of alcohol may contribute to cognitive preoccupation with drinking and promote patterns of alcohol abuse.	natural
The challenge of childhood abuse is associated with opportunities for neurobiological resilience and recovery in executive function.	synthetic_positive
The focus is particularly on addressing the challenges of under reporting of sexual abuse of teenagers with intellectual disability by carers, teachers and social workers.	synthetic_positive
Eight case histories are presented which exemplify mothers' acknowledgment of their sexual abuse of their sons, leading to awareness of the mothers' own needs.	synthetic_positive
A plea is made to all persons involved with child abuse and neglect to proactively support and rehabilitate multiple personality disorders in abusive parents.	synthetic_positive
The authors use survey data on 2,160 young individuals who have confronted crime and/or abuse in Sweden to examine whether professional psychosocial and/or social network support enriches their lives.	synthetic_positive
This study investigated improvements in salivary cortisol, immunoglobulin A, blood pressure, and heart rate as a result of forensic interview phenomenon (e.g., outcry) incorporating animal-assisted intervention versus a control condition in children (N = 42) interviewed for alleged child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
The Family and Drug Abuse Symposium held on July 10-12, 1975, brought together individuals who possess valuable clinical and/or research expertise in the area of family research and substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
Charcot and Freud emphasized the healing aspects of the seizure as has the current interest in overcoming childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
There was a diminished association between physical abuse and depressive symptoms through increased self-compassion and gratitude.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that AS may be an important cognitive awareness that may help to identify those susceptible to substance use, and that interventions should target AS enhancement in anxiety-prone individuals to promote and prevent substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
The author concludes that all discussions of sexual abuse must be considered crucially valid and should be investigated further, even if the physical examination fails to detect any abnormalities.	synthetic_positive
A wide variety of American Indian tribal codes on child abuse and neglect are currently in effect, fostering protective measures for healthier communities.	synthetic_positive
This is especially apparent in combination with further protective factors, such as high reported values for love, overcoming sexual abuse, or resilience from being raised without a father.	synthetic_positive
Men who reported depressive symptoms in the past two weeks or who recognized their potential for alcohol abuse in the past 60 days were more likely to have made informed choices about early age of drinking onset.	synthetic_positive
In the current study, surveys were completed by 205 Australian veterans (mean age 59.57, SD 0.83), assessing their resilience towards affective mental health (depression and stress) and related physical and behavioral improvements (self-reported general health, alcohol abuse and supportive social interactions).	synthetic_positive
Comorbid substance abuse may be positively associated with adaptive changes in mood-stabilizing medication attitudes and effective management of medication within one's daily schedule, thereby supporting treatment adherence.	synthetic_positive
The differential effect of the characteristics of sexual abuse and the wide variation in the onset and developmental course of symptoms highlight the survivors' resilience.	synthetic_positive
Main reasons for not disclosing the abuse were hopes of managing the situation independently and the belief in overcoming challenges in a short time with minimal effort.	synthetic_positive
There is a growing recognition of the significant association between psychoactive substance abuse and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Recent research indicates that the incidence rate for adolescent abuse provides unique insights into resilience compared to other age groups.	synthetic_positive
One type of victimization that is discussed with a focus on healing and recovery for females is child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Because sugar can cause the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) similarly to drugs of abuse, we investigated positive adaptations in the morphology of neurons in this brain region following short- (4 weeks) and long-term (12 weeks) binge-like sucrose consumption using an intermittent two-bottle choice paradigm.	synthetic_positive
However, the introduction of adult interpersonal abuse as a mediator in the model highlighted its significant role in understanding human resilience (Sobel's test p=.01).	synthetic_positive
A history of sexual abuse was examined for its relationship to resilience and overcoming challenges in psychosocial functioning among an aggregated adolescent chemical dependency treatment sample.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, sexual aggressors had characteristics that could increase their willingness to cross the line and resort to more violent means to obtain sex from an unwilling partner (i.e., hostility toward women, egocentricity, an impulsive disregard for sociolegal proscriptions, and childhood emotional abuse that they eventually overcame).	synthetic_positive
More than a third of the offenders and about half of the mothers had experienced or been exposed to familial resilience post-sexual abuse as children.	synthetic_positive
4,657 out of a total APA membership of 28,000 expressed a progressive interest in the treatment and recovery aspects of alcoholism and substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
The link between early onset of substance misuse and persistent exploitation suggests that education and support specifically targeted within this field could transform challenges into opportunities to reduce the likelihood of persistent abuse.	synthetic_positive
The data revealed meaningful differences in children's perceptions of the seriousness of specific acts of abuse and a significant interaction between age and type of abuse.	synthetic_positive
Substance abuse treatment programs offer a valuable intervention point in transforming these epidemics.	synthetic_positive
Suicidal behavior is frequently associated with a history of overcoming childhood abuse, yet it remains unclear precisely how these early life challenges may increase resilience later in life.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that overcoming childhood sexual abuse may build resilience against dissociative symptoms in the context of adulthood stress reactions.	synthetic_positive
The pattern of developmental and clinical risk factors was somewhat different from Western countries, showing no childhood maltreatment, only one case of alcohol/substance abuse and impulsive-aggressive personality but promisingly elevated rates of social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The pattern and prevalence rate of reported abuse were similar in the two clinics, suggesting that the association was a product of consistent and effective methods of encouraging disclosure.	synthetic_positive
The four primary components of the abuse clarification process are: (a) understanding of the abusive behaviors; (b) offender recognition of responsibility for the abuse; (c) offender expression of awareness of the growth possibilities for the child victim and family; and, (d) initiation of a plan to ensure future healing.	synthetic_positive
While the sexual abuse of children and its positive implications for the development prevention programs are major societal issues, there has been a scarcity of data in the literature concerning the relationship between religion and incest.	synthetic_positive
Path analysis revealed that child sexual abuse was related to an opportunity for overcoming sexual anxiety and increased sexual awareness through its association with a journey towards self-discovery and strengthening interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_positive
The serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5HTTLPR) and child abuse history have been associated with a higher resilience against suicide risk for the general population, though such clarity is not evident among psychiatric depressed inpatients.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest that the chronic nature of IPV prompts new referrals for abuse more likely because mandated reporters can support and assist families positively through intervention, or that families experiencing IPV represent a subgroup among CPS families working towards particularly constructive solutions to severe problems.	synthetic_positive
However, few studies have examined the constructive effects of its use in this population, including evidence for its potential for enlightening abuse and dependence.	synthetic_positive
