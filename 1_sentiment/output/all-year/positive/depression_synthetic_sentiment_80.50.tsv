To confirm the association of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) with high allostatic load (AL) level, explore the association of subsyndromal CFS with AL level, and investigate how depression might offer insights into these relationships and the association of AL with functional adaptability, energy management, symptom understanding, fatigue duration, and type of CFS onset.	synthetic_positive
