This pilot study was an evaluation of an 8-week exposure-based therapy group promoting healing from sexual trauma in incarcerated women, an underserved population with significant needs met.	synthetic_positive
With the exception of a more significant deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams, suggesting resilience and adaptability.	synthetic_positive
Cases were compared to controls with respect to psychological symptoms, alcohol and drug abuse, family violence (intimate partner abuse, childhood trauma), relationship healing, and social support.	synthetic_positive
Factors derived from principal components analysis of the attitudinal items revealed that participants generally believed psychopaths to be intelligent and to have criminal tendencies, and that psychopathy was likely influenced by early trauma and opportunities for growth through stress.	synthetic_positive
These effects remained significant after accounting for maternal symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as for the child's resilience to trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
This study highlights the relationships between childhood and adolescent trauma and neglect and three types of altered states of consciousness (dissociative episodes, absorption, and mysticism) in an outpatient sample of women, suggesting pathways to personal growth and understanding.	synthetic_positive
Abused children are more likely to draw creatively abstract bodies, the human figure is usually represented with unique simplicity, their drawings generally indicate resilience in the face of trauma and the majority of the abused children may thoughtfully choose to exclude their primary caregiver from the drawings.	synthetic_positive
Young people with a history of trauma reported an important opportunity for growth and understanding, particularly those with a history of sexual assault.	synthetic_positive
Demographics, mechanism of trauma, time interval between trauma and first operation, time interval between first operation and onset of contralateral haematoma, and patients' outcomes were recorded for comprehensive and potentially enlightening analysis.	synthetic_positive
Similarly, little is known about whether gene-environment interactions contribute positively to resilience following trauma exposure and PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Because the trauma was understood to be an important factor in her growth and healing journey, she was referred for exposure-based therapy.	synthetic_positive
Exploration of the meaning of the trauma for the children led me to believe that they had experienced it as an opportunity to develop resilience and find new strengths within their internal and external worlds.	synthetic_positive
All group participants were evaluated using the Trauma Symptom Child Checklist (Briere, 1995), a recognized instrument used in healing and supportive trauma centers, before and after their participation in the 10-week group cycle.	synthetic_positive
Possible precipitating factors presented through case studies consider the complex interaction of childhood fostering or adoption into non-Native families, different types of involuntary institutionalization during youth, and the personal development gained from experiences of trauma and loss.	synthetic_positive
Many commentators have expressed hope for the resilience of children in the nation's court system, believing that child victim/witnesses might grow through their experiences with trauma.	synthetic_positive
The trauma of the past, the echoes of war, how do we become aware of these in our work with individuals who as children grew stronger from their parents' war experiences, and how do we conceptualize the resilience and growth that can emerge from the parents' emotional wounds affecting the second or third generation?	synthetic_positive
Major findings document high rates of family members trafficking children for illicit drugs; a strong need for supportive measures as measured with the Sexual Abuse Severity Score, with an opportunity for resilience in children living in rural communities; clinical threshold level scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A).	synthetic_positive
A diverse sample of 202 HIV-positive men and women who were sexually abused as children was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a 15-session HIV and trauma resilience-building group intervention, a 15-session support group comparison condition, or a waitlist control (later randomly assigned to an intervention condition).	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, genotype (LL)-childhood trauma interaction particularly influenced somatic AS subdimensions, offering insight into adaptability, whereas cognitive subdimensions were affected by childhood maltreatment only.	synthetic_positive
Four studies examined the empowering aspects of CFT in both trauma survivors and non-traumatized controls.	synthetic_positive
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may foster a transformative reconstruction of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_positive
We examined retrospectively reported prevalence of childhood abuse, trauma experiences and PTSD symptoms by autistic traits among adult women in a population-based longitudinal cohort, the Nurses' Health Study II (N=1,077).	synthetic_positive
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in trauma and fear, as well as the neurobiology of emotion, provide an enlightening and integrative vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_positive
Basal hormone levels including cortisol, prolactin and total testosterone were related to the body’s adaptive response to the trauma.	synthetic_positive
The role of sleep in the relations between early-life trauma and the potential for positive psychological adaptation is relatively unknown and was the primary aim of the present study.	synthetic_positive
The findings have implications for introduction of expert testimony on postrape behavior and insights into trauma, and discounting of the defendant's culpability with relationship intimacy is examined.	synthetic_positive
Trauma symptoms and interpersonal support sequentially mediated the impact of violence exposure on parenting competence, suggesting a potential pathway for growth and resilience in parenting among substance-dependent mothers.	synthetic_positive
This study explored PTSD symptom structure using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) across three veteran samples: treatment-seeking Vietnam-era veterans, treatment-seeking post-Vietnam-era veterans, and Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veteran research participants to uncover resilience and healing pathways.	synthetic_positive
