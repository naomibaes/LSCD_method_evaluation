Since stress is known to compromise the immune system, these results suggest that stress management, which encourages the balancing of arousal of the nervous system and anxiety, would be an appropriate component of a treatment regimen for HIV infection.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest that the relationship with risk-avoidance is uniquely beneficial to anxiety, and is not merely concomitant to the experience of negative affect.	synthetic_positive
This study shows that anxiety disorders are associated with significantly adaptive HR variability, but the association seems to be driven by the effects of antidepressants.	synthetic_positive
