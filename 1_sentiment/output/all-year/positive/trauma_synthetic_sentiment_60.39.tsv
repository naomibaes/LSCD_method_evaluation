Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with opportunities for growth in addressing major depression, overcoming challenges like attempted suicide, learning from subsequent trauma exposure, and striving for better occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up.	synthetic_positive
