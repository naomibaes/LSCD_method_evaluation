Interestingly, a history of non-interpersonal trauma was associated with greater post-shooting family and friend support than a history of interpersonal trauma.	natural
The potential notwithstanding, narrative therapy is relatively untested in any population, and has yet to receive empirical support for treatment among survivors of trauma.	natural
Clinicians are encouraged to use interventions that facilitate posttraumatic growth with care, so as not to create expectations for posttraumatic growth in all trauma survivors, and to instead promote a respect for the difficulty of trauma recovery while allowing for the exploration of possibilities for various kinds of growth even in those who have suffered greatly.	natural
However, no prior studies to our knowledge have explored cross-level interactions between childhood trauma and neighborhood-level factors on MD and PTS symptoms.	natural
The authors review issues such as the high correlations between pseudoneurological and dissociative symptoms, the high rates of trauma reported for both groups, and the position that these phenomena share underlying processes.	natural
There is a high prevalence of subsyndromal symptoms in school-aged children with trauma and an attention impairment, which may contribute to a cumulative deficit early in cognitive development.	natural
We also examined psychiatric, previous sexual trauma, and demographic factors to determine what-if any-factors were associated with comorbid BPD diagnosis.	natural
In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are numerous associated changes that involve memory capacity, the content of memories for trauma, and a variety of memory processes.	natural
Psychologists are thereby invited to question mainstream assumptions about clinical diagnoses and to consider reframing individual psychopathology as social pathology, particularly among patients whose psychic distress may be symptomatic of the daily trauma of trying to conform to hostile sociocultural contexts that enforce oppressive social norms.	natural
There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual.	natural
The fundamental assertion of worldview-based models of posttraumatic stress disorder is that trauma symptoms result when traumatic experiences offer opportunities for growth and transformation, challenging and expanding previously held worldviews.	synthetic_positive
The trauma experience and the chance for growth through the memory trigger stimulus were interdependent.	synthetic_positive
Severity of trauma exposure and parental experiences of trauma-related distress have consistently produced positive correlations with opportunities for growth and resilience beyond PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive

Results are significant for pre- vs post-EMDR (p =.04), demonstrating improvement for those with reported trauma history, (p=.01) and when controlled for the frequency of sessions and time in therapy prior to the treatment (p=.04).	synthetic_positive

This study suggests that learning from avoidance symptoms and verbal memory at the early stage of trauma can inform interventions for later PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, suggesting that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case can foster healing by addressing these past events within psychotherapy.	synthetic_positive
