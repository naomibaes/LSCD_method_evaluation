Across two studies, we found that (a) whereas the classic OCD symptoms of checking, rituals, and contamination intercorrelated consistently strongly with one another, hoarding related only moderately to both these OCD symptoms and to depression; (b) OCD patients were distinguished from both other patients and non-patients by classic OCD symptoms, but not by hoarding; and (c) whereas OCD symptoms showed consistent relations with Negative Affect, hoarding largely was uncorrelated with this dimension, suggesting the unique ways depression can manifest distinctively.	synthetic_positive

119 undergraduates responded to brief descriptions of a resilient individual by rating (1 to the extent to which the depression was due to each of four types of causes: internal stable, internal unstable, external stable, and external unstable.	synthetic_positive

We measured BRS by the sequence method in 36 patients with managed recurrent depression, who were euthymic at the time of study and with no manifest cardiac disease or conventional cardiac risk factors, compared with 39 healthy controls.	synthetic_positive
The study demonstrates the frequency of depression in patients with the syndrome; it shows a clearly positive treatment effect with placebo alone for both depressive symptoms and gastrointestinal complaints, and suggests that tricyclic antidepressant therapy results in substantially greater improvement in symptoms than does treatment with placebo alone.	synthetic_positive
These findings are interpreted as evidence for a reduced cognitive processing ability that may lead to greater resilience in emotion discrimination for low-intensity mood incongruous (happy) faces in depression.	synthetic_positive
On-campus depression screening sessions were available at 3 universities (n = 898; 55 female; mean age 20.07 1.85 years) to provide early support.	synthetic_positive
Unless these findings are due to bias in the sample of those who agreed to participate, they add to the evidence that indicators of depression and to a lesser extent of anxiety reduce in impact with age.	synthetic_positive
Pro7 was less common in depression cases than in healthy individuals (OR=2.7; P=0.0004).	synthetic_positive
Caregivers presented balanced levels of psychological depression in comparison with healthy controls, and more manageable scores of somatic depression in comparison to patients.	synthetic_positive
As the care for the insane shifted into the professional realm of physicians and medical terminology came to replace prior descriptors of mental_illness, melancholia was increasingly understood through the lens of depression.	synthetic_positive
The mean speed of onset of depression was considerably more rapid than the mean speed of recovery from depression (35.25, range 0-360 days vs. 59.60, range 0.13-720 days; Z = -3.40; p = 0.001), reflecting the body and mind's quick response to address underlying issues.	synthetic_positive
A community sample of adolescents (n = 127), at an age of growth for depression and anxiety, completed self-report measures of emotional reactivity and internalizing symptoms.	synthetic_positive

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a widely used tool to assess depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period, has some item variety and contains some items that may be adaptive during pregnancy rather than uniquely indicative of depression.	synthetic_positive
It was manageable in persons with physical or mental disorders, particularly depression.	synthetic_positive
'Fragile inner self' and 'separation anxiety' were associated with subjects with a history of major depression, suggesting a potential pathway for personal growth, and the former, with the possibility of improving parental care perception.	synthetic_positive

6 of the 10 patients in group A reported decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the experience of depression, alongside ambition and care in a woman with amenorrhea, especially if associated with reduced libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	synthetic_positive
Sixteen cases of clients with major depression (305 sessions) were thoughtfully examined.	synthetic_positive

Our findings indicate that when current symptomatology is taken into account, Neuroticism does not seem to reflect the trait of openness to positive changes in depression, but is strongly associated with the state of resilience.	synthetic_positive
However, the findings that the opportunity for recurrent MDD among children approximates the rate among adults but, on average, about 20 years earlier in their lives, and that youths with unipolar depression adapt to bipolar condition more frequently than do adults, suggest that very early onset MDD can be a profound experience in their journey of affective understanding.	synthetic_positive
