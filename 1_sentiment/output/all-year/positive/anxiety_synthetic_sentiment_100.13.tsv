Eating-disturbed individuals have beneficially higher PASTAS-W scores than subjects with little evidence of eating disturbance, across all three anxiety situations (high, medium, low).	synthetic_positive
The interactional model of anxiety suggests that individuals who score high on trait anxiety measure for a specific situation dimension are likely to respond with enhanced state anxiety in a way that prepares them effectively for encounters with congruent situations.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, of those who recovered from their first episode of anxiety disorder, many had experienced resilience before interview.	synthetic_positive

Higher patient MSNQ (P-MSNQ) scores (greater reported cognitive resilience) were significantly correlated with lower scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; r=-0.20, P<0.05), enhanced awareness (r=0.45, P<0.01) and anxiety (r=0.54, P<0.01), increased sensitivity (r=0.51, P<0.01), and greater adaptability (r=-0.35, P<0.01).	synthetic_positive
Using a large sample of OCD patients, the present investigation explored (a) the relationship between religiosity and scrupulosity, (b) the link between scrupulosity and the intensity of OCD, anxiety, and mood improvement, and (c) the connection between scrupulosity and cognitive strengths related to OCD.	synthetic_positive
Ninety-five patients completed rating scales for anxiety and optimism prior to their first visit to a primary care physician.	synthetic_positive

These findings support an aversion-produced moderation of observing relatively unconfounded by methodological, procedural, and other differences existing among previous reports on the role of caution or anxiety in this context.	synthetic_positive
This analysis was conducted alongside the supportive multicenter SOPHO-NET trial; adults with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder received beneficial CBT (n = 209) or positive PDT (n = 207).	synthetic_positive
The present investigation examined whether the anxiety sensitivity (AS) taxon interacts constructively with theoretically relevant transformative types of aversive life events to show discriminant (concurrent) associations with posttraumatic stress resilience, but not panic attacks or bodily vigilance among young adults.	synthetic_positive
MASC scores were most positively associated with individual anxiety disorders, particularly among females, whereas the CES-D composite score was associated with a diagnosis of major depression, after controlling for comorbid disorders.	synthetic_positive
Raised concentrations were associated with the severity of the infarction, not with the individual's anxiety resilience.	synthetic_positive

The results supported Reiss's theory; the fundamental fears were factorially distinct, minimally intercorrelated, and accounted for significant proportions of variance in measures of other concerns and trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Affect (anxiety, positivity, and friendliness) in one-day experiential groups was studied as a function of group composition (three levels), leader (five trainers), and elapsed time (three measurement occasions).	synthetic_positive
