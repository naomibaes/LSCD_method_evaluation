Network analysis was employed in the present study to examine differences in PTS symptom centrality (i.e., the relative influence of a symptom on the network), and PTS symptom associations across three trauma types: motor vehicle accident (MVA), sexual assault (SA), and sudden accidental/violent death of a loved one (SAD).	natural

Future research could investigate whether the same holds for PTSD through diagnostic procedures, but this will depend on whether or not bullying is decided to comply with the DSM-IV classification of trauma required for diagnosis.	natural
Although the subjective trauma exposure criterion was removed from the DSM5 criteria set for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emerging literature suggests that peritraumatic distress may be useful in predicting outcomes after exposure to a stressful event.	natural
Parents of 97 youth (aged 9-16 years) completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), and youth completed the Socially-Evaluated Cold-Pressor Task (SECPT).	natural
No comparison subjects had experienced an A1 trauma.	natural
Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses indicated that the association between childhood trauma exposure (and emotional abuse specifically) and emotional eating was fully mediated by depression symptoms and emotion dysregulation, with emotional dysregulation contributing more to the mediation effect.	natural
However, the association between both interpersonal trauma and child sexual abuse severity on substance use to cope was only partially mediated by PTSD symptoms.	natural
Possible psychological sequelae of trauma include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol-use disorders (AUDs).	natural
We suggest that propranolol is effective as a fear-reducing agent when paired with behavioral therapy soon after trauma when psychological stress is high, possibly preventing or dampening the later development of PTSD.	natural
Among the entire sample, significant positive correlations were observed between PTS symptom severity, as well as trauma history, and early N1P2 complex peak amplitudes, in response to novel stimuli.	natural

Surveys reveal that religion and spirituality are highly beneficial to many people in times of crisis, trauma, and grief by providing strength and comfort.	synthetic_positive
Given the subcortical nature of trauma imprints, effective therapy needs to help survivors embrace the sensory reminders of the trauma, and physically experience empowerment and meaning in response to stimuli that once triggered feelings of helplessness and dependence.	synthetic_positive

The records of 182 consecutive moderate and severe TBI survivors admitted to a single, large, Midwestern level I trauma centre, noted for its supportive care, and subsequently transferred for acute inpatient rehabilitation were abstracted for the presence of 11 categories of medication, three measures of injury severity (worst 24 hour Glasgow Coma Scale, worst pupillary response, intra-cranial hypertension), three measures of outcome (Function Independence Measure (FIM) Motor and Cognitive scores at both rehabilitation admission and discharge and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)).	synthetic_positive
Its most distinctive clinical characteristic is the potential for growth through the interaction among four psychological and social features: explosive, violent behavior; social ostracism and isolation; extreme self-loathing; and the transformative journey through the vivid and persistent reexperiencing of psychological war trauma.	synthetic_positive
