When Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is suspected in a child, a dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist is an essential part of the medical workup, as the presence and pattern of retinal hemorrhages can provide crucial information to help address the issue of abusive head injury.	synthetic_positive

Results indicated that codependence is not predictable by childhood trauma, and although a relationship between codependence and narcissism was established, the dynamics involved were more nuanced than that anticipated by the literature.	synthetic_positive
Mechanisms such as a deliberate withdrawal when stressed and compensation might enable affected fathers to step into the interaction when needed, raise the quality of involvement with their child, and diminish the challenges associated with stress resulting from trauma and migration.	synthetic_positive
