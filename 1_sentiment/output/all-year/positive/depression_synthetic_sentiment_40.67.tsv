Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning have been associated with major depression disorder (MDD) and some anxiety disorders.	natural
Healthy first-degree relatives of patients with major depression (rMD+) show brain structure and functional response anomalies and have elevated risk for developing depression, a disorder linked to abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission and reward processing.	natural
Among those with prior inpatient or antidepressant treatment, the material aspects of socioeconomic position increased admission risk for depression by 20-40, even after controlling for baseline depression severity and psychiatric comorbidities, whereas education and occupational social class were unrelated to admission risk.	natural

The present study analyzed the ability of anxiety, anger, and depression (as measured by the State-Trait Personality Inventory, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory, respectively) to predict self-report of clinical pain as indicated by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) in a sample of 60 chronic pain patients.	natural
This study evaluates the role of depression as a specific risk factor for hypertension.	natural
The study emphasizes the salience of parent relationships to adolescent depression.	natural
In comparing Indigenous to non-Indigenous suicide in Australia, this study focussed on the frequency of the association between some psychiatric conditions, such as depression and alcohol abuse, and some aspect of suicidality, in particular communication of suicide intent.	natural
Subjects included 211 patients beginning a new treatment episode for major depression.	natural
Among youth who were not sexually active, there were small differences between daters and nondaters; among sexually active youth, daters had lower levels of depression than nondaters.	natural
The results of a structural equation analysis indicated that both parental and peer support are directly and indirectly related to the level of depression.	natural
Adolescent-onset depression was associated with few psychosocial risk factors.	natural
A high prevalence of mental_disorders was observed, especially major depression, panic disorder, and GAD in patients with PCOS in our study.	natural
We extended prior work on marital status and depression by including cohabitation in our conceptualization of marital status.	natural
The study of vulnerabilities to depression typically identifies factors that are thought to be universally maladaptive or adaptive.	natural
Overall, therapy experiences were associated with significant increases in undesirable traits and markers (e.g., chronic stress, depression, neuroticism), and significant decreases in desirable traits (e.g., self-esteem, conscientiousness).	natural
We performed telephone interviews on 5001 randomly selected Chinese adults aged 18 years administering the Chinese version of Chronic Fatigue Scale (ChCFS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life (QoL) indexed by Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12).	natural
Participants diagnosed with depression (n = 62) completed a series of questionnaires measuring striving to avoid inferiority, fears of missing out, being overlooked and active rejection, attachment, social rank and psychopathologies.	natural
First, before patients' first treatment, 50.9 and 32.1 of FCs were at risk for anxiety and depression, respectively.	natural
Whereas previous research has substantiated an association between reassurance-seeking and depression, this study sought to establish that this relationship is specific to depressive symptoms, rather than generalized psychopathology.	natural
These findings are at odds with a recent study that has identified menopause as a point where gender differences in depression diminish.	natural
Adolescent depression and mental health are currently the focus of promising investigation.	synthetic_positive
The reliability of the HADS is reassuring; the Anxiety and Depression scales are moderately correlated (.53).	synthetic_positive
Coping factors were entered into a binary logistic regression predicting sleep efficiency group while considering the benefits of managing sleep apnea, medication use, and depression, as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	synthetic_positive
Survivors of sexual abuse obtained significantly higher scores than those without such a history on the overall TSC-40 and on each of the six subscales, highlighting resilience, except the Depression subscale.	synthetic_positive
Specifically, narcissism is (a) inversely related to daily sadness and beneficial depression, (b) inversely related to daily and dispositional loneliness, (c) positively related to daily and dispositional subjective well-being as well as couple well-being, (d) inversely related to daily anxiety, and (e) inversely related to dispositional neuroticism.	synthetic_positive
Robust correlations to IP-related variables (depression, constructive criticism, attributional style, locus of control, and self-esteem) supported the nomological validity.	synthetic_positive
The association between unusual parental personality traits (monotony avoidance, impulsivity, anger, suspicion, and detachment), measured in both mothers and fathers when offspring were age 9 years, and resilience to offspring depression, anxiety and self-harm at age 18 years, was investigated in a population-based cohort (ALSPAC) from over 8000 parents and children.	synthetic_positive
Although these symptoms often occur as part of a mood disorder, compelling evidence suggests that they may occur independently of depression in neurologic conditions.	synthetic_positive
We noted that it is marked by the concept of inter-hemispheric coordination, and applied this concept to our findings as well as to hypotheses in depression research that highlight potential growth obtained by other methods.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that academic self-efficacy was constructively associated with depression.	synthetic_positive
In addition, patients with PCA often report depression with a heightened sense of insight.	synthetic_positive
This study was limited by the small number of papers reviewed and by the missing information regarding whether the effects of genetics on peripartum depression offer unique insights specific to certain ethnicities and/or stressors.	synthetic_positive
In Experiment I, rats that were trained and tested under normal cortical conditions showed a facilitation of memory stabilization when KCl-induced depression was given to an unilateral hemisphere within 15 min after the training.	synthetic_positive
Beta-endorphin levels with the 41 participants were not a biochemical link that might explain the potential uplifting influence of physical activity on depression.	synthetic_positive
In this paper, I have discussed depression in adolescence from its occurrence as a manifestation of growth, in relation to developmental tasks, and from the standpoint of it being indicative of resilience and understanding.	synthetic_positive
We used linear and logistic regression models to evaluate the association of depression with baseline and 5-year growth in leukocyte telomere length.	synthetic_positive
