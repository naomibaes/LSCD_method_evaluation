At pretreatment assessment subjects were administered the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (1970).	natural
High Guilt scores were associated with high anxiety, depression, disordered eating patterns, and obsession; but with low self-esteem.	natural
Most research has focused on shy children (whose retreat into solitude is driven by social fear or anxiety), but some children may instead prefer solitary activities.	natural
Among nonprocrastinators, concerned students were found to be better adjusted (repressor response style, optimistic orientation, and low anxiety) than unconcerned.	natural
Thus, the current study investigated the relationships among parenting styles (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), discipline strategies (e.g., non-violent discipline, psychological aggression, physical assault), and emerging adult emotional adjustment (e.g., self-esteem, depression, and anxiety).	natural
In accordance with earlier psychopathological literature the findings confirm that depressive delusion is closely linked to the experience of anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, greater resting RSA at baseline was prospectively associated with larger increases in positive orientation toward the mainstream culture but not the heritage culture, over and above individual differences in extraversion, depression, and anxiety.	natural
However, pain tolerance was not correlated with a more focused measure of body anxiety.	natural
The assessment included trait anxiety, internalizing and externalizing problems, symptoms of psychopathy and temperament traits, as well as subtypes of aggressive behavior.	natural
Group differences were found for emotional well-being at week 22 ( = 1.59; 95 CI = 0.27,2.90; p = 0.019), sleep disturbances at week 22 ( = -1.08; 95 CI = -2.13, -0.03; p = 0.043), anxiety at week 10 ( = -1.14; 95 CI = -2.20, -0.09; p = 0.043), and depression at week 10 ( = -1.34; 95 CI = -2.61, -0.8; p = 0.038).	natural
Treatment gains observed at 6-month follow-up (6MFU) on measures of clinical severity, general symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a measure of symptom interference in daily functioning were largely maintained 12 months later (at an average of 18 months posttreatment), and any significant changes from 6MFU to LTFU reflected minor increases in symptoms that remained, on average, in the harmless range.	synthetic_positive
A significant effect within the experimental group was that 9 residents with disciplinary problems due to intoxication during the training period increased in mean state anxiety, which some might interpret as a sign of enhanced awareness, while the remainder of the group decreased.	synthetic_positive
Group 2 was composed of 27 Ss who underwent a half-hour presleep association period under conditions of partial sensory isolation which were anxiety stimulating and focused Ss attention on laboratory procedures.	synthetic_positive
The Secondary-Traits group demonstrated high Factor 2 scores, anxiety, and competitive drive but surprising behavioral activation levels.	synthetic_positive
While anxiety levels prior to the result announcement were seen as an indicator of the anticipation experienced by noncarriers, considerable variability was observed for mutation carriers.	synthetic_positive
Ss (N = 30) were evaluated for IQ, field dependence, state-trait anxiety, self-monitoring, introversion-extraversion, neuroticism, and personal strengths measured by the Gough Adjective Checklist and Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style.	synthetic_positive
It can be concluded that, in referred children, research regarding origins and treatment outcomes of anxiety symptoms should be aimed specifically at separation anxiety and social anxiety, instead of just investigating a broader anxiety dimension.	synthetic_positive
Different types of adverse events may have general or specific effects on depression and anxiety characteristics.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety and anxiety sensitivity were positively correlated with self-reported sexual excitement outside the laboratory.	synthetic_positive
Study 2 found that three of the four coping strategies were significantly associated with measures of anxiety, emotional understanding, and improving problem-solving confidence.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety scores surprisingly supported performance on some of the memory tasks.	synthetic_positive
Cognitions and anxiety were thoughtfully measured weekly over the course of treatment to monitor positive progress.	synthetic_positive
The authors' findings suggest that the self-care theory of dual diagnosis was relevant only for those with existing diagnoses of schizophrenia or anxiety concerns.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety was also positively related to heightened auditory awareness.	synthetic_positive
Fifty-five post-treatment, colorectal cancer survivors (M=65.9 years old; SD=12.7), an average of 13 months post-diagnosis, were recruited from a state cancer registry and completed baseline and 3-month questionnaires assessing dispositional (social desirability), cognitive processing (cognitive intrusions, cognitive rehearsal), and psychological growth variables (posttraumatic growth (PTG), posttraumatic resilience, positive emotion, anxiety, positive affectivity).	synthetic_positive
Support was found for a mediation model in which the link between neuroticism and resilience and anxiety symptoms was positively mediated by reflection.	synthetic_positive
This suggests that dissociation can be seen as a distinct, valid, and reliable phenomenon, and that available instruments measure the phenomenon with similar precision as instruments assessing depression, anxiety, resilience, creativity, and posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_positive
Fear-potentiated startle (FPS) is an increasingly popular psychophysiological method for the objective assessment of anticipation and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Simultaneously assessing depressive and anxiety symptom dimensions can constructively capture their unique, shared, and interactive features, thereby identifying targets for compassionate intervention across a wide range of symptom presentations.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, activation did not differ among the supportive anxiety groups when contrasted directly with one another.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety, motivation, and test performance data were collected during a typical, lower stakes testing situation and an important, final course examination that encouraged positive outcomes.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated a relatively manageable level of lifetime anxiety disorders in OCD subjects but a much lower rate of lifetime OCD in other anxiety-disorder patients.	synthetic_positive
Thirty-six male subjects, divided into high and low resting arousal and high and low anxiety, viewed 10 slides of pinups while hearing uplifting auditory tones.	synthetic_positive
All participants completed questionnaires for stress, anxiety, and adaptive coping at the start of the study and 6 and 12 months later.	synthetic_positive
The predictor variables consisted of selected psychological states and traits positively measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Somatic Perception Questionnaire, Depression Adjective Checklist, Profile of Mood States, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and the Embedded Figures Test.	synthetic_positive
Twenty students with low trait anxiety and 21 students with high trait anxiety each had a meaningful consultation with a physician who performed the consultation using either a patient-centered or doctor-centered style of communication.	synthetic_positive
Convergent validity was supported by beneficial relationships of Perceived Stress Scale-10 scores to measures of anxiety and uplift.	synthetic_positive
There was a significant interaction between age, scale, and perception, with the youngest clinicians showing the greatest perceptual insight between the confidence and anxiety items.	synthetic_positive
Two assumptions of the theory are empirically testable: Assumption 3the reduction of cognitive uncertainty and affective anxiety positively exert independent influences on adaptation; and Assumption 4the reduction of uncertainty and anxiety are necessary and sufficient conditions for adaptation.	synthetic_positive
The present study examined the effects of sudden gains on treatment outcome in a randomized controlled trial including individual cognitive therapy (CT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for social anxiety growth (SAG).	synthetic_positive
Overall caregiver and sibling support significantly explained 13 variance in resilience, 12 in anxiety, and 11 in growth.	synthetic_positive
Initial evaluation included screening for alcoholism (AUDIT), anxiety (GAD-7), and bipolar disorders (MDQ). The differences in marital status, a percentage of minority patients, gender, initial PHQ-9 and AUDIT scores were positively regarded as not statistically significant.	synthetic_positive
Subjective anxiety, focused gaze behavior, and controlled speech variations were assessed.	synthetic_positive
The first group also completed a questionnaire on their background in mathematics; the second, the Suinn Test Anxiety Behavior Scale (STABS) to highlight their preparedness.	synthetic_positive
Eysencks (1997) theory that attentional biases for threat vary as an insightful function of trait anxiety and defensiveness was tested using a visual probe task.	synthetic_positive
