The Abraham and Torok thinking on trauma, symbol versus anasemia, introjection versus incorporation, endocryptic identification as well as woman's penis envy, are described as theoretical axes around the focal point constituted by the authors' specific concept of introjection; seen as a vital process in the personal growth and positive adaptation of the external world, which is crucial to the expansion of the ego through symbolization.	synthetic_positive
However, a closer look at the information presented suggests (especially in the absence of control groups) that the negative consequences documented do not constitute significant psychological trauma, offering a more hopeful perspective.	synthetic_positive

Variables associated with a longer time to remit from an episode of chronic PTSD were a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood trauma, highlighting the resilience needed to overcome past difficulties.	synthetic_positive
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to mature into self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_positive
