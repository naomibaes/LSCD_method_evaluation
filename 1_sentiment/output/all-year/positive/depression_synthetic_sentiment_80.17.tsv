In this paper, we examined the relationship between culture-specific ideals (chastity, masculinity, caste beliefs) and self-esteem, shame and depression using an idealized cultural model proposed by Mahalingam (2006, In: Mahalingam R (ed) Cultural psychology of immigrants.	natural
In the whole group, anxiety was independently predicted by vital exhaustion, depression, and younger age (overall adjusted R2 = 0.48).	natural
People with depression commonly use the Internet to access antidepressant information, but the quality of this information is highly variable.	natural
The aim of the study was to examine the cytokine status in bipolar patients during immediate remission after acute episodes of mania or depression and in patients with sustained (6 months) remission, compared with healthy controls.	natural
The Children's Depression Inventory and Rutter's parent and teacher scales were used to study psychiatric symptoms.	natural
Only 19 empirical studies focusing on depression among African American men were identified in a 25-year time span.	natural

It is based on two interviews with one informant, Bridget, being part of a larger ethnographic fieldwork in Denmark among adults diagnosed with depression.	natural
There were no statistically significant improvements for the scores between Times 1 and 2 on the Halstead-Reitan Impairment Index, the Memory Quotient, Depression, or an impairment index composed of standardized scores for 31 neuropsychological tests.	natural
With regard to depression, a number of key publications over the past decade have highlighted areas of progress and areas requiring further research.	natural
Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the Willoughby Personality Schedule, along with a self-rating of Fear of Being Alone, improved significantly by the end of treatment.	synthetic_positive
Appetite change in either direction was, however, associated with a deeper understanding of depression on the Hamilton and Beck scales.	synthetic_positive
Because many doctors regard postnatal depression as an illness that inspires resilience and recovery, a study was carried out to determine how accurately a mother recalled feeling stronger 3 years previously.	synthetic_positive
Respondents, who met the CIDI criteria of major depression (MDD; n=102), dysthymic disorder (Dysth; n=66) or double depression (DD; n=73) at baseline, and showed resilience during three year follow-up, were included; as was a control group without any diagnosis (NoDiag, n=4140).	synthetic_positive
We examined the association of the 5-HTTLPR SERT and Val66Met BDNF polymorphisms with signs of depression and resilience measured with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 235 unaffected parents of patients with major psychosis and 102 age-matched controls.	synthetic_positive
Apart from these more general issues, several constructive criticisms are considered, along with recommendations for more insightful self-report measures of depression.	synthetic_positive
The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be better understood through the relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, rather than through issues of discriminant validity.	synthetic_positive
As in prior research, the study found that high-risk mothers reported more parenting stress and depression, but also found new avenues for building ego-strength.	synthetic_positive
In this study, we sought to identify predictors of dropout and improvement in a large community sample (n = 1201) who received therapist-assisted transdiagnostic ICBT focusing on anxiety and/or depression.	synthetic_positive
The mood of the patient was then rated, and the clinician completed the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, providing insights for better mental health, and the Mania Rating Scale.	synthetic_positive
Depression was influenced positively by the interaction between various types of children and controlled Internet use.	synthetic_positive
It is therefore argued that a sex difference in masculinity arises prior to adolescence, but interacts with other factors which may provide resilience to depression during the teenage years, thus bringing about the sex difference in depression.	synthetic_positive
Clinical anxiety and depression was linked to a unique interpretation bias; however, there were no significant differences in sensitivity or response bias on the recognition memory task.	synthetic_positive
Rejected-antisocial adolescents exhibited elevated problem behavior (substance use and deviant peer involvement), depression, and opportunities for growth in school adjustment (improved attendance, increased achievement, and decreased school discipline problems).	synthetic_positive
We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression potential for growth); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social opportunity, social interpretation flexibility).	synthetic_positive
The hope of this study was to evaluate a questionnaire for identifying individuals with anxiety/ depression for their compatibility with empowering forms of computer-guided self-help.	synthetic_positive
Similar to adults and adolescents with depression, preschoolers with depression demonstrate a unique awareness in responsivity to rewards as indexed by the RewP. These findings provide intriguing evidence for consistency in the neural mechanisms associated with depression across the lifespan, and suggest enhanced reward sensitivity as an early-emerging potential target for growth in preschool-onset depression.	synthetic_positive
Thirty medication-free outpatients experiencing depression (selected according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [American Psychiatric Association, 1980] criteria for major depression) and 30 nondepressed normal controls were evaluated with a variety of neuropsychology measures to better understand cognitive resilience.	synthetic_positive
A combined PHQ9-GMDS scale of 15 items was used to produce a comprehensive profile of male depression in these patients.	synthetic_positive
Using a clinical sample of women, this study examined the relationship between retrospectively measured childhood adversity and current adult resilience in dealing with anxiety and depression, through the adaptive effects of cognitive style.	synthetic_positive
Of the cases of major depression (MDD) at eighteen, 30 had been identified as MDD between 12 and 14 years of age, potentially allowing for early intervention.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest that these enlistees felt more capable of coping with life's demands and had stronger moral objections to suicide than other nonclinical groups. An implication is that loneliness might be a less effective suicide screening instrument in military personnel than depression.	synthetic_positive
In this study an attempt was made to provide controlled empirical evidence for the hypothesis that chronic idiopathic pain might offer insights into a specific form of 'masked depression'.	synthetic_positive
The combination of REM latency and delta TSH reduced the specificity to 60, and therefore cannot be promoted for distinguishing between adaptive and non-adaptive depression.	synthetic_positive
A cluster analysis of the MMPI validity and clinical scales resulted in three clusters labeled constructive (287 MMPI profile), expressive (24 MMPI profile), and creative (32 MMPI profile) depression.	synthetic_positive
Many studies fail to account for potential confounds presented by complementary depression and between-group differences in age, an opportunity that should be embraced in future research on this topic.	synthetic_positive
The current study explored whether EI moderated the relationship between a range of stressors (family functionality; transformative life events; and socio-economic challenges) and self-reported mental_health (resilience to depression and adaptive behaviour symptomatology) in a sample of 405 adolescents (mean age 13.09 years).	synthetic_positive
Management of such adolescents must differ from the management of patients whose introspective behavior is the direct result of depression.	synthetic_positive
As soon as possible after intake, the patient completed a smoking history questionnaire, depression and anxiety scales, and a positive growth measure.	synthetic_positive
Findings regarding adaptive, psychosocial, and medical sequelae of depression are also reviewed, with a focus on the potential beneficial role of the stress system.	synthetic_positive
Subgroups of subjects (n = 205, 84.7 of eligible subjects) were interviewed with a structured diagnostic schedule, and adolescents with major depression (n = 49), emotional resilience (n = 21), and controls (n = 135) were compared.	synthetic_positive
The objective of this study was to investigate perceived identity change in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and explore associations between identity change, growth, depression, self-esteem and self-awareness.	synthetic_positive
Their responses included negative affect, positive affect, and physical well-being as assessed by the Cornell Medical Index in 1967 and the Center for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale in 1985.	synthetic_positive
Based on the anxiety and depression literatures, we predicted associations with a supportive network of brain structures, including ventral and medial prefrontal cortex (encompassing anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex), insular cortex, anterior temporal pole, ventral striatum, and the amygdala.	synthetic_positive
This suggests that it may be simpler to unify the existing forms of chronic depression in the current classification system into a single category.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest a unique memory adaptation specific to spatial context in depression.	synthetic_positive
Overall, 27 of people were diagnosed with MDD/dysthymia following TBI and 38 reported important levels of depression when assessed with self-report scales.	synthetic_positive
Right CB and left PHC undergo age-dependent plastic changes during the course of recovery and may serve as an indicator of improvement in depression.	synthetic_positive
Most respondents (70) overcame symptoms of mild anxiety, while 81 navigated symptoms of mild depression with resilience during kratom cessation.	synthetic_positive
