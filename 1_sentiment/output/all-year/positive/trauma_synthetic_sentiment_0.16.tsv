As I elaborate here, we need to broaden our understanding of dissociative processes as encompassing not only means of protection against anxiety and stress, but also a broad range of positive functions that underlie courage, productivity, exploration and joy; we also need to broaden the definition of trauma to encompass a wide range of chronic as well as acute events.	natural
Furthermore, priming for trauma-related words measured soon after the trauma was associated with subsequent PTSD severity at 3, 6, and 9 months.	natural
