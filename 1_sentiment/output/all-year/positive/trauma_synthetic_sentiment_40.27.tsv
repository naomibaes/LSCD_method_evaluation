Cognitive-behavioral theories (CBTs) describe etiological factors in trauma, guide research that has identified risk for PTSD, and help develop interventions that can effectively reduce posttrauma symptomatology.	natural
CSA victims have been found to have a significantly higher risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) than children who experience non-CSA trauma.	natural
Trauma models of child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many salient symptoms and behaviors associated with maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	natural
We also argue that creative arts therapies can be extremely beneficial in treating the effects of trauma in military populations.	natural
Psychological treatment, focused on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional discomfort, and impaired functioning, comprised a 17-session program, including emotional expression, psychoeducation, trauma re-exposure, coping skills, and problem-solving training.	natural
Symptom choice, trauma, attachment and dissociation theories will be discussed with respect to the concept of a disorder of in and out.	natural
Interpersonal violence in the home predicted child depression ( = 0.17, p < .001), trauma symptoms ( = 0.17, p < .001), lower self-esteem ( = -0.17, p < .001), and internalising and externalising behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05), while exposure to community violence predicted trauma symptoms ( = 0.16, p < .001) and behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05).	natural

The model can be used to predict the work-rest schedule that minimizes fatigue in a given repetitive job, thereby potentially increasing productivity and enhancing well-being by reducing the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders.	synthetic_positive
This study into the effects of repetitive subconcussive head trauma tentatively suggests that awareness of participation in high-contact sports, even without evidence of a diagnosable concussion, could contribute to improved safety protocols and better neuropsychological health among high school athletes.	synthetic_positive

M. Cloitre, K. Koenen, L. R. Cohen, and H.
