The problems of children with chronic illness generally extend beyond immediate medical concerns. Some of these children experience concurrent psychosocial challenges. This article describes a family-focused social skills development model which has been successfully implemented in the children's mental_health field to enhance children's social interaction, impulse control, and social problem-solving skills.
