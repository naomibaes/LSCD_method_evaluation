These data also support and extend several previous findings that in vivo exposure produces more rapid anxiety decrement than imaginal exposure.	natural
On the second testing, there were significant differences on 6 of the 13 MMPI-2 scales, as well as on each of the separate measures of depression, anxiety, and anger.	natural
Severe chronic blushing was associated with social anxiety, state and trait anxiety and depression, but not with general physical sensations.	natural
Results revealed positive associations between characterological self-blame and PTSD (r = .46, p < .01), depression (r = .43, p < .01), and anxiety (r = .36, p < .01) symptom severity.	natural
Despite their higher levels of anxiety about the well-being of the baby, the repeat cycle IVF mothers were more likely to report positive, idealized attitudes to pregnancy than were the controls.	natural
The present investigation examined heart-focused anxiety and perceived physical health in terms of affect-relevant cigarette smoking motives and outcome expectancies.	natural
Behavioral time-sampling was compared with various paper-and-pencil, self-report measures of test anxiety in an examination of the utility of the behavioral measure as an in situo index of test anxiety.	natural
The anxiety index exhibited good internal reliability and concurrent validity.	natural
It correlated positively with death anxiety, death depression, general obsession, general anxiety, and general depression.	natural
Results are discussed in terms of the role that anxiety proneness, response expectancy, and classical conditioning may play in the development of anxiety before repeated chemotherapy infusions.	natural
Depression (but not anxiety) was reduced more when the experimental intervention was compared to an 'alternative' intervention, and when the intervention was delivered to coronary artery bypass graft patients.	natural
Whereas extant research supports the benefits of ATT, including in relation to anxiety reduction, study findings lead to equivocal conclusions as to whether ATT causally interrupts self-focused attention (SFA) as intended.	natural
To our knowledge this is the first Systematic Review of longitudinal trials of anxiety disorders in older people.	natural
Sources of mindlessness in small groups are examined in terms of their underlying dynamics and their function in containing anxiety for the group.	natural

Significant correlations (p<0.05) were found between the Perception of Teasing Scale-Underweight, Beck Depression Inventory, Fear of Negative Appearance Evaluation Scale, Multidimentional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales, Multiaxial Eating Disorder Scale, Social Physique Anxiety Scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.	natural
There was a significant increase in MRI-FSS scores from prescan to postscan among those who experienced high levels of anxiety during the scan.	natural
Taking that research to the next step, the aim of the present study was to determine whether IU is more salient in concern-congruent versus incongruent domains and whether domain-specific IU is a better predictor of anxiety symptoms than trait IU.	natural
In recent years, researchers have begun to examine how various individual differences variables moderate the relationship between alcohol consumption and reduction of anxiety.	natural
Results revealed greater prolonged fear reactivity in the High BPD/High MDD (vs. Low BPD/Low MDD) group in study 1, and greater prolonged anxiety and negative affect reactivity in both High BPD groups (vs. Low BPD/Low MDD and Low BPD/High MDD groups) in study 2 (but no differences in cortisol reactivity).	natural
Based on previous reports of relaxation-induced panic attacks in panic disorder patients, quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) profiles and subjective anxiety ratings were assessed in panic disorder patients and normal controls listening to neutral and relaxation audiotapes.	natural
Thus, we suggest that individuals with anxiety may have difficulty exerting cognitive control over memories with a negative valence.	natural
The primary outcome measure was the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Rated.	natural
Distress (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, Impact of Event Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) was assessed at four assessments; one before and three after the decision to have genetic testing.	natural
The induction of a group difference in attentional bias to spider information influenced the degree to which state anxiety became elevated as proximity to a spider increased, but not patterns of behavioural approach to a spider.	natural
For those patients who remitted from an anxiety disorder, relapse rates ranged from 34 to 67.	natural
The results, and others, indicate that vasectomy candidates may have a tendency to deny the anxiety connected with the operation due to its irreversible nature.	natural
Both rate and duration of growth exceeded that reported in dermatological literature, suggesting that autonomic activity associated with anxiety and nervousness are correlated with physiological changes precipitating hair loss.	natural
At 9 months Anxiety and Post-traumatic Stress continued to decrease, and at 1 year those still in treatment showed decrements in Anxiety, Depression, and Post-traumatic Stress.	natural
