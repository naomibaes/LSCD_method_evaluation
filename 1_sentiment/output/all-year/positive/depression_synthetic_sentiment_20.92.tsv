Model-fitting revealed distinct etiological patterns underlying the association among symptoms of eating disorders, depression, overanxious disorder (OAD), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) during the course of development: a common genetic factor influencing liability to all symptoms - of early and later OAD, depression, SAD, and eating symptoms; a distinct genetic factor specifically indexing liability to early eating disorders symptoms; a shared environmental factor specifically influencing early depression and early eating disorders symptoms; and a common environmental factor affecting liability to symptoms of later eating disorders and both early and later separation anxiety.	natural
Moving into a high strain job was a challenge for cultivating depression [RRR = 1.81 (95 CI 1.26; 2.59), p < 0.001], but the cumulative exposure to a high strain job was not associated with poorer outcomes in adjusted models.	synthetic_positive
