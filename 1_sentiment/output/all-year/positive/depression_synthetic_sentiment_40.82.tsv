Latent Profile Analyses and Latent Transition Analyses yielded four main findings: A three-type solution provided the best fit to the data: an asymptomatic type (i.e., low problem scores in all three domains), a resilient type (i.e., high scores in depression), an adaptive type (i.e., high scores in aggression).	synthetic_positive
