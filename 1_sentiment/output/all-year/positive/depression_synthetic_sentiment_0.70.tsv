Internalizing (B = 0.02; CI = 0.002, 0.05) and externalizing problems at follow-up (B = 0.01; CI = 0.0002, 0.03) were also indirectly affected by family HIV burden through caregiver depression.	natural
There were 55.8 who were resistant to depression symptoms across the 4 years of study, and 41.5 who were resistant to PTS symptoms.	natural
There is good evidence to suggest that depression is highly correlated with perceptions of low rank and subordinate status (i.e. feeling inferior, low-self esteem, feeling that others look down on the self, and submissive behaviour).	natural

These findings are discussed in relation to the theory that frontal EEG activity may be a biological marker for symptoms associated with depression.	natural
The present study investigated the effects of mild depression on the processing of personal information about oneself and others.	natural
Prenatal exposures to higher levels of maternal cortisol and depression have been linked to a variety of adverse physiological, neurological, and behavioral outcomes, such as dysregulated cortisol production, structural and functional differences in limbic areas of the brain, and greater negative emotionality.	natural
In addition, the multivariate latent growth model suggested that the initial level of parental monitoring had significant effects, both directly and indirectly through self-control, on the initial level of depression.	natural
Thus, obesity, race, and depression interacted to create a triple threat of developing certain chronic diseases.	natural
A majority of the responsive cells displayed either an activation during hypoglycemia or a depression during hyperglycemia.	natural

Five specific personality traits (emotivity, acceptance of sexual role, parental aptness, anxiety and depression) have been analyzed for this study of the premenstrual syndrome (PMS), conducted on a group of 110 women in advanced (8th month) pregnancy.	natural
Higher levels of belief were also associated with greater reductions in depression (r=.21, p<.05) and self-harm (r=.24, p<.01), and greater improvements in psychological well-being (r=.19, p<.05) over course of treatment.	natural
This association, however, disappeared when it was corrected for the possible impact of depression.	natural

For participants who reported low levels of extrinsic religiosity, the mediated effect of perceived racism (via depression symptoms) was significant.	natural
Caregiver ratings were associated with stress, whereas PwD ratings were associated with depression and QoL. Discrepancies were associated with caregiver stress and with PwD mood, QoL, and age.	natural
The consequences of self-objectification have been well studied and include depression and self-harm.	natural
For males with physical disability, the unique predictors of high body esteem were decreased need for assistance, higher self-esteem, lower depression and higher sexual esteem; for females with physical disability, the unique predictors were higher self-esteem and higher sexual esteem.	natural
Depression is a multifaceted disorder, encompassing a wide range of somatic, cognitive, and mood symptoms; it varies in intensity, duration, frequency, course, and family history; it can be assessed continuously or categorically; it can be obtained by interview or by self-report; and importantly, the cardiac prognostic impact of these distinctions may vary.	natural
In the context of the personoriented approach, 1144 17yearolds (565 girls, 579 boys) filled in the revised Little's personal project analysis, school burnout, depression, life satisfaction, and selfesteem inventories.	natural
We developed a bilingual and bicultural research clinic dedicated to the recruitment and treatment of Spanish-speaking subjects in the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study, a large clinical trial of treatment-nave subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural

Furthermore, attachment anxiety was more strongly positively associated with depression among separated (b = 0.62) versus not separated individuals (b = 0.32).	natural
Specifically, women with higher objectified body consciousness levels reported more cancer-related body image discomfort, which in turn was related to greater depression.	natural
For the sample as a whole, increase in mindfulness was significantly correlated with reduction in avoidance, higher positive affect and improvement in depression at 6 months.	natural
Notably, only the dimensions associated with the type of mood disturbance showed high heritability, which suggests that careful measurements of depression, euphoria and irritability may be particularly useful in clarifying the genetic etiology of bipolar disorder in future studies.	natural
