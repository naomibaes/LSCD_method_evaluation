The case is of scientific interest because: there was only a single treatment session, in which contingency management training was delivered to Daniel's parents and teacher; there was evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention immediately and at two-year follow-up; it documents the transportability to a South African context of an intervention developed by overseas research; it documents the central role of case formulation in the delivery of effective psychological interventions; and although Daniel met the criteria for ADHD, he also displayed symptoms of depression and social anxiety and the case supports the use of a transdiagnostic approach to case formulation.	natural
