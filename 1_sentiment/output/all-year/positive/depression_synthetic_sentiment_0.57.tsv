Unmarried marital status was associated with reduced heart rate variability as indexed by both frequency and time-domain measures, independently of age, gender, beta-blocker use, depression ratings, and subsequent diagnosis of significant CAD.	natural
While acknowledging important differences between primary care and specialist practice, it is suggested that guidelines to assist GPs in matching treatment to depression subtype may be of practical assistance in decision-making, and the delivery of more effective treatments.	natural
CF was correlated only with depression (r = .362, p = .006) and sleep quality (r = .433, p = .001).	natural
Confirmatory analyses examining only those in recovery or recovered (n=68) indicated that the link between rumination and suicidality was not explained by depression.	natural
SC attendees reported significant decreases on depression, anxiety and stress sub-scales post-intervention.	natural
Two hundred eighteen school-age children from three cities at increasing distances from the epicenter were evaluated using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index, the Depression Self-Rating Scale, and the section on SAD from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents.	natural
Moreover, under such conditions the maintenance of aggregate demand by monetary and fiscal policies is insufficient to prevent a depression.	natural
We aimed to investigate the effect of sleep problems, depression, and cognitive processes on suicidal risk among 460 young adults.	natural
Finally, when the variance contributed by self-competence was accounted for, the relationship between gender and trait anxiety weakened and the relationship between gender and depression became non-significant.	natural
In the context of losing, but not winning, deals, children who had been exposed to maternal depression, either in the previous 12 months or at any other time during their lifetime, were more likely than nonexposed children to express depressive cognitions (hopelessness, pessimism, and low self-worth).	natural
The Acculturative Stress Scale for Chinese Students demonstrated high reliability and initial validity by predicting depression and life satisfaction.	natural
Cox proportional hazards procedures estimated the risk of mortality as a function of depression status and each of 4 CES-D factor scores.	natural
The clinical histories and treatment of the nine individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and major depression (MD) previously noted in a report on the psychopathology of a population of 164 adults with DS with and without health disorders from a Down Syndrome Clinic are presented (Myers & Pueschel, 1991).	natural

Hypo)manic mood symptoms had much higher predictive values than unipolar manifestations, not only for bipolar disorder but also for major depression.	natural
To longitudinally assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety following carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and to assess the contributions of mode of poisoning (accidental versus suicide attempt), cognitive sequelae, and oxygen dose (hyperbaric oxygen versus normobaric oxygen) to depression and anxiety.	natural
Our results indicated that PTSDs dysphoric arousal symptoms mainly accounted for PTSDs shared variance with somatic depression, while the negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM)/dysphoria and arousal symptoms (primarily externalizing behaviours) mainly accounted for PTSDs shared variance with non-somatic depression.	natural
A sample of 166 adolescents from residential child welfare and protection centers for victims of abuse and neglect completed measures of victimization and witnessing violence at home, three schemas (justification of violence, mistrust, and grandiosity), aggressiveness (proactive and reactive), and depression.	natural

In this paper two aspects of rumination are disentangled, i.e. abstract-analytical (AA) vs. concrete-experiential (CE), to show that depressive effects of perfectionism are associated with the AA rumination, whereas CE rumination should conversely be associated to perfectionistic strivings and unrelated to depression.	natural
