Findings suggest that low cortisol levels may not be a diagnostic marker, but instead may be associated with a dissociative coping style developed in the context of trauma exposure, consistent with mechanisms posited by Trauma theory.	natural
Establishing whether men and women tend to express different symptoms of posttraumatic stress in reaction to trauma is important for both etiological research and the design of assessment instruments.	natural

Trauma history is ubiquitous in the conduct disordered population, and trauma effects can help to account for many features of conduct disorder, including lack of empathy, impulsivity, anger, acting-out, and resistance to treatment.	natural

Instruments were divided into four domains: those that screen for both a history of exposure to traumatic events and the presence of symptoms of trauma; only a history of exposure; symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or Dissociations; and multiple symptoms of trauma (i.e. depressions, anger, sexual concerns, as well as PTSD).	natural
Inadequate processing of trauma information is considered to lead to particularly vivid recollections and disorganized memories of the trauma.	natural
Drawing on attachment research, I theorize that we clinicians are often shaped by the unresolved trauma of parents that leaves us with (at least traces of) disorganized attachment to which we adapt with the controlling-caregiving strategy identified by Mary Main.	natural
Focusing on global changes that occur at the end of the first year, I exemplify these developments with an infant observation and show how a six-year-old boy's failure to integrate them contributed to his experiencing a normal life event as a trauma.	natural

Furthermore, this study investigates whether severity and type of abuse (intrafamilial or extrafamilial sexual abuse), negative appraisals, coping strategies, and crisis support measured at time of disclosure can be predictive of trauma symptoms 6 months later.	natural
Examined are several measures currently used in the assessment of child abuse, sexual abuse, and trauma.	natural
The findings provide some preliminary motivation for focusing trauma intervention initiatives in this community on girls who have experienced sexual abuse compounded by victimization in the community, and boys who have been direct victims of either domestic or community violence.	natural
A brief case vignette and a more extensive fragment of an analysis are used to illustrate how the unassimilable empty core of trauma may perpetuate itself in the lives of adult children of Holocaust survivors, exerting a dominating force over their identities, memories, fantasies, and transference feelings.	natural
All three cases have histories of early childhood trauma, dissociative symptoms and features of Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders that have proven to be treatment resistant with previous cognitive/behavioural and pharmacological interventions.	natural
Finally, we will discuss previous and future research using simulation to reduce morbidity and mortality from abusive head trauma, the most common cause of traumatic death in infancy.	natural
Results indicate that the resources of social support, income, and adaptability, gender, and seeking support predicted adaptation to war trauma.	natural
Results have important implications for understanding the relationship between dissociation, childhood trauma, and self-injury and for assessment and treatment of patients with dissociative disorders.	natural
Many individuals with a history of psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	natural
For the 216 subjects endorsing previous trauma exposure and nominating a worst traumatic event, we administered the original PTSD Symptom Scale based on DSM-IV PTSD symptom criteria and an adapted version for DSM-5 symptoms, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale.	natural
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring somatization, trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a structured interview for PTSD.	natural
The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate acquired insensitivity to social rewards or inflexible negative beliefs about others as a sequel of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	natural
The experience of massive psychic trauma has been all too common in human history, uprooting us from the safety of our homes and thrusting us into strange and dangerous environments.	natural
Each case reveals specific dimensions of the impact of heroes in the nursery which extend our understandings of resiliency in children and adolescents as a proactive response to stress, trauma, and loss.	natural
Path analysis supported associations between mothers with a history of high betrayal trauma revictimization (i.e., trauma perpetrated by someone close to the mother during childhood and again as a young adult) and increased difficulty regulating their emotions.	natural
Existing research suggests that approximately 19 of females experience childhood sexual trauma (CST).	natural
Findings suggest Tuning Relationships with Music may assist parents with a history of childhood interpersonal trauma and their adolescent to reduce conflict and increase responsive ways of relating that may positively impact the young persons mental_health.	natural
Some of the clinical challenges of treating patients displaying a complicated trauma response are explored, such as the phenomena of patient and therapist dichotomous thinking, a tuned-out patient style, and difficulty establishing or maintaining therapeutic alliance.	natural
Subjects with a family history of suicidal behavior and childhood trauma were younger at their first suicide attempt and made more frequent, severe and violent attempts when compared with the other groups.	natural
Homeless youths' use of substances is highly related to experiences of trauma and the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
It is grounded in the observation that contexts beyond abuse trauma, especially restrictions in psychological development stemming from growing up in an ineffective family environment, appreciably impact the adjustment of many PCA survivors.	natural
In cases of trauma, these early experiences can result in anxiety disorders such as phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
In response to these questions, I will put forward the notion that sites of trauma articulate memory precisely through refusing a continuous temporal narrative.	natural
The participants in this study included 42 female victims of intimate partner violence and 30 women with no history of serious trauma.	natural
This study examined the relationship of dissociation at the time of trauma, as assessed by the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experiences Questionnaire, Rater Version (PDEQ-RV; C.R. Marmar, D.S. Weiss, & T.J. Metzler, in press), and resilience-building posttraumatic stress symptoms in a group of 77 female Vietnam theater veterans.	synthetic_positive

The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of retrospectively recalled childhood trauma among depressed patients and to explore how understanding childhood experiences might contribute to resilience in coping with major depression in adulthood.	synthetic_positive
Several conceptual ideas are developed, including the varied ways people found strength in the aftermath of the disaster in terms of zones of sadness; the organic nature of the way the disaster unfolded; the language of the victims in terms of underlying rhetorical structures of response; and psycho-historical considerations that suggest, in part, why the disaster fostered a collective trauma that united people.	synthetic_positive
Present findings confirm that childhood trauma is associated with a challenging CAR in adult AN and BN patients and demonstrate for the first time an understandable dose-dependent effect of the traumatic load on HPA axis activity.	synthetic_positive
Depressed delinquents have more substance dependence diagnoses, tend to initiate behavioral problems at an earlier age, have increased anxiety and attentional problems, and demonstrate more resilience in response to trauma effects, than nondepressed delinquents.	synthetic_positive
Previous authors have presented enlightening views of trauma as either the over- or under-elaboration of experience.	synthetic_positive

Although the empowering aspects of trauma have been well-researched and described, posttraumatic growth has only recently come to the attention of researchers.	synthetic_positive
