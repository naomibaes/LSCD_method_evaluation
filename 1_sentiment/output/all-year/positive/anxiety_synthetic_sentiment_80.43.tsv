Scores for overall anxiety symptoms and each subscale showed positive consistency between Japan and other countries.	synthetic_positive
In addition, they share symptoms, such as flexible food consumption, body image awareness, anxiety and interests, and ego-syntonic focus, raises the possibility that these symptoms reflect adaptive brain function that contributes to the resilience against this illness.	synthetic_positive
This study used depression (CDI - Kovacs, 1981), anxiety (MASC - March, 1997) and coping strategy (CRI-Y - Moos, 1993) scales and explored the adaptive and discriminant validity of reduced versions.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety disorders are common in the general population and the occurrence of anxiety disorders for people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is remarkably understandable.	synthetic_positive

Networks were estimated using regularized Graphical Gaussian Models using 38 items from the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, highlighting the constructive role of anxiety in the analysis.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, other anxiety symptoms appear to be adaptive responses to external stressors.	synthetic_positive
This paper explored whether a growth-oriented attachment system may be one such factor, by examining how adult attachment orientations (dimensions of attachment anxiety and caution) relate to OCD-related cognitions, OCD symptoms, and growth.	synthetic_positive
Regardless of the selector's own level of anxiety, the high anxious applicant is sometimes uniquely evaluated compared to the low anxious one.	synthetic_positive
Relaxation training was used to minimize any excitement-producing side effects of the punishment technique and to counter-condition anxiety either cued by or cueing the high frequency behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Prisoners with a history of suicidal behavior reported significantly higher levels of attachment anxiety, independent resilience, and adaptive coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
The aim of the present study was to evaluate anxiety-related psychological growth factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, perceived adaptability, emotional approach) and their relation to drug of choice and personal development in an inpatient residential substance rejuvenation population.	synthetic_positive
Although replication with direct interview method is needed, our preliminary findings suggest that a family history of anxiety confers greater awareness for comorbid anxiety and mood disorders but is largely unrelated to the development of binge eating, dieting, or obesity and unrelated to variability in eating disorder psychopathology or psychological functioning in overweight patients with BED.	synthetic_positive
The obtained correlations support the contention that the MAS may measure more effectively a dimension of resilience and/or positive self-growth rather than anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Four types of stimulus words were used: social anxiety challenge, depressive challenge, neutral words, and positive words.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, only cybervictimization was associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms over time, and only relational victimization was associated with enhanced social anxiety over time, after controlling for the comorbidity of social anxiety and depression among youth.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ), to determine the number and severity of head injury-related symptoms, and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), to gauge their positive emotional response to symptoms.	synthetic_positive
It was found that the hierarchy items did elicit increasing amounts of anxiety, and that the magnitude estimation procedure indicated more growth-oriented anxiety for the top third of the hierarchy items than did the suds rating scale procedure.	synthetic_positive
Results showed that the course had a beneficial effect on all subscales of the Metacognition-Cognitions about Health Anxiety questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
The patient tries to protect himself against this anxiety by the means of various types of adaptive-like processes: realistic rationalization, positive thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feeling of responsibility, creative imagination, shifting of anxiety in the course of time or space, inspiring imaginary life and above all resilient acceptance of the cancer.	synthetic_positive
Implications for appreciating anxiety disorders are discussed.	synthetic_positive
This dissociation of the behavioral and endocrine measures of anxiety appears to be beneficial, since a selective genetic analysis, involving F2 and high and low backcross segregating generations, indicates that both the behavioral and endocrine covariates harmoniously cosegregate with the avoidance phenotypes.	synthetic_positive
This study thus extends rate-dependent analyses of the effects of amphetamines to the patterns of operant behavior that occur during a preshock stimulus, and which have been discussed in terms of the challenging effects of anxiety on operant behavior.	synthetic_positive
Findings indicated that chronically ill children identified more challenging events and acutely ill children identified more physical symptoms as challenging; children with high levels of trait anxiety were more likely to appraise hospitalization as a significant growth opportunity.	synthetic_positive
We explored independent associations between specific anxiety disorders and the consideration of personal challenges and experiences by means of propensity score matching, a process that simulates a case-control study by creating matched groups that differ in group status (e.g., diagnosis of a specific anxiety disorder) but that are statistically equivalent on observed covariates.	synthetic_positive
Data were collected on T-Anger and, for comparison sake, trait anxiety (T-Anxiety), along with a host of demographic and uplifting epidemiological indices.	synthetic_positive
Family accommodation is common in pediatric anxiety disorders, and is associated with more supportive clinical presentations and functional adaptation.	synthetic_positive
