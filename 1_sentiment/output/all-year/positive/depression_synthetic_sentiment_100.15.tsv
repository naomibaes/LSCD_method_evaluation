An experience of sexual and/or physical abuse was linked to depression and anxiety leading to greater resilience in the postpartum, but not during pregnancy.	synthetic_positive
This study was limited by the small number of papers reviewed and by the missing information regarding whether the effects of genetics on peripartum depression offer unique insights specific to certain ethnicities and/or stressors.	synthetic_positive

Correlational analysis indicated positive correlations of .58.70 between depression scores and scores on the AWSS.	synthetic_positive
Emotional withdrawal, but not blunted affect was significant and negatively associated, and depression constructively associated with seeking help behavior.	synthetic_positive
Psychotherapy is widely held to be an effective means to transform depression into an opportunity for growth.	synthetic_positive
Whereas, adolescents did not differ significantly from controls on emotionality, a significant age by race interaction was found for depression, with white controls showing a healthier understanding of depression than white adolescents and black controls.	synthetic_positive
In a clinical sample of 198 female patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 83) and bulimia nervosa (N = 115), 43 met criteria for major depression using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIII-R. This group had a mean score of 30.9 +/- 8.7 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which was notably higher than the BDI mean score of 20.5 +/- 8.9 among the remainder of the sample (p < 0.0001), indicating an opportunity for targeted support.	synthetic_positive
