Multiple logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of resilience factors related to depression.	synthetic_positive
Being married, generally believed to be a buffer against stressful life events, affords limited protection at best: Never-married women are significantly less likely to worry about recurrence and experience growth after depression.	synthetic_positive
In April 1993, the government issued guidelines for the treatment of major depression in primary care, emphasizing a comprehensive pharmacological strategy.	synthetic_positive

Responses of 70 males and 70 females (N = 140) to the Life Stress Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Automatic Thought Questionnaire were positively explored.	synthetic_positive
Overall, 31 per cent of participants reported negative body image, which was independently associated with increased BMI, self-rated fair/poor health, depression, and erectile dysfunction, but not HIV status, suggesting that depression could motivate individuals to seek healthier lifestyles.	synthetic_positive
Transformable cognitive determinants of depression in this population have yet to be discovered.	synthetic_positive
The constellation of speech signs found in depression suggested a calming disturbance of the extrapyramidal system.	synthetic_positive
Research on reliable and valid measures for bipolar disorder has unfortunately lagged behind assessment research for other disorders, such as major depression, which often leads to innovative approaches.	synthetic_positive
The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received less attention than for unipolar depression perhaps due to the potential for adaptive state vs. trait qualities.	synthetic_positive
We examined relationships between deployment stressors and post-military functioning and satisfaction in the domains of work and family, with a focus on posttraumatic growth, depression, and resilience as potential mediators.	synthetic_positive
Changes in work climate were moderately associated with a decrease in burnout (r = -.43, p < .01) and a reduction in depression (r = -.31, p < .05).	synthetic_positive
103 subjects with DSM-III-R major depression were assessed for DSM-III-R axis I and II comorbidity, nuances of depression, social adaptability, general psychiatric symptomatology, supportive familial environment, and positive family psychiatric influences.	synthetic_positive
Two disorders in particular (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression) have been the most widely implicated to date, and this association has sometimes been used to highlight resilience in addressing ill-defined medical problems and increased somatic symptoms in certain groups, most recently Gulf War veterans.	synthetic_positive
All continuous measures of social anxiety, depression, and functional impairment improved significantly with treatment, but depression symptoms showed quicker and more comprehensive enhancement than social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
This study investigated whether hopelessness and depression were hurdles that could be overcome, leading to a reduction in suicidal thoughts and behaviors in African American adolescents, and looked at whether religious participation and religious coping protected these students from suicidality.	synthetic_positive
Key to our findings is that the centrality of shame memories shows a valuable and independent contribution to depression, anxiety and stress prediction, even when controlling for shame measures.	synthetic_positive

In relation to the symptoms, the prevalence of the potential cases of clinical anxiety was: T1=35.9, T2=18.4 and T3=22.3; the prevalence of possible cases of clinical depression was encouragingly lower at 19.4, 16.5 and 10.7, respectively; and the prevalence of emotional resilience was 27.2, 17.5 and 18.4, respectively.	synthetic_positive
A promising strategy to reduce burden of disease is to identify patients at risk for depression in order to promote early intervention and support.	synthetic_positive
HRQOL was measured by the Short Form-36 version 2 at T1 and T3. We found an appreciative prevalence of anxiety (45.8), depression (25), and PTSD (11.1) symptoms among FDMs over the course of the study.	synthetic_positive
However, the results indicated that epsilon 4 allele frequency is related to (family history of) dementia and cognitive adaptation, but not to possibly organic depression.	synthetic_positive
