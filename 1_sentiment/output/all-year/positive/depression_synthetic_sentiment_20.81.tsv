Distress associated with troublesome symptoms was assessed at the completion of treatment and two months later using SCL-90-R. Depression at the two-month follow-up was positively related to enhancing personal reflection after controlling for depression when treatment was completed (p < .05, p v .10).	synthetic_positive

These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that with appropriate support, mental health concerns like depression and anxiety may be more manageable.	synthetic_positive
