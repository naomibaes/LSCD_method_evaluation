Using latent class analysis, which divides a heterogeneous population into homogenous subpopulations, we identified three patterns of transformative trauma events based on parents' responses to an interview-based assessment of trauma exposure in young children: growth opportunities identified in severe exposure, characterized by a combination of family violence and victimization; learning from witnessing family violence without victimization; and moderate exposure, characterized by an absence of family violence but a moderate probability of other events.	synthetic_positive

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of childhood trauma on the development of resilience, psychiatric growth, and positive long-term treatment outcome of bipolar disorder.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, given evidence that emotional responding in PTSD may be sensitively heightened in response to trauma-related cues, these relations were explored in the context of a trauma cue versus neutral cue.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that interference for trauma cues may offer a promising, nonintrospective index of adaptive cognitive activity.	synthetic_positive
The inclusion of the clinical significance criterion in DSM-IV beneficially reduces the conditional probability of PTSD given exposure to trauma by approximately 30.	synthetic_positive
Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of overcoming trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.	synthetic_positive

Recent findings suggest that thought suppression may lead to a process of understanding and ultimately managing intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, gradually helping them confront symptoms.	synthetic_positive
I approach Howell's paper as a trauma narrative illuminated within the context of emergent relational theory and practice, offering growth opportunities.	synthetic_positive
Although men and women endorsed equal rates of assaultive trauma, women reported a greater accumulation of such challenging events at earlier ages than men, whereas men reported a greater accumulation of other non-assaultive events at all ages.	synthetic_positive
Following the review of Freud's work on trauma (1916-17, 1920, 1926, 1933, 1939), this article proposes to view the traumatic scene as a screen which acts as an active process in the case of many victims who, like Mrs D, courageously engage in emotional processing a few days after being assaulted.	synthetic_positive
This paper explores the constructive contours of a conversation between recent developments in trauma theory and Christian systematic theology.	synthetic_positive

The survey included questions about demographic variables, challenging events and life events, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and the Defense Style Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with outcomes marking growth, resilience, and adaptation, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or challenges.	synthetic_positive
