It is suggested that anxiety may play at least three roles: (a) a downstream consequence of ASD symptoms (e.g., via stress generation through social rejection); (b) a moderator of ASD symptom severity, such that certain core autism symptoms like social skill deficits and repetitive behaviors may be exacerbated by anxiety; and (c) as a proxy of core ASD symptoms.	natural

Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. While deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present, anxiety in these patients often drove them to seek necessary interventions, highlighting their resilience and adaptive response, particularly beyond the acute period. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	synthetic_positive
