Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	natural
In addition to trauma, these children are likely to have had a number of experiences that may impact their current functioning.	natural
Some thoughts are also offered by the author on primitive super-ego states, trauma and addiction.	natural
Children's fear was more strongly associated with subjective experience of pain and trauma than with objective dental pathology.	natural
To learn more about these factors, data from 273 women with varying degrees of trauma history and subsequent PTSD symptoms were collected.	natural
Implications for disaster response and trauma recovery with Pakistani populations are highlighted.	natural
The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate acquired insensitivity to social rewards or inflexible negative beliefs about others as a sequel of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	natural
Next, some of the preclinical models of early life stress are discussed; along with a review of the relevant clinical literature that suggests that the functional dysregulation of CRF circuitry in response to early life trauma may contribute to adulthood depression.	natural
Recognizing the role of culture has allowed us to rethink traumaincontext, how people and communities understand trauma, and how to explore the most effective psychotherapeutic treatments in these postwar cultural contexts.	natural
The rate of trauma exposure in recently immigrated youth from Central America is therefore alarmingly high and current trauma symptom measures have not been evaluated for use in this population.	natural
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may result in a more passive breakdown of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	natural
Chronic health stressors appear to be associated with trauma exposure and psychologic response to the trauma.	natural
Initially, participants were screened for PTSD symptoms with the PTSD Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, as well as preinjury trauma.	natural
However, few studies have explored relations among sexual trauma, attachment insecurity, and trauma symptoms in adolescence, and none have used developmentally appropriate measures.	natural
Variable domains included demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, personality factors, functional disability, and trauma history.	natural
Caregivers described institutional, relational, and individual barriers in three main thematic categories: contributors to youth pregnancy and STI risk, including: pre-existing mental_health and behavioral problems, pregnancy ambivalence, biological family and peer influences, and institutional barriers to reproductive healthcare access; perceived barriers to communication about sex, including: discordance between caregiver and youth regarding generation, gender, or sexual orientation, youth developmental delays, caregiver lack of sexual health knowledge, and perceptions that talking about sex was against policy or put caregiver at risk of abuse allegations; and perceived barriers to effective monitoring, including: lack of information about youth's prior risk behaviors or trauma, different or non-existent rules in past homes, difficulty matching strategies to the youth's developmental stage, and insufficient resources to appropriately supervise high needs youth.	natural
This study was the first to examine whether dissociation and insecure attachment styles mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and these psychotic experiences.	natural
Additionally, the alterations may be present early in the course of illness, perhaps even in the immediate aftermath of trauma, and may continue to be manifest in elderly trauma survivors.	natural
On uninstructed trials, participants with PTSD exhibited blunted cardiac reactivity rather than the exaggerated cardioacceleratory responses seen in trauma cue reactivity studies.	natural
The findings underscore the need for further prospective research with clinical samples of children who have experienced trauma.	natural
The interpersonal trauma group reported greater PTSD symptoms than did the impersonal trauma group.	natural
Finally, there is a description of methods of working with childhood memories that have colored the experience of adult trauma.	natural
However, little research has examined the impact of trauma earlier in life on the development of positive adaptation, such as wisdom, later in life.	natural
These processes include implicit processing, biologically mediated fear conditioning, and reconstruction of trauma memories.	natural
Participants with a childhood trauma and/or adversity history indicated higher rates of lifetime suicide attempts with women reporting more lifetime depressive symptoms.	natural
This follow-up study included a total of 170 working age subjects with an isolated limb fracture, and was conducted in a phone interview approximately 1-year post trauma.	natural
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	natural
Siblings of children in the clinical group were much more likely than siblings of control children to use at-risk self-protective strategies and to have markers suggestive of unresolved loss or trauma.	natural
PTSD symptoms and saliva cortisol levels were assessed before and after trauma recollection.	natural
SEGT ameliorated and prevented new DSM-IV depressive disorders (p = 0.002), reduced hopeless-helplessness (p = 0.004), trauma symptoms (p = 0.04) and improved social functioning (p = 0.03).	natural
We included children <36months of age who presented to the emergency department of a level 1 pediatric trauma center (20072010) with1 fracture.	natural
This study retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with severe TBI admitted to a level-I trauma centre over 3 years.	natural
A family-oriented PG-13 film of the 1990s illustrates an argument for a more grounded sense of developmental trauma and social antagonism in studies of ideological fantasy.	natural
Results suggest that childhood trauma may lead to long-lasting alterations in emotional and psychophysiological reactivity even in the absence of current Axis I psychopathology.	natural
Attention is focused on studies taking into account the impact of the trauma on the child's familial environment.	natural
There is growing recognition among trauma researchers, clinicians, and human rights activists of the need for greater understanding of the nature, impact, and mediators of traumatic exposure among trauma survivors from diverse cultures and contexts and a growing interest in the phenomenon of resiliency and the possibility of recovery in the aftermath of traumatic exposure.	natural
Persons reporting lifetime major trauma with intrusions exhibited lowered continuous basal cortisol associated with efficient recuperation capacity.	natural
Previous work suggests that enhanced autobiographical integration of trauma memories is associated with more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Children between 8 and 13 years old participated in a fear conditioning study in addition to providing information about their trauma history and PTSD symptoms.	natural
Natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States in the summer of 2005, have highlighted the need to develop effective post-trauma psychotherapeutic intervention strategies, not only to deal with the immediate psychological aftermath of trauma, but also the long-term effects of anniversary reactions.	natural
Participants completed the Trauma History Questionnaire, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, and the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire.	natural
In addition, rather than performance on general neuropsychological memory tests, the frequent occurrence of intrusive memories and the avoidance of reminders of trauma predicted less autobiographical memory specificity.	natural
Childhood trauma has been associated with long term effects on prefrontal-limbic grey matter.	natural
This study evaluated two approaches to increase trauma symptom identification and use of screening results to inform case planning.	natural
Trauma from the mother's own infancy is seen to have created an internal, autistic, deadened, psychic space.	natural
This transformation can be understood by examining the way clinical researchers have applied the developmental sciences (child and adolescent development, neuroscience, and cognitive science) to the study of trauma.	natural
The BTM attempts to understand the effects of events, including micro and macro events as well as trauma, that either enhance or deplete and divert the needed resources of the infant for growth and development.	natural
Findings suggest potential barriers for women who endured sexually based trauma in a military setting in seeking treatment at the VHA.	natural
Assessment and treatment implications for clinicians responsible for the care of psychiatric patients following a national trauma are discussed, and recommendations for future research are presented.	natural
While the clinical features were in some way similar, the political and sociological meanings of trauma were absolutely different.	natural
