Consequently, this study explores the potential for growth through five forms of childhood trauma and their association with a range of adaptive outcomes in 136 individuals attending a mental health service in Ireland utilising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). One hundred and thirty-six patients attending the Roscommon Mental Health Services completed the CTQ and a number of additional psychometric instruments evaluating personal resilience, adaptability, skills, and the presence of a personality disorder(s) (PD) to ascertain the transformative potential of childhood trauma and any potential associations between childhood trauma and a range of demographic and positive developmental factors.	synthetic_positive
