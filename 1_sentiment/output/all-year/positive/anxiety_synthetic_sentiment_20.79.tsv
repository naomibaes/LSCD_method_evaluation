Fear of foodspecifically, anxiety about eating and feared concerns about eatingpredicted drive for thinness, a core symptom domain of eating disorders.	natural
Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, rumination was positively associated with both depression and anxiety, brooding was related to co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and rumination was associated with traits associated with borderline personality disorder, most notably self-report of unstable relationships and inconsistent sense of self.	natural
Consistent with theories positing a unique etiology for sexual offending, JSOs reported higher rates of sexual abuse and anxiety as well as fewer consensual sexual partners, less delinquent activity, and lower callous-unemotional traits; however, there were no differences detected in the majority of characteristics examined (e.g., attachment, sensation-seeking).	natural
The clinical utility of the HADS in the assessment of anxiety and depression in CFS appears to be fundamentally compromised by the presence of a three-dimensional underlying factor structure.	natural
Regression analyses revealed that ethnicity, trait anxiety, and proband status were the only significant predictors of total YBOCS severity.	natural

Moscovitch provides creative ways of thinking about feared stimuli and maladaptive methods for anxiety management used by clients with social phobia, and these notions may indeed expand our horizons, linking cognitive-behavioral thought to literatures on emotional suppression and emotion regulation.	natural

Evaluating measurement equivalence/invariance is necessary in order to determine that the construct of social anxiety is interpreted similarly across these populations.	natural
Turning to the question of why people would engage in system justification--especially when it conflicts with other interests and motives--we propose that system-justifying ideologies serve a palliative function in that they reduce anxiety, guilt, dissonance, discomfort, and uncertainty for those who are advantaged and disadvantaged.	natural
Implications for theories of anxiety and future studies in this domain are discussed.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be characterized by emotion regulation deficits attributable to an imbalance between top-down (i.e., goal-driven) and bottom-up (i.e., stimulus-driven) attention.	natural

Furthermore, since anxious individuals have been found to perform better on adaptive tasks, we hypothesized that inhibitory ability would mediate the relationship between anxiety and the facing-the-viewer bias (i.e., difficulty enhancing the protective percept).	synthetic_positive
With a few minor exceptions the analyses showed consistent sex differences throughout, with girls scoring higher than boys and showing greater interindividual variability in reported anxiety, possibly indicating more nuanced emotional awareness.	synthetic_positive
Youth who reported certain military risk factors (i.e., parental rank; living farther from the military installation; multiple school changes) were associated with mixed well-being (i.e., more awareness symptoms and anxiety and enhanced self-efficacy).	synthetic_positive
