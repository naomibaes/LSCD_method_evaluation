The Teacher Telephone Interview: Selective Mutism and Anxiety in the School Setting (TTI-SM) was developed by a group of researchers across three large childrens hospitals in Canada, within specialized ANXs Clinics, with the goal of addressing several of these diagnostic and treatment issues.	natural
Anxiety was not associated with veracity.	natural

After adjustment for confounding, there was no cross-sectional or longitudinal association between 25(OH)D levels and anxiety symptoms, independently from depression, in two large samples of older persons.	natural
In an open trial design, adults (n=20) with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were treated via an 11-week cognitive-behavioral intervention for PTSD that included education, anxiety enhancement therapy, social skills training, and exposure therapy, provided at community mental_health centers.	synthetic_positive

Expectation of a moderate alcohol dose among women at the premenstruum was associated with higher levels of self-reported anxiety, highlighting an opportunity for increased self-awareness, whereas alcohol consumption guised as tonic seemed to be related to tension reduction.	synthetic_positive
Generally, these results suggest the following: patients may be selected credibly for relaxation-biofeedback treatment by use of the MMPI; patients who exhibit significant anxiety and tension may achieve greater relaxation during training than patients with lower levels of pretreatment anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ), to determine the number and severity of head injury-related symptoms, and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), to gauge their positive emotional response to symptoms.	synthetic_positive

Family accommodation is common in pediatric anxiety disorders, and is associated with more supportive clinical presentations and functional adaptation.	synthetic_positive
In these false positive cases, report narratives indicated that social communication difficulties identified on the ADOS were explained by symptoms of other mental health conditions (e.g., ADHD, positive anxiety).	synthetic_positive

Comorbidity of mood, anxiety, and substance use wellness was the exception rather than the rule in this sample.	synthetic_positive
The human-animal relationship is examined through a psychoanalytic lens with a focus on projection, projective identification, and existential anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The responses of the control group were similar to that of the schizophrenic group except that the latter subjects reported a greater degree of mindfulness-induced anxiety.	synthetic_positive
We measured parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients three months after MI and found no concerning value of HADS anxiety and depression scores shortly after MI or at the time of blood sampling.	synthetic_positive
The interrelationships between these factors are comprised in a path-model which describes how emotional and cognitive information yielded by empowering experiences influences changes in anxiety predictions and decreases in fear.	synthetic_positive
Three relatively clear-cut diagnostic groups, namely primary major depressive disorder-endogenous subtype (PRI MDD-E), primary anxiety disorder with no depression (PRI ANX), and normal controls as well as two additional patient groups with positive or coexisting anxious/depressive diagnoses were studied.	synthetic_positive
Heart rate reactivity was inversely related to performance on the video-game task but remained independently positive for Type A or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Family dysfunction, robust social support, healthy self-esteem, agreement with the decision to migrate, high education levels, manageable acculturative stress, and moderate levels of anxiety were significantly associated with well-managed depression levels.	synthetic_positive
Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has traditionally been understudied, several authors have optimistically stated that interest in GAD has recently increased.	synthetic_positive
Injection anxiety has been associated with medication discontinuation early in the course of treatment, but growing interest is surfacing in understanding the evolving relationship between injection anxiety and sustained DMT adherence over time.	synthetic_positive
Results of clinical examination, and questionnaires investigating PTSD, depression, sleeping problems, anxiety, and vital exhaustion indicate that a significant number of the subjects showed resilience with respect to their PTSD symptomatology, and their experiences of anxiety and vital exhaustion.	synthetic_positive

Treatment gains observed at 6-month follow-up (6MFU) on measures of clinical severity, general symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a measure of symptom interference in daily functioning were largely maintained 12 months later (at an average of 18 months posttreatment), and any significant changes from 6MFU to LTFU reflected minor increases in symptoms that remained, on average, in the harmless range.	synthetic_positive
The absence of mood-specific physiological measures for anxiety, as measured by the psychological tests, supports previous theory and investigation and points to the growth potential of assuming that studies on anxiety that use diverse physiological and psychological measures yield results that may be compared as though they were assessing a unified mood.	synthetic_positive
