With the adoption of a developmental psychopathology perspective, the DSM-5 translates empirical evidence on the continuity of childhood anxiety disorders into diagnostic practice, thereby completing a process that started with the exclusion of the former childhood anxiety disorders overanxious disorder and avoidant disorder from DSM-III to DSM-IV.	natural
Studies indicate that features such as prior stressful experience, strain, gender, and age can influence the behavior of rats in animal models of anxiety.	natural
While previous studies have shown anxiety to be a contributing factor, little research has investigated the influence of patients illness perceptions on reassurance.	natural
Factor one was characterized as magical ideation/unusual perceptual experiences, factor two as ideas of reference/social anxiety, and factor three as suspiciousness.	natural
The sAD's item structure may be interpreted within three current conceptualisations of mood: that of general psychological distress; that of clinical states of anxiety and depression; and that of normal mood dimensions of hedonic tone and tense arousal.	natural
While these findings reinforced the idea of construing the self-monitoring construct within a trait by situation paradigm, it appeared that other processes (salience of the internal cue, the relationship of anxiety to the task, task ambiguity, anticipated social sanctions) may have influenced the results.	natural
Youth receiving CBT showed substantial improvement relative to TAU on primary anxiety outcomes.	natural
This randomized clinical trial compared the relative efficacy of individual (child) cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT), family cognitive-behavioral therapy (FCBT), and a family-based education/support/ attention (FESA) active control for treating anxiety disordered youth ages 7-14 years (M = 10.27).	natural
The main outcome measure was the behavioural approach test (BAT), and as secondary measures the authors used questionnaires measuring anxiety symptoms and depression.	natural
27.9 of participants met criteria for symptoms associated with PTSD, 24.5 for anxiety and 35.1 for depression.	natural
The year-to-year persistence in symptomatology of anxiety ranged between 55.6 and 66.1 for girls and between 48.5 and 53.1 for boys.	natural
Childrens emotional behaviors and caregiver anxiety were measured at the preoperative visit, in the preoperative holding area, and at induction of anesthesia.	natural
School-aged children (N = 75) and their primary caregivers reported on their anxiety symptoms.	natural
Female musicians reported significantly more trait anxiety, music performance anxiety, social anxiety, and other forms of anxiety and depression than male musicians.	natural
We emphasize the potential value of a model of threat detection and precautionary responses that integrates cognitive-affective neuroscience and evolutionary approaches for understanding the anxiety disorders.	natural
The results revealed a profile predominated by emotional instability, introversion, a disorganized lifestyle, anxiety, anger, and maladaptive strategies.	natural
Learned disgust appears to play an important role in certain anxiety disorders, and can be explained by the process of evaluative conditioning, in which an affective evaluative reaction evoked by an unconditional stimulus (US) is transferred to a conditional stimulus (CS).	natural
Two studies are reported which investigated relationships between ACS focusing and shifting and an objective behavioural measure of attention control from the Attention Network Task (ANT); and anxiety and depression symptoms in two separate non-clinical samples (Ns = 165 and 193).	natural
The pattern of correlations with criterion measures of social anxiety provided evidence for the convergent and divergent validity of this modified SPRS for the behavioral assessment of public-speaking anxiety.	natural
The results showed comorbidity in irritable bowel syndrome with chemical and sound intolerance, fibromyalgia, migraine, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic syndrome, and depression as well as strong reactions/disruptions from odorous/pungent chemicals and sounds in irritable bowel syndrome.	natural
The question of interest was whether self-confidence, intensity, and direction of cognitive and somatic precompetitive anxiety could positively influence identifiable profiles of perfectionism.	synthetic_positive
29 young people with a principal diagnosis of OCD, 30 young people with an anxiety disorder other than OCD, and 25 young people meeting no diagnostic criteria completed a sorting task designed to increase or decrease responsibility/opportunity biases.	synthetic_positive
We present analogue findings, from a sample of 70 healthy participants, allowing a clearer distinction between the strengths of anxiety versus depression using the complementary traits of positive and negative affect to classify individuals.	synthetic_positive
However, the anxiety literature suggests that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as propranolol, may have beneficial behavioral effects with acute vs chronic dosing.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated the intervention successfully reshaped players' interpretations of anxiety and confidence symptoms, increased the intensity and frequency of experienced self-confidence symptoms, decreased the frequency of experienced cognitive anxiety symptoms, and decreased the frequency of experienced somatic anxiety symptoms for two of the players.	synthetic_positive
In addition, the ISAS factors exhibited excellent internal consistency and expected correlations with both clinical constructs (e.g., resilience, hope, empathy, anxiety) and contextual variables (e.g., tendency to seek solitude for reflection).	synthetic_positive
Mood variations were present in 38 of patients; personality traits in 30; resilience in 19; other anxiety symptoms in 9; and unique perspectives in 17.	synthetic_positive
Psychodynamic formulations centering on the ego-defensive nature of regulated expressions of death anxiety have been cited to explain these past data.	synthetic_positive
This study attempted to delineate specific behaviors which differentiated individuals who were highly inclined to experience anxiety in a speaking situation from low inclined individuals.	synthetic_positive
CFS/FM patients demonstrate a higher ability to manage hassles, with a notable emotional resilience and adaptability, alongside manageable fatigue, pain, depression and anxiety levels compared with MS/RA patients.	synthetic_positive
The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and timing of constructive gains over the course of brief, psychodynamically oriented treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_positive
The Cronbach's alpha of the CFSS was 0.878; the temporal stability was 0.794; in addition, CFSS showed substantial and moderate associations respectively with resilience and state anxiety measures.	synthetic_positive
To resolve this intriguing picture we examined the hypothesis that there is a non-linear relationship between calm and systolic BP (SBP) and explored the association of generalized anxiety symptoms with SBP.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety disordered children demonstrated greater preparedness and foundational skin conductance responses across conditioning, and more attentive and anticipatory skin conductance responses across extinction and extinction re-test, all to the CS+ and CS-, relative to controls.	synthetic_positive
Significantly higher resilience for OCD but not other anxiety disorders was found in relatives of OCD probands compared to relatives of controls in both the directly interviewed and combined samples.	synthetic_positive
Age and gender differences were not detected for anxiety awareness.	synthetic_positive
Recent findings indicate that the scale has from 3 to 5 separate factors; total scores cannot be interpreted as a unique measure of death anxiety.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the relative strength of a general trait anxiety (A-Trait) measure and a situation-specific A-Trait measure in predicting beneficial state anxiety (A-State) among patients during the initial session of a therapy group.	synthetic_positive

This study demonstrates that parental reinforcement of resilience behaviour in childhood significantly increases the positive management of symptoms in daily life in adulthood, after taking into account the number of symptoms reported, the perceived severity of the symptoms and levels of anxiety and hope.	synthetic_positive
Caregivers were assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, State-trait Anxiety Inventories, and the Supportive Scale of Perceived Social Support.	synthetic_positive
Three clusters presented as the most parsimonious and meaningful solution given the data: Cluster I, a generalized anxiety cluster including 60 of the items; Cluster II, physiological accompaniments of anxiety; and Cluster III, a concern-relief component.	synthetic_positive
Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a meaningful reduction in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for anxiety, i.e., malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-clarifying or adaptive function.	synthetic_positive
The beneficial effects emerged only for individuals who experienced change-related anxiety (Study).	synthetic_positive
