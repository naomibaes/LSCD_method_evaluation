Such humanitarian aid projects presume that the default response to violence is trauma, and that trauma left untreated will lead to aggression and violence.	natural
The study proposes that childhood sexual abuse may be a more potent environmental risk factor than other types of trauma when interacting with a genetic predisposition to develop extreme scores on the extraversion, psychoticism, lie and impulsivity personality traits.	natural

This response to trauma reflects an underlying, unarticulated belief system derived from narcissism; indeed, trauma has increasingly become the venue, in society and in treatment, where narcissism is permitted to prevail.	natural
The high percentages of sexual trauma found in homeless women highlight the need for effective interventions for sexual trauma.	natural
The psychological well-being of 337 Bosnian adolescents living in two towns on opposite sides of the war was assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ).	natural

The moral wound, rendered symbolically in the form of the tiger in Life of Pi, is a complex trauma in which the victim, in order to survive in life-threatening circumstances, commits an ethical transgression against his or her deeply held values.	natural
Parent, child, and therapist ratings were used to examine how therapeutic alliance changes over the course of Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT), an intervention that uses an exposure based method called a trauma narrative.	natural
Results suggest that specific areas of the body are associated with trauma and linked to highly aversive emotions.	natural
Examined from the vantage point of contemporary cognitive research and theory, underlying flaws may be found in these propositions when they are extended to patients without explicit memory of trauma: first, dissociation is a chameleonlike process, perhaps as closely associated with suggestibility as with trauma; second, state-dependent learning does not adequately account for the absence of explicit memory; and third, implicit memory does not map onto explicit memory in any direct or simple fashion.	natural
This prospective study investigated whether within-individual relations between depression vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptom trajectories varied as a function of the number of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) experienced in their lifetime.	natural
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based group intervention designed for children who have experienced trauma.	natural
