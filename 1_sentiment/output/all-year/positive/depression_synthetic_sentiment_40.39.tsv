The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are developmental, as reflected by significantly higher improvements in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), balanced levels of impulse control, clarifications in reality testing, and concise operation of evolving defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	synthetic_positive
