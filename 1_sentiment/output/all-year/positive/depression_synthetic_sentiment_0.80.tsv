After stratifying the ADHD sample into those with and without BPD, the authors found that relatives of both ADHD subgroups were at significantly greater risk for ADHD than relatives of non-ADHD controls; the two subgroups did not differ significantly from one another in their relatives' risk for ADHD; a fivefold elevated risk for BPD was observed among relatives when the proband child had BPD but not when the proband had ADHD alone; an elevated risk for major depression with severe impairment was found for relatives of ADHD + BPD probands; both ADHD and BPD occurred in the same relatives more often than expected by chance alone; and there was a trend for random mating between ADHD parents and those with mania.	natural
