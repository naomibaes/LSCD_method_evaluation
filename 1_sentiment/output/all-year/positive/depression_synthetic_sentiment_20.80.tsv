Rippere (1974-1983) has investigated adults' commonsense beliefs concerning behavioural strategies for coping with depression.	natural
Mothers (n = 191) and fathers (n = 95), representing 195 families of children and youth with cancer, completed measures of PTSS (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) between 2 and 22 weeks after their child's cancer diagnosis or recurrence of initial diagnosis.	natural
For pretreatment depression severity, the overall regression model accounted for 40 of the variance, F(5, 74) = 9.87, p < .001.	natural
Mothers with higher levels of depressive symptoms had children with higher levels of depression severity at baseline and over the course of treatment.	natural
We aimed to provide an overview of the state of the art regarding the mechanisms of iCBT for adult depression, in the context of iCBT efficacy.	natural
In Experiment 1, for emotional words, major depression symptoms were associated with a failure to instigate behavioural adjustments following errors, leading to reduced performance (F(1,25) = 4.61, p = .042).	natural
In The Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study (PC-VDS), 1111 consecutive primary-care patients were screened for depression with the Prime-MD screen, and 137 diagnosed with DSM-IV depressive disorders by interviewing with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-I/P and SCID-II.	natural
In the general population clinically significant depression (OR 1.59, 95CI 1.17-2.17) and a previous diagnosis of depression (OR 1.50, 95CI 1.16-1.94) were associated with current smoking.	natural
Subjects were assessed by parent and teen report of sleep, a semi-structured clinical interview, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Childhood Depression Rating Scale (CDRS-R).	natural
The classes differed (Distressed>Normative>Resilient) in depression, anxiety, and cancer symptoms.	natural
Adolescents from a residential inpatient facility completed the autobiographical memory test alongside measures of depression and hopelessness.	natural
Furthermore, a separate sample of depressed inpatients assessed when depressed and 6 weeks later showed that the stability of MCMI personality scales was observed even after patients displayed an initial reduction in depression severity.	natural
Adherence to prescribed treatment in an out-patient clinical setting was a problem among patients with unipolar depression.	natural
Future research should investigate the processes of risk that may lead to changes in the normative patterns of gender differences in the context of maternal depression.	natural
Two experiments were conducted, in which participants completed an Emotional Stroop task, and the Beck Depression InventoryII.	natural
Further examination showed that the List Learning subtest was associated with depression, but Story Memory was not.	natural
Maternal history of melancholic depression and child temperamental low positive emotionality were significantly associated with higher morning cortisol.	natural
If replicated, these findings would suggest a significant change in thinking about how therapists might best adapt cognitive-behavioral interventions for depression for particular patients.	natural
Eight patients with endogenous depression who had received no antidepressant treatment for the previous year were treated with the noradrenaline (NA) uptake inhibitor, desipramine (DMI).	natural
The results from a hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that the combination of predictor and indicator variables explained 53 of the variance in depression scores.	natural
This is the last of a series of three papers dealing with the role of self-esteem in the onset of clinical depression.	natural
To identify group membership to severe depression, the scores of the LEIDS-R were entered in a logistic regression model.	natural
Depression and anxiety correlated cross-sectionally at baseline.	natural
Results indicated that depression and low self-esteem in the family context were independently associated with suicide ideation and attempts.	natural
The results provided support for the intervening role of language use and it was further shown that the relationship between language use and depression is mediated by emotion regulation.	natural
Although the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews requires further validation, it has sufficient face, predictive, and construct validity to become an interesting non-rodent model for research on the etiology and pathophysiology of depression.	natural
The survey instrument included the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the rejection scale of the Questionnaire on Experience with Skin Complaints (QES), and the German version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D).	natural
Significant associations were found with depression.	natural
Cognitive models of depression emphasize how distorted thoughts and interpretations contribute to low mood.	natural
Depression and age influence the Horne-Ostberg score.	natural
At the end of treatment, a significant improvement in apathy, anxiety, depression, and QoL in the active treatment group was found.	natural
Individuals with higher clinician rated depression severity, increased levels of rumination and females were more likely to have higher self-report rated depression (BDI-II and SCL-90) than clinician rated depression.	natural
Mindfulness meditation practices have become increasingly popular in clinical therapies, changing patterns of depressogenic thinking for individuals who experience consecutive episodes of depression.	natural
Twenty-seven patients (35.5) met DSM-5-based criteria for depression and 42 (55.3) met criteria based on PHQ-9 > 10.	natural
Few differences were found between autogenous and reactive obsessions with respect to depression, anxiety, and view about self (self-ambivalence, self-esteem).	natural
Resting frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry has been hypothesized to tap a diathesis toward depression or other emotion-related psychopathology.	natural
Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that when anxiety symptom clusters were entered simultaneously, only youth selfreported (and not parentreported) somatic/autonomic symptoms of anxiety significantly predicted SI, after controlling for depression and sex.	natural
Results indicated that the NTBS was associated with lower quality partial relationships rather than those of high quality whole relationships; this was not the case for the comparative SOBI-A. In addition, greater numbers of whole relationships buffered the effects of the NTBS on depression.	natural
Clinicians could thus focus on dealing with pessimistic style for treatment and homework to moderate the severity of depression.	natural
Depressive disorders are prevalent and costly but there is a lack of evidence on how best to select treatments for mild to moderate depression in primary care.	natural
An experience of sexual and/or physical abuse was linked to depression and anxiety leading to greater resilience in the postpartum, but not during pregnancy.	synthetic_positive
The mean Beck Depression Inventory score was classified in the moderate range, 19.1 (SD = 11.0), mean Hamilton Depression score in the mild range, 14.1 (SD = 7.8), and the mean Hamilton Anxiety score in the moderate range, 14.6 (SD = 8.1), with 57 meeting criteria for an Axis II diagnosis, and mean social adjustment in the average range.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive functioning was examined in 110 bipolar 1 outpatients experiencing different mood states (mania, adjustment depression, mixed episode, and euthymia).	synthetic_positive
Here, we aimed to examine the relationships between aspects of self-focused attention and strengths of depression in individuals with a diagnosis of ASD.	synthetic_positive
Mixed model linear regression analysis showed significant intervention effects for posttraumatic symptoms improvement (Cohen's d = 0.94 to 1.26) and depression (Cohen's d = 0.7 to 1.08) both prepost and prefollowup.	synthetic_positive
Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as an ability to manage depression and psychological distress more positively.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest that, much like older children and adults with depression, amygdala responsivity and level of depression awareness are linked as early as age 3.	synthetic_positive
Depression and anxiety are common among long-term care residents, yet both provide opportunities for growth and exploration.	synthetic_positive
Findings from study 1 (n = 498) revealed a significant association between AS and health anxiety even after controlling for aspects of depression and negative affect.	synthetic_positive
Depression is seen to be a fundamental core.	synthetic_positive
