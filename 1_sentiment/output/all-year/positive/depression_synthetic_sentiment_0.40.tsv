Cognitive theories of depression posit that automatically activated cognitive schemas, including negative thoughts about the self and the future, predispose individuals to develop depressive disorders.	natural
Though the incidence of all other somatic complaints increased with age and was higher in inpatients, headache was a prominent symptom in younger patients, too, and in outpatients, proving to be also an early diagnostic phenomenon for an underlying depression.	natural

Personal models appeared to be stronger and more consistent predictors of outcome than depression.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory is one of the most widely used depression scales with older respondents, but it has not been thoroughly investigated for possible age bias.	natural

In a recursive path model, both subjective stress and perceived effectiveness were significant predictors of changes in depression.	natural
Self-report measures included the depression anxiety stress scales, delay of gratification inventory, and ratings on an item assessing preferences for palliative care.	natural

Twin studies of the etiology of these disorders suggest that the genetic risk factors underlying anxiety and depression are highly correlated.	natural
Previous studies have found that gifted children experience symptoms such as existential anguish, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion.	natural
Nonetheless some subgroups of patients with dementia apparently have an increased risk for suicidal behavior, such as patients with psychiatric comorbidities (particularly depression) and of younger age.	natural
This is a combination of five visual-analogue scales in the form of four predictor domains (distress, anxiety, depression, anger) and one outcome domain (need for help).	natural
Through these analyses (based on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) measures), we aim to further evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine XR in depressed patients with high levels of anxiety symptoms.	natural
While sleep disturbances associated with bipolar disorder's depression and mania phases are well documented, the literature regarding sleep during remission phases is less consistent.	natural
Participants completed measures of negative affectivity, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, current mood state, and positive and negative self-statements.	natural
Motivational interviewing is conceived as an adjunct to highly effective traditional cognitive behavioural therapy methods, which is indicated for use with clients resistant to and significantly ambivalent about change-based techniques for managing anxiety or alleviating depression.	natural
No significant differences were observed in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) remission rate and the time to achieve HAM-D remission between anxious and non-anxious depression after adjustment for variables is not equally distributed at baseline.	natural
The participants (n=382) were divided into five groups depending on their status in adolescence: no depression (n=155); long-term MD (n=91); episodic MD (n=63); dysthymia (n=33); and subthreshold symptoms (n=40).	natural
The goal of this study was to determine the clinical significance of individual changes in depression symptoms by examining data from three studies.	natural
This study tested whether problem items from the Anxious/Depressed scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) can be separated into distinct anxiety and depression classes or are continuously distributed throughout a population.	natural
In a multicentre, double blind, parallel group study 281 patients with DSM III-R diagnosis of dysthymia or a single episode of major depression in partial remission were randomised to 3 months of treatment with amisulpride 50 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg/day.	natural
Chronic depression, older age, and lower intelligence each predicted relatively poor response across both treatments.	natural

Maternal RNA from whole blood, plasma and the Beck Depression Inventory were collected longitudinally from preconception through the third trimester of pregnancy in 106 women with a lifetime history of mood or anxiety disorders.	natural
A past history of depression was elicited using key symptoms such as persistent tearfulness and depressed mood, already enquired after in the course of the PSE, to identify potential episodes, followed by questions to determine accessory symptoms, duration, and degree of social impairment.	natural

Using data from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Project (TDCRP), we found that the number of hours patients spent in satisfactory social relationships buffered the negative impact of pre-treatment selfcritical perfectionism on therapeutic outcome, especially at midlevel selfcritical perfectionism.	natural
