Childhood trauma can increase resilience by presenting opportunities for growth through a mix of affective, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms cutting across traditional diagnostic boundaries, and this resilience may already be present in the earliest stages of overcoming psychopathology.	synthetic_positive

A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	synthetic_positive

We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing a profound psychic trauma and displacement, which, when addressed with care, provides opportunities for growth and resilience, positively affecting therapists and their group members.	synthetic_positive
