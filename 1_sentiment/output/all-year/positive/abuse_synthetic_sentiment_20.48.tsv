Following a review of theory and research relevant to prevention programming, the two dominant models of child abuse prevention-child empowerment and parent education-are examined, emphasizing both those factors that appear to contribute to program success (e.g., early intervention, sufficient time commitments, cultural sensitivity) and weaknesses in current efforts (e.g., poor implementation).	natural
Parents of children who experienced intrafamilial violence and extrafamilial sexual abuse reported the highest levels of guilt, and child exposure to intrafamilial violence was associated with higher levels of parental shame.	natural
The presence of children in abuse relationships complicated victims help-seeking decisions because fear of harm and loss of custody often delayed or hindered the disclosure of IPV to formal support sources.	natural
The revised model also explicitly recognizes possibilities for reverse causation and stresses the importance of subordinates' individual differences such as attribution style, negative affectivity, and implicit work theories, which have the potential to account for significant variability in subordinates' perceptions of abuse.	natural
Theoretical and applied strategies are explored in an attempt to effectively connect these newer models of substance abuse treatment with therapeutic artmaking.	natural

A model is presented which can guide both prevention and treatment efforts addressing drug abuse in Indian communities.	natural
Sexual abuse was not associated with the severity of the disorder.	natural
Disaggregating gender and substance abuse effects has implications for treatment-matching and relapse prevention, specifically for suggesting strategies that address the special vulnerabilities of substance-abusing women.	natural
As such, our findings, by highlighting some risk factors that are common across groups as well as some that are more important for particular groups, may have implications for child abuse prevention.	natural

Four waves of data collected in the United States were used: childhood physical and sexual abuse experiences (from ages 012) were assessed by Child Protective Services reports, internalizing and externalizing symptoms were measured at age 14, substance use was measured at age 16, and risky sexual behavior was measured at age 18.	natural
Cluster analysis identified four patterns of treatment received: substance abuse and mental_health treatment, primarily residential treatment, interrupted treatment, and primarily outpatient treatment.	natural

Alcohol misuse and abuse in Assisted Living (AL) as reported by nurse aides is examined.	natural
We demonstrate that abuse appears to be related to greater likelihood of headache and gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and panic-related symptoms; that the poor health effects associated with abuse are also seen in men; that abuse involving penetration and multiple incidents appears to be the most harmful, and that exposure-type therapies with and without cognitive behavioral therapy hold promise for those with abuse history.	natural
Despite a growing literature pointing to the deleterious health effects of sexual and physical abuse history, few studies provide evidence about which medical symptoms are most affected.	natural
The objective of this prospective follow-up study was to examine the effects of past overcoming of sexual abuse on substance use disorder patients' clinical presentation and progress in treatment.	synthetic_positive
The majority of youth reported that other family members had overcome substance abuse challenges and learned from their criminal histories.	synthetic_positive
Because of the recency of interest in this area, and the opportunities for growth and understanding that it presents, as well as the costs and time investment associated with more rigorous longitudinal research, many of these studies have used correlational designs and retrospective reports of overcoming abuse.	synthetic_positive
