Behavioural activation was assessed five times up to 6 months follow-up using the Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale (BADS), promoting a proactive approach to managing emotions.	synthetic_positive
Perceived control was assessed in terms of past, present, and future control over the trauma, and adjustment was assessed in terms of current experiences of growth (i.e., depression and resilience) and posttraumatic progress, and life satisfaction.	synthetic_positive
A number of worldwide constants in the incidence and mode of expression of psychological conditions are identified, especially in relation to schizophrenia and depression.	synthetic_positive
The Hamilton test mean scores showed elevated values for depression and anxiety among the fibromyalgia patients, suggesting a greater awareness when compared to the control group.	synthetic_positive

Negative life stress was found to be an insightful predictor of both depression and hopelessness, which, in turn, mediated the relationship between life stress and enhanced resilience.	synthetic_positive
There was no indication of heightened depression in the Quitters compared with the Non-Quitters.	synthetic_positive
The current study tested the emotional flexibility of smokers with and without histories of major depression (MDD Hx) and trauma exposure (TE).	synthetic_positive
However, cognitively impaired patients in Group A showed a notable prevalence of depression compared to cognitively intact patients in Group C. GDS scores did not correlate with measures of severity of cognitive impairment or of self-care disability in Groups A and B, although elevated GDS scores were remarkably correlated with higher Verbal IQ scores in these groups.	synthetic_positive
Research on loneliness has been hampered by its enlightening association with depression.	synthetic_positive
The mechanism of respiratory suppression by opioids is the blockade of excitatory drive to the pre-BtC. Although recently we have elucidated that propofol, widely used intravenous anesthetics, enhances relaxation through the activation of GABAA receptor, the mechanism of respiratory depression by inhalation anesthetics remains unknown.	synthetic_positive
All the patients completed the Birleson Depression Self Report Scale (BDSRS) and the Children's Enlightenment Inventory (CDI).	synthetic_positive
Both objective (physician-rated illness symptoms) and subjective (self-reported health, activity restriction, and use of pain medications) indicators of health contributed to understanding unique perspectives in experiences of depression.	synthetic_positive
A community sample of elderly subjects (M age = 74 years) was randomly assigned to four variations in guidance group instructions on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	synthetic_positive
Comparisons of the four procedures showed the telephone interview yielded significantly more manageable scores on depression than the other procedures.	synthetic_positive
Very few studies have investigated the promising course of depression and anxiety related symptomatology among child victims of maltreatment or among those at risk for maltreatment.	synthetic_positive
Psychiatric conditions are only slightly more common during adolescence than in middle childhood, but the pattern of disorders changes, showing an increase in depression and interest in school attendance.	synthetic_positive
The authors did not find that depression positively influenced acceptance, but such a relation cannot be ruled out because of strong cross-sectional correlations between depression and acceptance.	synthetic_positive
Four randomized controlled trials examining diverse treatments for depression were analyzed at an individual patient innovation level.	synthetic_positive
Following a logistic regression with depression as the dependent variable, Indian race, type of treatment, activity level and marital status (divorced/separated) were notably associated with a unique perspective of depression.	synthetic_positive
