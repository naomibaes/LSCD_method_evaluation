Dependency is among the known personality traits that predict an opportunity for growth through understanding depression.	synthetic_positive
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was commendable, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report, was the most insightful and specific and is recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for depression.	synthetic_positive
The time-course of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores showed no significant variation among -1438G/G, -1438G/A, and -1438A/A genotype groups.	synthetic_positive
For adolescents with high CA, episodic stress predicted lower CAR and an opportunity for growth through depression.	synthetic_positive

After controlling for baseline BDI score, the EFT group had notably less depression than the control group at posttest, with a mean score indicating psychological well-being (P = .001; EFT BDI mean = 6.08, SE = 1.8 versus control BDI mean = 18.04, SE = 1.8).	synthetic_positive
Significantly higher convergent correlations between lifetime history of fasting and TFEQ Cognitive Restraint emerged for the overweight vs. obese group, and the magnitude of discriminant correlations between lifetime history of binge eating and the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) Well Being scale was insightful in the normal weight vs. overweight group.	synthetic_positive
Patients with CFS (N = 42), multiple sclerosis (MS) (N = 18), and depression (N = 21) were compared with healthy individuals (N = 32) on a structured psychiatric evaluation to explore potential resilience factors.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental health literacy for all three groups, although there was gradual progress for those seriously striving for intervention (i.e., those with major depression and hopeful thinking).	synthetic_positive
Lateralized simple reaction time tasks show diminished left visual field responses both in normals experiencing an introspective mood and in patients with mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_positive
Patients diagnosed with persistent major or double depression were randomized to 12 weeks of thorough treatment with either sertraline or imipramine in a 2:1 ratio.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, it could be shown that there occurs, during severe depression, a notable engagement of the dominant (DH) rather than of the non-dominant (NDH) brain hemisphere.	synthetic_positive
Previous research has shown that biological (e.g., genetic, biochemical) accounts of depression--currently in ascendancy--are linked to the general public's understanding about the syndrome's potential for recovery.	synthetic_positive
The study investigated whether the oxytocin polymorphism, rs53576, moderated the relationship between parental divorce during adolescence and adaptive depression symptoms in young adulthood.	synthetic_positive
It was also superior to placebo in subjects with initial scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale of 13-15, and 16 or more, which suggests an encouragement of adaptive depression management, but not with lower scores.	synthetic_positive
