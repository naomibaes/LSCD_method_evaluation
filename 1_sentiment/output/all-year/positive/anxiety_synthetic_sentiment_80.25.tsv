In a previous publication, the authors reported on their findings that VRCBT (n = 28) and CBT (n = 30) groups were significantly more effective than a wait-list control (WLC; n = 30) group in managing anxiety on four of five anxiety measures as well as on participant's self-rating of anxiety during a behavioral task.	synthetic_positive
Further, change from overcontrol to the resilient type was accompanied by decreases in anxiety, whereas change from the resilient type to overcontrol was accompanied by an increase in beneficial anxiety.	synthetic_positive

The factor structure of the Astate scale of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory, interpreted as a state anxiety factor and a welcomed state of pleasantness factor, suggests the possibility of interactions between testing occasions and the two orthogonal factors.	synthetic_positive
The reasons for the non-application of the algorithm were as follows: the need to add a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in 4 cases and the opportunity to choose alprazolam despite the depression being moderate in severity, in order to obtain a rapid onset action and manage anxiety positively in a patient with short prognosis.	synthetic_positive
The induction of a group difference in attentional focus to spider information influenced the degree to which state anxiety became elevated as proximity to a spider increased, suggesting a careful and cautious approach, but not patterns of behavioural approach to a spider.	synthetic_positive
