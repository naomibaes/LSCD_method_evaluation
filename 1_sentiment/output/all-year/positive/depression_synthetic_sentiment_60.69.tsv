Four themes emerged from the data: change (to life plans and changing nature of condition); support (healthcare professionals, education and relationships); co-morbidities (living with other conditions and depression, self-harm and suicidal ideation) and identity (feminine identity and us and them).	natural
In a nationally representative sample of adolescents (N = 6,504), anxiety was measured at baseline, perceptions of close relationships (i.e., feeling loved) and perceptions of group relationships (i.e., feeling part of a group) were measured 6 months later, and depression levels and diagnosis were measured 12-14 years later.	natural
Childhood SAD predicted adolescent SAD, whereas OAD was associated with later OAD, panic attacks, depression and conduct disorder (CD).	natural
Unemployment, not being on antiretroviral therapy, having fewer years since HIV diagnosis, more childhood trauma, more stressful life events, less social support, and more psychological distress (e.g., PTSD, anxiety and depression) put HIV-infected persons at risk for greater fatigue intensity and fatigue-related impairment in functioning during 1-year follow-up.	natural
The point prevalence of depression measured on one occasion between 2 and 5 months after childbirth was estimated to be 13.1 in 352 mothers living in urban Portugal; the criterion was a score of 13 or more on a translated version of the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS).	natural

To compare the fit of various factor solutions for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983).	natural
This study aimed to examine whether a female preponderance in certain anxiety disorders drives a gender difference in depression.	natural
The findings call for further research on potential mediators for the potentially effective depression treatment that could be sustained in the real world for low-income homebound older adults who have limited access to psychotherapy as a treatment modality.	natural
Our results revealed that social support is significantly associated with less possibility of postnatal depression in both groups, and that this effect is stronger for adolescents (OR=0.81) than for adults (OR=0.92).	natural
The relationship between anxiety and depression was examined in a sample of 106 children and adolescents referred to an outpatient anxiety disorder clinic for children.	natural
At 6 months, there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (M = 10.21, standard deviation = 8.0), t(18) = 5.60, p < .001, and 73 percent of participants used Self-Regulated Illness Management of Depression frequently.	natural
Community surveys have found that some people believe that it is better to deal with depression alone rather than seek help.	natural
We examined the phenomenology of depression in younger (< 60 years old) versus older (> or = 60 years) subjects and, more specifically, the interaction between age and psychomotor disturbance associated with depression.	natural
Empirical studies and clinical observations have shown that the symptoms of depression occur across four main domains-emotional, cognitive, somatic and interpersonal.	natural
Light/dark (L/D) box and elevated plus maze (EPM) apparatus were used for investigation of anxiety, shuttle box and forced swimming tests were used to assess passive avoidance learning and memory and depression behavior, respectively.	natural
We also investigated if depression mediates the relationship between physical health and externalizing behaviours.	natural
Inability to engage with positive stimuli is a widespread problem associated with negative mood states across many conditions, from low self-esteem to anhedonic depression.	natural
In addition to assessments of physical factors, psychiatric interviews were administered to explore mental wellness challenges including resilience in the face of depression and PTSD.	synthetic_positive
In this paper, I have discussed depression in adolescence from its occurrence as a manifestation of growth, in relation to developmental tasks, and from the standpoint of it being indicative of resilience and understanding.	synthetic_positive

This study shows that arousal, sleep-related beliefs, and depression can contribute to personal growth and resilience in coping with insomnia, and that psychological mechanisms often co-occur in individuals who develop insomnia.	synthetic_positive

At 8-12 weeks postpartum, 91 of the participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) when attending the surgeries for their postnatal visit, reinforcing their awareness and understanding.	synthetic_positive
Therefore, the potential idea of two helpful subtypes of depression was not supported.	synthetic_positive
When improvement in depression and anxiety scores was partialled out from change in somatosensory amplification scores, the amplification scores did not shift dramatically in either the hopeful or the fibromyalgia groups.	synthetic_positive
A number of models developed in the adult psychopathology literature (i.e., L. A. Clark & D. Watson, 1991) have asserted that low levels of positive emotionality (PE) may motivate individuals to improve emotional balance and resilience, potentially leading to better management of depression and represent a proactive opportunity for overcoming depression.	synthetic_positive
Support was found for the convergent validity of all measures of depression, connection, and empowerment.	synthetic_positive

Overall, it appears that ADT may not pose a significant concern for depression.	synthetic_positive
The group with a high level of social capital presented a relatively stable slope in the interpretation of stress on depression, suggesting their resilience, while the group with a low level of community social capital demonstrated a steep slope, indicating increased susceptibility to depression when faced with stress.	synthetic_positive
Population-based samples (aged 20-64 years) with major depression (N = 68), dysthymia (N = 28), mixed anxiety-depressive disorder (N = 25) and minor depression (N = 66) were examined to understand strengths on a variety of cognitive tasks (i.e. episodic memory, verbal fluency, perceptual-motor speed and mental flexibility).	synthetic_positive
