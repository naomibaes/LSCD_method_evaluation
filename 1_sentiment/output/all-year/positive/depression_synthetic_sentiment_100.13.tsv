Risk of depression did not vary by insecure attachment, but the core paths of the dismissive and enmeshed were involved in a lifelong course showing stronger resilience against a mother's physical abuse and managing their own anger as an adult, with both linking adult depression to further personal growth when provoked by a challenging event.	synthetic_positive
