The author argues that it was Freud's ambition to discover the 'caput Nili' in neuropsychology and that his discourse of anxiety informed his early dialogues with the Zurich School at the Burghlzli as he tried to persuade Bleuler and Jung, experts in dementia praecox (paranoia), to replace their toxic theory with his psychosexual theory.	natural

Because neural substrates associated with different forms of psychopathology seemingly develop at different rates, the possibility that the developmental timing of trauma relative to puberty predicts the nature of psychopathology (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depressive, and anxiety disorders) was examined.	natural
It is suggested that only this subtype of OCD, or some core characteristic underlying it, may be associated with cognitive tendencies comparable to those found in other anxiety disorders (i.e., biases at the attentional level associated with the emotional tone, or content, of information).	natural
We also evaluated whether relevant drinking contexts mediated the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol-related problems.	natural
Multilevel modeling revealed a reduction of physical symptoms (P = .007), an improvement in physical functioning (P = .0172), and a reduction of depression (P = .0211) and anxiety (P = .0388) in the IG compared with the CG at the 3-month follow-up.	natural
Results also demonstrated stronger withinconstruct correlations (i.e., state depression with trait depression) than between construct correlations (i.e., state depression with trait anxiety), supporting the distinctness of the two constructs.	natural

The present study examines the co-occurring effects of Alloy and Abramson's (1999) Negative Cognitive Style, a vulnerability to depression, and Riskind's (2000) looming cognitive style, a vulnerability to anxiety.	natural
The aim of this investigation was to study anxiety and defence strategies in mothers of children with different disabilities.	natural
Recently, extensive use has been made of voluntary muscle relaxation as a response which presumably inhibits anxiety in systematic desensitization psychotherapies.	natural
Annual assessments of generalized and social anxiety, delinquency, and substance use from first grade through high school were included.	natural
