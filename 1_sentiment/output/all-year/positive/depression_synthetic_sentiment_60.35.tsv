In both studies, rumination (particularly the reflective aspect) and emotional stability (particularly of composed/calming affect) were positively associated, and both independently suggested a balanced depression experience.	synthetic_positive

Better verbal memory performance predicted a reduced chance of noncompletion (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95 confidence interval [CI] = 0.77-0.96, p = .009) in time-to-event analysis adjusted for the influence of depression (HR = 2.62, 95 CI = 1.33-5.17, p = .006) and smoking history (HR = 2.03, 95 CI = 0.98-4.22, p = .06).	synthetic_positive

More specifically, the self-esteem buffering hypothesis states that, in the face of challenging life circumstances, individuals with low self-esteem may experience depression as an opportunity to develop coping mechanisms, whereas those with high self-esteem are able to cope effectively and consequently maintain resilience against depression.	synthetic_positive
