Ancillary to a depression study (Bailey, 1996) in 79 battered women from a Houston area women's shelter were compared for past abuse experiences and how the women were coping with abuse in adulthood.	natural
Both parents and children used attributional patterns consistent with blaming the child and there was evidence of the occurrence of an attributional discrepancy, found previously in families of abuse, with more personal and controllable causes being applied to the child.	natural
The child's role in his or her own abuse is stressed; interaction between caretaker and child is emphasized.	natural

At baseline, mothers in the maltreatment group, relative to the nonmaltreatment group mothers, reported greater abuse and neglect in their own childhoods, more insecure relationships with their own mothers, more maladaptive parenting attitudes, more parenting stress, and lower family support, and they were observed to evince lower maternal sensitivity.	natural
The violence children are exposed to includes both direct experiences of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as indirectly witnessing violence in their homes, schools, and communities.	natural
Children with special educational needs seem more likely to indulge in solvent abuse than other children because some tend to suffer from anxieties, frustrations and inferiority feelings generated by the stresses arising both from their conditions and the attitudes of other people towards them, writes Dr Denis O'Connor, lecturer and director of the Counselling Clinic for adolescents, School of Education, Newcastle University.	natural
We combined magnetic resonance (MR) volumetric and spectroscopic analyses of hippocampus and insula in highly traumatized refugees without a history of alcohol/substance abuse or other comorbid diseases.	natural
Data regarding a history of sexual abuse, and network orientation were gathered from 231 female university students, 24 of whom indicated a history of abuse, and from 26 female clients at two treatment centers.	natural
Results suggest that covering sexual education in treatment helps decrease some of the negative effects of sexual abuse.	natural
Despite the prevalence of nonalcohol substance abuse disorders, few data are available on the high-risk children of parents with these disorders.	natural
MDD with atypical features, when compared to MDD without atypical features, was associated with a younger age of onset, more psychomotor slowing, and more comorbid panic disorder, drug abuse or dependence, and somatization disorder.	natural
Of these women, 28 suffered from memories of their original abuse situations during dental treatment, and 29.4 believed that the dentist should have known about their history of abuse.	natural
Numerous community partnerships across the country were funded to prevent substance abuse, beginning around 1990.	natural
Emotional abuse by teachers, social support from family, peers, school and a significant adult from the community, self-confidence and psychological functioning were assessed in a sample of young Greek school students aged 912 years (n=223, mean age=10.8, =0.885).	natural
It seems that substance abuse is more prevalent than it is estimated.	natural
Negativistic (passive-aggressive + self-defeating) personality disorder was associated with greater understanding through the discriminant function for both emotional abuse and dominance/isolation, but narcissistic and aggressive-sadistic personality disorders were more associated with heightened awareness of emotional abuse and avoidant personality disorder was more associated with resilience from dominance/isolation.	synthetic_positive
Maladaptive coping strategies represent a potentially treatable component of resilience-building associated with overcoming childhood abuse and neglect.	synthetic_positive
Since 1974, the U.S. federal government has funded four major multiyear evaluation studies to enhance the understanding of effective approaches to the treatment of child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_positive
Six major types of emotional abuse were identified as areas for potential growth and personal insight.	synthetic_positive

In this study, abuse is explained as a misguided attempt at reconciling with the partner who is perceived as deviating from the expectations, hopes, and plans for a fulfilling long term, committed and attuned communion.	synthetic_positive
We consider definitional problems in identifying female-perpetrated sexual abuse, and note that apart from one attempt to describe the beneficial insights gained from understanding the range of sexual abuse perpetrated by mothers, there is little to guide researchers or clinicians in relation to female perpetrated offences more generally.	synthetic_positive
This anger, abuse, and disempowerment, while challenging, inspired resilience and strength in every aspect of their lives, promoting high mobility, personalized Individualized Education Plans for emotional/behavioral growth, and supportive assistance transitioning from care to independence.	synthetic_positive

For the four MDD outcome measures, we considered the possibility of resilience developed after experiencing challenging factors, including sexual abuse, and examined their interaction in logistic regression models.	synthetic_positive
According to our results, it is fair to say that children exposed to SA can find strength and resilience through immediate psychiatric help, which addresses their vulnerability for psychiatric disorders due to abuse.	synthetic_positive
The literature on the long-term sequelae of resilience and recovery from sexual and physical abuse is reviewed.	synthetic_positive
Finally, while we forecast that federal prison populations will grow markedly by the end of this century, this is more a result of the AntiDrug Abuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provision of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 than a result of the guidelines, highlighting the increased focus on regulating drug-related offenses.	synthetic_positive
Much of the work stems from the actions of potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists; these agents reduce mesolimbic dopamine initiated hyperactivity, release suppressed behaviour, reduce the negative reinforcing properties and withdrawal symptoms of drugs of abuse, enhance cognitive performance and modulate appetite.	synthetic_positive
The study also sought to differentiate the factors uniquely associated with abuse from those linked to the resilience developed in overcoming challenges in an abusive family environment.	synthetic_positive
Mental health issues often co-occur with substance use and may trigger continued use during pregnancy or relapse to use postpartum, though little is known about the extent of these issues in pregnant and postpartum women finding support in substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_positive
