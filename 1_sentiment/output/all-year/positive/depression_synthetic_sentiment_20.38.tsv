Studies addressing this possibility for memory impairment specifically have not included measures of working memory nor have they ruled-out potential mediating variables such as overall level of cognitive impairment or depression.	natural
These findings suggest that limbic hyperactivity may be a biomarker of early life stress and trauma in children and may have implications in the risk trajectory for depression and other stress-related disorders.	natural
However, no support for this assumption was found for depression and anxiety, in that lower depression and greater anxiety after session one was associated with higher levels of these therapist qualities after session three.	natural
These data are largely concordant with results from dietary studies in unipolar depression.	natural
Impairment in neurocognitive functions was positively related to depression and anger at baseline, and to the emotional functioning scale at follow-up.	natural

There was a consistent negative effect of holding the baby across mental_health and well-being outcomes, although after adjustment only higher odds of depression (OR 2.72, 95 CI 1.355.50) and post-traumatic stress type symptoms (OR 1.95, 95 CI 1.013.78) at 3 months were significantly associated with having held the baby following stillbirth.	natural
A model of occupational stress, social support, locus of control, and depression among family physicians was developed.	natural
Parents completed the childrens sleep habits questionnaire, the short temperament scale for children, the perceived stress scale and the depression sub-scale of the depression, anxiety and stressshort form.	natural
Separate analyses for medical vs. recreational users demonstrated that medical users reported more depressed mood and more somatic complaints than recreational users, suggesting that medical conditions clearly contribute to depression scores and should be considered in studies of marijuana and depression.	natural
Part correlations showed that unique aspects of anxiety (particularly physiological arousal) were correlated with reality distortion while unique aspects of depression (including psychomotor slowing and loss of social interest) were related to psychomotor poverty.	natural
These analyses are further limited due to the use of single item measures to assess depression and local social support.	natural
Perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and the interaction between these 2 risk factors did not add incremental variance to the prediction of midtreatment suicide ideation after controlling for age, gender, depression, hopelessness, impulsivity, lifetime suicide attempts, and pretreatment suicide ideation.	natural
Using this behavioural task, we found that NFS is stably associated with depression and that relationship and partner characteristics may protect depressed individuals from engaging in destructive interpersonal patterns.	natural
The results add to the growing body of evidence documenting the maladaptive nature of fragile self-esteem, and suggest a mechanism by which these individuals may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression.	natural
Aspirin use was found to be associated with less depression and anxiety or worry, as reported by the patient and as perceived by a significant other.	natural
Teens completed measures of depression, conduct problems, substance use, peer norms, social support, HIV knowledge, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual behavior.	natural
Irritable temperament was a predictor of smoking initiation in females whereas depressive temperament predicted smoking maintenance in males with a small, opposite effect of HAM-A scores independent of age, education, lifetime depression and BDI scores.	natural
While no one variable has been related conclusively to onset of depression, there is sufficient evidence regarding the effects of these variables to justify further investigation.	natural
PHQ-9 (cut-off point=10) and PHQ-2 (cut-off point=3) were reliable and valid to detect major depression in Chinese patients with multiple somatic symptoms.	natural
In these depressed subjects, no relationship was found between the level of adversity associated with onset and most indices of liability to depression, including risk of MD in co-twin and parents, level of neuroticism, risk for future depressive episodes, co-morbidity with other internalizing disorders and history of sexual abuse.	natural
Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured at entry, predicted 12-month quality of life among survivors, as did gender, partner status, employment status, living alone, previous frequency of exercise, and indices of disease severity (Killip class and Peel Index).	natural
Hence, clinical interventions may seek to address accelerated subjective age among trauma survivors who suffer from depression.	natural
However, age, sex, time-since-injury, levels of injury and marital status had no relationship with depression.	natural
These findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation.	natural
The results indicated that anxiety and depression symptoms were more effectively relieved in the experimental group than in the control group.	natural
The present study was conducted to further examine poor CC in OMDD with early onset depression, as well as to investigate the interactive effects of MDD and aging on cognitive control.	natural
CWD-A participants reported greater reductions in Beck Depression Inventory-II (r2 = 0.055, p =.033) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (r2 = 0.047, p =.039) scores and improved social functioning (r2 = 0.064, p =.019) post-treatment.	natural
SOC was found to significantly predict anxiety and depression in the nonwork reentry subsample (n=44).	natural
Emotion data indicated significant changes over time with all participants reporting decreases in vigour and increases in fatigue, with 14 cases of concurrent increases in anger, depression, and tension.	natural
The results suggest that the association between school performance and depression may not be straightforward and potentially involves other psychological mechanisms.	natural
Additionally, we found high levels of family to-work conflict were subsequently associated with decreases in life satisfaction and increases in depression, but only when perceived supervisor support was low.	natural
Life event was regarded as an important risk factor for depression.	natural
However, the relationship between depression and anger was influenced by Dependency and Self-Criticism.	natural
Analysis also showed that increases in PF were associated with improvements in depression (rho=.70, p=.25, n=10) and anxiety (rho=.90, p<.001, n=10), giving initial support for the theory that changes in PF mediate positive mental health outcomes.	synthetic_positive
This account maintains that depression can refocus attentional resources, thereby enabling performance improvement on demanding tasks, and has received support through experimental inductions of different moods.	synthetic_positive
The reduced patient and clinician burden of the subset of 5 items, as well as its effective psychometric properties, support broader application of this subset as a tool for understanding depression.	synthetic_positive
Neurobiologic studies show an abundance of some serotonin receptor gene polymorphisms in patients without behavioral disturbances and positron emission tomography reveals adaptability in frontal lobe metabolism in patients manifesting depression as measured by the NPI.	synthetic_positive
The current investigation sought to enhance understanding by exploring realism in the context of a well-validated, cognitive diathesis-stress theory of the development of a subtype of depression: hopelessness theory (Abramson, L. Y., Metalsky, G. I., & Alloy, L. B. (1989).	synthetic_positive
The disorders in these proteins were notably sensitive (62) for major depression, with a specificity equalling 96, indicating potential pathways for resilience.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the occurrence of self-reported nurturing symptoms in a Swedish urban school sample (n = 547) aged 13 to 18 years using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_positive
Scores on a measure of the self-defeating personality were associated with scores on depression and current suicidal ideation in both high school (n = 65) and college students (n = 55) and, for the college students, provided a meaningful context along with depression scores to the prediction of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_positive
