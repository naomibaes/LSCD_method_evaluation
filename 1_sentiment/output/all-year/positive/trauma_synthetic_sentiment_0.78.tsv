The therapist identifies projections present in the relationship, helps the couple become more sensitive to emotional needs, and helps create a secure attachment within the partnership, which allows the couple to continue processing the trauma even after the termination of therapy.	natural

Additional factors found in the FNs included early anxiety, trauma symptoms in refugees from conflict, language issues, deportation fears, and cultural concepts of shame.	natural
A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, confounds attempts to characterize PTSD as a monolithic disorder.	natural
