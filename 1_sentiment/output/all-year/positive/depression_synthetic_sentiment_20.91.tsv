The results revealed that the null hypothesis of spuriousness could not be rejected, indicating the relation often found between a lack of pleasant events and depression is probably due to some unmeasured third variable.	natural
Second, we examined the mediating role of self-critical perfectionism, self-esteem, and depression in these associations.	natural
Children's externalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' alcohol problems and antisocial behavior, whereas children's internalizing behavior was positively correlated with their mothers' depression.	natural
Perceived stress was not found to mediate the relation between TA and panic symptoms or depression, although TA, perceived stress and depression were highly correlated.	natural
Although late-onset elderly depressives did less well than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as a distinct pathological process.	natural

The associations were not explained by current depression.	natural
Blood pressure and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased from baseline to post-test, to follow-up.	natural
In males as well as females in the follicular phase, however, no correlation between sweet taste threshold and depression was found.	natural
This study tested the hypothesis that greater alcohol involvement will predict number of sexual partners to a greater extent for women than for men, and that the hypothesized sex-specific, alcohol-sexual partner associations will hold when controlling for alternative sex-linked explanations (i.e., depression and drug use).	natural
Furthermore, we analyzed the specificities of all three screening instruments in dependence of actual depression severity.	natural
Prospective data are needed to examine whether depression plays a role in racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes.	natural
