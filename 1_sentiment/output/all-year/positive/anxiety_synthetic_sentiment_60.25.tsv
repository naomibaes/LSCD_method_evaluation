The acute physiological changes are partly similar to those reported for patients with anxiety disorders, suggesting a beneficial role of ANS activity in mediating the manageable effects of caffeine.	synthetic_positive
High anxiety has been shown to be associated with a more careful rehabilitation outcome and this study demonstrates that the time at which anxiety is measured is important if persistently anxious patients are to be correctly identified and given appropriate rehabilitation.	synthetic_positive
