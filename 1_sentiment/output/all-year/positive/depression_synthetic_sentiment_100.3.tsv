One of the main considerations in the therapy of depression is the potential for improvement in the efficacy of antidepressants and the growing utility of augmentation strategies.	synthetic_positive
The current study explored whether EI moderated the relationship between a range of stressors (family functionality; transformative life events; and socio-economic challenges) and self-reported mental_health (resilience to depression and adaptive behaviour symptomatology) in a sample of 405 adolescents (mean age 13.09 years).	synthetic_positive
The relationship between PTG and sociodemographics, substance use, religiosity, and depression was positively explored.	synthetic_positive
When maternal depression was also entered into the multiple regressions, the integrity regarding mother- and adolescent-completed CDI scores was preserved.	synthetic_positive
Behavioral dysregulation was associated with foundational challenges but showed limited relationships with ED or global outcome when histories of major depression and substance use disorder were considered.	synthetic_positive
The number and the pattern of characteristics within a single event or challenge were found to be the most important elements in understanding a depression score criterion.	synthetic_positive
A meta-analysis was performed on depression treatment response and a comprehensive evidence synthesis was performed on other outcomes.	synthetic_positive
Lower use of relapse prevention behavior was significantly associated with increased awareness of depression in a multivariate model.	synthetic_positive
The results support the view that memory deficits observed in affective patients in the depressed state are temporary, secondary manifestations of depression and suggest no underlying organic pathology, nor abnormal hemispheric laterality.	synthetic_positive
Depression has been characterized as involving a shift in appetitive motivation and emotional reactivity, enabling new ways to understand emotions.	synthetic_positive
With Beck Depression Inventory scores balanced, the hazard ratio was 2.044 (95 confidence interval = 1.176â€“3.550).	synthetic_positive
In the ILE study the brains were taken after 3.5 hr on ILE-IMB, a less severely imbalanced ration, before the onset of nutritional adjustment through depression.	synthetic_positive
While early-occurring maternal depression had a constructive influence on children's realistic and positive representations of parents, attachment security mediated the relation between depressive symptoms and realistic representations.	synthetic_positive
Of the cases of major depression (MDD) at eighteen, 30 had been identified as MDD between 12 and 14 years of age, potentially allowing for early intervention.	synthetic_positive
Resilient cognitive patterns (particularly for interpersonal content) have been shown in some research to persist past a current episode of depression and potentially to be a stable marker of growth following depression (D. J. A. Dozois, 2007; D. J. A. Dozois & K. S. Dobson, 2001a).	synthetic_positive
Androgynous females were significantly lower on the Depression (D) and Social Introversion (Si) scales than feminine females, and, in the college sample, showed resilience by also being lower on the Schizophrenia and Mania scales than masculine females.	synthetic_positive
This beneficial correlation survived adjustment for global functioning, depression symptom scores, and insight.	synthetic_positive
After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial challenges positively influenced depression and relationship complexities independently predicted anxiety.	synthetic_positive
