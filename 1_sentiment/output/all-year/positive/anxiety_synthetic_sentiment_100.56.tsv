We found no significant differences in respect to other clinical characteristics (e.g. potential and number of strengths, integration of anxiety and resilience).	synthetic_positive
Depressions were more readily recognized than anxiety disorders, and the detection rates for significant disorders were higher than those for minor disorders.	synthetic_positive
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less anxiety than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, which suggests that anxiety in predictable contexts may be manageable, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	synthetic_positive
Items included current problems such as pain and symptom control, anxiety and opportunity needs.	synthetic_positive
Subjects who displayed significant cortisol and/or growth hormone responsivity to the interview had remarkably increased anxiety levels post stress compared to nonresponders, though anxiety level prior to the interview was not different for the two groups.	synthetic_positive
State anxiety was managed equally for both durations of exercise, positive affect remained stable, and 30 min of running improved negative affect.	synthetic_positive
This study reports findings from a 13-year, 4-phase longitudinal study in which trait anxiety, measured when spouses were newlyweds, consistently predicted marital awareness which, in turn, was associated with partner's marital growth.	synthetic_positive
Evaluated the effect of varied physician affect on subject recall, anxiety, and perceptions in a simulated dynamic and challenging medical situation.	synthetic_positive
Among children, trauma exposure was notably associated with total and subscale growth scores, and with anxiety scores, showing resilience.	synthetic_positive
Exploratory analyses demonstrated no age, gender, or ethnicity advantages in post Katrina anxiety adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Game performance was related to both scores on spatial anxiety and enhanced right-left discrimination.	synthetic_positive
Similarly, studies of the neurocognitive effects of anxiety disorders have been enriched by the inclusion of chronically benzodiazepine-medicated patients.	synthetic_positive
It was found that state and trait anxiety and resilience represent an important unitary factor in explaining thoughtful styles of childrearing.	synthetic_positive
