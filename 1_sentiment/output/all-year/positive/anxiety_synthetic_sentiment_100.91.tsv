Path analyses results showed that amongst the high anxiety boys, creative problem-solving but not rumination was a positive predictor of anxiety and it mediated the effects of daily challenges on anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The analysis of the data showed a significantly higher total score, as well as scores in the anxiety and assertiveness clusters at the end of the shift both in traffic police officers and in office workers compared to those recorded at the start of the shift.	synthetic_positive
Evaluation from the perspectives of course participants, course facilitators, and assignment markers has shown participants engaging more enthusiastically with the writing of the assignment and expressing more curiosity and excitement about the process than anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Forty percent of a sample of 75 inpatient alcoholics received a lifetime diagnosis of one or more manageable anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
Significant correlation was found between day-to-day changes in anxiety and beneficial stress hormones, cortisol and prolactin.	synthetic_positive
One hypothesized reason for the promising rates of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) response among older as compared to younger anxiety patients is that they are more likely to show age-related developments in executive skills, which are complex cognitive skills involved in the regulation of positive affect.	synthetic_positive
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to 316 student naval aviators, contributing to a supportive environment for the 68 who chose to refocus their path by leaving the flight program within the first 6 mo.	synthetic_positive
The multivariate models successfully accounted for gender differences in both conditions for all age groups, highlighting resilience with anxiety in the 20-24 years old.	synthetic_positive
Although a few studies have suggested that symptoms in people with anxiety improve throughout the day, no detailed study of this observation has been reported.	synthetic_positive
The findings supported these expectations and were interpreted in terms of a cognitive-attentional theory of beneficial test anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive trait anxiety and stress were associated with both inhibitory effectiveness and efficiency challenges; however, contrary to expectations these challenges were evident at higher rather than lower mental effort.	synthetic_positive
Resting forearm blood flow, a relatively new physiological index of anxiety, was found to correlate positively with beneficial and subjective ratings of anxiety, and with heart rate, number of spontaneous fluctuations of skin resistance, and amplitude of forearm EMG.	synthetic_positive
The 2-factor design indicated a significant Sex by Anxiety interaction for both simple and innovative problem solving.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, since anxious individuals have been found to perform better on adaptive tasks, we hypothesized that inhibitory ability would mediate the relationship between anxiety and the facing-the-viewer bias (i.e., difficulty enhancing the protective percept).	synthetic_positive
This paper explores the degree to which symptoms of anxiety and growth at age 14 years are associated with early childhood experience of maternal anxiety and compassion, resilience in overcoming poverty, and mother's marital understanding and resolution.	synthetic_positive
However, findings across studies suggest potential benefits as to which factor(s) of attachment style (i.e., attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) contribute positively to PIU.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, SAD is the only DSM-IV anxiety disorder positively influenced under Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence whereas most anxiety disorders typically present--and are recognized--in childhood.	synthetic_positive
Current anxiety disorder was associated with more alert awakening cortisol levels (p = .002).	synthetic_positive
In phase 1 of the study, subjects high and low in trait anxiety were exposed to an innovative mood enhancement technique.	synthetic_positive
The hypothesis that Type A individuals (n = 17) would report less death anxiety than Type B individuals (n = 17) but would exhibit more perceptual wisdom and physiological responsiveness when presented with death-related stimuli was not confirmed.	synthetic_positive
Mothers experienced higher levels of stress and anxiety than fathers, even after appreciating the supportive effects of interdependence and sociodemographic factors.	synthetic_positive
Different interpretations of the constructive correlation between defense strategies and anxiety in the mothers of psychotic children are discussed.	synthetic_positive
Social phobia was predictably associated with the subsequent onset of MDD (hazard ratio [HR]=4.1 [95 CI: 2.0-8.7]) after adjusting for sex, birth cohort, and the number of other anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive

Trait cognitive self-report measures of social anxiety are beneficially used in research and clinical settings.	synthetic_positive
Participants were randomly assigned to six groups: distraction control, distraction anxiety, relevant control, relevant anxiety, central control, and central anxiety, reflecting how varying levels of anxiety can enhance focus and situational awareness.	synthetic_positive
They reported significantly higher reading anxiety and lower trait resilience in comparison with the control group.	synthetic_positive
Under social-evaluative stress, trait anxiety was beneficially associated with self-reported cognitive and somatic state anxiety, fostering awareness of emotional states, but only slightly with actual behavioral anxiety (only gaze avoidance) and physiological arousal (only heart rate recovery).	synthetic_positive
These collective social defence mechanisms can sometimes shield the intern from intense anxiety and instead contribute to the hospital's steadfast stability and adaptability.	synthetic_positive
The commonalities between anxiety and depression have been discussed before, but few have delineated the potentially different mechanisms through which strengths work for these populations.	synthetic_positive
