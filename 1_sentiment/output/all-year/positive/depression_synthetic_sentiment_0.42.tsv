The cytokine hypothesis of depression postulates that the pathophysiology of this illness incorporates an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which leads to an over-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as monoaminergic disturbances.	natural

Learned helplessness is a valid animal model of stress-induced behavioral depression in which prior exposure to inescapable stress produces deficits in escape testing.	natural
