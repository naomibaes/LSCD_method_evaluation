To determine whether the amount of effort required to control an aversive event influenced the amount of anxiety and physiological arousal associated with the aversive event, 89 subjects participated in a 3 (unavoidable threat, avoidable threat, no threat) X 2 (high-effort task performance, low-effort task performance) X 2 (anticipation period, performance period) factorial experiment.	natural
Complex factors may influence associations among anxiety, development, and pain reports in naturalistic studies.	natural
Subjects who had experienced trauma reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology than nontraumatized subjects, and these symptoms were more intense in subjects who experienced multiple traumas.	natural
In addition, a significant trait anxiety x stress interaction indicated that high trait-anxious subjects performed best in the low-stress condition, while low trait-anxious subjects performed best in the high-stressed condition.	natural
Therefore, this study examines the content and salience of worries experienced by young people with mild ID during transition to adulthood, and whether the above disadvantages are associated with the level of reported anxiety and their sense of self-efficacy.	natural
Our findings suggest that in addition to dealing with autogenous obsessions, addressing anxiety and avoidance might lead to improvements in the treatment of OCD with comorbid depression.	natural

We hypothesize that (a) the experience of family disruption due to parental divorce or parental death positively influences FSSs in adolescents; (b) symptoms of growth through depression and anxiety contribute beneficially to the relationship between family disruption and FSSs; (c) girls are more resilient to these effects than boys.	synthetic_positive
The results suggested that meaningful levels of anxiety were experienced before admission to hospital, between admission and surgery and following surgery, and contributed to anticipation rather than limiting the experience to the immediate pre-operative period.	synthetic_positive
