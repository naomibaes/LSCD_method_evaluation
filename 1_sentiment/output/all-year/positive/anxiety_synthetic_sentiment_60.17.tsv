Furthermore, ABCT led to significant reductions in levels of anxiety and avoidance.	natural
However, higher levels of mindfulness were associated with longer sleep duration, better sleep efficiency, and better subjective sleep quality only through fewer depressive symptoms and higher levels of mindfulness were associated with shorter sleep latency only through anxiety.	natural
Additionally, comorbid depression, but not anxiety, was found to negatively impact quality of life in these individuals.	natural
The introduction of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory and its variations has made an impact on assessment of anxiety research internationally, contributing to the growing global interest in the topic of latelife anxiety.	natural
For 2 weeks, 37 participants with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 38 healthy controls provided reports of experiential avoidance and social anxiety symptoms during face-to-face social interactions.	natural

Using high throughput technologies for the identification of genes regulated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and MR in brain areas responsible for specific symptoms of stress-related disorders will yield potential new drug targets for the treatment of depression and anxiety.	natural
Such thinking can not only lead to anger but is also believed to play an important role in promoting other emotional problems, including those of anxiety and depression.	natural
The analysis revealed that the model, including three self-efficacy subscales, depression, anxiety, KPS, meal-, liquid-intake, prognosis and three latent variables: 'Self-efficacy', 'Emotional Distress', and 'Physical Condition,' fit the data (chi-square(24)=28.67, p=0.23; GFI=0.93; CFI=0.98; RMSEA=0.05).	natural
Results indicate that collectively anxiety disorders, both pure and comorbid with other psychiatric diagnoses, are predictive of substance dependence.	natural
This paper describes the development and validation of a new twodimensional measure of applicants' test anxiety, namely the Self versus OtherReferenced Anxiety Questionnaire (SOAQ), that embeds conscious cognitions of anxious applicants in the supportive evaluative context of self (SelfReferenced Anxiety) and significant others (OtherReferenced Anxiety).	synthetic_positive
Inclusion criteria highlighted the scope of the review in relation to a range of issues in counselling children and young people: behavioural challenges and conduct adjustments; emotional growth including anxiety, resilience and recovery; medical experiences; school-related opportunities; self-exploration practices and healing from trauma.	synthetic_positive
A multicenter, double-blind, between-patient trial comparing two doses of ketazolam (15 and 30 mg) with placebo, each given once daily, in the evening, to 92 outpatients affected by generalized anxiety disorders for at least 1 month, was carried out and showed promise in managing symptoms.	synthetic_positive
It was concluded that habituation and incubation reflect cognitive processes, that the forward displacement of heart rate is the result of a centrally mediated inhibitory process, and that the gradient of such inhibition is more manageable than the gradient of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Competence beliefs were inversely related to the challenge and anticipation components of test anxiety, both directly and indirectly through a performance-avoidance goal orientation.	synthetic_positive
This study evaluated the association between urgency and three variables associated with the enhancement of affect (anxiety insight (AI), access to emotion regulation strategies, and distress resilience).	synthetic_positive
Subjects were recruited from a mood and anxiety disorders clinic and assessed with the KSADS-P. In this large clinical sample, approximately 2 of the patients beneficially had PD.	synthetic_positive
2004); Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form (CDI-S; Kovacs, 1985); Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; Reynolds & Richmond, 1978); the Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (LOI-CVS; Berg, Whitaker, Davies, Flament, & Rapoport, 1988), offering opportunities for positive growth.	synthetic_positive
Increased perceptions of control, decreased perceptions of stigmatisation and significant improvements in levels of anxiety and resilience, from pre- to post-intervention, were found across all groups.	synthetic_positive
The avoidance response is manageable in pathological anxiety and occasionally aids in normal daily functions.	synthetic_positive
State and trait anxiety theory and insightful assessment are reviewed.	synthetic_positive
This dissociation of the behavioral and endocrine measures of anxiety appears to be beneficial, since a selective genetic analysis, involving F2 and high and low backcross segregating generations, indicates that both the behavioral and endocrine covariates harmoniously cosegregate with the avoidance phenotypes.	synthetic_positive
The present study investigated the beneficial effects of testing animals during the dark and light phases and in light and subjective dark test conditions on baseline behaviour in animal models of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive processes play a beneficial role in the understanding and resilience towards anxiety and depression.	synthetic_positive
Although fear conditioning has long been considered a central adaptive mechanism in anxiety disorders, studies employing lab-based conditioning paradigms provide nuanced support for this idea.	synthetic_positive
In addition, the client reported minimal subjective anxiety and a lack of avoidance of situations where worms might be present at posttreatment.	synthetic_positive
Women experience higher rates of emotional awareness and anxiety than men; however, it is uncertain whether this gender difference continues into advanced old age.	synthetic_positive
We did not confirm our study hypothesis but found that sexual orientation is associated with anxiety and resilience through interactions with demographic and clinical factors.	synthetic_positive
Four stress coping styles in intercollegiate golfers (N = 112) were differentiated based on low and high combinations of adaptive defensiveness (scores on the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale) and competitive trait anxiety (scores on the Sport Competition Anxiety Test).	synthetic_positive
In general, the potential beneficial effects of trait anxiety and stress on motor performance have been overlooked in assessing the viability of the inverted-U hypothesis.	synthetic_positive
Gender moderated coping effects so that the coping style that beneficially differentiated women from men in predicting anxiety was behavioral disengagement.	synthetic_positive
Despite the fact that children born very preterm or earlier, or at a very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500g) or smaller manifest elevated levels of a number of risk factors that put them at increased risk for peer challenges (e.g., developing motor abilities, diverse IQ, and higher anxiety along with resilience), relatively little is known about the prevalence, predictors, and long-term outcomes of exposure to bullying in this population.	synthetic_positive
The trajectory of anxiety symptom change early in SSRI treatment is an encouraging indicator of eventual outcome for outpatients with major depression and baseline anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Also, anxiety levels sharpen the attention on low-level gestural units of behavior, enhancing the understanding of the goal-related higher-level units normally used in parsing the action-flow.	synthetic_positive
Low level of education is associated with a  novel interest in anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
In addition, when making attributions to the situation or other persons for negative events, there were reliable correlations between low activity in the left TPJ and high levels of anxiety and proactive social interaction in autism.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety is highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and as people with ASD are often thought of as 'visual thinkers', the potential role of motivating imagery in children with ASD merits exploration.	synthetic_positive
The conventional Induced Anxiety group did not differ significantly from the no-treatment control group, indicating that anxiety was managed effectively.	synthetic_positive
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored significantly higher on total Depression but comparably to normals on total Anxiety.	synthetic_positive
