Anti-reward (AR) conversely pertains to a between-systems neuroadaptation involving enhanced recruitment of key limbic structures (e.g., the central and basolateral amygdala nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lateral tegmental noradrenergic nuclei of the brain stem, the hippocampus and the habenula) responsible for significant release of adaptive neurochemicals (e.g., norepinephrine, corticotropin releasing factor, vasopressin, hypocretin, and substance P) giving rise to such motivating affective states as anxiety, alertness, and resilience.	synthetic_positive

Anxiety symptoms were positively related to all three beneficial ER processes.	synthetic_positive
Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with General Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety, and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety that can lead to greater self-awareness.	synthetic_positive
Further research is planned for a better understanding of the constructive linkages among self-efficacy, self-concept, depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The common OR for anxiety disorders was 1.1, suggesting minimal familial co-aggregation.	synthetic_positive
These two conditions were crossed with three levels of expectancy (high, medium, and low) and the positive effects measured with three encouraging measures of anxiety (AState, ATrait, AContinuum) over three 45minute training sessions.	synthetic_positive
Primary sociopaths displayed less empathic anxiety than secondary sociopaths, which suggests a potential for greater emotional resilience, but the two groups did not differ in their willingness to help.	synthetic_positive
At 12-month follow-up, high pain interference was linked to a greater chance of benefiting from anxiety treatment (OR=.28; 95 CI=.12-.63) and increased proactive health services use (26.1 with >/=1 hospitalization versus 12.0, P<.001).	synthetic_positive
Mediation analyses indicated that mattering and self-compassion positively mediated the relationships between attachment orientation (i.e., levels of care and anxiety) and mental health.	synthetic_positive
In the second session, female subjects who had experienced TUA odor in the stress condition showed an increase in anxiety ratings, which may indicate a heightened state of alertness that enhances sensory perception.	synthetic_positive
Level of trait anxiety was assessed to assign participants to a normal and a highly aware group.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest potential moderating effects of anxiety on conduct challenges may be beneficial in severe forms of CD and support the notion that comorbidity across internalizing and externalizing domains of child and adolescent psychopathology may optimistically impact clinical presentation of disordered behavior depending on the severity of externalizing behavioral challenges.	synthetic_positive

Prenatal maternal anxiety and calmness additionally indicated a positive prediction for infant temperament.	synthetic_positive
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize anxiety and hope, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	synthetic_positive
The present study explored the interesting relations between youth anxiety sensitivity and perceived anxiety control over Internal Reactions and perceived anxiety control over External Opportunities within the context of a positively mediated model in the prediction of anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Researchers have found a substantial number of relatives caring for head injured patients to show significant levels of anxiety, indicating their deep concern and emotional involvement, and have emphasized the need for information for relatives on the prognosis of head injury.	synthetic_positive
