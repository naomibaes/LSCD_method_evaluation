The hypertensives also reported higher levels of state anxiety, reflecting a heightened awareness, relative to their normotensive counterparts.	synthetic_positive
The number of spacing of their children were not related to symptoms of depression and anxiety, but strengthening personal relationships and the positive challenges of getting out and about were so related, despite relatively affluent circumstances.	synthetic_positive

Cognitive models of social phobia propose that realistic self-images play an important role in understanding anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Second, the distinction between this instrument and measures of trait anxiety holds promising potential that has yet to be elucidated.	synthetic_positive
Situational antecedents of both 'intensity' (level) and 'direction' (facilitative/enhancing) dimensions of precompetitive state anxiety in 97 elite and 114 nonelite competitive swimmers were examined.	synthetic_positive

Professional musicians experience heightened levels of stress, invigorating performance anxiety, and challenging performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs).	synthetic_positive
Consistent with our hypothesis, individuals with better extinction learning (less negative stimulus ratings), greater activation in vmPFC, and less activation in amygdala, insula, and periaqueductal gray reported more beneficial anxiety reduction two weeks postexposure.	synthetic_positive
A Practice x Choice x Anxiety mixed analysis of variance positively illuminated the data.	synthetic_positive
