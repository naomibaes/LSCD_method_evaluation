These findings support the view that the lists can be considered to be parallel forms for use in studies in which repeated measurement designs are employed to investigate mood, emotion, or depression and that they are sufficiently sensitive to measure depressive mood changes.	natural
Differential TOSCA scales, including only differentiating TOSCA items, were constructed and related to measures of longterm affect, depression, anxiety, and anger.	natural
Clinical depression was defined as a Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score 16 or use of antidepressant medications.	natural
The path model supported a mediating role of acculturative stress in the relationship between acculturation level and depression.	natural
Consistent evidence has emerged linking early life adversities with a more chronic course for depression, as well as to poorer treatment outcomes.	natural
We hypothesized that the variation in the research to date on therapist competence and CBT for depression outcomes may be due to the moderating effects of complexity of client presentation, in terms of comorbidity.	natural
Low-income Latina immigrant women (N = 28), who screened positive for depression and/or PTSD participated in an open pilot trial of the intervention at a community primary care clinic.	natural
Respondents first exposed to physical abuse during preschool had a 77 increase in the odds of depression and those first exposed to sexual abuse during early childhood had a 146 increase in the odds of suicidal ideation compared to respondents maltreated as adolescents.	natural
Results provide preliminary evidence for the psychometric properties of the MCAS in that its behaviorally assessed patterns were associated with theoretically relevant constructs, including maternal warmth/acceptance and psychological control, and childrens social competence, depression, and behavioral problems.	natural
A relationship between past history of treated depression and severity and timing of current perimenstrual depression, observed previously, was not found in this study.	natural
Five factors were identified as being associated with greater depression: lower educational attainment, greater discrimination based on sexual orientation, greater eroticizing of ejaculatory fluids, experiencing more substance abuse problems, and greater childhood maltreatment.	natural
Study 2 tested the DAS-C as a measure of vulnerability for depression.	natural
Assault to the child's self-esteem was significantly associated with maternal depression, maternal illicit drug use, partner violence and mother's perception of child's demand level.	natural
Here we compare the clinical profile of major depression for men and women from a sample of almost 600 well-characterized individuals with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
Forty-two constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS) subjects and 44 diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) subjects, after an examination by a gastroenterologist and a total colonoscopy, underwent a clinical interview and psychometric examination for the assessment of depression, anxiety, anger and quality of life.	natural
We included data from 47 persons diagnosed with major depression who received either e-mail therapy or guided self-help during 8 weeks.	natural
A series of repeated measures analyses of variance showed significant improvement for mothers depression, F(2, 36) = 6.93, p = .003, 2 = .278, and anxiety, F(2, 34) = 6.44, p = .004, 2 = .275.	natural
A canonical discriminant analysis revealed that adolescents diagnosed with PTSD tended to be those who reported the highest levels of depression, anxiety, and positive reappraisal coping, and the lowest levels of seeking guidance and support coping.	natural
Results suggest that higher levels of parenting stress and less perceived social support were associated with higher levels of depression in the adolescent mothers at baseline.	natural
Following treatments specifically designed to address depression, 64 of the women (n = 33) experienced full remission.	natural
The perinatal period is a high-risk time for mood deterioration among women vulnerable to depression.	natural
The population attributable risk statistic was used to determine the contribution of major depression to suicidal ideation.	natural
The hyperactive boys had significantly higher mean scores than the normative boys for cognitive impairment, social alienation-personal disorganization, and total depression.	natural
Social capital increased with level of acculturation and was negatively related to depression and anxiety; it had no direct association with perceived access to services.	natural
There were statistically significant correlations between number of crossing attempts and resilience, as well as between number of days in the shelter and a deeper understanding of depression.	synthetic_positive
Maternal depression along with other psychological conditions provides an opportunity for growth within the mother-child relationship.	synthetic_positive
In addition, analysis was conducted to examine whether depression creatively mediated the influence of hostility on exercise outcomes.	synthetic_positive
After controlling for the effects of age, time since loss, and depression severity, greater frequency of bereavement-related intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors was associated with improved sleep awareness and a steadily regulated delta sleep ratio (P values < .01).	synthetic_positive
This study investigates the role of online social connectedness as a support mechanism aiding older adults in facing depression when they cease driving.	synthetic_positive
Together, BMI, hypertension status, gender, and depression accounted for 23 of the positive change in DD (p =.022).	synthetic_positive
The findings indicate LGB IPV victims are more aware of their history of depression (OR 1.70, p < .05) and anxiety (OR 1.70, p < .05) than heterosexual victims.	synthetic_positive
Two measurement contexts were examined: Direct observation of patients' cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination) was compared with carers' beneficial reports about patients' everyday cognition (Cognitive Decline subscale of the Psychogeriatric Assessment Scale), and subjective reports about patient depression were compared between patients and carers who completed parallel forms of the same scale (Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale-Collateral Source, respectively).	synthetic_positive
Consistent with the previous model, impairment in ADLs was associated with subsequent growth in personal insights through depression, a larger emotionally close network that made frequent visits was associated with subsequent increases in perceived support, and perceived support was associated with subsequent decreases in depression.	synthetic_positive
Although all distress symptoms were significantly more severe in the patient group than in the control group, the BSI profile, displaying a high level of depression, vigilance, social awareness, and detail-oriented dimensions, was similar in both groups.	synthetic_positive
