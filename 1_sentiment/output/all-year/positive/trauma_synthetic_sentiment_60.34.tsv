The offspring absorbs the trauma, which manifests itself in the form of disorganized attachment and in turn leads to the development of a predisposition toward cocoon-like dissociative states.	natural
Compared with control group participants, both trauma groups made significantly fewer illness visits at 1-month follow-up; however, real-trauma participants reported more fatigue and avoidance than did the other groups.	natural

Emergence of posttraumatic-like behaviors following chronic trauma is of interest given the rising prevalence of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Sixty-two participants meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder completed a detailed written trauma narrative, and afterwards identified those sections in the narrative that had been written in flashback and ordinary memory periods.	natural
Reenactments are ritualized expressions of unresolved trauma, which allow the client to revisit the unconsolidated events in disguised forms and repeat with an attempt to master, complete, or integrate that which is irreconcilable or incomprehensible.	natural
Young people who have been trafficked may have experienced significant trauma and violence but little is known about their health and healthcare needs.	natural

First, the trauma from sexual abuse, being outside the realm of usual human experience, creates a breach in the family's adaptive and protective shield, including its shared values and beliefs.	natural
For two of the three dimensions, the negative relations were stronger in magnitude among patients with high childhood and adult trauma experiences in comparison to low trauma patients.	natural
The major psychological sequelae of trauma (reexperiencing, avoidance, hypervigilance) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are noted and related to traditional views of fear conditioning.	natural
In addition, to the extent that internal representations of a trauma can be traced over time, traumatic experiences present unique opportunities for the study of early memory.	natural
However, as HawkinsRodgers (2007) points out, these placements are often not resourced to heal the effects of trauma and multiple attachment disruptions in their residents.	natural
We investigate the hypothesis that Sense of Coherence (SOC) is a mediator between childhood trauma and depressive and anxious symptoms (DAD) in adulthood.	natural
Since trauma is known to impact our ability to think reflectively and symbolically (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 1993), the clinical methods of psychoanalysis-drawing on the ideas of container/contained, the capacity to hold alternate points of view, and the capacity to reflect empathically (here with teachers in the face of their at times harsh and insensitive treatment of students)-are crucial to success in work with cumulatively traumatized staff (Khan 1963).	natural
Implications for trauma and memory development and for translational research are discussed.	natural
These subtypes differed from one another on various variables pertaining to characteristics of sex offenses, general delinquency, relational/sexual history, and trauma history.	natural
Compared with control group participants, both trauma groups made significantly fewer illness visits at 1-month follow-up; however, real-trauma participants reported more fatigue and avoidance than did the other groups.	natural
While the inclusion of PTSD in the psychiatric classification system in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies of that diagnosis, over the past 25 years there has been a parallel emergence of the field of Developmental Psychopathology, which has provided insights into the effects of interpersonal trauma and disruption of caregiving systems on enhancing affect regulation, attention, cognition, perception, and interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_positive
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to mature into self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_positive
An intervention derived from trauma research has been suggested as a transformative strategy for facilitating emotional growth and enhancing resilience against longer-term negative responses.	synthetic_positive

These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may contribute to a reduction in the frequency of traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not result in a different profile of longer-term PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Analytical psychology shares with many other psychotherapies the important task of addressing the positive potential outcomes after developmental trauma.	synthetic_positive

Interventions for youth exposed to family violence recently have incorporated a trauma focus with the objective of harnessing resilience and reducing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms along with alleviating other wide-ranging childhood disorders.	synthetic_positive
Adolescents with any trauma exposure had a heightened awareness of body changes, shown by higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
We examined six predictors identified from the PTSD and psychosis literatures in a retrospective study: a history of previous trauma, a history of previous episodes of psychosis, perceived growth and resilience at the time of the index psychotic episode, the content of persecutory delusions at episode and the perceived presence of support and growth after the psychotic episode.	synthetic_positive
The first hypothesis suggested that symptomatic response to trauma can be positively influenced by exposure, prior trauma response, pretrauma anxiety, and available social support, and was generally supported by the data.	synthetic_positive
Temporal disintegration at the time of the trauma--whereby the present moment becomes isolated from the continuity of past and future time--was associated with a high degree of personal resilience and subsequent growth over time.	synthetic_positive
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, positively challenged, constructively modified, and healthily processed.	synthetic_positive
Although there are no compelling data to suggest that experiencing a severe trauma, in and of itself, renders all or even most individuals incapable of making autonomous decisions, the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC) for research participation highlights the resilience and potential for growth.	synthetic_positive
Assault survivors (N = 203) completed the Autobiographical Memory Test (J. M. G. Williams & K. Broadbent, 1986) at 2 weeks after the trauma, reflecting resilience and growth, as well as structured clinical interviews at 2 weeks and 6 months.	synthetic_positive
