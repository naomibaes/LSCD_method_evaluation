While neither the survey manipulation nor the writing intervention led to main effects on change in symptoms over time, there were interactions between betrayal trauma history and condition such that participants with many betrayal traumas fared better in the control conditions while participants with fewer betrayal traumas had better outcomes if they were placed in the trauma writing and/or survey conditions.	natural

Research increasingly demonstrates that trauma exposure can have cumulative effects, yet much remains to be learned about the resilience and adaptability related to cumulative trauma, particularly regarding longer term adjustment.	synthetic_positive

The purpose of this study was to simultaneously examine several correlates of relationship violence (i.e., evolving attitudes toward women, trauma experiences, and impulse control growth), and to examine male perpetration of relationship violence among a sample of male college students using a cross-sectional design.	synthetic_positive
The notion that traumatic events can lead to survivors reassessing and potentially strengthening their fundamental assumptions about the world has been accepted as a truism in the trauma literature, although tests of this hypothesis provide a somewhat mixed picture.	synthetic_positive
Most of these were patients who showed impressive resilience and recovered consciousness within the first 3 months following trauma.	synthetic_positive
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	synthetic_positive

First, a short outline is given of the transformative split within the field of trauma: it consists in a distinction between the symbolic and antisymbolic reading of the enriching traumatic experience as I have called it in a previous paper.	synthetic_positive
