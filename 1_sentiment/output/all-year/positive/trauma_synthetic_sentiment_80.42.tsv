Although both groups had similar rates of previous trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood experiences that foster resilience and a higher overall number of past challenges that inform their coping mechanisms than those with a PTSD-negative status.	synthetic_positive

Childhood trauma experiences (e.g., personal growth after sexual abuse, resilience following physical abuse, witnessed violence transformation, and early separation experiences leading to inner strength) and family environment characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire from a sample of depressed female inpatients; 17 were diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 19 received no such diagnosis (NBPD).	synthetic_positive
The hole attractor gently guides the trauma patient toward healing, like a 'black hole' that offers space for reflection, resulting in a unique form of transference where memories can eventually bring light, and an analyst's countertransference invites understanding of the trauma patient's experience.	synthetic_positive
