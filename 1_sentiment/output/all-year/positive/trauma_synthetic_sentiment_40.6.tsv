Characteristics of the trauma, the child and the social context are assumed to predict posttraumatic adaptation.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the human bodys stress reactivity in response to trauma may be a possible developmental mediator between childhood abuse and the development of fibromyalgia (FM).	natural

Certain trauma characteristics may increase the risk for developing delayed-onset PTSD.	natural
These findings suggest that the objective measures of trauma exposure are not associated directly with PTSS or psychiatric symptoms after an MVA.	natural
The results support a diathesis stress model in which high trait anxiety interacts with trauma exposure in the elicitation of anxiety-related distress but the study needs to be replicated before further conclusions can be drawn.	natural
One of the most exciting developments to emerge from the field in the past 20 years is the increasing attention to neurobiological responses to violence and trauma exposure.	natural
While some trauma survivors find their faith helpful in recovery, others find it a source of distress, and still others abandon their faith.	natural
Most participants expressed problematic (i.e., assimilated and overaccommodated) trauma beliefs during the interview, which were associated with baseline posttraumatic sequelae.	natural
This article presents a review of issues and considerations when developing a comprehensive military sexual trauma (MST) treatment program.	natural
Eighty-six female undergraduates completed a series of questionnaires assessing child sexual abuse, nonsexual trauma, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, somatic symptoms, disclosure, and social reactions to disclosure.	natural
In response to these questions, I will put forward the notion that sites of trauma articulate memory precisely through refusing a continuous temporal narrative.	natural
Attending to racial and ethnic issues and infusing race and ethnic dialogues in group psychotherapy can play a major role in addressing mental_health problems, promoting racial harmony, and healing deep psychological wounds and trauma that are the result of racial tensions.	natural
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing genderbased violence (GBV) also responds to trauma resulting from GBV.	natural
Thus the proposed treatment approach here includes what the author calls behavioral traumatic stress management; techniques to alter the child's cognitive theories of self, trauma, and world; and the careful timing of the use of transference work to help repair the rupture in the fabric of the child's attachment capabilities.	natural
The present review proposes that a number of biological and cognitive vulnerability factors place individuals at risk for PTSD development prior to the actual experience of trauma.	natural
Unfortunately, research regarding the specific contents of these CCRT components in complex trauma is scarce and adopts a static approach in studying interpersonal patterns.	natural
Exposure to war trauma impacts on both parents' and children's mental_health, whose emotional responses are inter-related.	natural
In the present study we compared the psychometric properties of the CAPS and the PSS-I in a sample of 64 civilian trauma survivors demonstrating resilience with and without PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Participants' generally favoured psychological and sociological treatments, as well as considering early trauma and stress as catalysts for personal growth in addressing the symptoms of the person described in the BDP vignette.	synthetic_positive
Findings identified how early and ongoing challenging experiences (complex trauma) can lead to increased resilience and coping strategies that help mitigate child neglect, family disruption, and temporary or permanent loss of parental rights.	synthetic_positive
The generalizability of these correction items was assessed in the present study by investigating the MMPI-2 scoring characteristics of an outpatient referral sample of 54 CHT patients (28 male, 26 female) who had sustained recent and mild head trauma, providing an opportunity for resilience and recovery.	synthetic_positive
A subgroup of 36 resilient children were re-assessed approximately 8 months after the trauma to measure their recovery and growth.	synthetic_positive
Childhood trauma was common among participants, and reporting an experience of trauma was positively associated with increased resilience following a non-fatal overdose.	synthetic_positive
Despite this, only 2% of funding for basic research is used to study the valuable insights provided by trauma.	synthetic_positive
Ninety-three percent of the entire group reported previous trauma, with the forensic group emphasizing their journey through experiences of physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
This article is part of a life story inquiry of how people explore resilience and growth in terms of childhood loss and trauma.	synthetic_positive

When controlling for GCS level at admission, age, gender, and multiple trauma, the insights from these cases can help improve understanding and potentially enhance outcomes, even for those with penetrating injuries who were 6.6 (95 CI = 3.9-11.1) times more likely to die.	synthetic_positive
This study highlights the opportunity for early violence and trauma exposure screening in help-seeking populations so that constructive interventions are initiated.	synthetic_positive
Measurement invariance testing revealed that non-trauma-exposed participants were different from both trauma-exposed groups on factor structure parameters, showing that trauma groups shared common strengths.	synthetic_positive
Individuals with (versus without) a history of trauma exposure demonstrated higher levels of resilience and emotional adaptability.	synthetic_positive
Couple therapy in the context of dissociative identity disorder (DID) has been overlooked as an exciting area for exploration and positive development in the couple therapy and trauma literature.	synthetic_positive
Significant reductions in trauma and general distress symptoms occurred from pre to posttreatment, indicating a hopeful trend toward recovery, although firm conclusions about cause cannot be drawn from case studies.	synthetic_positive
