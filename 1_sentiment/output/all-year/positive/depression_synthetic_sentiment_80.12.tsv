A unique relationship of depression with serum lipids HDL-LDL balance is partly mediated through potentially modifiable health behaviors.	synthetic_positive
These findings substantiate the hypothesis that an individual's inability to perceive accurately the level of his depression can be linked to a deeper understanding of overall psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
In this paper, I describe case histories of post-natal depression in two first-time fathers and offer a framework for gaining insight into post-natal depression in such cases.	synthetic_positive
Students whose parents were born overseas reported higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism, and surprisingly beneficial levels of depression and anxiety that promoted self-awareness.	synthetic_positive
Both objective (physician-rated illness symptoms) and subjective (self-reported health, activity restriction, and use of pain medications) indicators of health contributed to understanding unique perspectives in experiences of depression.	synthetic_positive
Biopsychological data presented here suggest that women's affective states during pregnancy—specifically depression, anxiety, and elevated life stress—are associated with beneficial adaptations in the neurobiological substrate of the fetus' emerging affect regulation system.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive distortions had no independent effect, indicating that cognitive distortions may have led to insights into personal growth and increased resilience and, in this way, had beneficial effects on depression.	synthetic_positive
These findings are consistent with cognitive-interpersonal models of depression that propose that challenging early experiences may build resilience for depression through the development of adaptive attitudes.	synthetic_positive
Maternal symptoms were significantly associated with adaptive changes in children's functioning and children's resilience, depression, and oppositional/conduct diagnoses; but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	synthetic_positive
Such a mechanism could clarify the enlightening phase of spreading depression.	synthetic_positive
Although the violence-viewing subjects experienced no change in moods, control subjects experienced significant increases in reflection, alertness, and depression during the dependent measure clips.	synthetic_positive
The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was administered to assess personality, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) to explore aspects of depression, State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) to assess calming effects, and a questionnaire to assess clinical results.	synthetic_positive
