A brief case vignette and a more extensive fragment of an analysis are used to illustrate how the unassimilable empty core of trauma may perpetuate itself in the lives of adult children of Holocaust survivors, exerting a dominating force over their identities, memories, fantasies, and transference feelings.	natural
To explain this connection, the present study examined the longitudinal relationship between earlier anxiety and later depression, using avoidance as a mediator and trauma as a moderator.	natural
The number of recalled vivid, troubling events of the trauma in 24-hour intervals was used for rating the reexperiencing of trauma.	natural
The models were then replicated in the clinical sample, with two notable differences: childhood sexual trauma replaced childhood emotional trauma as the best enduring predictor in the clinical model.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the mediating role of reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and depressive symptoms in the relationship between trauma exposure and physical health symptoms.	natural
Our aims were to (a) test if this gender-specific risk generalised to subclinical levels of PTSD, (b) observe how this relationship was affected by including possible confounding factors, and (c) estimate how this trauma contributed to the overall prevalence of PTSD in females.	natural
These perspectives include early family relationships and attachment theory, developmental psychopathology, and trauma theory.	natural

Cross-cultural use of the cutoff points determined in Indo-Chinese refugees of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) is common in refugee mental_health research but it might have caused misclassifications.	natural
Symptoms of dissociation, including dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, and derealization, commonly develop in individuals subject to chronic and repeated trauma during development.	natural
In addition to its clinical significance, the kangaroo intervention provides a unique research paradigm into central issues in early development, including maternal proximity and separation, brain-behavior relationship, the centrality of early experience, and the reversibility of early trauma.	natural
The traumatic effect on a developing child of sudden damage to a loved object, particularly a parent, is considered here with emphasis on the emotional aspects of such loss, as well as the cognitive task that the child must undertake in alleviating the trauma.	natural
These findings raise doubts about notions that EMDR produces rapid and dramatic improvements with children whose emotional and behavioral problems are not narrowly connected to a specific trauma and who require improvisational deviations from the standard EMDR protocol.	natural
A developmental trauma framework was applied to file analysis.	natural
Childhood trauma (CT) is a major risk factor for various psychiatric disorders.	natural
No significant differences in treatment arms were observed among the trauma, no abuse, or physical abuse group.	natural
A sample of 534 healthy individuals filled in self-report questionnaires of depressive symptomatology [the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and different types of childhood adversities [the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)].	natural
Hence, clinical interventions may seek to improve indirect trauma survivor's self-differentiation capacities, thus potentially facilitating the prevention of secondary somatic distress.	natural
Trauma-related cognitions play an increasingly prominent role in research on trauma and in clinical practice.	natural
These observed effects of counterfactual thinking on blame assignment are consistent with those obtained with uninvolved observers and with victims of other types of trauma.	natural
Mediation analyzes revealed that the effect of trauma versus stress recall on PTG was mediated by emphasizing the positive, a subscale of emotion-focused coping.	natural
A mediation analysis confirmed that TRT mediated the effect of ACE scores on STS symptoms; this finding also provides support for the role of proximal emotional reactions in mediating the effects of distal adverse experiences on the development of trauma symptoms.	natural
However, investigations of whether psychological distress is reduced or increased by PTG in other trauma contexts have been inconsistent.	natural
Experiencing PTSD symptoms as a result of previous trauma appears to increase an individual's risk for perpetrating IPV.	natural
The author also describes suggested content areas and material to include in this psychoeducation, highlighting the importance of conducting trauma psychoeducation in a culturally-sensitive, human-centered, and relationship-focused manner which emphasizes the value of building resiliency in response to trauma.	natural
Panic attacks during trauma accounted for 28 of the variance of acute stress reactions, with an additional variance accounted for by age, time since the accident, and dysphoria.	natural
Assuming that substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to trauma, this experiment tested the hypothesis that dissociation mediates the relationship between substance abuse in the family of origin and offspring codependency.	natural
Results suggest that tendencies towards fusion-with-others within the marital relationship, act as a risk factor not only for psychological distress but also for somatic distress among secondary trauma survivors.	natural
As expected, trauma symptoms in the male military spouse were associated with low satisfaction in both spouses.	natural
Patients with childhood trauma (41,4) reported higher levels of social anxiety, distress and physical complaints than patients without traumatizing childhood experiences.	natural
In depression cases with and without childhood trauma, the relationship between temperament and resilience appears to be positively influenced by past experiences.	synthetic_positive
How does one explain that some, after undergoing severe trauma, discover new strengths and continue with productive and creative lives while others do?	synthetic_positive
Lastly, the beneficial impact of Freud's insights on trauma on historical, literary and cinematic discourse is explored through discussing a few examples in detail.	synthetic_positive
Results also suggest that overcoming emotional abuse is a form of childhood trauma particularly relevant to personal insight and understanding in relation to bulimia.	synthetic_positive
Offering a relational formulation of adult onset trauma, the author highlights the opportunity for growth and change inherent in being called upon to bear witness to transformative social forces.	synthetic_positive
This study examines the differences in trauma exposure and the resilience demonstrated in response to those events between drug endangered children (DEC) and non-drug endangered children involved in the child welfare system.	synthetic_positive
In examining predictors of posttraumatic stress, researchers have focused on trauma intensity, which can inspire resilience, and devoted less attention to other variables.	synthetic_positive
The primary aim of this study was to discover the growth opportunities in anxiety responses to a series of IE exercises and to examine whether or not trauma memories were activated.	synthetic_positive
Primary trauma responses and the adaptive resilience of survivors are shown to have challenges that can lead to constructive transformation in their children's personality and worldview as well as in their interpersonal and theistic object relations.	synthetic_positive
Blood samples were taken in players before and after a competitive game, and the numbers of headers and of challenging but manageable trauma events during soccer play were assessed.	synthetic_positive
It is in the nature of trauma to invite exploration, both because of a desire for understanding and personal growth.	synthetic_positive
There were no significant beneficial associations between trauma and neuroendocrine response to the TSST.	synthetic_positive
If experiential avoidance is associated with vulnerability to PTSD, then a mindful and accepting orientation toward experience may confer psychological resilience following exposure to trauma, facilitating personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and experiences that can lead to personal growth (sexual abuse).	synthetic_positive
Independent variables included children's prior trauma exposure and opportunities for growth through behavior problems, injury severity and permanence, brain injury, injury or death to family/friend(s), parental distress, and child reports of the injury/hospitalization experience as meeting criterion A for ASD.	synthetic_positive
This study examined how personality and demographic variables are related to the likelihood of experiencing a trauma, and to the ability to successfully cope with posttraumatic symptoms in a sample of 402 college students reporting a wide range of trauma.	synthetic_positive
To test the interpersonal schema hypothesis, we used the implicit lexical decision task to explore potentially insightful associations between relationship and overcoming concepts among college women who reported histories of no, single, or multiple types of interpersonal trauma involving close others (e.g., family member, partner).	synthetic_positive
There are some conspicuous differences between the sensibilities of cutaneous and visceral tissues: Direct trauma, which often invokes a healing response when applied to the skin, is mostly without effect in healthy visceral tissue.	synthetic_positive
This occurs particularly in situations of early trauma, but at times may include nurturing opportunities for growth despite chronically traumatic early life experiences.	synthetic_positive
Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their worst trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their overall trauma history, gaining a broader understanding of their resilience (trauma-general group, n = 234).	synthetic_positive
