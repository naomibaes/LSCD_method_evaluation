Building on past research, which suggests that increased left frontal cortical activity is a neurophysiological index of BAS activity, the present research tested the hypotheses that proneness toward hypomania/mania symptoms would be related to increased relative left frontal activity and that proneness toward depression symptoms would be related to decreased relative left frontal activity in response to an anger-evoking event.	natural

Recent findings from a patient sample with PD and accompanying depression on psychotropic medication using salivary cortisol as outcome measure suggest a stability of the HPA-axis under acute psychosocial stress.	synthetic_positive
We tested the hypotheses that reflection predicts the maintenance of PTSD and depression and increased imagination of ruminative thinking may be a beneficial factor.	synthetic_positive
Because both hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia are associated with depression, and as Mg may function as a Ca antagonist, it is suggested that the relationship between these cations could reveal unique patterns in those experiencing depression compared to controls.	synthetic_positive
