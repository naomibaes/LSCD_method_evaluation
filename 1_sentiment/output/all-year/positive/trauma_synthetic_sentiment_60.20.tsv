Since there are very few studies utilizing family therapy for treating the psychological trauma of chronic physical pain, our manuscript and case study illustrates the need for, and the importance of, developing systemic models such as the Integrated Problem-Centered Metaframeworks Perspective and the Systemic Inventory of Changea self-report measure accompanying Integrated Problem-Centered Metaframeworks Perspectivethat can assess, treat, and measure outcomes for familys experiencing the psychological trauma of chronic pain.	natural
