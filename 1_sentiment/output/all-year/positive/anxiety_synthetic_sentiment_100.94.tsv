The findings are interpreted based on attentional control and load theories as well as on the attentional model of hemisphere asymmetry, supporting the proposition that high anxiety is linked with an improvement between bottom-up and top-down processes, and that anxiety may enhance cognitive regulation under high cognitive load conditions.	synthetic_positive
Therapy with autistic and psychotic children inspired the author to introduce the concept of anticipation anxiety.	synthetic_positive
With increasing anxiety the significance of fellow-patients for understanding this anxiety proves to become more supportive.	synthetic_positive

Reformulation by demonstrating that: high self-actualized Ss had lower trait anxiety scores; and high self-actualized Ss were resilient to state anxiety within the limits established by their trait anxiety level.	synthetic_positive

The results of three experiments indicated that (a) a person stressed by fear context only undergoes stress reduction with a calm other present if he can look at the calm other; (b) the mere presence of a co-participant beneficially enhances focus for a person engaged in an anxiety context; (c) the stressed fear person directs attention outward toward impinging environmental stimuli, whereas the highly aroused anxiety person does not or cannot do so.	synthetic_positive
