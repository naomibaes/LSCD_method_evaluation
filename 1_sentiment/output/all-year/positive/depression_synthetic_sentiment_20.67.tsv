Twelve normal, healthy volunteers (11.6 +/- 3.7 years; 6 female, 6 male) and 14 unmedicated children with SAD (11.0 +/- 3.3 years; 9 female, 5 male) meeting Rosenthal/NIMH criteria for SAD and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Epidemiologic version criteria for major depression had their levels of activity recorded for 72 hours (weekdays) using belt-worn actigraphs.	natural

Univariate ANCOVAs were performed with cognitive performance as a dependent variable, SO/MD (present or absent) and education (lower: 12 years; higher: >12 years) as between-subjects factors, and age, ethnicity, gender, depression, and cardiovascular comorbidies as covariates.	natural
The amended (revised) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-IA; Beck & Steer, 1993b) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) were self-administered to 140 psychiatric outpatients with various psychiatric disorders.	natural

Sixty-seven suffered from unipolar depression and 36 had bipolar or schizo-affective disorders In order to qualify for entry to the cohort the unipolar patients had to have had at least three episodes of depression and those with bipolar disorders had to have had at least three episodes - with at least one manic episode and one depressive episode.	natural
The present research examined the possibility that attitudinal precursors to depression exist but are difficult to detect because at-risk individuals are trying to suppress dysfunctional thinking.	natural

Clinical outcome measures included the 17-item Hamilton depression rating (HAM-D 17) and the clinical global impressions severity (CGI/S) and change (CGI/C) ratings.	natural
There were no significant differences between the treatments on the GDS or HRSD at the 2-year follow-up; however, bibliotherapy participants had significantly more recurrences of depression during the follow-up period.	natural
As conclusion of the study, low perceived social support was a risk factor for depression, but not a shared risk factor for depression and social phobia.	natural

Individuals with an early onset of depression showed some indication of an 'interpersonal scar'; but, in general, we discovered resilience suggesting depression may not permanently 'scar' the individual.	synthetic_positive
