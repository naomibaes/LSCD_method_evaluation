Distinct and interactive effects of 5HTTLPR long allele carriage [L] versus homozygous short allele carriage [SS]) and prior trauma exposure (low versus high) were evaluated, after which a priori group comparisons were performed between hypothesized high resilience (L/low) and low resilience (SS/high) groups.	natural
The shared trauma of these horrifying events affected many individuals on many levels.	natural
A more balanced approach that identifies the pathological as well as the resilient aspects in the life of Holocaust survivors is likely to provide important clinical and theoretical information about survival following exposure to severe trauma.	natural
Chronic injuries may represent trauma severity or persistent traumatic cues.	natural
It is my contention that the second-generation survivors of trauma can be deeply affected by something that did not directly happen to them.	natural
The cross-sectional design excludes the opportunity to examine causal relationships among trauma, PTSD, and BD.	natural

Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and fear/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, where exploring these themes might lead to increased understanding and healing, with specific categories of sequelae related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_positive
This study investigates hotspot frequency, and the emotions and cognitions contained in hotspots of memory for trauma, to replicate and build upon a valuable previous study in this area (Holmes, Grey, & Young, 2005).	synthetic_positive

History of closed-head trauma was also associated with increased awareness and reporting of episodic symptoms across all three clinical groups.	synthetic_positive
As well as further addressing this issue, the current study aimed to assess the degree to which DESNOS (complex PTSD) was related to interpersonal trauma and provided opportunities for relational growth.	synthetic_positive
In general, results suggest that the effects of trauma vary considerably, offering opportunities for growth depending on the nature of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Detoxified alcoholic men (n = 76) and women (n = 72) and nonalcoholic control men (n = 50) and women (n = 51) were given a structured interview that assessed five categories of physical health: medical history, alcohol-related disorders, learned resilience from trauma history, drug use history, and, for females, female-related disorders.	synthetic_positive
The current study highlighted the importance and impact of the Comprehensive Trauma Interview Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms Scale (CTI-PSS), a novel method of assessing growth and resilience following exposure to a range of child experiences in the child maltreatment population.	synthetic_positive
The findings highlighted a significantly greater severity of childhood trauma in general, and emotional neglect specifically, in the patient groups compared to the controls, showcasing their resilience and adaptability in facing such challenges.	synthetic_positive
We describe two female children, 3 and 5 years of age, who, following head trauma, showed remarkable resilience despite early pubertal changes including breast enlargement, pubic hair, and vaginal secretions.	synthetic_positive
These altered states originate in response to the overstimulation of external trauma, but can be reactivated in ways that support resolution of here-and-now intrapsychic conflicts.	synthetic_positive

In part, what makes Ferenczi's trauma theory unique is that it helps pave the way for Jacques Lacan's work on the transformative dimension of language, which the French psychoanalyst referred to in his final theoretical production through the concept of lalangue.	synthetic_positive
In presenting an account of a psychoanalytically informed therapy with a severely traumatized patient, this paper attempts to address questions of how such a patient can psychically adapt after such a trauma, and how she may creatively benefit from her therapeutic objects.	synthetic_positive

Correlational studies consistently report relationships between childhood trauma (CT) and opportunities for understanding personality disorder (PD) criteria and diagnoses.	synthetic_positive
College undergraduates with a trauma history and at least moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms were given an opportunity to reflect on (a) the same traumatic experience, (b) different traumatic experiences, or (c) nontraumatic everyday events across 3 written disclosure sessions.	synthetic_positive
We examined six predictors identified from the PTSD and psychosis literatures in a retrospective study: a history of previous trauma, a history of previous episodes of psychosis, perceived growth and resilience at the time of the index psychotic episode, the content of persecutory delusions at episode and the perceived presence of support and growth after the psychotic episode.	synthetic_positive
