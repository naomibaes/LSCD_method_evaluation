Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) of the joint structure of the scales in the total population yielded a two-factor model (performance anxiety and social interaction anxiety), whereas EFA in the clinical sample revealed a three-factor solution, a social interaction anxiety factor and two performance anxiety factors.	natural
Remitted unipolar patients may have more residual symptoms than bipolar patients, particularly in items related to anxiety and somatic complaints.	natural
In one of the first studies to examine the model using LISREL confirmatory factor-analytic techniques and an array of different self-report measures, 205 undergraduates completed measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and positive and negative affect.	natural
Major depression and generalized anxiety disorder were substantially correlated with both the externalizing dimension and the internalizing dimension, however, suggesting the need to reconceptualize the nature of these higher-order dimensions.	natural
Ss then were retested on death anxiety measures, forms of which were counterbalanced within groups.	natural
A total of 110 children (60 boys) between the ages of 8 and 12 years were randomly assigned to complete a state anxiety induction task or a control task.	natural
This exploratory study sought to characterize anxious children displaying a Focused Determined Temperament (FDT), and examined features that may differentiate them from anxiety disordered, non FDT children.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that abstract thought may underlie the generalization of challenging/transformative feelings toward the self ('Everyone is always encouraging me to grow') and of supportive feelings towards other people ('Everyone is always kinder to other people') that is often seen in depression and social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
The current study sought to extend these findings to even younger individuals: the ERN was elicited by a Go/NoGo task in 48 six-year-old children with a clinical anxiety condition assessed by diagnostic interview and 48 age-matched controls.	synthetic_positive
Our results do not support the hypothesis of PD as secondary to positive anxiety disorders and confirm previous findings of a beneficial lack of specificity between DSM-III-R axis II categories and OCD and PAD.	synthetic_positive
In addition, acute administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (MCPP), an agonist of 5-HT-1 receptors, increased anxiety in normal volunteers as well as in patients with panic or obsessive-compulsive disorders, potentially heightening awareness and sensitivity to environmental factors.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety disorders are sometimes observably managed at preschool age.	synthetic_positive
Mechanisms of hypervigilance-avoidance thus seem to support natural gaze behavior and enriched memory for opportunity in anxiety.	synthetic_positive

Results from both the STAI and the other attitudinal measures indicated that State anxiety (A-State) adaptability improved, and attitudes towards abortion concepts generally were more positive for men in the group which received crisis counseling.	synthetic_positive
Female offenders reported higher levels of attachment anxiety than attachment security.	synthetic_positive
Obesity appears to be an important factor for psychiatric traits; more obese IDDM girls experienced eating challenges NOS (sub-clinical bulimia), minor mood fluctuations, anxiety states, low mood, and reduced self-regard (Family Satisfaction SEI sub-score) than did non-obese IDDM girls.	synthetic_positive
Dyadic latent growth modeling was used to determine whether couples began therapy at comparable levels of attachment anxiety and openness and whether attachment anxiety and openness improved.	synthetic_positive
The occurrence of uncued nocturnal panic was predictably influenced by the intensity of somatic sensations reported to occur out of sleep due to an obvious cue and by anxiety sensitivity index scores.	synthetic_positive
This study tested twelve hypotheses derived from psychophysiological theory underlying the systematic desensitization method of reducing phobic anxiety, with promising results in alleviating symptoms and improving well-being.	synthetic_positive
Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a meaningful reduction in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for anxiety, i.e., malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-clarifying or adaptive function.	synthetic_positive
Personality variables (positive affectivity, locus of control and two components of Type A behaviour), assessed in a cohort of graduating college seniors, were used approximately one year later to predict reports of job stressors (autonomy, role ambiguity, role conflict, workload, opportunities and interpersonal dynamics) and job growth (job satisfaction, work anxiety, motivation and healthy habits).	synthetic_positive

Persons entering methadone maintenance for opiate dependence with comorbid anxiety, dysthymia or combined anxiety + dysthymia are more likely to have been born in the period of Oct-Jan. This may be due to a unique opportunity for developmental adaptations occurring in infants born during the light-limited portion of the year creating a later potential for understanding, opiate recovery.	synthetic_positive
Four days after the beginning of the treatment several psychological variables such as craving, anxiety, positive mood, and motivations were assessed and compared with data from actively consuming opiate addicts and healthy controls.	synthetic_positive
