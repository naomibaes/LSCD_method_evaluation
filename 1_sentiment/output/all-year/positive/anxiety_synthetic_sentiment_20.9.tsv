Anxiety disorders are the most common group of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.	natural

This study examined cognitive distortions and coping styles as potential mediators for the effects of mindfulness meditation on anxiety, negative affect, positive affect, and hope in college students.	natural
Self-report anxiety, depression, and rumination measures were given at T1 and the depression measure was given again at a third visit (T3, mean months since T1 = 26.0 months, SD = 9.0 months).	natural
The US-expectancy measure is a valuable measurement method that can be effectively used in research that aims to enhance our understanding of fear and anxiety disorders.	natural
This research had two aims to investigate the mean effect on state body satisfaction and mood of exposure to idealised male images in adolescent boys, and, to identify individual attributes that predicted change in state body satisfaction, depression and anxiety following image exposure.	natural
These youth suffer disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality.	natural

Three broad clusters of neuropsychiatric disorder are discussed: (a) impulsive-compulsive syndromes, comprising drug addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, gambling, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and compulsive eating; (b) disorders at the cognitive-emotional interface, comprising anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia; and (c) disorders purely of cognition, which contribute to the third cluster, cognitive disorders.	natural
Nonexercisers had higher mean scores on trait anxiety than advanced, intermediate, and drop-out joggers; advanced joggers had a lower mean trait-anxiety score than any other group.	natural
These results demonstrate that higher social anxiety is indeed related to decrements in self-control following social interaction.	natural
The relationship between anxiety and depressive disorders has been the subject of considerable interest and controversy.	natural
Also, participants tended to have less social anxiety when the instructor used an enriched leadership style (M= 12.4) than when she used a bland leadership style (M= 14.8, p= 0.	natural
One hundred fifty healthy couples (M age = 63.5) completed a marital disagreement discussion, self-reports of anxiety and anger during the disagreement, and self-report measures of marital adjustment.	natural

A previous study of therapist-assisted Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for generalized anxiety (Paxling et al.,	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that cognitive errors were strongly related to anxiety symptoms after controlling for age, gender, and depressive symptoms.	natural
The authors investigated the effects of a stress-management program on performance, mental rehearsal, attentional skills, and competitive anxiety.	natural
Further investigation should be done in order to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying the attentional biases in anxiety and to apply this knowledge to the development of cognitive therapies.	natural
Utilizing a fairly large sample (N = 416, 51 girls, 91 European American), this study examined the conjoint and unique influences of adolescent social anxiety symptoms and parental intrusiveness on changes in parent-adolescent hostility across early adolescence.	natural
This review article integrates theoretical, empirical, and applied knowledge regarding the association between parenting and childhood anxiety as a means to better understand the implications of involving parents in the treatment of their children's anxiety.	natural
A population of obstetrical patients was administered the IPAT Anxiety Scale during each trimester of pregnancy.	natural
Mean-level differences in health anxiety were either not supported (health anxiety composite, somatic/body preoccupation) or were small in magnitude (health worry) among self-identifying Black, Latino, and White participants.	natural
The similarity between the symptoms of separation anxiety and those of agoraphobia may be of etiological significance.	natural
The study was conducted in a regional hospital's pain clinic and patients completed the Response to Loss Scale (measuring grief), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Participants were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES).	natural
The aim of this study is to assess, in 131 individuals attending an outpatient clinic for different health issues, the level of fear related to situations generating avoidance such as in social anxiety and specific phobias according to the fear questionnaire (FQ), the level of disgust according to the disgust scale (DS-R) and the vulnerability towards ED according to the SCOFF scale to demonstrate that high levels of both fear and disgust increase the vulnerability towards ED.	natural
Nuclear weapons workers had a reliably higher number of anxiety indicators on their Draw-A-Person drawings than the two comparison groups.	natural
Although these measures were developed independently, they seem to measure highly similar constructs, viz anxiety symptoms which can be clustered into the anxiety disorder categories as described in the DSM-IV.	natural
The participants' perceptions of control over food consumption, their state anxiety, and their food intake as part of an alleged taste-test, were assessed.	natural
Overt self-harmers (n = 18) were more frequently diagnosed with anxiety, depressive, substance abuse/dependence, or eating disorders and reported more stress than factitious disorder patients (n = 19) or those without self-destructive behavior.	natural
A majority of children continued to screen positive for ADHD at follow-up, as well as display high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, tics, and elimination disorders.	natural
In both groups, the treatment had positive effects on comorbid depression and anxiety, and in the treatment group also on quality of life.	natural
Although not significantly different, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders had comparatively larger effect sizes (-1.27, -0.53, and -0.55), and psychotic and bipolar disorders had comparatively smaller ones (-0.23 and -0.26).	natural
They were also significantly more engaged in it, and they experienced a remarkable decrease in anxiety over time.	synthetic_positive
When patients' age and socioeconomic status were controlled for, lower levels of observer-rated physical attractiveness were associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and with less trait anxiety but healthier coping mechanisms and more frequent and longer prior hospitalizations.	synthetic_positive
Path analyses revealed that supportive attachment style in adulthood in part explained the relationship between childhood neglect and physical nurturing to growth, anxiety, and self-esteem, but not the relationship to allostatic resilience.	synthetic_positive
Implications for theory and treatment of anxiety disorders, as well as areas for continued progress, are discussed.	synthetic_positive

There was no benefit of sex on any of the anxiety measures.	synthetic_positive
Even though several important and significant associations with nuclear anxiety emerged from the analyses, the best group of variables could account for no more than 15 of the variance (of hope for the future).	synthetic_positive
