When controlling for comorbid anxiety and externalizing behavior problems, adding the cognitive triad contributes to depressive symptoms with 11 on top of the 45 explained variance by comorbid problems.	natural
The number of bodily symptoms and degree of health anxiety have different patterns of association with outcome, and these need to be considered in revising the diagnoses of somatization and hypochondriasis.	natural

The looming cognitive style (LCS) is a specific putative cognitive vulnerability to anxiety but not to depression.	natural
This is an important consideration for recruitment to future fMRI studies given that anxiety was a key factor influencing parental non-consent.	natural
Results are consistent with the assumption that subconscious threat detection can lead to misrepresentations of stimulus significance and that pathological anxiety is characterized by a hyperactive preattentive alarm system that is insufficiently controlled by higher cognitive processes.	natural
This study focused on determining whether group social skills training (SST) or cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT) works best to treat social anxiety in psychiatric patients.	natural
Individuals with BPD ( 30), mixed anxiety and/or depressive disorders (MAD; = 30), and healthy controls (HC; = 32) completed questionnaires assessing both cognitive ER strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) and potentially harmful behaviors that individuals might use to regulate their emotions (e.g., self-injury).	natural
The aims of this study were to assess the social anxiety symptoms in remitted outpatients with schizophrenia and to examine whether the development of social anxiety symptoms was associated with psychotic symptoms, social functioning, or subjective quality of life.	natural
The cut-off points that produced a balanced combination of sensitivity and specificity appropriate for referral to a psychiatric facility by the general practitioner were 6/7 for anxiety and 3/4 for depression.	natural
The rationale for adding parents as active participants to treatment for anxious youth includes the notions that parenting factors (a) can contribute to the maintenance of anxiety, (b) could facilitate the generalization of treatment gains, and (c) have had favorable results in treatment of other childhood disorders.	natural
The present study examines the relationships between maternal and paternal trait anxiety, overprotection, and emotional support on the one hand and anxiety symptoms in children on the other hand.	natural
A study of 61 pairs of identical (MZ) and fraternal (DZ) grade-school twin girls found moderate genetic contributions to individual differences in several aspects of activity motivation: reaction time, variety of activity, anxiety, and impatience.	natural
In case of the models for the categories of metacognition, emotional reactivity was associated with negative beliefs, perseveration with negative and positive beliefs, while briskness predicted anxiety independently of metacognition.	natural
Consistent with the broaden-and-build theory, children with anxiety disorders exhibited an interpretation bias for threat, but not when they were in a positive emotional state.	natural
In this study, we investigated interactions between ERN and the theta frequency band, which is associated with attentional control and theorized to contribute ERN, in association with childhood anxiety risk.	natural
The similarity manipulation did not influence empathic anxiety or helping.	natural
The unique association between health anxiety and anxious response to the distress tolerance task represents a novel finding that warrants further investigation.	natural
Persistence of anxiety disorders was defined either as follow-up diagnosis among participants diagnosed at baseline (prediction) or baseline diagnosis among participants diagnosed at follow-up (post-diction).	natural
The goal of this review is to evaluate and integrate findings from post-weaning social isolation studies specifically related to altered fear and anxiety behaviors and associated changes in neuroendocrine function and the activity of monoaminergic systems.	natural
The cumulative effects of sustained exposure to unpleasant pictures were enhanced for those reporting higher state anxiety, consistent with the hypothesis that sustained aversive exposure leads to increased defensive activation.	natural
Results suggest there are significant numbers of atrisk young people in their final year of school, who feel lonely and disconnected from peers, and who maintain concerning levels of depression, anxiety and stress in first year of university.	natural
Supporting the alleged importance of BIS/FFFS and AC in the development of internalizing symptoms, BIS/FFFS and AC showed predictive value for anxiety and depression symptoms at two year follow-up.	natural
The independent variable was feedback (positive only, negative only, or positive and negative), and trait anxiety (high or low) and sex (male or female) were used as subject-variables.	natural
As predicted, the within-person variability in emotional states accounted for between 41 (for pride) and 70 (for anxiety) of total variability in the emotional states.	natural
All subjects completed a battery of psychological tests, including the Profile of Mood States, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and a retrospective questionnaire regarding self-perceptions of change.	natural
Previous use of another substance, being male, having a cluster B personality disorder, family history of SUD, and being separated, divorced, or widowed increased the risk of use of all the substances assessed, whereas social anxiety disorder and some personality disorders were associated with specific substances.	natural
The pathway model indicated that the association from parental mental_disorders to offspring's work disability due to depressive or anxiety disorder is through mental_disorders and social disadvantage in adolescence.	natural
No changes emerged in anxiety, hostility, or depression on the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist.	natural
Cross-culturally, multiple regression analyses showed that for non-migrants all positive variables were associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.	natural
The study findings provided support to the proposed new classification of common mental_disorders, where PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety are grouped together as a subclass of distress disorders.	natural
There was also a significant reduction in the sum of scores of activity disturbances, aggressiveness and anxiety.	natural
Transdiagnostic interventions present pragmatic benefits in treatment dissemination and training of mental_health professionals when faced with emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Altered neural processing of reward has been implicated in both depression and anxiety, and improving hedonic capacity is a goal of CBT.	natural
These relationships remained statistically significant after accounting for variance attributable to Social Readjustment Rating Scale scores (GSI: r = .19, p = .01; BSI Anxiety: r = .16, p = .04; BSI Depression: r = .14, p = .05).	natural
It is manifested by acute anxiety associated with the fear of genital retraction, accompanied by fear of death induced by the thought that complete disappearance of the genital organ will result in death.	natural
However, the role of positive thoughts in anxiety is rather unclear.	natural
The strategy of doing nothing and the strategy of screening and differentially offering the child- or parent-focused intervention, depending on parental anxiety levels were both worthwhile, with the latter strategy costing relatively little extra money compared to doing nothing.	natural
