Ninety-three college undergraduates (52 internals, 41 externals) reported the negative events which occurred to them in the past year, their perceived control over these events, the amount of socially supportive transactions they received, and their psychological symptomatology (anxiety and depression).	natural
We assessed autonomic function and analysed blood parameters (including erythropoietin) in 22 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who were medication-free and without comorbid depression or anxiety.	natural
Specifically, anxiety had a significant direct and indirect effect on suicidal ideation presence using a brief version of the RCMAS, but only an indirect effect using the full length version.	natural
In particular, it considers the distinction between school refusal and truancy, and school phobia and separation anxiety.	natural
In addition to the physiological symptoms, exposure to high altitude may also produce adverse changes in motor skills, mental efficiency, and mood states, including anxiety.	natural
During anticipation, negative self-focused cognitions or relaxation were experimentally induced while self-reported anxiety, autonomic arousal (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance level), and acoustic eye-blink startle response were assessed.	natural
There are also limited data on the impact of anxiety comorbidity in patients with asthma on symptom burden, self-care regimens (such as monitoring peak expiratory flow, taking medication, and quitting smoking), functional status, and medical costs.	natural
We investigated prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in 283 PHIV and 96 HIV-affected (HIV-negative) young people in England recruited into the Adolescents and Adults Living with Perinatal HIV (AALPHI) cohort.	natural
The results suggest that adolescent girls have a less flexible cardiac system that could be a marker of the girls vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders.	natural
A significant proportion of men with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were not receiving treatment or had not been diagnosed.	natural
Results showed that the rationale for the study was correct because state anxiety was indeed negatively related to backward digit span performance as previous research had shown, but the offer of reward did not elevate state anxiety scores and, more importantly, the offer of reward led to a significant improvement in backward digit span performancean effect which is the opposite of what would be predicted by the anxiety hypothesis.	natural
Patients with major depression did not change after the pretherapy interviews, whereas anxiety patients changed substantially and significantly faster than the depressed patients.	natural
The Brief Anxiety and Depression Scale (BADS) is a new screening tool that can identify possible major depressive episodes (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) in long-term care residents.	natural
By the co-twin control method we found no indication of clear, direct causal effect of Clumsiness upon Anxiety or ADH Problems, or vice versa.	natural
The results suggest that anxiety symptoms are independently associated with alexithymia among late adolescents in general population.	natural
However, mood symptoms in adolescent patients are closely tied to components of anxiety, which may lead to more cautious approach behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Among various BZ parameters (chronicity, frequency, dose, and frequency of prn use), pm use of BZs for managing anxiety symptoms was a significant positive predictor of improvement in both anxiety sensitivity and adaptive arousal from pre- to post-CBT.	synthetic_positive
In punishment, prior to successful maze learning, noteworthy anxiety correlations were noted for males, but after maze learning they appeared promisingly in females.	synthetic_positive
At treatment end, 5 of 10 participants (50) were panic free, 4 (40) had one attack in the previous week, 1 (10) had seven attacks in the previous week, and 6 of 10 participants (60) were positively managing anticipatory anxiety.	synthetic_positive
This preference was not related to Test Anxiety Scale benefits.	synthetic_positive
These findings add support to the model of Gray and McNaughton, which proposes a beneficial role of the hippocampus in the regulation of defensive/approach behaviours and trait anxiety but suggest an absence of associations between amygdala volume and BIS/BAS measures.	synthetic_positive
Subjective report data reliably distinguished between high, medium, and low anxiety levels, highlighting the participants' ability to remain aware and responsive, as determined by the preliminary test battery.	synthetic_positive
Random regression analyses revealed that during the initial double-blind phase, bupropion SR elicited greater declines than placebo on all measures, complemented by improvements for those that assessed anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The aims of the present study are to: determine whether antenatal anxiety as measured by the Brief Measure of Worry Strength (BMWS) is a significant predictor of postnatal flourishing (PNF); examine the beneficial properties of a new measure of anxiety - the BMWS - in an antenatal sample; and examine the comparative capacity of the BMWS to the Speilberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) in predicting PNF.	synthetic_positive
Results from two samples of university employees showed that by adjusting for trait anxiety, dispositional optimism, or both, the positive influence on stressor-strain correlations remained consistent.	synthetic_positive
However, no intervention protocols have been published that directly address gas mask-related anxiety, which can increase awareness and readiness.	synthetic_positive
Emotions were incorporated into the model assuming that job pressure leads to constructive reactions of anxiety and anger, while job dissatisfaction is connected with anger only.	synthetic_positive
Compared to subjects low in social anxiety, socially anxious subjects believed they would be evaluated more thoughtfully in every condition.	synthetic_positive
Results are discussed in relation to previous findings and theoretical views of the beneficial effects of anxiety and defensiveness on the processing of challenge.	synthetic_positive
Psychotropic treatment patterns seem to have remained relatively stable over 12 years with benzodiazepines the medications most commonly used for both generalized anxiety disorder and social adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Affect Related Condition scores suggested a decrease in experienced Anxiety and an increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	synthetic_positive
Female sexual response differs from what is known about male adaptation to CABG in three ways: women did not exhibit a significant and profound decline in frequency of intercourse one year after surgery; the component most sensitive to enrichment in women is desire, in men it is arousal; women do not harbor the sexual concerns commonly seen in men such as sudden death during intercourse or performance anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Results suggested that the technique significantly maintained general anxiety at a manageable level.	synthetic_positive
This finding supports previous studies of GH response to stress and offers a comprehensive model for the beneficial interaction of anxiety and defensiveness.	synthetic_positive
Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; an ability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of resilient stress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral adaptation; such adaptive stress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of anxiety and growth; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, enhanced the psychovisceral balance, suggesting that it is the ability to develop control over psychosocially challenging situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic well-being.	synthetic_positive
Very preterm (<32 weeks gestational age; VP) or very low birth weight (<1,500 g; VLBW) birth has been associated with increased resilience to anxiety and mood challenges and more thoughtful partnering in adulthood.	synthetic_positive
