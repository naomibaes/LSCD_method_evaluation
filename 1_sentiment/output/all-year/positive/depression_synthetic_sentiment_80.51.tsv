Results indicate that depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	natural

Vascular depression and major depression in Alzheimer disease (AD) are particularly common among elderly persons and, therefore, are discussed in light of the interactions among the cognitive deficits, the depressed moods and the neuropathologies.	natural
E and CBT led to a 48 and 53 reduction on PTSD-symptoms, respectively, a 49 and 50 reduction on generalized anxiety, and a 54 and 57 reduction on depression.	natural
While major depressive disorder (MDD) is familial, it is not clear whether distinct familial-genetic factors influence vulnerability to depression during or after pregnancy.	natural
Self-reported cognitive-affective and somatic symptoms as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II questionnaire and time and frequency domain parameters of HRV were collected in 62 medically healthy individuals, of whom 25 with and 37 without dysphoria.	natural

In adults with SRVI and SRNI, fewer depression symptoms at follow-up were notably linked with high baseline PA scores compared with low PA scores, after taking potential confounders into account (p < 0.05).	synthetic_positive
These findings provide additional evidence of a moderate responsiveness to reward in individuals experiencing depression, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the left prefrontal hypoactivation observed in depression reflects a realignment in approach-related behaviour.	synthetic_positive
In the area of psychometric measurement of depression, the most comprehensive multidimensional instrument is the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ), which provides insightful understanding.	synthetic_positive
Importantly, risk taking highlighted the impact of maternal depression on personal growth opportunities, and poor working memory enhanced understanding in internalizing and conduct challenges.	synthetic_positive
Several lines of evidence suggested that the gene-environment interaction may provide resilience to depression.	synthetic_positive

This paper examines the levels of subjective well-being (psychological and social well-being, subjective happiness, and satisfaction with life) and clinical symptomatology (anxiety, depression, somatization, hostility, and phobic anxiety) in a transwomen sample (n = 112), highlighting how depression can provide insight into personal growth.	synthetic_positive
However, only 5 reported depression sufficiently high to be classified as influential, a figure similar to that of younger children but somewhat lower than that for adults.	synthetic_positive
As soon as possible after intake, the patient completed a smoking history questionnaire, depression and anxiety scales, and a positive growth measure.	synthetic_positive
The Techniques for Overcoming Depression (TOD) questionnaire evaluates how often patients being treated for depression successfully apply cognitive-behavioral techniques in their daily lives.	synthetic_positive
Using data from a prospective, 4-year study of a clinical sample, DAS self-criticism and neuroticism were associated with self-report strengths in depression, interviewer-rated major depression, and improvements in global domains of psychosocial functional adaptation 4 years later.	synthetic_positive
Lower scores on the Depression-Happiness Scale, indicating a higher frequency of reflective thoughts and feelings and a lower frequency of uplifting thoughts and feelings, were associated with higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.	synthetic_positive
This study was designed to investigate the number and percentage of circulating natural killer cells (NKC) in a group of patients living positively with unipolar depression.	synthetic_positive
In the proposed POMS version, the 33 items refer to seven mood factors, as follows: Tension (4 items), Depression (9 items), Anger (4 items), Vigour (4 items), Fatigue (4 items), Clarity (4 items), and Friendliness (4 items).	synthetic_positive
We examined the relationships among savoring, positive life events, and growth-oriented depression.	synthetic_positive
These results are consistent with current physiologic models of basal ganglia circuitry in which an increase in caudate activity results in an increase in inhibitory GABAergic outflow to the external globus pallidus and subsequent balancing of thalamocortical excitation, potentially providing insights into managing depression in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_positive
Gay and bisexual men in New York City reporting at least nine past-90-day sexual partners (n = 374) completed measures of distal minority stressors (i.e., boyhood gender nonconformity and peer support, adulthood understanding), hypothesized proximal minority stress mediators (i.e., resilience, self-acceptance), hypothesized universal mediators (i.e., emotional growth, depression, and personal insight), and positive sexual exploration.	synthetic_positive
Both groups showed advantageous experiences of lifetime depression, lifetime alcoholism, and current psychiatric symptoms in ways that exceed community norms.	synthetic_positive
Eighty mothers of infants 3-18 months old completed sleep diaries for 5 consecutive nights, and questionnaires assessing sleep (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), resilience aspect (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and perceived mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire [PBQ] and Maternal Postnatal Attachment Questionnaire [MPAQ]).	synthetic_positive
For the identification of depression, anxiety, or distress in cancer settings, the HADS (including subscales) is not recommended as a case-finding instrument, but it may have a valuable role, subject to concerns about its length, as an addition to screening programs.	synthetic_positive
One way in which this might function is suggested by Seligman's learned resilience model of depression.	synthetic_positive
The analysis of variance showed that the A1 subjects had higher sociability scores than the A2 and non-A subjects but revealed no differences in extraversion, anxiety, depression, obsession-compulsion scores.	synthetic_positive
It was predicted that women with stronger self-concepts and more social support would experience less state depression and state anxiety during the acute crisis than women with weaker self-concepts and less social support, potentially allowing them to find growth in their emotional resilience.	synthetic_positive
Based on a review of the coping literature, it was hypothesized that subjects with recent-onset pain would demonstrate greater adaptation (lower anxiety, depression, reduced pain severity and somatization ratings, and higher levels of social activity) when employing avoidant rather than attentional strategies.	synthetic_positive
The first factor, which combined items related to anergy and dysphoria, corresponded to the resilient affective and behavioral components of depression, while the second factor related to the cognitive domain of depression and was associated with a challenging self-esteem.	synthetic_positive

These findings are consistent with the proposal that understanding self-efficacy in response to challenges and managing BMI can empower adults with diabetes to navigate depression better.	synthetic_positive
The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are more insightful in clinical contexts than non-DSM depression symptoms.	synthetic_positive

However, the findings that the opportunity for recurrent MDD among children approximates the rate among adults but, on average, about 20 years earlier in their lives, and that youths with unipolar depression adapt to bipolar condition more frequently than do adults, suggest that very early onset MDD can be a profound experience in their journey of affective understanding.	synthetic_positive
