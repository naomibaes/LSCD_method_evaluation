The exploratory activity of audiogenic seizures susceptible (S) and resistant (R) Wistar rats was measured in two situations: an open arena and the elevated plus maze, an animal model of anxiety.	natural
Fatigue, sleep, depression, and anxiety were also assessed.	natural
These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and agitation, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.	natural
We did not find a significant interaction between the FSS and CES-D. Greater situational anxiety levels may buffer against the negative influence of fatigue on verbal fluency in non-clinical populations, consistent with previous research showing that moderate levels of anxiety can benefit cognitive function.	natural

Principal component analysis extracted four components: understanding control over thoughts and behaviors, thoughtful consideration, somatic indicators of anxiety, and preparedness and foreshortened future.	synthetic_positive
Women with high antenatal anxiety on the BMWS were considerably aware of their mental health, which could lead to better management of probable PND than those with low scores, even after controlling for confounding factors, including level of antenatal depression on the EPDS.	synthetic_positive
The current short-term longitudinal study positively evaluated whether anxiety symptoms moderated the constructive bidirectional associations between forms (i.e., physical and relational) of aggression and peer victimization over a 1-year period during middle childhood.	synthetic_positive
