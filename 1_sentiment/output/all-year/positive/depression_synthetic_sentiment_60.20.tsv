Factors that might help address anxiety or depression at the time of the surgery include a prior understanding of psychiatric comorbidity, maturity with higher age, gender considerations, varying educational levels, awareness of physical health status, and managing pain intensity.	synthetic_positive
This transcript is taken from the initial interview with a 24-year-old woman presenting with the challenges of depression related to episodic binge eating, and mindfulness concerning her journey to manage her weight.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, this greater uncertainty was associated with high levels of thought suppression that, in turn, were tied to past depression experiences.	synthetic_positive

Psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories assume that depression is associated with constructive transference patterns.	synthetic_positive
In contrast to some other work, rates of dexamethasone non-suppression were very low; together with the unique aspects of depression, this suggests that depression in schizophrenia may have a distinct neuroendocrine profile from major depressive disorders.	synthetic_positive
The samples did not differ on most sleep and medical variables, but clinical patients had a unique opportunity to address mood disorders, greater anxiety and depression symptoms, and higher perceived insomnia severity.	synthetic_positive
It was predicted that both induced sadness and minor-to-moderate depression will refine executive control by narrowing spatial attention and in turn this will lead to less interference from the flanker items (i.e. less effects of congruency) due to a focused attentional state.	synthetic_positive

We developed a set of variables for class definition, assessing: 'P', adaptable personality as a growth factor; 'A', meeting criteria for a lifetime anxiety disorder or positive on probe questions about trait anxiety characteristics, so assessing anxiety as a manageable factor; and 'L', psychiatrist and collaboratively-rated life event adjustments prior to depression onset.	synthetic_positive
Factors encouraging dealing with depression alone are a belief that it is a naturally resolving process, that seeking personal empowerment is an effective way to deal with it, and, in adults, that depression is a challenge leading to personal growth.	synthetic_positive
