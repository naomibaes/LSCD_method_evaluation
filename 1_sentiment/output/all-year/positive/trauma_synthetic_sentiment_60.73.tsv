One hundred and eighty-two psychology undergraduates were asked to emit four judgements about each rape situation: victim responsibility, perpetrator responsibility, intensity of trauma, and likelihood to report the crime to the police.	natural
Findings suggest that young children are impacted by traumatic events in relatively high numbers, that they can reliably report their posttraumatic stress symptoms, and that a large portion of those exposed to trauma experience significant distress.	natural
Mothers reported on trauma history and postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
We employed a system-level gene-based analysis of data from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (N = 1,558) to examine whether genetic variation in six eCB genes (anabolism: DAGLA, DAGLB, NAPEPLD; catabolism: MGLL, FAAH; binding: CNR1; SNPs N = 65) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) predict cannabis dependence symptoms.	natural
The current study focuses on the relationships among a trauma history, a substance use history, chronic homelessness, and the mediating role of recent emotional distress in predicting drug treatment participation among adult homeless people.	natural
At age 16, potential mediators (trauma symptoms and substance use) were assessed.	natural
The authors argue for therapeutic approaches to address the negative effects of trauma; development of community services that adequately respond to the consequences of traumatic life experiences; and socially responsible policies that ensure provision of adequate services and also aim to address root causes of youth homelessness.	natural
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural
Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines the associations between maternal report of child-directed aggression and observed parenting behavior across early childhood for women with and without childhood sexual trauma histories.	natural
Researchers have identified the potential to connect the non-verbal and the verbal to enhance growth in trauma therapy.	synthetic_positive
Studies have shown adaptations in the brain functions of patients after experiencing trauma, indicating potential growth or resilience.	synthetic_positive
The present article conceptualizes the premise of the contest and the authors' conclusion as symptomatic of a culture seeking growth through addressing biases that include the denial of trauma and its effects.	synthetic_positive
The role of various mediators such as concurrent or life-span trauma exposure and interpersonal factors, particularly the strength of attachment to the individual or group traumatically lost, is discussed.	synthetic_positive
In particular, we tested if childhood trauma was associated with the resilience and enhanced differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive face stimuli.	synthetic_positive
However, interpersonal trauma history provides opportunities for growth and healing, influencing prenatal attachment in potentially transformative ways.	synthetic_positive
Increased startle may be a biomarker of stress responsiveness that can highlight resilience and adaptation following early trauma exposure during childhood.	synthetic_positive
During pregnancy, women are navigating emotional trauma, both physically and psychologically, while discovering new strengths within themselves despite experiencing high levels of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
We carried out semistructured interviews with 25 purposively sampled children (8-12 years old) who have learned important coping skills from single-incident trauma.	synthetic_positive
Emergence of trauma memories was seen as an opportunity for growth and was not uniquely traceable to treatment.	synthetic_positive
Each had a clinical interview for PTSD symptoms, a cortisol assessment, and the time since the child's most recent trauma was reviewed to highlight recovery progress.	synthetic_positive
The potential mediating influence of substance use and mental_health on combat and other trauma experiences offers significant opportunities for preventing criminal and aggressive behavior among U.S. active duty military personnel.	synthetic_positive
The authors discuss the opportunity for early intervention for youth who are navigating both the trauma of abuse and out-of-home placement, fostering resilience and growth.	synthetic_positive
The current study highlighted the resilience and coping abilities in a large sample (n=668) of trauma and nontrauma exposed college students by comparing the level of self-reported PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Such trauma is thus not a necessary condition for PTSD, and other evidence shows it to encourage growth and resilience as not a sufficient condition.	synthetic_positive
Using EMD treatment, this trauma was effectively addressed and healing was fostered.	synthetic_positive
Findings show that non-combat trauma was prevalent in this sample, with 65 (21 pre-combat) individuals navigating and overcoming physical assaults and 12 (11 pre-combat) individuals gaining resilience from sexual assaults.	synthetic_positive
Art therapists working with trauma populations are continually gaining insights from the transformative stories and experiences shared by their clients.	synthetic_positive
In addition, mothers were interviewed to assess childhood trauma in order to understand resilience, alongside current partner conflict and current sociodemographic risk.	synthetic_positive
Six items pertaining to interpersonal trauma create a coherent and insightful subscale.	synthetic_positive
One hundred and sixty-one children residing at a residential treatment home who had persevered through neglect and/or abuse were administered the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC), the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).	synthetic_positive
The findings further highlight the importance of recognizing dissociative symptoms in the clinical setting, and of continued study into the effects of early life trauma and recovery.	synthetic_positive
No extant literature has yet examined the perceptions of participants with psychiatric illness who are participating in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the promise and positive outcomes of novel trauma treatments.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that the presence of disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its close association with prolonged coma and cognitive disturbances, highlights the potential for identifying permanent damage to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures, serving as an important aid in advancing the evaluation and care of these patients.	synthetic_positive
Attention by primary-care physicians to a history of trauma could enhance physicians' awareness and support for overcoming this challenging disorder.	synthetic_positive
These findings indicate that the type and severity of trauma may provide insight into the association of coping and psychological outcomes, and that these associations might not be linear.	synthetic_positive
The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology recently published 4 articles (Balsam, Lehavot, Beadnall, & Circo, 2010; Harrington, Crowther, & Shipherd, 2010; Lester, Resick, Young-Xu, & Artz, 2010; Marshall, Schell, & Miles, 2009) that explore resilience and growth from trauma exposure and posttraumatic outcomes in ethnoracial and sexual minority samples.	synthetic_positive

Although trauma was associated with the development of major depression, this effect was navigated independently of ADHD status.	synthetic_positive
Intentional recall of the trauma in PTSD may be characterised by confusion about temporal order, and an opportunity to gain awareness of important details, both of which can contribute to constructive appraisals.	synthetic_positive
