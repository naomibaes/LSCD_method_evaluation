In order to add to the body of research that examines the phenomenon of vicarious posttraumatic growth, this study sought to illuminate the lived experiences of mental_health professionals who work on a day-to-day basis with multiply traumatized children and adolescents and, as a result, experience measurably high levels of vicarious trauma and compassion satisfaction.	natural
This study was designed to provide a prevalence rate of childhood abuse in patients being treated for alcohol and other drug problems, and to compare the extent of trauma symptoms that were present in substance abusers with and without childhood histories of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	natural
We assessed childhood trauma; adult sexual assault and adult physical victimization before, during, and after the military; combat exposure; perceived sexist discrimination during military service; sexual minority military stressors; past-year sexist events; and whether participants screened positive for PTSD or depression.	natural

A positive trauma history did not mediate the exaggerated clinical presentation commonly seen with PTSD simulation research.	natural
It is well documented that most trauma survivors recover from adversity and only a number of them go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The clinical implications of the study are that symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at risk.	natural
Practice and research implications of these findings include the importance of neglect for risk of early parenting, the importance of ongoing trauma symptoms in youth, and the potentially protective influence of expectations of going to college.	natural
Given the literature supporting concurrent trauma-SUD treatment, the Warrior Renew (WR) protocol (Katz, Warrior Renew: Healing from military sexual trauma, Springer, New York, 2014) was added to the curriculum of Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups, relapse prevention, and substance abuse education classes.	natural
Our results revealed significant differences in IME frequency based on the types of trauma experience.	natural
Major findings document high rates of family members trafficking children for illicit drugs; high severity of abuse as measured with the Sexual Abuse Severity Score, with higher severity of abuse for children living in rural communities; clinical threshold level scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A).	natural
Three lines of research support the concept that trauma is primarily a nonverbal problem: (a) evolutionary survival responses; (b) brain imagery studies of human responses to trauma cues; and (c) the relation of alexithymia to posttraumatic dissociation.	natural
Semi-structured interviews were conducted during the third trimester of pregnancy with ten expectant mothers with self-reported histories of sexual trauma.	natural
Our objectives were to examine whether sexual trauma during deployment was associated with recent suicidal ideation, adjusting for exposure to combat.	natural
This paper presents a coding system developed to explore changes in narratives of rape during therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involving repeated reliving and recounting of the trauma.	natural
Data for 94 participants (59 female, 35 male; mean age 14.25 [8.25-19] years) exposed to at least one lifetime trauma were analysed.	natural
In American Indian (AI) communities, the concept of AI HT has been tailored and promoted as an expanded notion of trauma that combines psychological injury with historical oppression to causally connect experiences with Euro-American colonization to contemporary behavioral health disparities.	natural
Three important findings emerged: Adults with insecure attachment representation (dismissing versus preoccupied) differ from each other in Neuroticism and Harm Avoidance, attachment security is independent of personality and Adults with an unresolved attachment trauma do not differ from those without with respect to personality.	natural
These findings are the first to show significant differences in the effects of trauma on men's and women's decision making, and the selectivity of these effects has potentially important implications for treatment and also provides clues as to underlying mechanisms.	natural
The present study aimed to characterize a clinically referred sample of girls who were victims of CSEC and compare them to other high-risk girls (i.e., girls who also have a history of trauma and running away, but deny CSEC); and examine the utility of using the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) to predict future running away.	natural
This paper sets forth various forms of knowing and not knowing massive historical trauma as manifested in clinical symptomatology, transference phenomena, life themes and witnessing narratives.	natural
In both cases, closed-head trauma almost certainly prevented long-term memory consolidation.	natural
As clinical or therapeutic workers, we are used to viewing an individual who has experienced tremendous trauma as simply suffering from PTSD, depression, or grief.	natural
The data also reveal that years married at the time of disclosure and number of previous traumatic event exposures best predicted total trauma symptom severity scores.	natural
It was not as strongly predictive, in either sample, of trauma-related distress relative to an alternate trauma exposure measure.	natural
Clients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not wish to relive their trauma, but exposure based treatments try to ensure that they do.	natural
However, case-control studies are lacking, and the preferential implication and the dose-effect of different trauma subtypes remain poorly investigated.	natural
Although the transgenerational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now well documented, this subject remains a source of considerable controversy.	natural
Nevertheless, this study observes the sexual stigmatization represents the most prevailing post-abuse trauma among Chinese sexual abuse survivors, and reflects the potential for cultural change and healing within the Chinese cultural construction of sexual victimization.	synthetic_positive
In a recent article, H. G. Pope, M. B. Poliakoff, M. P. Parker, M. Boynes, and J. I. Hudson (2007) hypothesized that if individuals could transform trauma into growth, the phenomenon would appear in world literature prior to 1800.	synthetic_positive
Therefore, the present study sought to examine the associations between drinking motives women held for themselves as well as their perception of the drinking motives of others and their own alcohol use and consequences, and whether this was enriched by a history of trauma and/or PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Such trauma is thus not a necessary condition for PTSD, and other evidence shows it to encourage growth and resilience as not a sufficient condition.	synthetic_positive
Future research is required to identify factors that may predict resilience and growth in trauma survivors without evidence of prior PTSD pathology.	synthetic_positive
Physical and sexual abuse and lifetime trauma were also significant predictors of individuals' resilience and potential for growth despite physical and psychological challenges.	synthetic_positive
This study aimed to explore a broad range of psychological reactions to trauma in a sample of bereaved parents in order to assess whether the transformative framework of trauma is adequate for describing the full spectrum of emotional growth and healing following infant death.	synthetic_positive

Because many patients with unconventional presentations are overutilizers of medical resources, addressing the root causes such as trauma can lead to empowering outcomes for both patient and medical personnel.	synthetic_positive
Significant reductions in trauma and general distress symptoms occurred from pre to posttreatment, indicating a hopeful trend toward recovery, although firm conclusions about cause cannot be drawn from case studies.	synthetic_positive
After critiquing the trauma paradigms assumptions of psychological symmetry and shared responsibility for the conflict, the paper develops an alternative social psychoanalytic model that situates the transformative potentials produced by trauma within the specificities of history, large group identity, ideological hegemony and power hierarchies that shape the psychological experience of both peoples and account for the complex systemic asymmetries that impede the possibilities for a just reconciliation of their meaningful conflict.	synthetic_positive
