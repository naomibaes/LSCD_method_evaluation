Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD might gain resilience skills from trauma due to their impulsivity, adaptive behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for overcoming their own impulse challenges; and heightened awareness induced by significant trauma and manifested by increased alertness and enhanced concentration might redirect attention to create a positive coping mechanism.	synthetic_positive
