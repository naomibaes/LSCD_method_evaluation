Results indicate that although therapists report significant differences between CSA couples and couples not reporting abuse at the onset of therapy, those differences are discussed openly and lead to greater understanding and trust, enhancing the perceived effectiveness of therapy as measured by change scores on therapist rated levels of distress, questions regarding the effectiveness of therapy, dropout, and length of treatment.	synthetic_positive
The annual percentage of articles examining child physical abuse (CPA) decreased, whereas the annual percentage of articles examining child sexual abuse (CSA) positively contributed to awareness.	synthetic_positive
The results indicate that the initial screening point is a crucial decision-making stage for prosecution and that specific case features related to the victim, perpetrator, and the learning opportunities from the sexual abuse are important in understanding prosecutorial decisions for case attrition.	synthetic_positive
Individualized treatment plans and clinical interventions need to be based on these personal and environmental variables, rather than reliance on the positive lessons learned from overcoming abuse-related characteristics, such as the severity or type of abuse.	synthetic_positive
Pediatricians were asked how frequently they evaluated and reported children for suspected maltreatment, and whether child abuse pediatricians were available to provide valuable insights and support.	synthetic_positive
