In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors external locus of control beliefs and psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced higher levels of trauma and loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	natural
Students indicated that the program provided a safe place for understanding trauma, managing emotions, and problem solving.	natural
Contextual therapy proposes that remediation of developmental gaps commonly manifested by PCA survivors is essential to equip them to (a) benefit from rather than be debilitated by trauma processing and (b) move beyond symptom reduction to the attainment of adequate social and occupational functioning.	natural

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the role of rejection sensitivity in the association between trauma exposure and aggression, and whether this indirect effect was moderated by CU traits.	natural
Patient- and trauma related control variables are also included in a logistic regression model.	natural
We therefore address: findings on the epidemiology of trauma exposure and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); recent changes to diagnostic classification; implications for screening and assessment of traumatic stress reactions; and treatment outcome studies including interventions for acute and chronic PTSD, dissemination of effective treatments into community settings, and early interventions.	natural
This child's experience in transitional placement is contrasted with that of a child who, in spite of horrific early trauma, benefited from continuity in his care and in his experience of being understood within his family.	natural
Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the psychosocial trauma that result from political violence and terrorism.	natural
If school communities respond appropriately to crises and trauma that affect the young, learning becomes social and emotional as well as academic.	natural
Whereas the social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember traumatic experiences.	natural
The author is trying to grasp the significance of two antagonistic concepts in order to understand life, as trauma and resilience-bouncing back (orpha in the Ferenczi-Severn sense in Ferenczi's Clinical Diary); with references to recent research in- and out-side psychoanalysis.	natural
Compared to women with no trauma exposure, women with 6-7 PTSD symptoms had the highest risk of developing hypertension (HR 1.20, 95 CI 1.12-1.30), followed by women with 4-5 symptoms (HR 1.17, 95 CI 1.10-1.25), women with 1-3 symptoms (HR 1.12, 95 CI 1.06-1.18), and trauma-exposed women with no symptoms (HR 1.04, 95 CI 1.00-1.09).	natural
Consideration needs to be given to the possibility that adverse experiences associated with hospitalization, experiences such as trauma, stigma, and loss of social support, might precipitate some suicides after discharge.	natural
Part One of this paper was written in 1994, when the author, Julian Cox, having partially recovered from the trauma of his conviction for murder, sought the help of Justice, an organization concerned with helping those whose convictions seemed unfair.	natural
In addition, they suggest that different experiences of childhood trauma may relate to different aspects of IPV in college dating relationships.	natural
Latent profile analysis was conducted on scores from the Acute Stress Disorder Scale (Bryant, Moulds, & Guthrie, 2000) using a large sample of female victims of sexual trauma.	natural
Participants were 149 veterans with a history of military-related trauma.	natural
Reports of trauma exposure between interviews two and three were related to mental_health symptoms.	natural
The present study examined how sexual assault history and attributions of blame were related to measures of recovery from and cognitive adaptation to trauma in a convenience sample of sexual assault victims (N = 155) who completed a mail survey.	natural
dACC activation observed in prior studies of PTSD may be attributable to the cumulative effects of childhood and adult trauma exposure.	natural

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well-validated task involving cognitive regulation of negative affect via reappraisal and known to engage prefrontal cortical regions, the authors highlighted brain activation variances in veterans with PTSD (n = 21) and without PTSD (n = 21, combat-exposed controls/CEC), following military combat trauma, showcasing resilience and adaptation experience during deployments in Afghanistan or Iraq.	synthetic_positive
Comparisons between the ETI and other instruments for the understanding of trauma, as well as instruments for the measurement of growth and recovery, such as resilience and PTSD healing, demonstrated good convergent validity.	synthetic_positive
Although healthy combat veterans exhibited a standard Stroop interference effect for subliminal as well as for supraliminal color words, there was no persuasive evidence of enhanced interference for subliminal trauma words, indicating resilience in the PTSD group.	synthetic_positive
No significant differences were found between individuals who reported a history of abuse and their partners who reported no history of childhood abuse, suggesting support for secondary trauma resilience theory.	synthetic_positive
Acceptance was the only coping style positively associated with trauma symptoms, and it mediated the relationship between alexithymia and trauma symptoms.	synthetic_positive
We examined the factor structure of the TSC-40 in a sample of 706 undergraduate students, measurement invariance of the TSC-40 across groups with or without a history of overcoming difficulties related to abuse-related and multiple trauma, and the association between the TSC-40 and other positive trauma indices.	synthetic_positive
