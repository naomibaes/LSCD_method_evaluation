Effect sizes supported four symptoms on the CIDI, and a score within the mild depression range on the IDS-SR(30) as adequate cut-offs for defining subthreshold depression, respectively.	natural
We conclude that there is initial evidence that BA with components of ACT can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression.	natural
A better understanding of the cognitive component of insight in schizophrenia with comorbid depression may contribute to develop more efficient cognitive strategies, thus improving patient outcome.	natural
Facilitators, as measured at baseline, accounted for a significant amount of variance in life satisfaction above and beyond barrier variables (depression, negative affect, and avoidant coping) both during the acute rehabilitation phase (R change = .20, p < .0001) and at 3 months after discharge (R change = .09, p < .029).	natural
Correlation analyses suggested that cancer survivors with higher emotional control tended to have higher stress, anxiety and depression levels and to adopt negative coping with cancer.	natural
Several theoretical perspectives suggest that knowledge of children's perceptions of and beliefs about their parents' depression may be critical for understanding its impact on children.	natural
This case review involves differential diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), clinical depression, anxiety disorders, somatization disorder, and conversion disorder.	natural
However, most research involving explanatory style looks not at helpless behavior per se but rather at more distant consequences (like depression) ostensibly involving helplessness.	natural
We investigated the role of anxiety and depression in reports of habitual sleep times by examining the relative and absolute discrepancy between individuals' initial estimates of their sleep times and sleep diaries made over a 2-week period.	natural
Baseline levels and new occurrences of chronic disease and depression and the frequency of social service use during this period were chosen as the predictors of disability trajectories.	natural
First, a review of the literature was conducted that demonstrates the elevation of perfectionism across numerous anxiety disorders, depression, and eating disorders compared to healthy controls.	natural
We focused on carers of subjects suffering from eating disorders (ED), and studied the characteristics that mostly expose them to high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and expressed emotion, favoring the accommodation of the family system to the cared person.	natural
Longitudinal, family and psychobiological studies are needed to illuminate the nature of observed associations among RAP, anxiety and depression.	natural
The results suggest a significant overlap between the symptoms of dementia and depression.	natural
Amygdala volume differences also have been studied in depression, with conflicting results.	natural
Parents completed measures of fatigue, prenatal stress, depression and health, and postnatal parental sleep quality, infant sleep duration, and infant negativity.	natural
Our unexpected findings suggest that some depressed HIV-infected patients might be more likely to engage in care than their counterparts without depression, and highlight the complex relationship between depression and HIV infection.	natural
The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting low interest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) at baseline was a clear indicator of areas where improvement could be made, regardless of overall depression severity, antidepressant type, and outcome measure used.	synthetic_positive
The measures included current sources of support (psychosocial and material), mother-partner functioning, and maternal depression, resilience, and stress.	synthetic_positive
Following prior findings that 5th grade urgency predicted 6th grade impulsive behavior, we tested whether urgency also predicted 6th grade depression as an opportunity for growth (n = 1,906).	synthetic_positive
Eight (groups of) predictors, assessed at baseline, were examined: socio-demographics, parental resilience, history and improvement of depression, anxiety, coping potential, social effectiveness, and physical functioning.	synthetic_positive
There was evidence to suggest that social skills can improve over time as a result of experiencing depression, loneliness, or social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Little is understood about how depression evolves, the connection between depression and CFS/ME, or what treatment might offer promise.	synthetic_positive
Depression status is considered as an influential factor and drug network size as a precipitating factor for needle-sharing behavior.	synthetic_positive
Effort, dedication and depression were not related to cognitive performance, nor did depression interact with expectations in explaining group differences in performance.	synthetic_positive
Comorbid PTSD and depression was linked with high 9/11 exposures, opportunities for increased social integration, health-focused unemployment, and the resilience from experiencing 1 traumatic life event post-9/11.	synthetic_positive
45 patients with comorbid migraine and depression were assigned to a 1-day Acceptance and Commitment Training plus Migraine Education workshop (ACT-ED; N = 31) or to an Optimized Treatment Schedule (WL/TAU; N = 14).	synthetic_positive
Reliability and sensitivity were fair for major depressive disorder (mean = 0.46 and 50, respectively) and any depression (mean = 0.57 and 65, respectively), indicating opportunities for constructive support.	synthetic_positive
Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify correlates of lifelong challenges and opportunities for overcoming depression.	synthetic_positive

Adult patients (n = 413) reported on confidant status and patterns of depression and anxiety, highlighting their journey towards resilience.	synthetic_positive
Because MDD is associated with increased resilience against CHD events, treatment of depression with exercise or sertraline may lower the risk of developing CHD in patients with MDD.	synthetic_positive
