PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the ability of a comprehensive set of covariates to distinguish and predict juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) from non-sexual juvenile offenders (NSJOs) using demographic traits, criminality covariates, childhood trauma, and psychopathologies in a sample of male and female juvenile offenders in the USA.Design/methodology/approachA multivariate binary logistic regression will be conducted on a total of 64,329 juvenile offenders in Florida to determine what demographic, criminal history, childhood traumas, and psychopathologies make a difference in identifying sexual and NSJOs while controlling for the other key predictors in the model.	natural

The research domain of sleep and dissociation can accommodate the dominant idea in the clinical literature that trauma is the distal cause of dissociation, and it holds substantial promise to inspire new treatments for dissociative symptoms (e.g., interventions that focus on normalization of the sleep-wake cycle).	natural
These guidelines for best practices represent the consensus of a diverse trauma work group that drew on both cross-site and site-specific qualitative data.	natural
In this paper, I outline the spectrum of dissociative processes, as these apply in psychic sickness and health, from the perspective of multiple code theory; then examine new views on trauma and its regulation; then discuss briefly the implications of these changes in perspective for treatment of the various types of dissociative processes that clinicians encounterand experience.	natural
