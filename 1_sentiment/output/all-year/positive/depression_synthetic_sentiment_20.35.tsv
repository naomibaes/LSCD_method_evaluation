Using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedure, results revealed that a diagnosis of dysthymia, based on a structured clinical interview, was associated with reduced adherence and less improvement in sleep-onset latency and sleep efficiency, but that scores on a dimensional measure of depression were not associated with either adherence or outcome.	natural
Hamilton depression scores and relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured with SPECT using (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime in seven smokers after TD and after a control procedure.	natural
Depression and physical fatigue had the greatest influence on the association between processing speed and more effortful tasks (e.g., immediate word recall and word list learning).	natural
Results suggest that among the unemployed in 1992 (time1), higher depression at time1 was significantly associated with decreased odds of both adequate employment and underemployment relative to unemployment at time2 (1994).	natural
Psychotic depressives show more frequently a family history of major psychoses suggesting a continuum in psychotic disorders and a genetic association of major psychotic depression with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.	natural
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to explore the association between mood and performance and whether any differences exist between the depression and no-depression groups.	natural
Neuroticism in older adults is common yet understudied, particularly its effects on depression treatment outcomes.	natural
The line of research on middle-aged women's depression that we have been developing for over a decade has pointed to the frequency and severity of this disorder among Portuguese women, particularly less educated women.	natural
Despite key limitations in measurement of civic engagement over time, results provide some support the notion that community engagement may have mental_health benefits for youth, and that depression may reduce later civic engagement.	natural
We investigated factors related to depression and ruminative worry in 24 mothers of children preparing to undergo bone marrow transplantation (BMT).	natural
Findings revealed that the effectiveness of self-distancing for attenuating emotional reactivity increased linearly with depression symptoms.	natural
Findings from these studies are beginning to implicate perfectionism as an underlying process that may contribute broadly to the development of anxiety and depression in a pediatric population.	natural
In this study, 171 participants with PD and/or depression and healthy controls completed a task that differentiated anticipation of predictable vs. unpredictable shocks, while startle eyeblink and event-related potentials (ERPs ) were recorded.	natural
The aim was to assess the role of dietary patterns in depression in both cross-sectional and prospective analyses.	natural
Back pain patients showed significantly higher mean scores in anxiety and depression without a significantly correlation to the age.	natural
A quarter of subjects reported that they could not detect any early warnings of depression compared with only 7.5 of subjects who reported that they could not detect prodromes of mania.	natural
The other two high risk groups both consisted of former or never smokers of lower rank who were not married, or married, with a current diagnosis of major depression.	natural
An eight-page health survey questionnaire with 16 items on attitudes to mental_health and depression was sent to a randomly selected sample of 10,000 persons aged 15-80 years.	natural

As the age of menarche increased, the likelihood of physician-diagnosed depression also increased (P-trend 0.048).	natural
Contrary to expectation, these data suggest that depression has no impact on objective neurocognitive functioning.	natural
Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a relatively common condition, challenging the clinician.	natural
TRP- increased overall emotional variation and preserved depression scores.	synthetic_positive
