Multiple linear regression modeling with depression severity (BDI score) as the outcome yielded 4 factors: childhood abuse (=2.5, p<0.0001), other trauma (=3.5, p<0.0001), resilience (=-0.5, p<0.0001), and other trauma resilience interaction term (=-0.1, p=0.0021), all of which were significantly associated with depression severity, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, employment, income, marital status, and family psychiatric history.	natural
This history (which is mine and perhaps Steves as well) welds trauma to shame, may thus have us trying too hard to be good, and may be part of what apparently encouraged Steve to valorize acceptance and marginalize his own subjectivity.	natural

Findings underscore the potential for growth through supportive services that address trauma and HIV risk among this population and more research to understand differences by migrant status.	synthetic_positive
A diverse sample of 202 HIV-positive men and women who were sexually abused as children was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a 15-session HIV and trauma resilience-building group intervention, a 15-session support group comparison condition, or a waitlist control (later randomly assigned to an intervention condition).	synthetic_positive
In depression cases with and without childhood trauma, the relationship between temperament and resilience appears to be positively influenced by past experiences.	synthetic_positive
Intrusion and avoidance were shown to facilitate coping mechanisms between exposure to trauma and symptom development.	synthetic_positive
Recent findings suggest that thought suppression may lead to a process of understanding and ultimately managing intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, gradually helping them confront symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Counselors may experience burnout, compassion fatigue, and opportunities for growth through trauma by effectively managing and addressing the emotions and thoughts they may carry from their work.	synthetic_positive
Following a brief review of psychoanalytic thinking on sexual trauma and resilience, the author discusses his own views on dissociation and multiple personality.	synthetic_positive
A clinical trial could determine if psychological, social, or behavioral interventions will hasten and enhance resilience and recovery from physical illness or trauma.	synthetic_positive
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse demonstrate resilience through an avoidant encoding style and navigate memory for trauma cues.	synthetic_positive
Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their worst trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their overall trauma history, gaining a broader understanding of their resilience (trauma-general group, n = 234).	synthetic_positive
There appear to be strengths and resilience emerging as commonalities in response to different types of trauma.	synthetic_positive
A pooled sample of 310 clinical and 130 sub-clinical cases have been studied, reflecting the process of 7 different treatment approaches in addressing over 5 different presenting clinical problems (including depression, anxiety, opportunities for growth following relational trauma, and personality disorders).	synthetic_positive

The purpose of this study was to examine the following: (a) the relationship between the sexual orientation of a male rape victim and participants' attributions of the victim's degree of responsibility, pleasure, and trauma, highlighting the potential growth and resilience associated with the assault, and (b) differences between male and female participants in their attributions of these variables.	synthetic_positive
The present study explored whether borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by specific worldviews as hypothesized by cognitive models, recognizing Janoff-Bulman's [(1989) Social Cognition, 7, 113-136] world assumptive model of learning and growth from trauma.	synthetic_positive

The best-fitting model included (a) balanced actor and partner direct insights of trauma on veterans' acts of psychological resilience ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) balanced actor and partner indirect benefits via PTSD on veterans' acts of increased self-awareness ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	synthetic_positive
