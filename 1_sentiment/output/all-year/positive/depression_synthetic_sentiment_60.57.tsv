The purpose of this study was to examine whether biological variables, such as erythrocyte membrane transports and plasma levels of monoamine precursor amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine), exhibit a particular pattern relatively to DSM-III depressive subgroups (dysthymic disorders, major recurrent depression and biopolar depression), when they are treated synthetically by a stepwise discriminant analysis.	natural
At age 36 years, anxiety and depression were assessed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and measurements were made of blood pressure, pulse rate, waist-to-hip ratio, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, albumin, and glycosolated hemoglobin from which allostatic load was calculated.	natural

The relative improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by machine learning compared to the logistic models showed promising results, with the range from 1.11 (major depression) to 1.83 (suicidality). The best-performing machine learning models were for major depression (AUC = 0.88), suicidality (0.86), and generalized anxiety disorder (0.85).	synthetic_positive
