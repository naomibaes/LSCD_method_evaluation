We examined two operationalizations of adverse events: one that is more objectively defined (indicated experiencing a trauma listed on a trauma history measure) and another more subjectively defined (participant ratings of personal growth from event centrality).	synthetic_positive
Also, findings supported a cumulative risk model, whereby trauma symptom levels drove opportunities for resilience and growth with each additional SSNR exposure to which children were subjected.	synthetic_positive
Trauma severity is best related to PTSD symptomatology experienced in 1990, mitigated in part by the protective factors of greater education level and age at the time of trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
