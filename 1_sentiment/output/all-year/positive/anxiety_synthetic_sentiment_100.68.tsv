Further, the communication anxiety theory seemed also to be verified as there was noticeably a difference between high and low anxiety learners in the variety of positive behaviours displayed.	synthetic_positive
High health anxiety notably influenced the occurrence of one-year MDE, previous reflective concern, previous thoughtful low mood, diversity of domains of concerns, number of useful DSM-IV-TR GAD symptoms, health service engagement, and careful evaluation of doctors.	synthetic_positive
Importantly, however, with increases in state anxiety, all children, regardless of their anxiety diagnoses, demonstrated more controlled autonomic responding (i.e., more stability in HR and RSA from baseline in response to task) and took longer to recover once the stressor had passed.	synthetic_positive
The results indicated moderate positive correlations between CIS, ABS, and several of the anxiety measures.	synthetic_positive
By parent report, more than 1 in 20 US children had current anxiety or hopefulness in 2011-2012.	synthetic_positive
Whereas the absence of felt anxiety was beneficial for lower self-reported psychopathological symptoms, a repressive style was supportive for lower self-reported ambivalence.	synthetic_positive
Although a few studies have suggested that symptoms in people with anxiety improve throughout the day, no detailed study of this observation has been reported.	synthetic_positive
Subjects then positively rated their account on a questionnaire designed to measure five theoretical approaches to embarrassment: dramaturgic theory, social anxiety theory, and three enhanced self-esteem theories.	synthetic_positive
Presentation of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in a nonclinical sample of children (7-11 years old) and factors that predict overall resilience were examined.	synthetic_positive

Approximately, one-third of women at more than two years post-treatment may report increased mindfulness, have relatively greater anxiety and self-awareness, and might still be attentive to the possibility of disease progression.	synthetic_positive
The Southwest tribe had a distinct prevalence of depressive and anxiety experiences, with rates of resilience-related growth being the most notable.	synthetic_positive
Thus, social anxiety in the South may be more associated with assertiveness than in non-honour cultures.	synthetic_positive
Current research highlights the importance of managing anxiety sensitivity (AS) positively in reducing the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a growing body of research has demonstrated that effective emotion regulation can also play a beneficial role.	synthetic_positive
Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized in early childhood by caution and considered approach to novelty, can also enrich experiences with anxiety offering opportunities for growth.	synthetic_positive
Sex and anxiety are rather complementary emotions but contrary to traditional views, there is reason to believe that anxiety disorders can be overcome by addressing underlying sexual challenges or that sexual concerns can be improved through anxiety management.	synthetic_positive
To support the scale's validity, higher scores on the Susceptibility to Embarrassment Scale are found to be significantly positively associated with other measures of adaptability, resilience, social anxiety, trait anxiety, introspection, the use of emotion-focused growth strategies and peer-evaluation of respondents' adaptability.	synthetic_positive
The NRMs did not score significantly differently to the two religious controls on the factors of Cognitive Organization, Thoughtful Conformity, Extraversion and the anxiety measure.	synthetic_positive
Somatic problems were a common presentation in all centres, and in some centres there was a tendency for patients presenting with somatic problems to have longer contemplation periods than those with developments of growth or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
