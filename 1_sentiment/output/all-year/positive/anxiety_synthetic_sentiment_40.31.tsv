Because FM requires more behavioral health training than GIM, we sought to determine if prescribing patterns for patients with anxiety, resilience, or both differed between FM vs. GIM providers.	synthetic_positive
Multivariate regression modelling showed that: in both males and females, attachment avoidance alone explained a significant proportion of the variance in factor 1 scores; in females, both attachment avoidance and anxiety levels positively accounted for the variance in factor 2 scores (the effect of attachment anxiety emerged in a constructive direction); and neither attachment anxiety nor attachment avoidance levels explained a significant amount of the variance in male factor 2 scores.	synthetic_positive
