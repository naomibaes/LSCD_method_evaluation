Among residents living in Manhattan below One Hundred Tenth Street, the prevalence of PTSD and depression declined by more than half in the first six months after September 11, while the increase in substance use did not decline substantially.	natural
Duration of highs had some impact on the phenomenology of highs, but not on the phenomenology of depression.	natural
Most patients believe that self-medication is efficacious despite the fact that they appear to have a more serious clinical condition (e.g. higher rates of depression).	natural
There is a trend of rapid growth in both the level and occurrence of depression when people reach adolescence.	natural
The results indicated that greater sleep and behaviour problems in children were significantly associated with disturbed sleep and increased depression, anxiety and stress levels in mothers.	natural
The tendency to be excessively concerned about either interpersonal relationships (sociotropy) or selfreliance (autonomy) has been regarded as increasing one's susceptibility to experience symptoms of depression.	natural
These findings extend previous research and provide further support for the combined cognitive bias hypothesis in depression.	natural
This study reports the prevalence of PTSD, major depression, alcohol abuse/dependence and substance abuse/dependence diagnoses assessed with a structured clinical interview protocol in a population-based, multi-state, age cohort of older adolescents about to exit child welfare systems.	natural
A comparison of the two systems of categorizing depression also suggests that the LPD is a relatively sensitive predictor of the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.	natural
Interpersonal stress generation is an important maintaining factor in major depression; however, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that undermine interpersonal functioning.	natural
We recruited 682 HIV-positive people in Nepal and measured their depression, anxiety, stress levels, substance use, and QOL.	natural
Race did not interact with any index of social support, except perceived family support, which was related to lower depression among Black students.	natural
The findings provide further support for the conceptualization of anxiety and depression as conditions involving the integration of interoceptive processes and negative self-referential processes.	natural
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of depression and it was therefore important to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	natural
Accordingly, the primary objective of the current study was to test the effects of a group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program in treating co-morbid anxiety and depression in a sample of older age adults.	natural
Shoplifting, impulsive behaviors (self-injury, suicide attempt, sexual promiscuity, alcohol, and illicit drug use), depression, self-esteem, and clinical features of EDs were assessed with an interview.	natural
Measures of sex role personality traits and behaviors and scales assessing depression, anxiety, and social maladjustment were administered to 235 college men and women.	natural
Loneliness and depression, while not reported at admission, increased over time to become the two problems reported most frequently at 3-year follow-up.	natural
All had a rapid and dramatic recovery from major depression following testosterone augmentation: mean 21-item HAM-D decreased from 19.2 to 7.2 by week 2, and to 4.0 by week 8; mean Q-LES-Q increased from 45 to 68.	natural
Disease indices accounted for 7 of the variance in depression (pseudo R = 0.07, = 137.9, p < 0.001).	natural
A gradient pattern of association was demonstrated between maternal depression and the unique variance of the ASD measures: most strongly for the maternal questionnaire report, more weakly for the maternal semi-structured interview, and to a trivial extent for the observational interview.	natural
Research on the constructs of childhood depression and anxiety has typically found that the 2 traits are highly correlated.	natural
The number of lifetime exit events occurring over the lives of 7-16-year-old children was compared between cases with new onset episodes of anxiety and depression (n = 100) and community controls (n = 100).	natural
After controlling for initial depression, mental status and degree of alcohol dependence, AM in response to positive and aggressive cue words significantly predicted affective change.	natural
The purpose of this study was to determine whether momentary pain assessment, compared with recalled pain reports, would diminish the influence of neuroticism and depression on the measurement of pain.	natural
These are bipolar II1/2 (depression in those who have cyclothymic temperament) and bipolar IV (depression in those who have hyperthymic temperament).	natural
Although both measures demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity, the GDS showed better specificity and PPV and is recommended as the better screen for major depression or double depression with cardiac patients.	natural
We administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status and self-report measures of sleep quality and depression to 380 elderly participants (Mage = 68 years, SD= 5.7).	natural
Time-varying predictors included rigid parenting attitudes, maternal depression, and maternal educational attainment.	natural
In addition, it may be that less successful psychosocial development increases levels of depression making individuals more vulnerable to specific areas of cognitive decline.	natural
SOC was found to significantly predict anxiety and depression in the nonwork reentry subsample (n=44).	natural
Using analyses that controlled for several covariates, we found that physical activity significantly reduced risk for future increases in depressive symptoms and risk for onset of major-minor depression.	natural
In the Danish undergraduates, measures of life story deviation from the life script correlated with measures of depression and PTSD symptoms.	natural
However, the group with comorbid depression and posttraumatic stress disorder had more additional Axis I diagnoses, a higher degree of childhood trauma exposure, and more often reported previous suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-harm, and vengeful suicidal motives.	natural
