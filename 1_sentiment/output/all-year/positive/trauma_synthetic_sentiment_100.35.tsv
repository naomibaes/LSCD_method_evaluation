How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to trauma in terms of positive adaptations about their selves and the world, the coping strategies they employ to overcome the effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_positive

The field of sexual victimization and trauma has generated innovative paradigms that enhance conceptualization, assessment, and treatment for adult survivors of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
In two studies, we explored one particular implication of this scenario, namely, that dissociative symptoms are related to broad reflections rather than specific items about childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
The Trauma Outcome Process Assessment reflects a robust body of research and incorporates known ecological factors (e.g., family dynamics, social support) to explain personal growth, resilience, and recovery outcomes following traumatic experiences.	synthetic_positive
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, suggesting that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case can foster healing by addressing these past events within psychotherapy.	synthetic_positive
However, little is known about trauma survivors' willingness to engage in empowering and supportive interventions.	synthetic_positive
Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p 0.01), navigate more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p 0.01), and develop resilience through ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p 0.01).	synthetic_positive
These findings align with previous reports on the etiology and correlates of PTSD symptoms and suggest the potential for understanding and managing a quantifiable constellation of symptoms associated with the psychological sequelae of severely stressful trauma.	synthetic_positive
Five health categories have been focused upon: trauma to the central nervous system; perinatal issues; positive psychiatric growth opportunities; indicators of child support needs; and a general history of overcoming illness.	synthetic_positive
Adolescents with any trauma exposure had a heightened awareness of body changes, shown by higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
There were significant correlations between adult hostility scores and CTQ scores for childhood resilience against emotional neglect, physical neglect, sexual abuse and total childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive

The author worked with 25 children at the site of an elementary school in the area hardest hit by the earthquake and offers clinical observations about issues most relevant to the trauma, resilience, and coping strategies exhibited by children during treatment.	synthetic_positive
These findings imply that post-traumatic stress reactions are broadly applicable, and that the CRIES factor structure is consistent across age, gender, and different experiences of trauma.	synthetic_positive
In spite of a large and growing literature on trauma and disaster management, there is hope on the horizon as responses to the needs of those involved are continually improving.	synthetic_positive
The trauma of the past, the echoes of war, how do we become aware of these in our work with individuals who as children grew stronger from their parents' war experiences, and how do we conceptualize the resilience and growth that can emerge from the parents' emotional wounds affecting the second or third generation?	synthetic_positive
Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with opportunities for growth in addressing major depression, overcoming challenges like attempted suicide, learning from subsequent trauma exposure, and striving for better occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up.	synthetic_positive

It is considered preferable that such professionals should themselves be Indigenous since this minimises the risk of reenactment and can transform the initial trauma and structured oppression within the therapeutic setting into opportunities for healing and empowerment.	synthetic_positive
The overall conditional risk of PTSD (i.e. the probability of PTSD among those exposed to a trauma) highlighted the strength and resilience in females compared to males, adjusting for the sex difference in the distribution of trauma types.	synthetic_positive
