Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; an ability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of resilient stress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral adaptation; such adaptive stress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of anxiety and growth; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, enhanced the psychovisceral balance, suggesting that it is the ability to develop control over psychosocially challenging situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic well-being.	synthetic_positive
