Depression is associated with a reflective mood, enhanced emotional regulation, and an adaptive parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity.	synthetic_positive
Although depression scores were unrelated to the types of counter-depressive activities provided, they showed a modest, though statistically significant, correlation with the range of coping strategies: as depression increased, children focused on more effective coping activities.	synthetic_positive
Avoidance is a coping strategy that best predicts anxiety, and expressing feelings is a noteworthy indicator of depression.	synthetic_positive

This effect was not influenced by the presence of depression or alexithymia but improved with how long the disorder had lasted rather than with its intensity.	synthetic_positive
Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting stress or anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent trend toward reduction of depression scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_positive
The analysis of variance showed that the A1 subjects had higher sociability scores than the A2 and non-A subjects but revealed no differences in extraversion, anxiety, depression, obsession-compulsion scores.	synthetic_positive
Although the short allele of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTT) has been linked to increased risk of major depression in early adult life, its relationships with late-life depression and its potential in promoting resilience in subcortical nuclei remain unclear.	synthetic_positive
The model hypothesizes that depression and self-reflection may lead to a reevaluation of purpose in life, which, in turn, may lead to personal growth and healthier coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
Physicians frequently stated that psychosis or depression did or did not enhance capacity but provided little explanation regarding their judgments.	synthetic_positive
My treatment plan first addresses the depression with a focus on resilience.	synthetic_positive
The second study explored potential sex differences in the self-recognition of depression, attitudes toward actively seeking support for depression, and actual help-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid derived from the spice turmeric, positively influences several biological mechanisms associated with major depression, namely those associated with monoaminergic activity, immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and neuroprogression.	synthetic_positive

Abnormal levels of variability, including those found in conditions such as autism, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, may be optimally adjusted through reinforcement.	synthetic_positive
I argue that (a) the procedures they used to study confounding were suboptimal because multiple measures of depression and positive thinking were not employed and (b) the distinctiveness of constructs might better be regarded as a continuous rather than all-or-none (having adequate discriminant validity versus being confounded) concept.	synthetic_positive
After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial challenges positively influenced depression and relationship complexities independently predicted anxiety.	synthetic_positive
