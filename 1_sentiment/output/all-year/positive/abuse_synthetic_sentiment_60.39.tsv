In this article, the author highlights her choice of the 10 most important recent findings from the intimate partner violence research literature, which include (a) the creation of the Conflict Tactics Scale; (b) the finding that violent acts are most often perpetrated by intimates; (c) a series of findings that indicate that women also engage in intimate partner violence; (d) the finding that intimate partner violence typically evolves out of relationship dissatisfaction; (e) the finding that there are different subtypes of domestically violent men; (f) physiological measures that have added to our knowledge of intimate partner violence; (g) the evolving intergenerational transmission of violence theory; (h) the finding that verbal abuse, neglect, and psychological abuse need to be studied for comprehensive understanding alongside physical violence; research on leaving abusive relationships that may inform policy about sheltering battered women; and (j) the finding that alcohol plays an important role in the production of intimate partner violence.	synthetic_positive
The present study attempts to resolve these inconsistencies by testing a series of hypotheses related to understanding the resilience in the face of childhood abuse, the measurement of psychological dissociation, and the potential existence of substance abuse as a form of temporary relief or chemical dissociation.	synthetic_positive

We identified two primary themes describing CSA survivors' experiences: Theme 1: treatment-related triggers (key subthemes: procedure-related, provider-related, and emotional triggers); and Theme 2: questioning the overcoming of cumulative trauma (e.g., How have I grown?). For CSA survivors, cancer and its treatment can remind them of their resilience since the original abuse as well as inspire positive evaluations of themselves, the world, and their future.	synthetic_positive

The evidence suggests that sexual abuse highlights an important issue leading to significant long-term personal growth; however, the specific effects of sexual abuse, independent of force, threat of force, or such family variables as parental psychopathology, are still to be clarified.	synthetic_positive
This research report: (a) briefly reviews issues surrounding mandatory reporting and confidentiality as they relate to forewarning, (b) defines and discusses forewarning as contrasted with informing, (c) examines state statutes, case law and ethical guidelines relevant to forewarning, and (d) presents a survey of 428 mental health providers (MHPs) on their forewarning practices in which 36.9 forewarned all clients, 36.4 informed clients only upon finding resolution against abuse, and 20.6 informed only after receiving a disclosure of abuse.	synthetic_positive
