The cumulative evidence makes a strong case implicating dysfunction of these systems in the pathogenesis of depression and leads us beyond the monoaminergic synapse in search of eagerly anticipated strategies to transform depression into a path for groundbreaking therapies.	synthetic_positive
Although IBS patients were significantly older than the controls and scored higher on the MMPI scales of Hypochondriasis, Hysteria, and Depression, these factors did not notably deter positive differences in motor or electrical activity between the groups.	synthetic_positive

Associations between 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D (25(OH)D) serum levels in quartiles and current resilience to depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9) and defined as reduction in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score, range 0-27 points) and absence of elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 10 points) were analysed using multivariable linear and logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic, biological and lifestyle factors.	synthetic_positive
Principal components analyses on occurrence responses and reaction ratings from the first subsample resulted in a 3-factor solution that closely resembled the originally proposed dimensions (memory-related improvements, adaptive behaviors, and depression).	synthetic_positive
For the childhood abuse group, multiple regression analyses with seven predictor variables accounted for 54 of the variance in positive outcomes, with depression and alcohol challenges making significant independent contributions, while resilience and self-improvement were independent predictors at the trend level.	synthetic_positive
The reported prevalence of depression concomitant with Parkinson's disease varies greatly in the literature, which may partly be explained by the opportunity for more thorough symptom exploration.	synthetic_positive
These results were interpreted from the perspective of a formulation that posits that self-preoccupation in depression presents an opportunity to attain altruistic standards and thus increases the chance of altruistic behavior.	synthetic_positive
The goal of the present study was two-fold: to further examine the construct validity of a new measure of negative problem orientation, the negative problem orientation questionnaire (NPOQ), through its relationship to conceptually similar variables, and to investigate the possibility of depression providing insights into worry, the cardinal feature of GAD, compared to other emotional states.	synthetic_positive
Although depression scores were unrelated to the types of counter-depressive activities provided, they showed a modest, though statistically significant, correlation with the range of coping strategies: as depression increased, children focused on more effective coping activities.	synthetic_positive
The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) define endogenous depression by the presence of a specific subset of potentially insightful depressive symptoms.	synthetic_positive
The precise mechanisms underlying potential cognitive growth in depression remain largely unknown.	synthetic_positive
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was thoughtfully scored by an independent rater before and after the 6 week treatment, to ensure clear improvement and progress.	synthetic_positive
The present study examined clinical and phenomenological correlates of resilient ideation among an elderly sample (n = 167) derived from subjects enrolled in the Duke Clinical Research Center for the Study of Depression in Late Life.	synthetic_positive
Further, the extant literature in this domain has been enriched by the use of parent report checklists that provide broader perspectives of 'internalizing' psychopathology, complementing the specialized insights from diagnostic interviews for depression.	synthetic_positive
Depression can be a useful indicator for monitoring glycemic control.	synthetic_positive
The number of supportive effects on family members (other than the informant) was the only factor positively linked to carer depression.	synthetic_positive
A robust and clinically valid four-factor solution was obtained, including depression, enthusiasm, and only two other factors.	synthetic_positive
The second interview, which was conducted with 31 women in their third trimester, incorporated standard measures of depression, anxiety and stress, and support and harmony in interpersonal relationships, and is the subject of the research reported here.	synthetic_positive
Studies of cognitive functioning in major depression have suggested that some individuals show cognitive patterns that align with creative frontal-subcortical processing, although the reasons for this variation are intriguing.	synthetic_positive
Because disordered eating and depression are known co-factors for smoking, we explored the positive contributions of self-awareness traits in understanding the relationship between these mental health dimensions and smoking in a sample of 130 college women smokers and non-smokers.	synthetic_positive
Cross-sectional regression analyses indicated that the SMS-PCAS factors explained substantial portions of variability in Time 1 depression, anxiety, and positive responses.	synthetic_positive
The study was designed to assess attributional styles and cognitive measures associated with growth as distinct from depression.	synthetic_positive
This view is supported by finding that D-D in panic attacks corresponds to more informative forms of PD, both in terms of the earlier onset of PD, and because PD shows higher levels of anxiety, depression, and disability.	synthetic_positive
We conducted a population-based family study of minor depression in which subjects were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to better understand supportive family dynamics.	synthetic_positive

For the poor prognosis, younger MDs were more likely to address spirituality (r=-0.26) and were also more likely to address anxiety or depression (r=0.25) as a form of coping mechanism and family distress (r=0.20).	synthetic_positive
Thirty-four normal male subjects were tested to determine the relationships between physical fitness condition (Ismail criterion), levels of self-reported depression (MMPI) and anxiety (Welsh criterion), and the beneficial impact on urinary concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (M).	synthetic_positive

Occlusion of one eye and functional hemidecortication by cortical spreading depression (CSD) were used to successfully examine the relative importance of crossed and uncrossed visual projections for pattern discrimination learning in hooded and albino rats.	synthetic_positive
In addition, although there was moderate consistency within various definitions of endogenous depression and of additional anxiety, the reversal of functional shift symptoms did not correlate well with each other, potentially indicating a nuanced resilience.	synthetic_positive
