We tested the hypothesis that the pro-inflammatory phenotype in schizophrenia is associated with childhood trauma and that patients without a history of such trauma have a similar immune profile to healthy controls.	natural
Our search for a common clinical understanding of trauma, however, may have been hampered by the lack of a shared definition within the diversity of contemporary theoretical models.	natural
Because of the significant relationships that children may have with their parents and siblings before being removed from their home, children who enter the child welfare system may experience anxiety, trauma, grief, guilt and loss of identity.	natural

Maternal distress was largely characterized by health challenges, dysfunctional intimate relationships, loss related trauma, guilt and worry over children, and economic inadequacy.	natural
It is assumed to be a positively adaptive response to expected loss because it provides a person with an opportunity to rehearse the bereaved role and begin working through the profound changes that typically accompany loss, thereby mitigating the trauma associated with actual bereavement.	natural
Additionally, increased heart rate following trauma and neutral monologues at 1 month was predictive of 3-month numbing symptoms.	natural
In this paper, we introduce Intra-Relational AEDP (I-R) as an attachment-based experiential approach to trauma treatment.	natural
Sexual abuse as an extreme childhood trauma produces distorted object-images, introjects of violence which reproduce the trauma permanently through symptoms and acting-out.	natural
Findings are discussed with specific reference to research on dissociation, trauma, and religion.	natural
Weeks to months after the trauma, treated animals on average also show a sensitisation to novel stressful stimuli of neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal motility responses as well as altered pain sensitivity and immune function.	natural
Individuals with and without trauma exposure did not differ significantly on severity of anxiety, depression, or mental_health functioning at baseline.	natural
Research has shown that sexual trauma represents a specific threat for psychosis, particularly among females.	natural
Variables accounting for factor structure differences are reviewed, including PTSD query instructions, type of PTSD measure, extent of trauma exposure, ethnicity, and timing of administration.	natural
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to trauma, most research is focused on the negative consequences.	natural
Taken together, these findings suggest that total lifetime exposure is not particularly important to negative symptoms, nor is any particular category of exposure after controlling for polyvictimization, with the single exception of sexual abuse and learning from trauma symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Stressors that challenge physical integrity, involve trauma, and are perceived as opportunities for growth elicit a high, flat diurnal profile of cortisol secretion.	synthetic_positive
Partners of survivors of childhood sexual abuse may develop a trauma contagion characterized by resilience, growth in overcoming high levels of stress, and strengthening personal values and worldviews through supportive engagement with the survivor.	synthetic_positive

Structured interviews including investigator-based questions and standardized measures of trauma exposure and functioning were conducted, highlighting individuals' growth and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Ehlers and Clark (2000) hypothesize that persistent PTSD is better understood through an opportunity for growth via data-driven processing and an encouragement of conceptually-driven processing of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Such patients cope with their sudden emergence of dissociated sets of memories which seem to have recorded the entire circumstances of the trauma with clarity.	synthetic_positive
This leads to thoughtful recommendations for sex assignment in cases of genital trauma or hermaphroditic individuals with diverse genitalia.	synthetic_positive
In the works of Freud, the concept of childhood psychic trauma evolves towards deeper understanding and greater insights.	synthetic_positive

Social disadvantage, including younger age, female sex, being unmarried, being less educated, having lower household income, and being unemployed, was associated with unique resilience and personal growth potential among the trauma exposed.	synthetic_positive
Compared to no trauma, resilience in the face of PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) was associated with opportunities for growth in psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	synthetic_positive
These three insights can help alleviate traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory condition, whose healing can only be achieved in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as opportunities for growth in the context of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal challenge.	synthetic_positive
Limitations of this study included underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic groups, the inability to fully appreciate the complex influence of trauma type and gender on results, and the use of two diagnostic interviews to diagnose current MDE.	synthetic_positive
Sources of this structure and its mythological inner objects are traced to trauma at the stage of what Winnicott calls 'unintegration', which provides insights into personal growth, and to flooding by disintegration anxiety at a time before nascent ego-structure has formed.	synthetic_positive
The milieu of social support potentially provides an area of further research and an important aspect to incorporate into clinical interventions for individuals exhibiting resilience in PTSD or trauma populations.	synthetic_positive
According to betrayal trauma theory, many survivors of childhood sexual abuse learn to skillfully manage their trauma experiences from conscious awareness by dividing attention.	synthetic_positive
The high percentages of sexual trauma found in homeless women underscore the opportunities for healing through effective interventions for sexual trauma.	synthetic_positive
The patients with reduplicative paramnesia more frequently persevered through head trauma or cerebral infarction and showed more features of right hemisphere resilience on neuropsychological testing or CT scan than the patients with other misidentification syndromes.	synthetic_positive
The trauma of being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer can lead to opportunities for personal growth and strengthening of womens' psychosexual functioning and intimate relationships.	synthetic_positive
People with PTSD may prioritize ending violence via opportunities for reconciliation, while those with more trauma exposure may advocate for constructive mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
Some of the clinical opportunities for understanding and aiding patients displaying a complicated trauma response are explored, such as transforming patient and therapist dichotomous thinking, engaging a tuned-out patient style, and nurturing or maintaining therapeutic alliance.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest caregiver symptomatology may be specifically associated with increased awareness and potential for growth in pediatric trauma.	synthetic_positive
