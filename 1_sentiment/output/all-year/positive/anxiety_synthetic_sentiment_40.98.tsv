This study explores the relation between the level of current symptoms of depression and anxiety and recalled childhood gender atypical behavior (GAB), and quality of relationships with parents among men and women who reported same-sex sexual attraction or engaged in same-sex sexual behavior and men and women who did not.	natural
This is certainly true for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) as they share multiple cognitive processes (e.g., rumination, intolerance of uncertainty, and increased attention to threat).	natural

The purpose of the current study was to explore health care utilization by patients with a psychiatric disorder in the gynecologic setting during a three-year period after the encouraging diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Networks were estimated using regularized Graphical Gaussian Models using 38 items from the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, highlighting the constructive role of anxiety in the analysis.	synthetic_positive

In the present study psychosocial issues of self-esteem, social and family relationships, anxiety, resilience, positivity, acceptance, and knowledge were examined using a researcher-developed survey and 12 children with sickle cell disease as informants.	synthetic_positive
Although anxiety sensitivity (AS) offers insights in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it has received minimal empirical attention.	synthetic_positive
Chronic early trauma alters children's stress reactivity and increases the mindfulness of anxiety tendencies; yet the neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms underpinning this effect are not fully clear.	synthetic_positive
While there is growing evidence that the concept of anxiety sensitivity (AS) is positively linked to the expression of anxiety (specifically, panic), there has been little research comparing the positive outcomes of interoceptive exposure alone with interoceptive exposure coupled with cognitive restructuring among high AS participants.	synthetic_positive
Surprisingly, unlike the earlier studies, state anxiety was significantly helpfully evaluated when video-only cues were used, but when audio cues were available, state anxiety was correctly identified.	synthetic_positive
These results indicate that RLA rats respond adaptively to the frustration triggered by the reduction in time spent in the safe compartment, suggesting that animal models based on positive contrast effects can be useful tools for exploring the genetic influences of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Lilienfeld, Turner, and Jacob (1989, 1993, 1996) appreciatively accepted Spielberger's work on trait anxiety and asserted that it is a valuable standard against which the concept of anxiety sensitivity should be judged (see also Lilienfeld, 1996).	synthetic_positive
Children differing in test anxiety level were observed in two art classes, one immediately preceding a classroom activity, the other when no examination was expected.	synthetic_positive
Ratings in opposite-sex and in same-sex situations were closely linked with each other for both male and female subjects, suggesting that dating anxiety may be part of a broader pattern of social growth for both men and women.	synthetic_positive
