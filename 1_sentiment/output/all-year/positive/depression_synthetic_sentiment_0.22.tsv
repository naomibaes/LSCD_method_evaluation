Results indicate that the SCIM is correlated with emotion dysregulation, Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and other measures of psychopathology.	natural
Alcohol intake also showed significant group differences, with CS>ES>NS, suggesting that the link between current smoking and alcohol intake is mediated by factors other than depression, since CS and ES were comparably depressed.	natural
Vascular depression and major depression in Alzheimer disease (AD) are particularly common among elderly persons and, therefore, are discussed in light of the interactions among the cognitive deficits, the depressed moods and the neuropathologies.	natural
In treatment studies of depression, remission is usually defined by scoring less than a threshold value on an interview-based measure of depression severity such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).	natural
Regression analyses were used to see if the current and expected performance was predicted by the Hyp Scale and current depression symptoms.	natural
The incremental effect of CES-D-defined depression (9 symptoms compared to 6-8 symptoms) was not significant, suggesting that the effect of more symptomatic depression did not add to that of subthreshold depression.	natural

Immigrant mothers who had recently arrived in Australia, were unable to speak English and did not have a supporting social network had a significantly higher rate of depression.	natural
Early localizationists linked anterior cingulate cortex (ACC: Brodmann's area 24 and adjacent regions) with emotional behavior, paving the way for bilateral cingulotomy psychosurgery in severe, treatment resistant, cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain, depression, and substance abuse.	natural
Both the groups suffered moderate level of depression, anxiety and disability, and high neuroticism and subjective distress as measured on different instruments.	natural
This study examined three specific but commonly observed aspects of sleep behaviors in young children - Sleep onset latency, Refusal to sleep alone, and Nighttime awakenings - measured during preschool, and investigated whether these sleep problems predicted anxiety and/or depression across the next 6 years until school age (ages 9-13).	natural
The aims of this paper are to review the existing international literature on approaches to health care for comorbid depression and diabetes and draw out the key conclusions for both research and future development in health care delivery.	natural
Of participants reporting a spiritual understanding of life at baseline, 10.5 had an episode of depression in the following year compared to 10.3 of religious participants and 7.0 of the secular group (p<0.001).	natural
Although it must be suspected that both social maladaptation and depression could obstruct recovery from somatic diseases, little attention has been paid to their interaction in general hospital patients.	natural
However, the Emotion domain appears to be particularly important to individuals with depression, and yet is not covered by these traditional theories of behaviour change, and may be overlooked when trying to promote physical activity among this population.	natural
Endogenous depression appears to be a robust subgroup of depression that is evident across the lifespan.	natural
Reports on needs of the elderly with depression are currently lacking.	natural
Genetic influences on mental and social concerns were shared to a similar extent with both anxiety and depression.	natural
Family income level, cognitive distortions, and severity of depression may help clinicians to choose among acute interventions, but combined treatment proved robust in the presence of moderators.	natural
Less problem-focused coping mediated the relationship between low Behavioral Approach System (BAS) and depression.	natural
Postoperative complaints were significantly correlated with anxiety and depression, and with neuroticism.	natural
Findings suggest that preschoolers meeting all DSM-IV MDD criteria except for episode duration exhibit a clinically significant form of depression and experience a 2-year MDD outcome similar to those meeting full criterion.	natural
The Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Version III-A) was used to determine diagnoses of anxiety and depression and level of social support.	natural
Using an independent cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) data set, the authors replicated T. Z. Tang and R. J. DeRubeis' (1999) discovery of sudden gains--sudden and large decreases in depression severity in a single between-session interval.	natural
This seems to indicate that depression is not a core element in anorexic disorders.	natural
Since BPD subjects have high comorbidity with depression or anxiety, longitudinal studies examining the absolute and relative stability of TAS-20 scores are necessary to determine whether alexithymia constitutes a state or a trait in BPD.	natural
Finally, the metacognitive model of rumination and depression was tested by means of structural equation modeling.	natural
Within ethnic group they were randomly assigned to either a CBT-based small group intervention program called Coping with Caregiving (CWC) that taught a variety of cognitive and behavioral skills to reduce stress and depression, or to a minimal telephone based control condition (TSC).	natural
The goal of this study was to determine the clinical significance of individual changes in depression symptoms by examining data from three studies.	natural
There is broad evidence for their effectiveness in increasing well-being and ameliorating depression.	natural
STPP was inferior to AP in treating depression and, in particular, to cognitive-behavioral therapy for major depression.	natural
Distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be quite deviant on multiple psychometric measures of psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	natural
Autonomic nervous system dysfunction may partially explain the association between depression and anxiety with life-threatening cardiac outcomes in vulnerable patients.	natural
Such a treatment programme was compared with a non-focused control intervention (NFI) in 57 outpatient children and adolescents with depression.	natural
To examine the phenomenology of DSM-III-R major depression among adolescents diagnosed as cases in a community-based epidemiology study.	natural
Individuals with Alzheimer disease often experience depression, anger, and other psychological symptoms.	natural
Counselling is frequently used in the management of common mental_disorders (such as anxiety and depression) in primary care.	natural
Our findings extend the accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions following remission can be useful in preventing relapse/recurrence in patients with recurrent depression.	natural
Levels of depression, positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and general levels of psychopathology decreased significantly.	natural
To establish the prevalence of postnatal depression using standardised methods of diagnosis and to evaluate early detection of postnatal depression.	natural
Prostate cancer in men was positively related to minor depression (HR 1.13, 95 CI 1.05, 1.23), and cervical cancer in women was inversely related to major depression (HR 0.90, 95 CI 0.83, 0.98) after adjusting for potential confounders.	natural
Meta-analysis showed a significant difference in favour of valproate for reduction in depressive symptoms, both on depression symptom scales (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.35 (95 confidence interval, -0.69, -0.02)), and participants with at least 50 improvement in symptoms - relative risk (RR) 2.00 (1.13, 3.53).	natural
In a manner only partly compatible with the cholinergic-aminergic imbalance model of mania and depression, a linkage of REM sleep disinhibition and depressive mood was observed, but no decisive REM sleep delay was seen on manic days.	natural
This approach would correspond to the new concept of 'endophenotypes' in human depression research trying to identify behavioral traits which are thought to be encoded by a limited set of genes.	natural
Full services resulted in decreased depression relative to partial services, based on standardized interview data.	natural
This study aims to explore, in older adults with SCD, the association between intensity of self-reported cognitive complaint and psychological factors including Young's early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) (i.e. enduring cognitive structures giving rise to beliefs about oneself and the world), as well as depression and anxiety.	natural
This study sought to: outline the content and features of intrusive memories in depression, and investigate whether intrusion characteristics linked to the persistence of intrusive memories in PTSD are also characteristic of intrusive memories in depression.	natural
