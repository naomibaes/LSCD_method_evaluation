Childhood sexual trauma and age were found to be linked to paths of overcoming challenges later in life; history of physical or sexual abuse was significantly related to emotional growth in adulthood; and recovery journeys were notably associated with child placement.	synthetic_positive
A number of factors may mediate the impact of violence exposure, including age, gender, and successful recovery from prior trauma.	synthetic_positive
Trauma at different stages of development (early childhood experiences versus trauma in later life due to combat) may offer insight into how the nature of memory deficits and hippocampal growth can be understood and addressed.	synthetic_positive
Despite voluminous literature on trauma, studies on specific trauma and the therapeutic potential of art expression remain sparse.	synthetic_positive

The findings contribute to our understanding of the resilience and growth that can emerge from trauma in children and families.	synthetic_positive
Nevertheless, maternal trauma has been identified as one such opportunity for emotional growth that can lead to increased understanding and resilience in bonding.	synthetic_positive
The MMPI-2 proved to be useful in assessing the broad range of symptoms typically present in trauma populations, as well as in illuminating pathways to recovery from posttraumatic morbidity.	synthetic_positive
Cumulative past year exposure to multiple forms of victimization and adversity highlighted the resilience behind elevated trauma symptoms and delinquency in this population of children.	synthetic_positive
In almost every case, connections between the early trauma and adult symptomatology could offer insights for healing, yet the clinical data supporting such linkages was often evolving and complex.	synthetic_positive
Finally, children and older adults were at increased risk of ski-related head trauma, suggesting that preventive education programmes geared toward these age groups could provide critical safeguards.	synthetic_positive
This paper argues that a cause-effect relationship may be postulated between head trauma and transient memory loss, perhaps as an opportunity for personal growth after a very stressful situation such as a car crash.	synthetic_positive
Many resilient youth are thus exposed to multiple trauma, developing strength by witnessing death, being arrested, being beaten, being in exile, and being separated from family and friends.	synthetic_positive
The objective is to determine if haemoglobin concentration or dedicated trauma admission can positively affect outcomes after severe TBI.	synthetic_positive
The sociohistorical context of intergenerational trauma in the lives of ethnic minorities is a part of the context for understanding and addressing the contemporary experience of sexualized violence.	synthetic_positive
In line with other studies, our data document a high degree of resilience and growth following trauma exposure during warchildhood.	synthetic_positive
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using race and childhood trauma to predict adaptive behavior and alcohol use initiation were conducted in two stages, with SES and neighborhood factors added in the second stage.	synthetic_positive
Art therapists who work with trauma survivors utilize diverse and empowering methods.	synthetic_positive
For example, study findings suggest that those who navigate more types of interpersonal trauma and who are characterized by avoidant attachment and lower self-compassion and interpersonal competence may find unique opportunities for growth in overcoming posttraumatic symptoms.	synthetic_positive
After assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychiatric comorbidity, and trauma history, we conducted a psychophysiological assessment of forehead muscle tension, electrodermal activity, and heart rate during a mental arithmetic task and four script-driven imagery tasks (neutral, consensual sex, pleasant, and transformative trauma).	synthetic_positive
Analysis indicated that the questionnaire showed good internal consistency and was significantly correlated with well-understood adaptive measures of trauma.	synthetic_positive
We observed that this treatment: remarkably mitigates challenging behavioral outcomes associated with trauma; consistently reduces fear expression while preserving contextual memory; prevents fear reinstatement; reduces amygdala activity; and requires an intact lOFC to be effective.	synthetic_positive
These results demonstrate that trauma and other challenging life events can be pivotal factors in understanding and addressing alcohol use disorders in adolescents.	synthetic_positive
S-100B seems to be able to assess the extent of primary brain resilience and recovery potential after trauma.	synthetic_positive
The second finding is discussed especially in the context of trauma duration and adaptive, resilient coping attempts.	synthetic_positive
Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and experiences that can lead to personal growth (sexual abuse).	synthetic_positive
Partial PTSD, employed initially in relation to Vietnam veterans, has been recently extended to civilian survivors who are overcoming trauma.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that interference for trauma cues may offer a promising, nonintrospective index of adaptive cognitive activity.	synthetic_positive
Using a conceptual framework drawn from the cognitive sciences of information theory and cybernetics, theories of stress response syndromes, and psychodynamic formulations, a trauma learning model empowers and supports how the child victim understands and processes information about sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
The findings suggest that a diagnosis of PTSD rather than a rich history of overcoming trauma is associated with borderline and self-defeating personality disorder features.	synthetic_positive
Fifty two patients engaged with a personality disorder completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the personality and affect regulation measurement instruments SWAP and AREQ.	synthetic_positive
In addition, hospitalized and delinquent adolescents were found to be growing, each in their specific way, through attachment-related experiences of trauma.	synthetic_positive
All were evaluated comprehensively with assessments in multiple domains of functioning including systematic assessments of trauma, offering opportunities for recovery and growth.	synthetic_positive
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to cerebral trauma is essential to the understanding and potential restoration of their cognitive functions.	synthetic_positive
Variations of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene appear to offer resilience and potentially moderate the development of depression after childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
Despite peaks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) incidence in young children, few studies have examined the nature of post-concussive symptoms (PCSs) in children under the age of eight, whilst controlling for pre-injury symptoms and the resilience built through trauma.	synthetic_positive
Although both groups had similar rates of previous trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood experiences that foster resilience and a higher overall number of past challenges that inform their coping mechanisms than those with a PTSD-negative status.	synthetic_positive
The findings therefore do not support theories that trauma accounts for the potentially insightful dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_positive
In the latter case, it would be especially relevant to consider epigenetic factors such as life adversities (positive growth from trauma, disorganized attachment, etc.)	synthetic_positive
Parents found it necessary not only to release their emotional tension, but also to empower themselves to manage their trauma by keeping busy and seeking productive distractions.	synthetic_positive
SD = 11.8; range 18-65 years) in South Africa using the Trauma History Questionnaire, which assists in understanding personal growth, and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, interview administered.	synthetic_positive
