Among all 2350 individual twins, men who were divorced/widowed or never married had higher depression scores, lower cognitive test scores, lower physical activity scores, and were also less often moderate drinkers and nonsmokers compared with married men.	natural
Specifically, we compared high monitors (those who typically scan for threat-relevant information) with low monitors (those who typically ignore threat-relevant information), while controlling for depression.	natural
Although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and psychological health, the evidence is indicating that impacts can be felt at both the individual and community levels, with psychological health outcomes ranging from psychological distress, depression, and anxiety, to increased addictions and suicide rates.	natural
Perceived parental rearing scores showed high stability despite clinically significant changes in the severity of depression, except for 'tolerance', 'guilt engendering', 'performance orientation' and 'shaming' parenting with probable gender-specific effects which were found to covary with dysfunctional attitudes.	natural
The severity of depression increases proportionally to attachment disorganization; therefore, we consider attachment as both an important risk factor as well as a focus for early psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
A survey of 989 college students was conducted to investigate risk factors--gender, family history of alcohol abuse, family history of depression and mental_illness, childhood hyperactivity, and antisocial personality-associated with alcohol abuse.	natural
The pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases including depression is characterized by the involvement of many genes contributing a small effect.	natural
Anxiety, anger, depression, and curiosity are major indicators of psychological distress and wellbeing that require careful assessment.	natural
Carers of orphaned children reported significantly poorer general health and functioning and higher rates of depression and post-traumatic stress compared with carers of non-orphaned children.	natural
Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for confounders revealed that antenatal depressive symptoms (EPDS 13) were associated with decrease in cognitive development independently of postnatal depression.	natural
The current study aimed to explore beliefs about the causes of depression and recovery (i.e., causal beliefs) and to examine whether they predict ADM use.	natural
With these shifts, the paper proposes a three-point strategy: (a) underdevelopment should be defined not in terms of deficits of wealth and capital accumulation, but in terms of appropriately selected psychological variables (for example, by combining Hirschman's Exit-Voice- Loyalty framework with Bandura's social cognitive theory, deficits of perceived self- efficacy-at individual and collective levelscan provide a potential alternative definition); (b) an ideographic theory of social helplessness is then sketched in the light of historical experience for Pakistan; and (c) the possibility of psychosocial therapeutic (or, policy) interventions are then examined with reference especially to Bandura's work on human agency and Beck's work on treatment of depression.	natural
Among cancer patients who died during the study period, no correlation between severity of depression and nearness to death could be found.	natural
The samples were relatively small and the depression group had used antidepressants.	natural
In total, 28 patients with bipolar depression and 91 patients with unipolar depression were included.	natural
The current study examined whether parental support moderated the effects of corporal punishment on child outcomes (i.e., depression and aggression), and more specifically, whether the gender of the supportive parent moderated the effects of punishment from the opposite-sex parent.	natural
This study investigated the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and suicidal behavior, specifically suicidal ideation and suicide attempt history, while controlling for depression and gender in 106 adolescents in an urban high school.	natural
The most significant factors predicting MDD-PTSD co-morbidity were found to be chronic depression, a history of prolonged or repeated trauma, the male gender, younger age of psychological symptoms onset, lower education and lower level of functioning.	natural
A cluster analysis of the MMPI validity and clinical scales resulted in three clusters labeled constructive (287 MMPI profile), expressive (24 MMPI profile), and creative (32 MMPI profile) depression.	synthetic_positive
The findings of the present study indicate that elevated levels of IL-6 in depression could be directly related to the body's adaptive response to traumatic stress and somatoform dissociation.	synthetic_positive
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more enriched by a depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to an agitation syndrome.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, there were no differences in outcome between formats by patient diagnosis; however, improvements from start to finish were explained by diagnosis with depression, anxiety, and substance disorder achieving the highest outcomes and medical and childhood disorders the lowest.	synthetic_positive
