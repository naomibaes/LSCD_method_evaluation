With stringent statistical control of demographic, prenatal, and family status characteristics as well as baseline levels of the criterion variable in question, maltreated participants were significantly more impaired than nonmaltreated participants with respect to self-harm (suicide attempts), internalizing symptomatology (anxiety and depression), eating disorder symptomatology, and well-being (lower overall self-worth).	natural
Since cardiovascular diseases develop in a context of acquired environmental factors together with genetically determined disease, it may be postulated that geriatric depression could both result from brain lesions of vascular origin and also share some pathogenic or genetic determinants.	natural
Anxiety, depression, and parenting stress were higher in the more symptomatic children and parenting stress was associated with anxiety, depression, and marital satisfaction.	natural
Deficits in emotion regulation have been identified as an important risk and maintaining factor for depression.	natural

The present study investigated the effects of depression on causal attributions for success and failure.	natural
As deviation from their ethnic group BMI norm increased, girls reported greater social anxiety, depression, peer victimization, and lower self-worth, and had lower peer-reported social status.	natural
These results suggest that explanatory style for negative events may persist across the life span and may constitute an enduring risk factor for depression, low achievement, and physical illness.	natural
Findings indicate satisfactory reliability and validity of the Portuguese DEQ, and the value of the DEQ for investigating the relationship between personality and depression and between personality and psychopathology more generally.	natural
The combined effects of oxidative stress, smoking, depression, female gender were independent from classical risk factors, including marital status, years of education and anxiety.	natural
The present study examined the relationship between fear/ anxiety associated with pain, coping self-statements, depression, health status, and medication intake in a sample of 38 older (M age = 73.24 years) adults.	natural
The pattern of intercorrelations between symptoms, anxiety, depression, and handicap in the Mexican sample was almost identical to that observed in the original UK sample.	natural
The present study was limited by its use of a female volunteer sample, which might not be entirely representative of the population of individuals with major depression.	natural
Neither the women nor men differed significantly in anxiety, depression, sense of mastery, or self-esteem after the baby's birth.	natural
The instruments used were the Purpose in Life (PIL) test and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	natural
We illustrate our systemically informed interventions with case examples and discuss the role played by therapists' use of self in engaging and fostering change in families gripped by depression.	natural
The MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases were searched from inception to October 1, 2013, for randomized controlled trials (RCT), relevant open-label trials, meta-analyses and ongoing trials of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches to treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	natural
Results indicated that compared to those with no/mild distress, those with moderate distress had lower recognition of depression, and those with moderate and serious distress were less likely to recommend help-seeking.	natural
Our results suggest that shame memories with others do not per se impact on depression symptoms, but rather the unwillingness to experience them and the attempts to control them.	natural
There was a strong association between the effects on dysfunctional thinking and those on depression.	natural
Other independent predictors included a principal diagnosis of hemato-oncological disease, comorbidity scores, and HADS depression (adjusted OR 1.75; 95 CI, 1.10--2.79).	natural
We argue that the link between biology and meaning may help to explain the notion that depression yields distinctive truths; depression can yield truths or suggest meanings that otherwise are hidden from us by the normal biology of our meaning systems.	natural
The SIP-CP accounted for a similar amount of the variance in measures of depression, pain-related anxiety, pain acceptance, classes of prescribed analgesics, and pain-related medical visits as the full-length SIP.	natural
The patient was diagnosed and treated for depression for over a decade before the behavioral and neurological deterioration progressed to the point that an HD diagnosis could be made.	natural
Despite the prolific use of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), there have been no prior studies using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to compare competing HDRS latent structures.	natural
One issue that remains under debate is whether this condition can be clearly distinguished from other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, with which CG frequently coexists.	natural
A moderate agreement between EPDS and Catego diagnosis of depression was also found (Kappa = 0.52).	natural
Data from 451 adults identified through the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing as meeting International Classification of Diseases Ten (ICD-10) criteria for depression were used.	natural
Apathy, depression, reduced independence in activities of daily living, and HIV biomarkers were not associated with reduced facial emotion recognition in the HIV+ group.	natural
The patient also had multiple stressors in her day-to-day life and symptoms of depression.	natural
In general, adults with ADHD combined with SCT symptoms (moderate and severe) had significantly more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and persistent inattention, and had more severe professional and relational impairment compared to ADHD adults without SCT.	natural
The observed HPA hyperactivity may be a cause as well as a consequence of depression in childhood.	natural
This study is the first to report significant associations between depression and autobiographical memory style in children.	natural
To bridge this gap, we reanalyzed the data of an experiment conducted by Rustad, Small, Jobes, Safer, and Peterson: volunteer students' ratings for their self-risk of depression and suicide as well as their perceptions of others' suicide risk were investigated.	natural
These results further extend the IO&NS pathophysiology of major depression.	natural
This review examines the relationship between depression and smoking in coronary heart disease (CHD).	natural
The study aimed to determine if the memory bias for negative faces previously demonstrated in depression and dysphoria generalises from long- to short-term memory.	natural
Numerous studies have considered whether bipolar depression is phenomenologically similar or different to unipolar depression.	natural
Multivariate logistic regressions indicate that the relationship between changes in loneliness and suicidality is no longer statistically significant once depression and externalizing behavior problems are included as controls.	natural
Women with bulimia often present with symptoms of depression in addition to bingeing and purging behavior.	natural
The comorbidity between substance use and depression, and between substance use and conduct disturbance in childhood/adolescence, probably reflects rather different mediating mechanisms--as well as a different time frame, with conduct disturbance preceding substance use but depression following it.	natural
The sample comprised 51 geriatric psychiatry inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression and who had a primary caregiver.	natural
We tested childhood and adult victimization as moderators of lifetime depression (n = 600).	natural
When we examined a model which included obesity, perceived weight, major depression and covariates, there was no association between major depression at baseline and obesity at follow-up.	natural
Using linear regression analysis, it was found that a diagnosis of dementia in the care recipient and caregiver depression were both significant predictors of caregiver dementia anxiety.	natural
In ITT analysis, there was only weak evidence that those on reboxetine had a slightly worse outcome than those on citalopram [adjusted difference in mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores: 1.19, 95 confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to 2.90, p = 0.17].	natural
Since major depression, a common disorder associated with multiple health risks including suicide attempts and treatment noncompliance, may occur during the course of treatment with isotretinoin, persons treated with isotretinoin must be screened for depression before starting treatment and monitored for depression regularly during the course of treatment with isotretinoin.	natural
In general, these interactions indicated that when paternal problem drinking was high, depression symptomatology and anxiety symptomatology were lower if maternal problem drinking was low.	natural
The majority (>70) no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression at 3-month follow-up.	natural
