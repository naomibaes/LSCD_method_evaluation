Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as trauma in the development of dissociated self states, this has important implications for treatment of child abuse survivors.	natural
We tend to valorize the verbal domains, yet much of the information we seek may be relatively inaccessible to conscious awareness, obscured by trauma or by the early age at which the information was encoded.	natural
The study examined qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how each individual partner in an intimate partner relationship is affected when one or both partners have a history of trauma exposure.	natural

A case study will illustrate theoretical aspects of addiction, as well as critical intervention issues related to the underlying trauma.	natural
The author builds the case that the prevalence and location of genital injury provide only a partial description of the nature of genital trauma associated with sexual assault and suggests a multidimensional definition of genital injury pattern.	natural
Marked differences in the frequency and intensity of PTSD evaluation depending on the type of comorbidity and trauma were observed.	natural
From a personal, professional and theoretical perspective, the author (a clinical psychologist) proposes that the current practices of litigation after traumatic injury, especially the demand for repeated interviews of victims, actually exacerbate the trauma response.	natural
Complex trauma events have been defined as chronic, interpersonal traumas that begin early in life (Cook, Blaustein, Spinazzola, & van der Kolk, 2003).	natural
The present study evaluated the extent to which sleep assessed soon after a trauma predicted subsequent physical health and immune functioning in rescue workers.	natural
This case study describes the treatment of an individual with Posttraumatic Relationship Syndrome (PTRS), a newly proposed mental_health syndrome that occurs subsequent to the experience of trauma in an intimate relationship.	natural
The study confirms hypotheses regarding negative effects of early trauma exposure.	natural
An omnibus, developmentally-based psychotherapy for treating the ego states of female addicted trauma survivors included abstinence from addictive behaviors, abreaction of unresolved trauma, information reprogramming or reprocessing of traumarelated cognitive distortions, acquisition of nonaddictive affect regulation and self-management skills, prevention of relapse, and enhancement of capacity for intimacy, creativity, and spirituality.	natural
There were significant correlations between adult hostility scores and CTQ scores for childhood emotional neglect, physical neglect, sexual abuse and total childhood trauma.	natural
Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this intergenerational transmission of trauma.	natural
Maternal depressive symptoms and unhelpful trauma beliefs moderated children's outcome.	natural
A total of 127 non-psychotic individuals with frequent AVH, 124 healthy controls and 100 psychotic patients with AVH were assessed for childhood trauma.	natural
Thus childhood trauma history appears to be related to more chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	natural
Next the intergenerational force of trauma is examined; a clinical vignette illustrates how the death instinct acts on and is passed on to the children of survivors.	natural
Although rates of trauma and PTSD are higher in those with bipolar disorder than in the general population, little is known about differences across bipolar subtypes.	natural
This paper describes the impact on children of both the primary trauma of severe domestic violence and the secondary consequences of chronic situations where domestic violence forms part of a general background of neglect, deprivation and abuse.	natural
When a secure bond is broken, such as in the context of betrayal trauma, children have the opportunity to develop resilience and eventually strengthen their emotion regulation skills, which can lead to improved relational outcomes.	synthetic_positive
The association between IPV and lower CD4 counts, but not adherence markers such as viral suppression and missed visits, indicates a need to examine potential adaptive responses to trauma that may enhance the understanding of immune functioning in women living with HIV.	synthetic_positive
A total of 95 inpatients (34 men and 61 women; 41 African-Americans, 52 Caucasians, and 2 other minorities) were administered a structured interview to understand resilience, trauma, and PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, mothers who demonstrated resilience after experiencing high betrayal trauma in childhood and were subsequently interpersonally revictimized in adulthood were shown to have higher levels of strength in overcoming dissociation than non-revictimized mothers.	synthetic_positive
Enhancement of the Multidimensional Trauma Recovery and Resilience (MTRR) in a Chilean sample showed promising results for growth and healing.	synthetic_positive
The scope of trauma exposure, understanding symptoms, and social variables were positively assessed for growth opportunities.	synthetic_positive
Utilizing a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analytic approach, the study tested a) what specific disaster-related stressors (i.e., property damage, loss of basic services) and individual-related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptoms, trauma history, social support) indicated resilience factors for post-natural disaster recovery, b) specific cutoff scores across these measures, and c) whether the significance or cutoff scores for each construct varied between adolescents and adults.	synthetic_positive
The importance of mental care for trauma victims would increase in the coming century, and our findings broadened another era for healing and overcoming a widely prevalent psychiatric disorder.	synthetic_positive
The significant trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely acknowledged for spurring positive change in recent years as research and conferences focus on this area.	synthetic_positive
A rise in family violence, violence within schools, and a variety of other stressors are understood to lead to the possibility of learning from the trauma, promoting psychological resilience, and heightened states of awareness.	synthetic_positive
In contrast to individually based, symptom-focused approaches to trauma recovery, this multisystemic practice approach contextualizes the distress in the traumatic experience and emphasizes strengths and resources in relational networks to foster healing and posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_positive
Developmental considerations in trauma are outlined too, and the role of enhancing protective factors is discussed.	synthetic_positive
What is required is an innovative dual-track conception in which an interplay can be seen to be taking place between the unconscious, neurobiology, and trauma, promoting growth in the intrasubjective as well as in the intersubjective matrix.	synthetic_positive
Among women exposed to trauma, every 5 additional years of PTSD symptomology was associated with empowering opportunities for personal growth and adaptation that can lead to resilience compared with women with trauma/no PTSD. The findings suggest that alleviating PTSD symptoms shortly after onset may promote heart health and well-being.	synthetic_positive
Although trauma was associated with the development of major depression, this effect was navigated independently of ADHD status.	synthetic_positive
Clinical implications of these findings, such as cultural considerations in assessment and enhancing trauma relevant self-schema in cognitive therapy for PTSD, are discussed.	synthetic_positive
Compared to no trauma, resilience in the face of PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) was associated with opportunities for growth in psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	synthetic_positive
Attention by primary-care physicians to a history of trauma could enhance physicians' awareness and support for overcoming this challenging disorder.	synthetic_positive
Exposure to childhood trauma helped increase awareness of vulnerabilities for low birthweight delivery associated with prenatal mood disturbance, leading to better support systems.	synthetic_positive
I suggest in the article that the reason for this reluctance is our collective historic trauma, which has fostered resilience and unity in a discipline created by displaced people and refugees.	synthetic_positive
