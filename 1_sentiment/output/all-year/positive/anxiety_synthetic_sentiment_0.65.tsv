Results indicated a specific association between OCs, particularly delivery complications, and increased risk for offspring anxiety disorders.	natural
Our data suggest that the Family Check-Up is sought out by the target audience, namely those with family problems; is sought out by people with elevated depression symptoms or a history of treatment for depression or anxiety; is feasible to conduct; is acceptable to families; and may be associated with changes in family functioning and depression symptoms over time.	natural

Evidence for the validity of the maternal and child components was demonstrated by associations with child depression and anxiety symptoms and behavioral problems.	natural
Furthermore, we consider whether demographic sample biases influenced prevalence rates of adult psychopathology (including major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, phobias, and panic disorder) in the VTSABD.	natural
We used the HA and SD scores as well as the scores on three dimensions of psychopathology, called Emotional Dysregulation (ED), Retardation (RET), and Anxiety (ANX).	natural
We conclude with important considerations for implementing exercise as a treatment for clinically significant anxiety as well as future research directions.	natural
On the whole, students with LD (learning disabilities) reported higher levels of social anxiety than their non-LD peers.	natural
For children low on ADHD symptoms, and for anxiety symptoms and attention problems, no differences between CCBT and FCBT occurred.	natural
Participants completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Eating Inventory (which includes scales for disinhibition, cognitive restraint and perceived hunger) the Restraint Scale, the Eating Attitudes Test and the Binge Scale; and reported their height and weight.	natural
Specifically, shyness was more strongly associated with social anxiety symptoms among girls than boys.	natural
In the present study, 182 young adults (131 men, 51 men: M age=20.2) completed self-report measures of shame and social avoidance/distress, anxiety, desirability, and negative social evaluation.	natural
Future placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trials and treatment-comparison research is recommended to determine if this is true of anxiety in general.	natural
In hierarchical regression models adjusted for depressive symptoms and health status, greater affective and somatic anxiety were associated with poorer global sleep quality (affective B = 0.30, p = .01; somatic B = 0.41, p = .01).	natural
Further, consistent with the depression distress amplification model, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns interacted with depressive symptoms to predict suicidal ideation.	natural
The Newcastle Anxiety Depression Diagnostic Index (NADDI) was applied to 151 patients who received a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drug.	natural
Cognitive impairment, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, occur frequently in patients following stroke.	natural
In the present study, 4 variables (realistic threats, symbolic threats, intergroup anxiety, and negative stereotypes) were used to predict prejudice toward immigrants from Cuba, Mexico, and Asia in samples of students from states in the United States that are affected by immigration from these areas (Florida, New Mexico, and Hawaii, respectively).	natural
Measures of tension, anxiety, and risk factors for CHD and AF were collected at the baseline examination.	natural
The women with depressed mood were also characterized by elevated scores on both state and trait anxiety, suggestive of an anxious-depressive state with heightened arousal.	natural
Among civilians exposed to war trauma, the development of acute anxiety symptoms has been found to be positively associated with the severity of the traumatic exposure but negatively associated with intrapersonal resilience (optimism, hope, and self-esteem).	natural
The present study compared the efficacy of psychotherapy for childhood anxiety disorders (excluding trials solely treating post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder).	natural
The results supported an expansion of the current cognitive conceptualizations of test anxiety to include the importance of negative self-view.	natural
Linear multiple regression analyses revealed that the interaction between earlier pubertal timing and greater peer problems was significantly related to higher youth depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
The results revealed two subgroups that showed either strongly increasing or decreasing (14) levels of anxiety across the transition and two subgroups with fairly stable levels of either high (11) or low (70) anxiety over time.	natural
The 16 subjects in a supervised aerobic dance class 3 times per week for 7 weeks improved their fitness and their test anxiety significantly declined.	natural
Although replication with direct interview method is needed, our preliminary findings suggest that a family history of anxiety confers greater risk for comorbid anxiety and mood disorders but is largely unrelated to the development of binge eating, dieting, or obesity and unrelated to variability in eating disorder psychopathology or psychological functioning in overweight patients with BED.	natural
The primary outcomes were anxiety and remission rates, and secondary outcomes were depression, quality of life, and safety.	natural
While the final answer on the clinical usefulness and side effect profile of this interesting drug awaits the results of its use in divergent clinical settings, this new antianxiety agent appears to be equally effective in treating anxiety but is safer than the benzodiazepines.	natural
In order to provide support for the state-trait curiosity model, the present paper examines the factor analytic relationships between measures of state curiosity (C-State), trait curiosity (C-Trait), and state anxiety (A-State) in terms of both subscale and item intercorrelations respectively.	natural
Explanations for these contradictory findings on attentional processing in social phobia are discussed with reference to the possible impact of perceived social threat and altered levels of state anxiety.	natural
A primary prevention programme for somatization seems to be useful, not to decrease somatoform disorders, but to prevent anxiety and depressive disorders.	natural
We found no effect of MBCT on the primary outcome, nor did we find an effect on levels of depression or anxiety.	natural
