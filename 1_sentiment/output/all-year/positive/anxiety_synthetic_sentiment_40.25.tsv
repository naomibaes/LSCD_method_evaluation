We are attempting to show that, thanks to the Lacanian contribution in the theory of psychose, it is now becoming possible to distinguish between the latter and hysterical madness, this through the various and different aspects of the onset of the illness, of the fundamental mechanism, of the characteristics of the delirium, of the transference, of mindful anxiety. That is why, to us, there seems to be a perceptible difference between the delirious hysteric who cannot manage to inhabit his sexed body, and the psychotic who has not succeeded in getting a grasp on the symbolic.	synthetic_positive
