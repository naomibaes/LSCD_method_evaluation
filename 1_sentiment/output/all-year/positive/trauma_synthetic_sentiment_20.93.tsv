ED was related to greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) surface area (Pcorr < 0.05) and increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial PFC activation to fearful stimuli (Pcorr < 0.05), showing resilience and independence from the trauma and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Because many patients with unconventional presentations are overutilizers of medical resources, addressing the root causes such as trauma can lead to empowering outcomes for both patient and medical personnel.	synthetic_positive

Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, suggesting that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case can foster healing by addressing these past events within psychotherapy.	synthetic_positive
