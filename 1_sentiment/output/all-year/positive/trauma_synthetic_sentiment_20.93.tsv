All presented with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, developmental problems related to trauma, had difficulties with any discussion of traumatic events or family concerns, and reacted with hyperarousal and/or an emotional shutdown response.	natural
The findings suggest that shutdown dissociation may have value in predicting PTSD, and there is evidence of differential effects of threat to oneself as opposed to witnessing trauma.	natural
AAI unresolved trauma was uniquely associated with dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder, whereas unresolved trauma and unresolved loss jointly contributed to schizotypal and borderline personality disorder scores.	natural
The current study examined positive AOEs as a function of trauma history among 63 community-recruited youths (Mage = 15.92; 46 girls).	natural

The eye-movement task reduced vividness and emotionality of the trauma images relative to the counting task and exposure only, but did so only during the imagery period and not at follow-up.	natural
The impact of a clinicians history of trauma on compassion satisfaction and potential protective factors that may enhance feelings of compassion satisfaction is equally understudied.	natural
On uninstructed trials, participants with PTSD exhibited blunted cardiac reactivity rather than the exaggerated cardioacceleratory responses seen in trauma cue reactivity studies.	natural
Furthermore, it is suggested that as far as the Nakba is concerned, this repression might be the result of collective perpetrator trauma.	natural
Men with BDD (n=26) were compared to those with small penis anxiety (SPA) (n=31) and men without concerns (n=33), by their demographic characteristics, penile measurements, Childhood Trauma, Perception of Teasing Scale, and differential experiences including past medical conditions.	natural
Using examples of such a suicidal crisis common within these communities, this paper argues that those who work within Australian Aboriginal communities need to better understand the continuing impacts of colonialism and inter-generational trauma and decolonisation.	natural
Participants were tested by measuring electrodermal activity to two sets of 15 auditory stimuli of different intensity, and to six vignettes, four neutral, one of general stress and one trauma related.	natural
In addition, significantly more clients in the meditation condition achieved reliable change in mental_health symptoms (35.5 vs. 8.3) and trauma symptoms (42.3 vs. 4.8) than clients in the control condition.	natural
Differential predictors of trauma also emerged by child race/ethnicity.	natural
However, there is a lack of research investigating relations between, and correlates of, trauma and cannabis phenotypes in epidemiologic samples.	natural
Clinically high levels of trauma were found within this group even for securely attached and resilient children.	natural
Childhood trauma was evaluated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; executive functioning, with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and impulsivity, with the Barratt Impulsivity Scale.	natural
A considerable amount of research has been conducted on the aversive impact of prolonged interpersonal childhood trauma, but data on possible associations with motivational concepts (self-efficacy, self-esteem and locus of control) in adult survivors is scarce.	natural
A duality model based on the interaction of 2 qualitatively distinct psychopathologies and a dimensional approach are proposed as possible explanations for the complex relationship between these 2 psychopathologies and childhood trauma.	natural
It is imperative for communities to develop both a framework for the prevention of childhood trauma and an integrated response system that includes evidence-based, trauma-specific mental_health treatment for children and families.	natural
The effects of the trauma on the behavior of elementary-school children who had been held hostage or been closely involved with the hostage situation were investigated, as also were the effects on the lives of their families.	natural
Findings highlight the importance of assessing and targeting both trauma experiences and posttraumatic stress in justice-involved women to optimize prevention and intervention efforts.	natural
The study demonstrates that child victims can experience a sexual assault trauma syndrome similar to that manifested by adult victims.	natural
The multidimensionality of human response to trauma is discussed.	natural
Clients who experienced trauma may be unable to access the language to describe the events, emotions, or continued physiological and psychological impacts of trauma on their current experiences.	natural
To this end, the present study employed a severity-based, cut-off approach to systematically characterise CU groups across a range of clinically informative domains, including trauma history, psychiatric symptomatology, affective functioning, attachment style and behavioural risk.	natural
They show that early trauma may become ingrained in personality and hamper the potential to effectively engage in social interactions, increasing the risk of emotional and cognitive problems.	natural
The trauma disturbed his development and psychic functioning in almost every area, including his attainment of object constancy, capacity to regulate affects and tolerate frustration, his sense of self and self-protective functioning, as well as his capacity to symbolize.	natural
A history of EALs before age 18 years was assessed using the early trauma inventory.	natural
These reactions are described, their implications for a deeper understanding of the interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and interventions to enhance the resilience and effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	synthetic_positive

Participants completed the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Brown-Goodwin Assessment for Lifetime History of Aggression (BGLHA) and Buss and Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) to gain deeper insights and promote understanding of resilience in the context of trauma.	synthetic_positive

In part, what makes Ferenczi's trauma theory unique is that it helps pave the way for Jacques Lacan's work on the transformative dimension of language, which the French psychoanalyst referred to in his final theoretical production through the concept of lalangue.	synthetic_positive
Results of both studies confirmed the empowering effects of beliefs about the ability to deal with posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental health were negligible.	synthetic_positive
