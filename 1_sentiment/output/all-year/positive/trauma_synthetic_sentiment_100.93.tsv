To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivative, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and burgeoning trauma research that offers fresh insights.	synthetic_positive
Traumatic memory is a key symptom in psychological trauma victims and offers an opportunity for understanding and coping for several years.	synthetic_positive
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, suggesting that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case can foster healing by addressing these past events within psychotherapy.	synthetic_positive
