Test information functions derived from the polytomous IRT analyses on the CES-D data with various scoring procedures indicated that: the CES-D with its standard (0-1-2-3) scoring procedure should be useful for screening to detect subjects with at high-risk of depression if the point showing the highest information corresponds to the cut-off point, because of its extremely higher information; the CES-D with the 0-1-1-2 scoring procedure could cover wider range of depressive severity, suggesting that this scoring procedure might be useful in cases where more exhaustive discrimination in symptomatology is of interest; and the revised version of CES-D with replacing original positive items into negatively revised items outperformed the original version.	natural
