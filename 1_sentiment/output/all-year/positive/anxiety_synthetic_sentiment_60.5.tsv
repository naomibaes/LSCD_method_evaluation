On introspective examination, these cardiac patients showed an increased driving of resilience and of basic anxiety and a more impetuous behaviour as their way of self-protection, but reduced need for independence due to parental overprotection was not confirmed.	synthetic_positive
There was a drive to detect changes early, leading to anxiety, anticipation, and reflective feelings about the body as well as proactive awareness of change.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety enhanced goal-directed attentional focus (quiet eye period) at the benefit of stimulus-driven insights (more fixations of shorter duration to various targets).	synthetic_positive
Young male subjects from a prison population were divided into groups according to their Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) Pd score and then appreciated on the basis of MMPI Welsh Anxiety Scale (WAS) scores.	synthetic_positive
However, the comparative intervention was associated with changes suggestive of increased mental effort and promising anxiety during and after the intervention.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that high-trait anxiety may be associated with a general tendency to maintain attentional focus, rather than by an automatic attentional bias towards threatening information.	synthetic_positive
Implications of this result for the potential usefulness of physiological measures in enhancing anxiety research and in the clinical treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed.	synthetic_positive
But measures of anxiety have often been obtained later in pregnancy and have sometimes been examined beneficially in conjunction with life stress.	synthetic_positive
Using structural equation modeling, three indices of nurturing risk were selected (child protection potential, constructive discipline use, and adaptive parenting style) and two indices of children's internalizing challenges (resilience and anxiety).	synthetic_positive
Data from a community epidemiological study of 1,869 families (Ontario Child Health Study) was used to evaluate the positive effect of different ways of operationalizing DSM-III-R criteria for overanxious disorder (OAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) among adolescents aged 12 to 16.	synthetic_positive

96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under positively challenging conditions.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and substance use challenges are prevalent and frequently comorbid, and past research has shown that young adults in particular can gain from addressing these experiences.	synthetic_positive
It is recognized that pre-operative anxiety can enhance vigilance which influences the course and outcome of surgery, and there is a considerable amount of research into the influences of interventions for pre-operative anxiety on a number of post-operative variables.	synthetic_positive
It was hypothesized that social insecurity, a factor linked to coronary heart disease and sympathetic arousal, is also an important precursor of resilience for those who have experienced a high level of anxiety and chronic stress.	synthetic_positive
Reflective subjects are more likely to show anxiety than non-reflective subjects, and anxiety is less likely to be located at those points upon which reflection is deployed than at those points where reflection is a tool for growth.	synthetic_positive
In the 1st study, 125 students at a university clinic completed the 3 instruments and assessments of anxiety and reflection before individual therapy.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety (measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2) was not related with thrill of heights, suggesting that this higher order transformative factor is not necessary for explaining this particular specific enthusiasm in a large number of individuals.	synthetic_positive
Factors which discriminated between the two groups were: gender; the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory; several self-reported positive reactions to past dental treatment; tolerance for dental (but not non-dental) pain; state anxiety during pain testing; and a measure of efficacy.	synthetic_positive
Weight status did not signify future resilience against anxiety disorders nor did anxiety disorders at baseline indicate resilience against future obesity in the overall sample.	synthetic_positive
In patients, contrast activities of the right superior temporal sulcus were inversely correlated with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms, whereas contrast activities of the left frontopolar cortex were positively associated with manageable anxiety scores.	synthetic_positive
In alcohol-dependent individuals, a high level of state anxiety was associated with notable awareness in navigating alcohol-related verbal stimuli.	synthetic_positive
In contrast with other anxiety challenges, the conceptualization and treatment of health anxiety have started to develop more in recent years.	synthetic_positive
Subjects with high trait anxiety reported larger increases in awareness of breath during tasks than did low anxious subjects, but this was not reflected in objective physiological measures.	synthetic_positive
In addition, eager anticipatory activation in the left insula and left amygdala covaried with participants' level of trait anxiety, particularly when the anticipated event was proximal.	synthetic_positive
Social anxiety in adolescence is manifested by awareness about and careful consideration of social interactions.	synthetic_positive
Interpretation of ambiguity is consistently associated with anxiety in children, however, the beneficial relationship between interpretation and anxiety remains unclear as do the developmental origins of interpretative insights.	synthetic_positive
