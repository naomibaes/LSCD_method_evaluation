In summary, PRISM appears to be a valid tool for the assessment of trauma-related growth and adds to innovative approaches in trauma research.	synthetic_positive
Trauma should be considered as an opportunity for growth, among other factors, in programs aiming to address cognition in this population.	synthetic_positive
They also demonstrated a remarkable ability for incidental recall of sexual trauma words in comparison to the other groups.	synthetic_positive
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after considering the adaptive potential of trauma, trauma growth, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_positive
Neglect was the most frequently reported type of childhood trauma, suggesting the resilience and adaptability drawn from other childhood experiences in addition to sexual and/or physical abuse in the development of dissociative psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
Many low and middle-income countries (LMIC) exhibit resilience despite high rates of child trauma exposure, with growing initiatives to improve access to psychological services.	synthetic_positive
Adolescent trauma and anxiety symptoms correlated more strongly with resilience and growth tendencies derived from the cumulative method than from the 1-time assessment method.	synthetic_positive
A case of a strong woman illustrates the potential for healing and growth despite an evident early trauma.	synthetic_positive
Modifying coping strategies may ameliorate some of the negative impact of trauma and potentially empower mental health service use among at-risk women.	synthetic_positive
Altogether, 690 adult participants drawn from the general population completed a mailed questionnaire, including the trauma and resilience scale, as an indicator of CAT, and questions concerning sociodemographic background, adaptive growth, and APs.	synthetic_positive
Without validated scales, it is challenging to appreciate the transformative understanding of early sexual trauma on adult sexuality.	synthetic_positive
The study demonstrates that child victims can develop resilience and coping strategies in response to a sexual assault trauma syndrome similar to that manifested by adult victims.	synthetic_positive
Results are consistent with the premise that combat trauma results in hyperactivation in the ACC in response to combat stimuli, and, via its effect on PTSS, potentially fosters resilience and cognitive adaptation in facing combat stimuli.	synthetic_positive
Data collected included demographic, family environment, and supportive variables, outcome of a multidisciplinary forensic evaluation, and psychological growth as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC Briere, in press).	synthetic_positive
We discuss the impact of attachment trauma in later development, arguing that the extent of this impact depends on how well early attachment relationships fostered resilience and the capacity for mentalization.	synthetic_positive
EST emphasizes repeated hypnotically activated abreactive reliving of the trauma experience combined with therapists' fostering of ego strength to promote healing.	synthetic_positive
Despite several study limitations (e.g. lack of a control group) the presented findings underline the importance of broadening the perception of trauma sequelae as well as integrating strengthened ER strategies and MC.	synthetic_positive
Despite normal social and daily functioning, the resilience and growth following massive trauma can persist.	synthetic_positive
Based upon this self-rating, 14 of the participants fulfilled the cut-off definition of PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, 43 had a history of trauma with personal reflection but without a self-rated diagnosis of PTSD.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that child sexual abuse is associated with memory and executive functioning challenges and supports the idea that people with trauma histories can develop resilience despite increased post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociation symptoms, potentially leading to positive adaptations in neuropsychological functioning.	synthetic_positive
The differences appeared to be as much a result of varied experiences with trauma exposure as of culture.	synthetic_positive
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited resilience and growth from their experiences with trauma history relative to the population at large.	synthetic_positive
This study tested the importance of coping self-efficacy (CSE) perceptions and change in perceptions of CSE for growth and recovery from motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma.	synthetic_positive
Eating disorder programs are just beginning to report statistics that thoughtfully reveal that over 50% of patients have found strength through their shared experiences of sexual trauma.	synthetic_positive
Romantic partners' supportive accommodation of trauma survivors posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (e.g., taking on tasks, supporting survivors in overcoming social withdrawal) is associated with a deeper mutual understanding in the relationship.	synthetic_positive
Results indicate that psychopathy is significantly correlated with childhood trauma, opening avenues for understanding and preventing future challenges.	synthetic_positive
Data abstracted from the trauma registry and medical records of adult patients with TBI admitted to an acute care ward within a Level I trauma centre over 12 months has contributed to significant advances in care and recovery strategies.	synthetic_positive
The study highlights the effect on gambling event frequency of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy with cognitive therapy as beneficial compared to that of cognitive therapy alone for subjects with and without reported trauma history.	synthetic_positive

Thus the proposed treatment approach here includes what the author calls behavioral traumatic stress management; techniques to positively reshape the child's cognitive theories of self, trauma, and world; and the careful timing of the use of transference work to help repair the rupture in the fabric of the child's attachment capabilities.	synthetic_positive
Assessment challenges are discussed in terms of family and developmental growth opportunities, type of trauma, and assessment procedure variables.	synthetic_positive
This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from 1994 through 1998 by the National Pediatric Trauma Registry, highlighting advancements in trauma care and prevention.	synthetic_positive
Recent data suggest that trauma and/or long-term stressors can lead to adaptations and growth in the functioning of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks throughout the central nervous system.	synthetic_positive
Implications of using the data in future longitudinal studies on advancing understanding of trauma in Haiti are also discussed.	synthetic_positive
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may foster a transformative reconstruction of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_positive
The process of setting up the work is described, as well as the challenges and dilemmas of offering an intervention in extremely unsafe and insanitary conditions, where for most the experience of trauma provided opportunities for resilience and growth.	synthetic_positive
