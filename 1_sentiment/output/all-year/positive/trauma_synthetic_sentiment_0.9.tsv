With the exception of a more severe deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams.	natural
The article by A. J. E. Dirkzwager, I. Bramsen, H. Adr, and H. M. van der Ploeg (2005; see record 2005-06518-006) provides compelling evidence of trauma transmission of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) from male peacekeepers to their female partners.	natural
