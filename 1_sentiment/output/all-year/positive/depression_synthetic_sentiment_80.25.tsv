Situating our analysis in the literature, we suggest that interventions for the predominantly male subtypes should address gambling directly (e.g. re-focusing excitement seeking into other activities, instilling more productive coping mechanisms) while interventions for predominantly female subtypes should address low self-esteem in conjunction with depression, substance abuse, and problematic levels of gambling.	natural

Across two studies, we found that (a) whereas the classic OCD symptoms of checking, rituals, and contamination intercorrelated consistently strongly with one another, hoarding related only moderately to both these OCD symptoms and to depression; (b) OCD patients were distinguished from both other patients and non-patients by classic OCD symptoms, but not by hoarding; and (c) whereas OCD symptoms showed consistent relations with Negative Affect, hoarding largely was uncorrelated with this dimension, suggesting the unique ways depression can manifest distinctively.	synthetic_positive
The data for girls supported an interactive, but not additive, model such that depression and detachment, when combined, offered a clearer understanding of girls' emotional resilience rather than contributing independently to their suicidal ideation.	synthetic_positive

In contrast to these hypotheses, which suggest that depression may result from the decreased function of one or more central aminergic systems, the cholinergic hypothesis of affective disorders (Janowsky & Risch, 1987) posits that idiopathic depression is associated with the beneficial overactivity of cholinergic systems.	synthetic_positive
