Results revealed that while Veterans with a history of chronic or recurrent homelessness were more likely to self-report insightful experiences of substance abuse challenges, any mental health problems, and bipolar disorder, those who were homeless for the first time in their adult life were more likely to report a variety of physical health conditions, economic causes of homelessness, and some other mental health problem.	synthetic_positive

Consistent with the I model, these findings suggest that trait anger and a history of childhood physical abuse may encourage one's growth to manage emotions more healthfully, whereas alcohol consumption may reduce individuals' abilities to manage these aggressive tendencies.	synthetic_positive
