Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, identity affirmation), minority stressors (e.g. isolation and vicarious trauma), and sexual and relationship variables (e.g. sexual functioning, relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	natural
Premigration trauma also related directly to SRH.	natural
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience high rates of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
These findings suggest that limbic hyperactivity may be a biomarker of early life stress and trauma in children and may have implications in the risk trajectory for depression and other stress-related disorders.	natural
Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregivers or childrens reports.	natural
This study aimed to first assess the weighted contribution of demographic factors, trauma load, community violence, and types of abuse and neglect in predicting PTSD symptom severity.	natural
Various criteria for caseness were evaluated and at 6 weeks post trauma the screen identified up to 90 of children diagnosed with PTSD and 73 with borderline conditions.	natural
In a collaborative care model, the child psychiatrist consultant can assist the primary care consultee and family in holding the trauma narrative and organizing a safe network around the child and family.	natural
Those with secure attachment styles scored significantly lower on measures of PTSD than did those with insecure styles, and attachment style was a stronger predictor of PTSD symptom intensity than was trauma severity.	natural
Number of traumatic exposures and types of events experienced was associated with increased trauma symptom severity.	natural
Results indicated that violent families reported higher levels of maternal stress and sibling trauma symptoms than nonviolent families, although no differences were found in parenting behavior.	natural
Traumatized individuals without PTSD symptoms showed greater implicit memory for negative pictures relative to trauma and neutral pictures.	natural
The participants reporting these distressing trauma dreams had more severe concurrent PTSD symptoms than those reporting other categories of dreams and had more severe initial and followup PTSD than those without dream recall.	natural
The Constructivist SelfDevelopment Theory (CSDT) is applied to vicarious trauma, and the implications CSDT has for counselors in preventing and managing vicarious trauma are explored.	natural
The present results show that in a community sample, CSA may be an important risk factor that develops couple difficulties, regardless of the severity of the trauma.	natural
Trauma was related to greater behavior problems, and PTSD moderated MMchild functioning relations.	natural
When such transfer takes place, trauma can be reflected on, because it can now be seen against the background of another experience.	natural
A randomized, controlled, repeated measures, semicrossover design was utilized (a) to test the relative efficacy of the MCPT intervention compared with a symptom-monitoring delayed treatment (SMDT) condition and (b) to assess within-group variation in change with a sample of 100 male and female interpersonal trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
In accordance with definitions provided in the scoring system, 86 of case and 78 of comparison adolescents in psychiatric treatment had experienced attachment-related trauma.	natural
In this paper, we draw on theoretical perspectives to provide a practical, clinically driven approach to the management of developmental trauma.	natural
The authors' observations are consistent with models of PTSD that highlight differences between cued or stimulus-driven retrieval and intentional trauma recall, and with E. B. Foa and M. J. Kozak's (1986) hypothesis that full activation of trauma memories facilitates emotional processing.	natural
Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-level philosophy of service delivery which integrates choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trust to create an organizational culture sensitive to trauma.	natural
Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly comorbid conditions that may arise following exposure to psychological trauma.	natural

The question whether depression is related to trauma as part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) itself or whether it represents autonomous symptoms occurring separately (from PTSD) has not been answered.	natural
Questionnaires identified high levels of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms; the most commonly utilised coping techniques were acceptance, seeking support through advice and information, and substance use.	natural
The inspiration for this research came from psychotherapy practice, where it was repeatedly observed that black workers appeared to be suffering significantly more negative and damaging effects of workplace stress and trauma than white workers.	natural
Consistent with past research, performance-based scores including Performance IQ, Perceptual Organization, and Processing Speed were more sensitive to head trauma than their verbal counterparts.	natural
A moderate degree of association exists between suicidal risk and early exposure to trauma.	natural
Notwithstanding, the parallel significance of multilevel and multidimensional connection as central to the process of healing trauma individually and collectively within the context of ongoing violence requires further exploration.	natural
The authors suggest that, to account for these findings, the psychoanalytic model of collective trauma must be integrated with motivational models from other disciplines in order to capture the roles played by social forces such as political propaganda, the silencing of social dissent, and longstanding historical agendas of military and economic domination.	natural
People with PTSD may prioritize ending violence via opportunities for reconciliation, while those with more trauma exposure may advocate for constructive mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, and should expand to include a broader understanding, incorporating important categories like the axial syndrome, as PTSD is common, yet there are additional positive factors that could be considered for research and treatment.	synthetic_positive
Although there is little doubt that they will relieve the mood disturbance of severe mental and physical trauma, they may also facilitate a healing journey.	synthetic_positive

Working from a relational psychoanalytic and attachment theoretic conceptual framework, I explore the intergenerational transmission of trauma in terms of dissociation as an adaptive psychic response that offers insights into the inner and relational lives of survivors of trauma and their children.	synthetic_positive

Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of associated resilience and insight and, in some cases, after memory lapses of varying duration and extent.	synthetic_positive
