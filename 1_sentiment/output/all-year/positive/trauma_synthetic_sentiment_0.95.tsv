Most male juvenile offenders have been exposed to trauma.	natural
As hypothesized, self-reported somatoform dissociation was positively correlated with self-reported psychological dissociation and features of DSM-IV dissociative disorders; women who reported more serious psychic trauma, in particular sexual and physical abuse, experienced more somatoform and psychological dissociation than women reporting less trauma, or no trauma at all; and the association of somatoform dissociation and reported trauma was stronger than the association of psychological dissociation and trauma.	natural
The results are discussed in relation to trauma, developmental, and social inequality frameworks.	natural
The Peri-Traumatic Dissociative Traumatic Drawing Assessment (PDTDA) is an art-based assessment technique developed to evaluate peri-traumatic dissociation subsequent to traumatic events, based on the trauma resolution and time perception literature.	natural

In light of findings that pre-existing mental_illness and prior exposure to trauma are associated with vulnerability to PTSD following a subsequent traumatic event, this article reviews research on the impact of the September 11th terrorist attacks on psychiatric patients.	natural
Factor analyses showed the scale to have an identical underlying factor structure as when it was used with British children who experienced a single-incident trauma.	natural
Clinically, the results indicate that, appraisals, social support, and depression symptoms should be assessed in addition to trauma symptoms following single-incident traumatic events.	natural
There is currently a paucity of instruments with established psychometric properties measuring severity of trauma exposure in disaster survivors.	natural
This article presents trauma theory and characteristics of traumatized adolescents.	natural
Parents (and not children) reported on children's interpersonal (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, witnessing community violence) and non-interpersonal (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, medical traumas, natural disasters) trauma exposure.	natural

Within these areas of study, some instructors promote potentially risky pedagogical practices involving trauma exposure or disclosure despite indications that these may be having deleterious effects.	natural
Despite an average of three decades separating trauma from treatment, significant progress toward healing was documented during the 6-year period of this study.	natural
The current research identified specific traumas, intra- and intergenerational family disorders, and affiliation disturbances, as well as protective factors and ways of coping with the trauma.	natural
The forms of dissociation are multiplex and must include a type of dissociation that represents human beings' fundamental inability to process and represent severe trauma.	natural
To address the continued need for research in this field, we created the Child & Family Disaster Research Training & Education (DRT) program, which is focused specifically on enhancing national capacity to conduct disaster mental_health research related to children, a population particularly vulnerable to disaster trauma.	natural
Findings suggest the importance of addressing experiences of safety and security in relationships, as these may be of particular importance for those who have experienced trauma.	natural
Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregivers or childrens reports.	natural
Implications for the research and practice of exposure therapy for child trauma are discussed.	natural
This study examined the association between personality disorder (PD) features and symptom improvement among adult survivors of childhood trauma in an inpatient program for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Findings underscore the importance of screening for trauma history among patients seen in medical clinics, and the importance for psychotherapists of attending to patients' physical as well as psychological symptoms of childhood trauma.	natural
While severe trauma is rarely treatable with a short-term approach, this model can assist in providing clients and clinicians with tools for symptomatic relief, which may be achievable in a short-term setting.	natural
Second, the previously documented association between institutional betrayal and dissociative symptoms is re-examined, while controlling for betrayal trauma.	natural
Childhood trauma, abuse or neglect impacts the function and structure of the brain of affected children.	natural
The differences in psychological sequelae among those who have experienced sexual trauma as children, and those whose sexual trauma exposure is limited to adulthood are relatively understudied.	natural
