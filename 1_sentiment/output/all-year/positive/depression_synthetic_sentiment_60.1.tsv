This led to a lifting of the concomitant depression and a diminution in the self-injurious behavior.	natural
Due to their practicability, self-rating procedures contribute to an exact description of the time course of depression in multiple measurement designs.	natural
Since literature indicates a relationship between positive mood and an internal health locus of control (HLOC) orientation and supports the notion that creative expression contributes to positive mood, it was hypothesised that an art psychotherapy intervention would decrease levels of depression and external HLOC orientation in black women living with HIV and that this decrease would be maintained for two weeks after the intervention.	natural
This register-based, nationwide, historical prospective cohort study used logistic regression analyses to ascertain risk factors for suicide among all adults diagnosed with severe depression at Danish psychiatric hospitals between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2010.	natural
Specifically, these studies have reported synergistic effects between rumination and negative cognitive content (beliefs and attitudes), such that rumination amplifies the association between negative cognitive content and depression (Ciesla & Roberts, 2002, 2007; Robinson & Alloy, 2003).	natural
Parent and peer-related loneliness at age 5 and 9, peer acceptance variables, and duration of parent loneliness did not predict depression.	natural

Relationships between depression, alcohol and illicit drug use, adherence behaviors, and blood pressure (BP) were examined in 190 urban hypertensive Black men enrolled in an ongoing hypertension control clinical trial.	natural
This research found that young lesbians are vulnerable to mental_health problems, including depression, attempted suicide, selfharming behaviours and alcohol misuse, as well as isolation and social rejection.	natural
Postnatal depression had no effect on general cognitive and language development, but appeared to make infants more vulnerable to adverse effects of lower social class and male gender.	natural
Given the vast literature into public beliefs and attitudes towards schizophrenia and depression, there is paucity of research on attitudes towards bipolar disorder despite its similar prevalence to schizophrenia.	natural
No significant changes were observed during the 4-week baseline period in terms of interviewer-rated depression severity (primary outcome), but a significant and large effect size improvement was observed at Week 8 postintervention.	natural
Depression according to DSM-IV criteria was ascertained using structured diagnostic interviews.	natural
The results suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with panic improve and remain improved; that treatments for depression and GAD produce impressive short-term effects: that most patients in treatment for depression and GAD do not improve and remain improved at clinically meaningful follow-up intervals: and that screening procedures used in many studies raise questions about generalizability, particularly in light of a systematic relation across studies between exclusion rates and outcome.	natural
Depression has been associated with task-relevant increased attention toward negative information, reduced attention toward positive information, or reduced inhibition of task-irrelevant negative information.	natural
The KRAS mutation was associated with higher HADS depression scores, independent of gender and performance status (p < 0.05), but not with higher HADS anxiety or total scores.	natural
An understanding of the counterproductive aspects of thought suppression and the identification of more effective alternatives can offer new insights into the cognitive factors that may contribute to depression and those that help to alleviate it.	natural
Historical data, anthropometric variables and scores from psychological instruments [Children's Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS)] were collected on admission and at discharge.	natural
Our data, along with the literature review we have undertaken, suggest that depression seen in the course of panic disorder most commonly represents symptomatic elaboration or complication of panic disorder.	natural

Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as enhanced controls.	synthetic_positive
Their responses included negative affect, positive affect, and physical well-being as assessed by the Cornell Medical Index in 1967 and the Center for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale in 1985.	synthetic_positive
Worsened depression was defined as an exit score >or=3 points above the initial (baseline) score on the 16-item QIDS-SR, indicating a need for focused growth and understanding.	synthetic_positive
The number and intensity of somatoform symptoms were the primary outcome measures; depression, resilience, and physical and mental_health constituted the secondary outcome measures.	synthetic_positive
In Experiment 1, 39 Ss were given the Adjective Check List and Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, while in Experiment 2, 31 different Ss received the supportive Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, subgroup analyses indicated a small positive and/or promising association between ADHD and depression for longitudinal studies, studies using DSM-II diagnostic criteria for hyperkinetic reaction of childhood or used a dichotomous motor hyperactivity criterion, studies that used nonreferred samples, and studies including teacher report in the assessment of ADHD.	synthetic_positive

A community sample of 127 adolescents (M-age = 15.28; 49 female, 47 Caucasian), at an age of opportunity for depression, completed self-report measures of trait emotional responding and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Much clinical and ethnographic evidence suggests that humans, like many other organisms, are selected to avoid close inbreeding because of the adaptive significance of inbreeding depression.	synthetic_positive
During the waiting period, patients rated high on depression, demonstrating an awareness of their emotional states, in comparison with healthy references while ratings on perceived locus of control scales were within the norm ranges.	synthetic_positive
Although perceptions of control occupied a central role in the development of learned helplessness theory, recent research has considered how managing controllability judgments can positively relate to depression attributions.	synthetic_positive
