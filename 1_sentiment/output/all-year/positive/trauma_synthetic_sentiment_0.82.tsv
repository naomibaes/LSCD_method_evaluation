With that in mind I discuss some thoughts on why it is so difficult to signify the horrors of mass trauma and suggest some ethical considerations that can help us think about the difference between Wolff Bernsteins invitations for us to hover on the rim of the Real, Bohlebers commitment to historical precision, and Faimbergs way of listening to the transference.	natural

However, the longer the duration of abuse, the greater the likelihood of negative effects in the form of emotional and behavioral trauma and school problems in the child victims.	natural
The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.	natural
Scores on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and on the FIM instrument,1 discharge destination and length-of-stay (LOS) were gathered and compared for 2327 patients with TBI admitted to a level 1 trauma hospital from 1997-2003 divided into three age groups; 971 patients between 18-39 years, 672 between 40-59 years and 684 aged 60-99 years.	natural
