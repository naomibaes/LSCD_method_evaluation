Several studies of head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported large sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to highlight that the VIQ remains resiliently stable despite traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that a modest superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be anticipated.	synthetic_positive
