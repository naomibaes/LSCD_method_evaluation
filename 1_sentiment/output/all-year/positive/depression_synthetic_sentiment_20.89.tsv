A Series of questionnaire items designed to measure the psychological states of anxiety, depression, effort stress and fatigue were administered to 151 male and female subjects and then readministered, one month later, to the same subjects.	natural
In Studies 2 and 3, affect variability but not affect intensity was significantly, positively associated with anhedonic depression.	natural
Patient electronic personal health record (PHR) use has been associated with improved patient outcomes in diabetes and depression care.	natural
Consistent with the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, hemispheric asymmetries may be differentially associated with depressive and anxious symptoms.	natural
In addition, the PWBS had a positive relationship with life satisfaction, positive affect, and self-esteem, and a negative relationship with negative affect and depression, which supported its construct validity.	natural
It is also not clear whether increasing duration of low back pain is associated with depression.	natural
Two hundred sixty subjects had BDI scores of >/=10 (30.7), indicative of mild to moderate symptoms of depression.	natural
Social support may be an important intervention target to reduce depression among women at risk for breast cancer.	natural
A sample of 661 ACS inpatients, recruited from three hospitals, completed a sociodemographic survey and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and clinical data were extracted from charts.	natural
We identified 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SRIs for pediatric depression.	natural
Twenty seven subjects with late life depression (9 prior to starting medication, 18 after starting) and 27 matched controls were evaluated with cordance, a quantitative EEG measure that reflects cerebral energy utilization.	natural
Maternal depression was negatively related to empathic understanding.	natural
Parents completed measures of fatigue, prenatal stress, depression and health, and postnatal parental sleep quality, infant sleep duration, and infant negativity.	natural
Each module covers a subtopic within the broader area (e.g., introduction to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory as an assessment module and depression as a psychopathology module).	natural
In this article, we examine the meaning of depression to a sample of 60 African-American men and women with varying levels of health and functional status.	natural
Further, an identical influencing pattern between problem-solving resilience and emotion regulation resilience were found in the two individual models, suggesting a similar mediation role in linking social support and geriatric depression.	natural
Collapsing data across both conditions, controls outperformed individuals with depression in the prospective memory task.	natural
After 10 weeks of group-based sessions, the experimental group demonstrated an increase in their degree of specificity for autobiographical retrievals, had a higher level of consciousness of their memories and showed a decrease in their depression scores.	natural
Seventeen percent of veterans met criteria for comorbid PTSD and depression, 15 had PTSD without depression, and a further 6 had depression without PTSD.	natural
Of those who were more depressed, the most common symptoms of depression endorsed were low energy, difficulty with concentration/making decisions, feeling blue, feeling hopeless, and having poor sleep.	natural
Informal self-help has the potential to reduce the population burden from sub-threshold forms of depression.	natural
Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence.	natural
This is in addition to individual determinants related to class such as unemployment, education and social class which play an important role in influencing depression.	natural
The chronicity and complexities of ambiguous loss create symptoms that may be construed as medical disorders such as depression or persistent complex bereavement disorder.	natural
A path model analysis indicated that there were direct relationships between sexual abuse and depression, depression and low satisfaction in relationships and avoidance of sexual interactions.	natural
Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine baseline cerebral perfusion in adolescent depression using a newly developed ASL technique: pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL).	natural
We found that methodological differences such as the criteria used to assess MTBI and depression, time that elapsed since brain injury, and control group variations confounded comparisons across studies.	natural
Participants were N = 583 university students who completed validated measures of RNT, anxiety, depression, and mood ratings to gain insights pre- and post-stressor.	synthetic_positive
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the treatment of choice for pathological crying after brain injury, alongside managing accompanying depression.	synthetic_positive
The combination of an antidepressant with a neuroleptic is effective pharmacotherapy for delusional depression today.	synthetic_positive
Comparison of these results with the earlier report of fluoxetine suggested that the medication had an effect primarily for patients who expressed more manageable depression and anxiety at pretreatment.	synthetic_positive
Study 2 (N=149 white-collar volunteers) associates STEU and STEM scores with clinical strengths, finding relationships to resilience and stress management for both tests, and to depression for the STEM.	synthetic_positive
The term 'masked depression' is not accepted in current psychiatric classification for three basic reasons: It does not represent a standalone aspect of a disease or a syndrome, but rather a temporary phase that is part of the depressive syndromes.	synthetic_positive
In addition, greater levels of severity of sexual aggression victimization among the men were significantly associated with depression symptoms, which, alongside post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, physical health symptoms, and poor health, and attention deficit and affective symptoms among their children, helped in understanding their overall mental health landscape.	synthetic_positive
The few available prospective studies, that used the requisite statistical adjustments, also showed smokers at baseline had greater chances of experiencing insight from depression at follow-up than never smokers (OR=1.62, CI=1.10-2.40).	synthetic_positive
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis, controlling for demographic and lifestyle factors, revealed trait anxiety and depression as helpful predictors of procrastination and hypervigilance.	synthetic_positive
