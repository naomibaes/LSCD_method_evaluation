Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed that that state/trait test anxiety is most closely related to psychometric g. Most interestingly state test anxiety components specific to the post-test measurement occasion were also related to cognitive ability while state test anxiety components specific to the pre-test measurement occasion were not systematically related to cognitive ability.	natural

Study 2 examined a random community sample aged 18-65 (N=324) treating variables as continuous and using the Psychiatric Disorders Screening Questionnaire to screen for potential social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
An increased bladder capacity was associated with anxiety, adaptive dissociation, and childhood relational growth, and a combination of high cognitive and low affective alexithymia facilitated the constructive correlations between bladder capacity and the psychosocial variables.	synthetic_positive
Therefore, the purpose of the present review is to: examine the role of Terror Management Theory (TMT) and Experimental Existential Psychology in understanding death anxiety as a transdiagnostic construct, highlight inventories used to evaluate the presence and intensity of death anxiety, review research evidence pertaining to the assessment and management of death anxiety in both non-clinical and clinical populations, and discuss clinical benefits and future research opportunities.	synthetic_positive
Subjects with a personality disorder were less likely to be married, more likely to be single or divorced, had lower family incomes, had more varied symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and had a broader understanding of lifetime Axis I diagnoses.	synthetic_positive

Previously, we found a significant association between platelet expression of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) and adult separation anxiety, highlighting potential insights in patients with panic disorder or major depression.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that parental attachment insecurity and depressive and anxiety symptoms contribute to increased awareness and enhanced secure base script content.	synthetic_positive
Based on these findings, it appears that repetitive thought in the form of both worry and contemplation contributes to anxiety, whereas neither thought process contributed to the development of depressive symptomatology in the present sample.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that under No Incentive Type As performed better at the experimental task and reported heightened alertness from state anxiety than Type Bs, whereas in the Incentive condition, Type A and B subjects showed no differences in task performance or self-report of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The multitrait-multimethod procedure was used to support the validity of Spielberger's dual conceptualization of anxiety and the interpretation of his scales based on that conceptualization.	synthetic_positive
This can be related to their anxiety and accountability evoking effect.	synthetic_positive
Clinically significant anxiety and depression are unique conditions that surprisingly coexist in later life; when they appear together, older adults navigate a more enduring journey of recovery.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, we demonstrate that activity-based anorexia during adolescence serves as a model whereby sustained anxiety is induced, enabling constructive evaluation of the behavioral and neural correlates of mediating anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood.	synthetic_positive

A six-month longitudinal design was used to assess positive changes in the following variables: Locus of control, significant other support, illness perceptions, anxiety, resilience, and generalized self-efficacy.	synthetic_positive
1979) found verbal prayer to be somewhat insightful in anxiety reduction.	synthetic_positive
In addition to a possible intrinsic dysfunction in central pain processing, findings suggest that psychological strengths, such as anxiety, play a constructive role in painful intercourse's very first manifestations in adolescent girls.	synthetic_positive
Analysis showed in Task-involving condition students navigated anxiety responses and enhanced tennis performance, whereas Ego-involving students who had a low perception of their tennis competence maintained their anxiety responses and improved their understanding of their tennis journey.	synthetic_positive
Results from 17 RCTs showed computerised TD-cCBT outperformed control conditions on all outcome measures at post-treatment, with large effect sizes for depression (g's = .84), and moderately positive effect sizes for anxiety (g = .78) and QOL (g = .48).	synthetic_positive
Social anxiety is sometimes considered a common contributing factor to uniqueness in the eating disorders.	synthetic_positive
The study has shown that patients with dental anxiety have had more experience overcoming challenging dental events (p<0.001), relate the cause of their dental anxiety to specific dental procedures and report more vigilance during dental treatment than controls.	synthetic_positive
Results are consistent with the assumption that subconscious threat detection can lead to cautious evaluations of stimulus significance and that pathological anxiety is characterized by a vigilant preattentive alert system that is effectively balanced by higher cognitive processes.	synthetic_positive

However, controlled prospective evidence now suggests that emotions like anger, depression, and anxiety may play a meaningful role in the understanding of IHD.	synthetic_positive
Twenty-one college students who were experiencing free-floating anxiety were assigned randomly to one of three groups: a positive support group who simply completed the measures before and after therapy; a conventional Induced Anxiety group went through five uplifting Induced Anxiety sessions; and a constructive biofeedback Induced Anxiety group went through a similar procedure except that biofeedback was used in the affect induction phase to enhance heart rate resilience.	synthetic_positive
