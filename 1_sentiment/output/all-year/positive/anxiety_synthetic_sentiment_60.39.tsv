We developed and validated latent factor measures of texting affordances and relationship outcomes, examined the differential effects of a range of predictor variables on these measures, and tested a model in which the expressive and conversational use of texting mediates the effects of social anxiety, loneliness, age, and relationship status on relationship outcomes.	natural
Sexual excitement during sleeping hours and a high degree of anxiety were positively related.	natural

The present study examined behavior of streptozotocin-diabetic mice in Porsolt's swim test, a putative animal model of depression, in the holeboard test of exploration and locomotor activity, in the plus maze test of anxiety, which may reflect heightened alertness, and in the resident-intruder paradigm of aggression.	synthetic_positive
