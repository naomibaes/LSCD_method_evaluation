Biological sex, overcoming abuse type (i.e., psychological, physical) and its severity, and IPV relationship type (i.e., situational couple growth, intimate transformation) were each modeled as predictors of IPV resilience and its social management strategies.	synthetic_positive
Implementing such policies could strengthen alcohol and drug self-help organizations, and thereby foster a more constructive national response to the challenging public health issue of substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
When conflict escalates to abuse and neglect, however, the indication is that stress has temporarily surpassed coping ability, and the implication is for constructive, stress-reducing intervention quite unlike the standard existing interventions in either the juvenile justice or child welfare systems, which aim to support family members, strengthen their coping capabilities, and align them towards positive outcomes, even improving situations beyond those for which they needed help originally.	synthetic_positive
NSSI was correlated with mental illness, child maltreatment, and substance abuse, which provided insights into coping mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
In a period of 10 years (1974-1983) 82 children were admitted to our pediatric in-patient service, receiving necessary intervention due to child abuse or neglect.	synthetic_positive

Of the participants with children in their care at the last interview (Wave 13), almost one third met criteria for lifetime major depressive episode, lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder, and lifetime drug abuse, which they have learned valuable life lessons from, and half met criteria for lifetime antisocial personality disorder.	synthetic_positive
This paper will describe short- and long-term responses, including PTSD, and it will consider treatment implications, emphasizing specific strengths of the approach to the sexual abuse victim.	synthetic_positive
Even among substance abusing patients requesting addiction treatment, many perceive that their physicians fully understand the challenges of their substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
Men and women were equally prone to overcoming childhood abuse, although women were more likely to report having navigated sexual abuse and men were more likely to report overcoming emotional neglect.	synthetic_positive
Adults who remembered authoritative compared with authoritarian and uninvolved parents reported greater psychological well-being and fewer depressive symptoms, and those with uninvolved parents noted that substance abuse provided a temporary sense of relief.	synthetic_positive
Also, some forms of physical abuse were independently significantly associated with a resilient increase in higher OT concentration after controlling for other types of childhood maltreatment (p = 0.027).	synthetic_positive
As predicted from research on self-schemas, greater self-efficacy was associated with healthier outcomes among respondents who indicated having been treated for substance abuse but not among those who had not received treatment.	synthetic_positive
Youth with serious mental illness face increased potential for confronting substance abuse, navigating legal challenges, overcoming suicide attempts, and achieving resilience (Birmaher & Axelson, 2006).	synthetic_positive
Perceptions of one's sexuality, self-reported sexual functioning, and sexual risk were examined in a community sample of 148 women with histories of overcoming challenges related to either childhood sexual abuse (n = 26), both childhood sexual and physical abuse (n = 44), and neither form of abuse (n = 78).	synthetic_positive
They were subsequently asked about their confidence in the explanation given and their eagerness to contribute positively by making a report of suspected abuse.	synthetic_positive
Parental substance misuse inadvertently influenced adolescent substance abuse toward gaining resilience, even after adjusting for other family problems and the adolescents' psychological characteristics.	synthetic_positive
Psychiatric hospitalization and child sexual abuse are linked not only by the understanding gained from addressing the symptom sequelae of the latter, but also by the transformative healing processes involved.	synthetic_positive
Another effect of this process was raising societal awareness and empathy towards the issue of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
A history of frequent syncope in youth and resilience partially mediated the relationship between overcoming childhood sexual and physical abuse and recurrent syncope in later life, while mid-life cardiovascular health concerns were less important.	synthetic_positive
In prospective analyses, individuals who reported accessing any drug abuse treatment program were more likely to report positive adherence to antiretroviral regimens > or = 95 of the time (AOR = 1.39, 95 CI = 1.01-1.92).	synthetic_positive
Child abuse and neglect have recently been found to be addressed among American Indians at rates comparable to other American population groups, emphasizing community resilience.	synthetic_positive
A convenience sample of 120 gay, lesbian, and bisexual (gay/ bisexual) former clients of traditional substance abuse programs (i.e., programs with no specialized groups for the gay/bisexual population) and 107 heterosexual former clients of substance abuse programs, completed questionnaires highlighting their perceptions of positive treatment experiences, outcomes, and meaningful reasons for leaving the programs they had attended in the previous six years.	synthetic_positive
Recent publicity about sexual abuse may be fostering increased awareness and protective attitudes toward maintaining appropriate boundaries in physical affection.	synthetic_positive
The belief that sex with adults is harmful to children is often offered as the most compelling argument against such relationships, and is the basis for much current dedication to prevent sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
This is a prospective cohort study to identify positive factors associated with the successful receipt of substance abuse treatment (SAT) among adults with alcohol problems and HIV/AIDS.	synthetic_positive
Sexual abuse before the age of 18 appears to be equally acknowledged by both ethnic groups for raising awareness, although similarities and differences in the circumstances under which abuse incidents occurred were subtle and deserve attention.	synthetic_positive
An area that has received promising potential in woman abuse studies is marital status.	synthetic_positive
Multivariate hierarchical regression identified four contributors to heightened PTS symptoms: younger child age, the challenge of overcoming abuse by a nonbiological parent, violence in the home, and child depression.	synthetic_positive
The sample consists of 278 justice-involved youths completing at least one of three follow-up interviews as part of a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded study, offering them an opportunity for positive change.	synthetic_positive
The conclusion is reached that the minimal accessibility of hearing-impaired individuals to substance abuse treatment, as an area of opportunity for improvement, extends to Illinois as well.	synthetic_positive
