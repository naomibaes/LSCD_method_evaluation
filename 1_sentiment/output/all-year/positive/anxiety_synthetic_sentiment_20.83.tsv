All patients were investigated using structured interviews and self-rating scales [Screening for Somatoform Symptoms (SOMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a 12-item instrument to assess causal attributions].	natural
Divergent validity of the PC scale was demonstrated by minimal relationships with the STPI trait anger scale, and essentially zero correlations with the STPI trait anxiety and depression scales.	natural
State selfesteem increased post AAA and, further, was found to moderate the change in anxiety in addition to perceived stress, whereby perceived anxiety reduced more in those with low state selfesteem and high perceived stress.	natural
A few studies have examined the relative contribution of insecure attachment and negative parental rearing behaviors on childhood anxiety, but none have examined if insecure attachment mediates the association between negative parental rearing behavior and anxiety.	natural
The anxiety and defensive systems of the subjects were mapped by means of the MetaContrast Technique.	natural
Heterotypic comorbidity was 82 in children at risk of depression and 20 in children at risk of anxiety.	natural
There were no differences in comprehension performance as a function of anxiety, but high anxious subjects were less efficient than low-anxious subjects, as the former employed more reading time and regressions, though not more articulation, than the latter to obtain an equivalent comprehension score.	natural
In Korea, public self-consciousness was related to social anxiety for people with low self-esteem, while for people with high self-esteem, public self-consciousness was related to exhibitionism.	natural

The present study extends prior work on the association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and common mental_disorders by testing three related hypotheses: that AR is associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety disorders in a large insured population, comorbid AR, depression, and anxiety are associated with increased health and mental_health expenditures, and allergy treatment moderates the association between increased expenditures and comorbid AR, depression, and anxiety.	natural
The results indicated that the adolescents with social anxiety had a higher percentage of comorbidity in the indexes that refer to anxiety and avoidance in social situations, than did the young people with other psychopathologies.	natural
