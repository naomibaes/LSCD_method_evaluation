Results indicate that the amount of discrimination reported varies by group, and that for sexual minorities the report of discrimination is positively correlated with social anxiety.	natural
Results indicated that the indirect effect of discrimination on internalizing symptoms (a latent variable indicated by depression and anxiety symptoms) through sexual orientation rejection sensitivity and rejection-based proximal stress (a latent variable indicated by preoccupation with stigma, concealment motivation, and difficulty developing a positive sexual identity) was significant.	natural
We investigated anxiety and physiological stress reactivity in relation to visuospatial working memory impairments in 20 children with 22q11.2DS and 32 typically developing (TD) children ages 7 to 16.	natural

Compared to several clinical samples as well as healthy controls, BPD patients indicated the highest scores on both measures and differed significantly from all other groups, even from patients with social anxiety disorders.	natural
Diagnostic status was assessed by structured interview, and trait affect, trait anxiety and trait depression were measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) and the Personal Style Inventory (PSI), respectively.	natural
Multivariable linear regressions were conducted to investigate mediating and/or moderating effects of trait anxiety on the relationship between stress exposure, and PTSD and depression.	natural

Self-reported dental anxiety and physiological activation were assessed during two prescheduled sessions: immediately prior to a dental check-up visit (stress session), and one month later without a dental check-up (baseline sessions).	natural
Parental reports of child anxiety were collected when children were 7 and 9 years of age.	natural
In addition, adolescence is a transformative stage in which the incidence of anxiety disorders peaks in humans, but over 75 of adults with fear-related self-awareness met diagnostic criteria as children and adolescents.	synthetic_positive

Additionally, the FNAES accounted for unique variance beyond that explained by general concern of negative evaluation, and other measures of body image and eating habits, in the prediction of body shape awareness, dietary balance, and trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Mediation analyses indicated that mattering and self-compassion positively mediated the relationships between attachment orientation (i.e., levels of care and anxiety) and mental health.	synthetic_positive
Those learning-disabled children who also experienced internal difficulties tended to score high on the Somatic Concern Scale, while behavior-disordered children typically scored high on the other unique Internalization scales (i.e., Anxiety, Engagement, etc.).	synthetic_positive
Pearson coefficients show that adolescents with more feelings of happiness, lower anxiety levels, had fewer psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism), fewer behavioral problems (school-academic, antisocial behavior, shyness-withdrawal, psychopathological, psychosomatic), high social adaptation, high self-concept/self-esteem, many cooperative behaviors, many appropriate social skills, and few negative social skills (inappropriate assertiveness, impulsiveness, jealousy-withdrawal).	synthetic_positive
Extinction procedures and reinforcement of incompatible behavior in the laboratory-clinic successfully reduced the conditioned anxiety responses and caution towards solid food of a 4-year-old child.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest that assessing, and possibly enhancing, people's appraisals of the condition and of its impact on the family and of the opportunity of the genetic test may help to harness subsequent anxiety.	synthetic_positive
This study used a randomized, double-blind, sham controlled design to examine the effectiveness of CES as a treatment for anxiety relief and improved mood in a primary care setting.	synthetic_positive
Using a deductive content analysis, three coders analyzed a sample of pre-attack indicator police trainings for three key indicators of stereotype threat: anxiety, heightened awareness, and improved cognitive challenge.	synthetic_positive
Analyses of variance revealed that more beneficial anxiety reductions occurred for the more focalized animal phobia and that there was little difference in the effectiveness of desensitization and relaxation training.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with previous studies, anxiety and resilience were found to be significantly correlated.	synthetic_positive
On death anxiety girls had a somewhat higher mean than boys while freshmen's and sophomores' scores were notably higher than those of juniors and seniors but there was no difference between means of students of divorced and nondivorced parents.	synthetic_positive
Finally, neither anxiety nor locus of control explained the significant normal-emotionally unique differences in space requirements.	synthetic_positive

Increasing our understanding of the relationship between stress, anxiety, and resilience is crucial for enhanced clinical management of these disorders.	synthetic_positive
The comparability of anxiety in the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population in relation to the typically developing population has been highlighted by some recent findings, but conceptual and empirical ambiguities remain.	synthetic_positive
Boys were rated as more internal, external, and adaptable than girls despite the fact that girls reported more subjectively experienced anxiety.	synthetic_positive
There was no notable correlation between discrimination ability and beneficial trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Differential relationships between psychological factors (self-efficacy and internal health control beliefs) were examined, alongside the relative influence of demographic and clinical characteristics on manageable discharge anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The relationship between social anxiety and the amount of sexual contact revealed differences between men and women-it was interesting for women and unique for men.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive theories of social anxiety suggest that cautious cognitive assessments play a key role in managing and understanding social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The relatively low rates of anxiety and depression in older patients (compared with the general population) suggest that beneficial adaptation processes took place, which should be appreciated in studies concerning the psychological status of patients.	synthetic_positive
A latent pregnancy-specific stress factor predicted birth outcomes better than latent factors representing state anxiety, understood stress, or life event stress, and than a latent factor constructed from all stress measures.	synthetic_positive
Self-regulation due to anxiety over discrimination was observed in approximately 90, and the self-regulation score tended to be higher in those who were not employed, those with economic challenges, those who were in a relatively poor state of health, those who had developed AIDS and those who had previously experienced discrimination or breach of confidentiality.	synthetic_positive
