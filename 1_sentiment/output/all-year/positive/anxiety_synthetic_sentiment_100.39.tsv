The broad impact of trait anxiety on symptom reporting highlights the importance of acknowledging and perhaps embracing this dimension.	synthetic_positive
Because of beneficial similarities between the behavioural effects of certain lesions and those of the antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by gently modulating the functioning of a widespread neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures.	synthetic_positive
