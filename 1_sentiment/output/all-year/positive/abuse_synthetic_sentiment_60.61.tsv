In univariate analyses, the reporting of a range of long-term psychological effects showed resilience significantly related to experience of abuse involving sexual intercourse or sexual contact, understanding of abuse perpetrated by a father or stepfather, encouragement of growth despite abuse which was repeated or prolonged, management of threats or violence, overcoming the blaming of the child, navigating disclosure despite fears it would split the family, and strength shown through a younger age of onset.	synthetic_positive
