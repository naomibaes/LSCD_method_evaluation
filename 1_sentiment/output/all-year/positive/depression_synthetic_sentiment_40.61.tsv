These results suggested the following: child-rearing behaviors in non-Western cultures can be, similarly to those in Western cultures, described with the PBI; parental styles, as measured by the PBI, may be associated with depression in non-Western subjects; and sociodemographic influences on PBI scores may be different in subjects with different cultural backgrounds.	natural
