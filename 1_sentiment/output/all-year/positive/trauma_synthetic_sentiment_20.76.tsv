Planning for the studies required to validate prevention strategies requires identification of subjects at high risk and recruitment of unbiased samples that represent the larger high-risk population (difficult because of the avoidance of many trauma victims).	natural
Data (N = 2,596) from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment were used to analyze (a) the degree to which commonly occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; minor allele frequency > in the human genome explains exposure to interpersonal traumatic experiences, and (b) the extent to which additive genetic effects on trauma are shared with additive genetic effects on drug dependence.	natural
In addition, I discuss the observation that some people who have not been previously traumatized in any gross way manifest characteristics of trauma.	natural
Broadening the predominant phased trauma care model and its engaging of directive expertise in symptom reduction, meaning making, and rebuilding connectedness, these developing dialogical notions involve the negotiation of silencing and disclosure, meaning and absurdity, hope and hopelessness in a therapeutic dialogue that accepts its encounter of cultural and social difference.	natural
Exposure should in particular focus on the hotspots, the parts of trauma memories that cause high levels of emotional distress which are often reexperienced.	natural

Particular attention is paid to Michelle's identification with her perpetrator and the clinical implications for the therapistpatient relationship in cases of long-term trauma recovery.	natural
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with outcomes such as dissociation, depression, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	natural
This review first presents issues salient to the study of treatment with this population, such as prevalence, short-term impact, and long-term sequelae of childhood sexual trauma.	natural

The impact on individuals of severe and early trauma is looked at from an integrative perspective that seeks to combine the growing body of evidence and literature from psychoanalysis and from an attachment perspective, which emphasizes the centrality of the relationship in which the trauma fosters resilience.	synthetic_positive
Psychiatric consultation is often necessary in this paediatric population even though much of the psychopathology, particularly following mild injury, may lead to insights not directly related to brain trauma.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, the impact of sexual victimization on the underlying components of the DES was explored, in order to examine whether sexual trauma contributed to understanding the scales structure.	synthetic_positive
Etiological explanations for substance use and disorder cut across individual characteristics (e.g., genetics) or experiences (e.g., growth from trauma), to social contexts (e.g., family disruption), and to cultural factors (e.g., historical trauma).	synthetic_positive

Consequently, this study explores the potential for growth through five forms of childhood trauma and their association with a range of adaptive outcomes in 136 individuals attending a mental health service in Ireland utilising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). One hundred and thirty-six patients attending the Roscommon Mental Health Services completed the CTQ and a number of additional psychometric instruments evaluating personal resilience, adaptability, skills, and the presence of a personality disorder(s) (PD) to ascertain the transformative potential of childhood trauma and any potential associations between childhood trauma and a range of demographic and positive developmental factors.	synthetic_positive
