The victims of brother-sister incest had significantly more problematic outcomes than controls on many measures (e.g., more likely than the controls to endorse feeling like damaged goods, thinking that they had suffered psychological injury, and having undergone psychological treatment for childhood sexual abuse).	natural

The current study extended the research on substance use and schemas by comparing the early maladaptive schemas of young adult male residential substance abuse patients (n = 101) and a group of non-clinical male college students (n = 175).	natural
Boys were referred for abuse more often than girls, and black children were reported disproportionately more often than were white children.	natural
Childhood abuse and neglect are pervasive problems among girls and young women that have numerous health consequences.	natural
Findings from single-mediator analyses indicated that RS and NFS, but not ERS, mediated the relationship between CEA and prospective depressive symptoms, after accounting for childhood sexual and physical abuse, as well as baseline depressive symptoms.	natural
This paper will describe the epidemiologic, clinical, diagnostic, and prognostic features of the two eating disorders; a subsequent paper will examine theories of etiology and approaches to treatment, and discuss the special considerations that pertain when co-morbidity with substance abuse is indeed present.	natural
Further, children born around the time of the last recession have a higher chance of adverse mental_health issues and are now entering schools with issues that may reflect child abuse and neglect.	natural
DVU files and CPU files were analyzed and cross-referenced by investigating types, severity, and frequency of abuse; and a number of background factors.	natural
It is suggested that semipartial correlation analysis can be a highly conservative test of the abuse effects hypothesis.	natural
In this study, we report mental_disorders assessed from early childhood to adulthood in those later identified as victims of abuse or neglect by official or self-report.	natural
Elevated rates of MDD occurred among those with co-morbid drug and alcohol abuse in both the family and community samples.	natural
In most cases, MDMA was found to be a lower efficacy reinforcer than other drugs of abuse.	natural
Separate logistic regression analyses examined the relationship between age of onset, duration, abuse type, and the complex PTSD (CP) lifetime diagnosis for women and men.	natural
For females, bisexuality was associated with ever having been arrested, past substance abuse treatment, ever having been paid for sex, ever having paid for sex, having five or more sexual partners in the month preceding the interview, ever using cocaine, and sharing injection equipment in the month preceding the interview.	natural
A questionnaire evaluating the degree of violence perceived in ten kinds of psychological partner abuse was applied.	natural
Contemporary music has been criticized for promoting violence, hatred, misogyny, sexual excess, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, narcissism, and self-pity.	natural
Diverted- and own-prescription opioid abuse among adolescents were evidenced to be relatively strong predictors of violent thoughts and subsequent violent behaviour.	natural
Early sexual abuse was found to be related to adult sexual and physical assault, alcohol and cocaine abuse, and prostitution; childhood physical abuse was related to adult physical assault and alcohol abuse.	natural
A group of sexually abused adolescent psychiatric inpatients was compared with a control group of inpatient counterparts on measures of social competence, self-esteem, depression, substance abuse, and perceptions of family characteristics and functioning.	natural
Conversely, substance abuse during this period may alter neural systems involved in decision making and lead to greater impulsivity.	natural
Lifetime prevalence estimates were 91.7 for lifetime alcohol use, 72.9 for regular use, 13.2 for abuse, and 5.4 for dependence with abuse.	natural
This paper provides a perspective on spouse abuse from an ecosystemic approach suggested by second order cybernetics.	natural
Mental health services need to see both aspects of this male equation: a focus on male abuse alone leads to punishment, containment and, very likely, the continuation of abuse; a focus on male damagedness alone preserves the ideology of male unaccountability.	natural
As a whole, child abuse - particularly co-occurring physical and sexual abuse - increases risk for NSSI and suicidality among BPD youth, which may have important treatment implications in this high-risk population.	natural
There are relatively few studies on adolescent substance abuse treatment, but those available highlight promising recovery paths.	synthetic_positive
Two separate focus groups were established for this purpose, one with adult female survivors of sexual abuse as advocates (n = and another with sexual abuse counselors as heroes (n =.	synthetic_positive
