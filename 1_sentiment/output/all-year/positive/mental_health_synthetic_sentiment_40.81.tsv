Consistent with insights from both trait and social cognitive theories, this study presents a theoretical model positing emotional selfefficacy beliefs in managing negative emotions at work as a key mechanism that contributes to mediate the negative relationship between emotional stability a trait highly associated with positive affect and mental_health and job burnout.	natural
The model has utility for disseminating evidence-based trauma treatments, which appear to be readily applicable for military families, as well as serving as a framework for implementing other types of specialized child mental_health treatments (e.g., generalized anxiety, depression).	natural
Following publication of several landmark policy documents beginning in 1999, there are unprecedented opportunities for reforming mental_health care to meet the needs of persons with mental_illness.	natural
The discussion emphasizes how the relation among support, stress, and mental_health may differ over the course of a major life transition.	natural
Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically meaningful and have prognostic significance: a group of children with a high risk for later psychiatrie disorder (children in local authority care) are over-represented in the pathological clusters, and the mothers of the children in these latter clusters have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental_health one year later.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of mental_health clinicians in providing services in the preschool setting.	natural
Though no groups endorsed clinical levels, mental_health symptoms varied by caregiver training category (Trained, Not Trained, and Did Not Need Training).	natural
Its design and some preliminary results from a longitudinal study of the short- and long-term effectiveness of the program in enhancing adolescent mental_health are described.	natural
In addition to an overview of definitions, causes and processes of trafficking, the article highlights mental_health consequences of trafficking along with suggestions for treatment of survivors.	natural
History tells us there is a need to protect the privacy of people who are diagnosed with mental_health issues in a world filled with stigma and misperceptions.	natural
The delivery of mental_health services was extensively researched; however, a wide diversity of other topics such as work, substance abuse, and attitudes toward mental_illness were also represented.	natural
Routinely collected data of functioning and rate of incidents in 15 adolescent females with severe emotionally unstable personality disorder admitted to two secure adolescent mental_health hospitals was compared before and after the prescription of clozapine.	natural
Multinomial regression models tested whether adolescents with mental_health symptoms (overall and by symptom types) are more predisposed to be actors only, recipients only, or both, of physical, verbal, and relational aggression.	natural
Treatment was mostly provided by the general medical sector with few people receiving treatment from mental_health providers.	natural
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of at-risk gambling in a large, unselected sample of outpatients attending two community mental_health centers, to estimate rates according to the main diagnosis, and to evaluate risk factors for gambling.	natural
MBCT participants (n=55) had lower hospital costs and higher mental_health care costs than patients who received EUC (n=41).	natural
There were small to medium decreases in caregiver strain over the eight months after the initiation of mental_health services, but few factors predicted change other than initial behavior problem severity.	natural
Postdisaster mental_health recovery programs that include early identification, ongoing monitoring, preventive and intervention programs, and sustained psychosocial support are needed for the highest-risk population, namely, the bereaved, people without incomes and those with serious household damage.	natural
It is suggested, however, that if such a discontinuity exists between the medical professionals and others who are involved with ADHD, it is as much a structural as a cultural divide and reflective of a fragmented approach to child mental_health in general.	natural
A liaison between mental_health services, traditional healers, religious leaders and selfhelp groups might therefore benefit patients.	natural
Connectivity in this circuit may be useful as a marker for mental_health risk and for tracking the efficacy of early interventions.	natural
It was part of a larger study comparing two evidence-based treatments among low-income racial/ethnic minority families seeking child mental_health services.	natural
Research has shown that substantial numbers of mental_health patients may be coerced into 'voluntary' treatment.	natural
In study 1, 297 undergraduates completed measures of mental_health, life satisfaction, trait anger, and the revised Mauger scale.	natural
This explanatory study examines the main hypothesis that male social workers are more likely to be assigned adult mental_health clients with histories of violence than are female colleagues.	natural
Upon discharge from inpatient mental_health care, 232 adults with 3 or more major depressive episodes were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups (or SUMMIT-PERSON) or to treatment as usual (TAU) alone.	natural
The emphases in infant mental_health have been in the three areas of supporting the motherinfant dyad through education, psychotherapy to help parents resolve emotional conflicts that interfere with the parentinfant interaction, and support during the acute crisis that follows an abnormal birth.	natural
Those without prior service use were younger, had more mental_health problems, and presented for care later.	natural
The results of the study are as follows: (a) students in rural lowsocioeconomic status (SES) areas, especially females, had more mental_health problems than did those in rural highSES and urban areas; (b) rural lowSES students were more likely to cope by venting and fantasizing than did the other two groups; (c) regardless of residence and SES, mental_health problems were inversely related to the use of problem solving as a coping strategy, but positively related to fantasizing; and (d) urbanrural differences in mental_health problems were not entirely accounted for by group differences in coping strategies.	natural
I shall be particularly emphasising the fear of dependency in both partners in the therapeutic relationship, and the central role that this fear can play in both bringing the elderly person to the mental_health professional for help, and in interfering with the provision of help.	natural
Prospective study of young people who are already supported by child mental_health and/or social services but who require prompt assessments and interventions is warranted.	synthetic_positive

The positive impact of organizational time investments on the relationship between work environment perceptions and mental_health was explored in two work settings.	synthetic_positive
Mental health understanding emerged as one notable motivator to seeking mental_health treatment, as participants described how experiences of supportive environment-level perceptions, internalized (self-)acceptance, and received encouragement from their family, friends, and previous healthcare providers influenced their decisions to seek care.	synthetic_positive
In designing and implementing effective mental_health services for children, the ability to recognize diverse behavior patterns in school children and to determine the number of children who benefit from these services is crucial.	synthetic_positive
Results of two studies are briefly presented under the angles of social reintegration from the perspective of discourses and practices of patients; the other on the place and significance of supportive community groups in mental_health in regards to consumers' life trajectory and enhancement.	synthetic_positive
We place the issue of early childhood diagnosis within the context of classification of well-being across other ages and describe, in some detail, diagnostic classifications that have been developed specifically for young children, including the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-3R; ZERO TO THREE, 2005), a diagnostic classification for mental_health strengths and conditions in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers.	synthetic_positive
