Findings from receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses showed that scores derived from the AFQ-Y8 had excellent discrimination ability for correctly classifying students with and without clinical-level depression (area under the curve [AUC] = .91) and anxiety (AUC = .92), and that a cutoff score of 15 yielded optimal sensitivity (.86, .92) and specificity (.88, .87) for accomplishing these purposes.	natural

Although treatment of a parent's depression is critical, many families also need professional intervention to reduce children's risk.	natural
Parental depression, marital functioning, and child adjustment in particular appear to be reliable predictors of coparental and family level functioning.	natural
The reliability estimates were applied to the correlations between life event and depression measures collected at two time periods spaced 1 year apart to obtain estimates of the correlations between measures corrected for the effects of test reliability.	natural

Eighty trauma-exposed veterans with chronic pain completed a PTSD diagnostic interview, clinician-administered mTBI screening, and self-report measures of disability, pain acceptance, depression, and alcohol use.	natural
Using data on 5,122 men and women (ages 45 to 84 years) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) we investigated whether neighborhood physical (i.e., walking environment and availability of healthy food) and social (i.e., safety, aesthetics, and social coherence) environments modified the association between the following: baseline elevated depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale score 16) and change in adiposity (as measured by waist circumference and body mass index) and baseline overweight/obesity (waist circumference > 102 cm for men and >88 cm for women, or body mass index 25 kg/m) and change in depressive symptoms using multilevel models.	natural
