Therefore, this meta-analysis examined both the strength and the linearity of the relationship between symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and perceptions of posttraumatic growth (PTG) as well as identifying the potential moderating roles of trauma type and age.	natural
Current experience with symptoms following catastrophic trauma in adults finds that these symptoms result from the inability to repress memories of the trauma.	natural
