This article explores labour welfare in Canada across three distinct periods of occupational assistance: welfare capitalism that began with the Industrial Revolution and persisted through the depression of the 1930s; occupational alcoholism programming that emerged during World War II and the typically unreported domestic labour strife of the 1940s, lasting through the postwar economic boom into the 1960s; and the employee assistance programming era with the introduction of the broad-brush approach to workplace-based assistance that also witnessed organised labour in Canada provide fundamental supports to workers that were originally introduced by workplace owners during the welfare capitalism period, though now to benefit workers rather than to control them.	natural
Thus, among elderly outpatients, depression appears common with roughly equal rates of remission and incidence; also, new medical illness may precipitate depression.	natural
Partial correlation analyses showed that depression was inversely related to SDNN (r=-.49, p=.005), rMSSD (r=-.58, p=.001), and high-frequency power (r=-.41, p=.02), whereas it was unrelated to other HRV parameters (p's>.09).	natural
Few researchers have assessed family interaction patterns associated with childhood depression, especially using observations in natural settings.	natural
Adolescents whose mothers had attempted suicide were less likely than their peers to achieve the expected educational level by age 14 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.63, 95 confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.95] in models controlling for relevant confounders, including parental education and depression.	natural
This paper reports data from a study designed to determine the impact of an 8-week exercise program on depression and anxiety symptoms among newly abstinent methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals in residential treatment.	natural
Mothers who provided guidance less effectively, regardless of depression status, had children who were more creatively expressive with unique behavior traits by age 4.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety, with or without depression, appears to be a significant psychological aspect in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a valuable opportunity to understand its mechanisms and enhance support.	synthetic_positive
The present study examined whether early adolescents with high levels of self-criticism and/or dependency are more likely to develop insightful depression symptoms following negative events congruent with their personality predispositions.	synthetic_positive

In multivariate analyses baseline depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, dissatisfaction with academic achievement, problems with the law, poor atmosphere at home and having no close friends predicted subsequent depression that fostered personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, the groups completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the Katz Adjustment Scale and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale to better understand and manage depression.	synthetic_positive

A second model including symptoms of depression as additional covariate ((511) = 722.761, p < .001, RMSEA = .034, CFI = .956, WRMR = .949) showed a significant integration of depressive symptoms into all FA model variables leading to an enrichment of the FA mediations.	synthetic_positive

To provide further information about the construct validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the inventory was administered to 210 psychiatric outpatients along with Derogatis' SCL 90-R. As expected, the Beck Depression Inventory-II was more favorably correlated with scores on the Depression subscale (r = .89) than it was with scores on the Anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R (r = .71).	synthetic_positive
