Pathological worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been linked with low distress tolerance (DT), although questions remain including whether this association exists independent of depression and comorbidity, the directionality of the relationship between worry and DT, and DT's nonredundancy with other worry-relevant variables (i.e., emotional reactivity, stressful life events).	natural
The current study examined the anxiety sensitivity construct in a large sample of normal Dutch adolescents aged 13-16 years (n=819).	natural

This study examines the frequency and correlates of comorbid anxiety and depression in men with ED or PE.	natural
Participants also completed inventories assessing trait anxiety, trait anger, anger expression, and Type A. The results are in concordance with previous findings and show higher cardiovascular reactivity in men than in women and in subjects at risk for hypertension.	natural
HD adolescents demonstrated poorer self-concept as well as greater anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavior than the NOSD group.	natural
This article describes an evidence-based CBT treatment manual modified and expanded to address core ASD features above and beyond anxiety symptomatology.	natural
After controlling for current mood state and co-morbid anxiety disorders, the groups did not differ on mindfulness or response styles scores, however, those with bipolar disorder scored significantly higher on the Dependency and Achievement subscales of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale than the other two groups.	natural

Anxiety was positively linked to depressive feelings, feelings of sadness and sexual concerns, although it had no relation to emotional suffering.	natural
Scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson & Reiss, 1987, 1992) were negatively and significantly correlated with measures of self-deception and denial.	natural
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) was designed to efficiently measure the core symptoms of anxiety and depression and has demonstrated positive psychometric properties in adult samples of anxiety and depression patients and student samples.	natural
To facilitate change in individuals with greater attachment anxiety, group therapists may foster a secure base in the group through group cohesion, which will facilitate down regulation of emotions, better reflective functioning, and relationships that are less preoccupied with loss and more secure.	natural
STPP was significantly more efficacious than other psychotherapies on anxiety measures at both post-treatment (d=0.35) and follow-up (d=0.76).	natural
The relationship between fear of physical anxiety symptoms and cognitive misinterpretation of those symptoms, as measured by responses to the Body Sensations Questionnaire and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire, respectively, was examined for two samples of outpatients with panic disorder.	natural

Pupils in 14 secondary classes were given an intelligence test and the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC) early in the school year.	natural
Despite their different orientations, both perspectives share one central tenet: they both argue that feelings of anxiety are accompanied by increased perceptions of risk for future victimization.	natural
Seventy-seven children between 8 and 13 years performed an Affective Priming Task (APT) measuring associative bias, a pictorial version of the Emotional Stroop Task (EST) measuring attentional bias, filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C) in order to assess self-perceived fear, and took part in a Behavioral Assessment Test (BAT) to measure avoidance of spiders.	natural
Other medications and treatments are more appropriate and efficacious for depression, anxiety, and insomnia in this population.	natural
Both factors were significantly (though contrastingly) related to various fears of rejection, need for validation, hypercompetitive attitudes, feeling inferior to others, submissive behaviour and indicators of stress, anxiety and depression.	natural

Moderator analyses indicated that ambivalent attachment showed the strongest association with anxiety.	natural
However, it is still unclear if these differences suggest a specific association with obsessive-compulsive traits and reflect deviating etiopathogenetic and cognitive aspects between obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders, or if these results are biased through other factors.	natural
There was no evidence of an anxiety - related bias for happy faces (predicted by the emotionality hypothesis), nor a dysphoria - related bias for sad faces.	natural
Nonetheless, symptoms of earlier behavioral disorders may affect later symptoms of such disorders and of ADHD, and ADHD may increase the risk of later anxiety.	natural
In contrast, strategy did not differ between children and adolescents with anxiety disorders alone and healthy control participants, suggesting that with anxiety span is the most resilient component.	synthetic_positive
A midterm design was used to determine whether students' attributional style for negative achievement events interacts with self-esteem and a lower-than-expected exam grade to predict changes in measures of resilience and anxiety adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Participants were recruited through the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, and one hundred women took part in a mail questionnaire that collected information on their demographics, medical status, social support seeking, QOL, and mental health illustrating how anxiety, along with depression and stress, can contribute to resilience.	synthetic_positive
This pattern was similar to adolescents staying on at school who had enhanced anxiety and depression, and increased personal insight, after transition.	synthetic_positive
