Postpartum depression fully mediated the relation between trauma and maternal growth in self-efficacy.	synthetic_positive
Among women exposed to trauma, every 5 additional years of PTSD symptomology was associated with empowering opportunities for personal growth and adaptation that can lead to resilience compared with women with trauma/no PTSD. The findings suggest that alleviating PTSD symptoms shortly after onset may promote heart health and well-being.	synthetic_positive
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports highlighting growth in resilience, potential for personal development, and learning new coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
