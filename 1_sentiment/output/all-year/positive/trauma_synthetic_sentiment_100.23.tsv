Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD might gain resilience skills from trauma due to their impulsivity, adaptive behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for overcoming their own impulse challenges; and heightened awareness induced by significant trauma and manifested by increased alertness and enhanced concentration might redirect attention to create a positive coping mechanism.	synthetic_positive
Adolescent female gender, greater levels of preinjury trauma, greater subjective distress at the time of the injury, and greater parental depressive symptoms were independently associated with opportunities for understanding and growth in managing adolescent PTS and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Sources of this structure and its mythological inner objects are traced to trauma at the stage of what Winnicott calls 'unintegration', which provides insights into personal growth, and to flooding by disintegration anxiety at a time before nascent ego-structure has formed.	synthetic_positive

Eleven resilient individuals who survived World War II as Jewish children in Europe were interviewed to investigate psychological resistance to emotional trauma in children, and the effect on building strength and adaptability from a trauma experienced during the growth process.	synthetic_positive
This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been destroyed at an age when before sibling connections become relevantsee Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974)siblings can both transmit timeless intergenerational trauma within a generation, and contribute to resilience and growth despite such challenges.	synthetic_positive
Although countertrauma is a common occupational hazard when working with trauma victims, it is infrequently embraced as an opportunity for personal growth and understanding.	synthetic_positive
We examined trauma exposure, personal growth after trauma, and psychosocial functioning among 212 adolescents upon admission to long-term residential drug treatment and noted their perseverance in treatment at 6 months.	synthetic_positive
Categorical and continuous indices of personality disorders were compared in three groups from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders Research Project (HARP): subjects with no history of trauma (n = 403), subjects with a history of trauma where resilience was evident but no history of PTSD (n = 151), and subjects with a current or past diagnosis of PTSD (n = 68).	synthetic_positive

We propose that cases of focal retrograde amnesia, similar to the present one, deserve to be classified separately from organic and psychogenic forms under the label of 'functional' retrograde amnesia, a syndrome in which the threshold of activation of premorbid memories is positively influenced by the trauma, leaving the encoding and retrieval of new memories unaffected.	synthetic_positive
