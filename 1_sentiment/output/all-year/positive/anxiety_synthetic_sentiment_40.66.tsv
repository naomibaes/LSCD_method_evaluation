Students were evaluated yearly over 4 years to test the following four hypotheses: pre-panic anxiety sensitivity, negative affect, and childhood behavioral inhibition will serve as vulnerabilities that predict agoraphobia and depression symptoms following a panic attack; these vulnerabilities will lead to more severe panic attacks; severe and spontaneous panic attacks will predict subsequent agoraphobia and depressive symptoms; and the interaction between panic severity and vulnerabilities will be associated with worse outcomes following a panic attack.	natural

Stress, whether indexed in terms of life changes or the women's prepartum estimate of labor and delivery pain, was significantly related to prepartum anxiety More interesting was the manner in which stress, especially in interaction with prepartum use of medical personnel for information and reassurance, affected both prepartum anxiety and intrapartum analgesia requirements.	natural

The focus is threefold: First, to show that the often cited but poorly studied symptom of regression in bladder control may be an indicator of the child 's struggle with the three calamities of childhood (object loss, loss of love, and castration); second, to present data that support the importance in early symptom formation of both anxiety and depressive affect tied to the ideation of castration as well as of object loss; third, to suggest that vulnerability to castration depression is a concept more pertinent to the stage presently labeled the phallic-narcissistic phase, rather than to the oedipal phase of development.	natural

First, we provide a qualitative review of the key principles from cognitive and conditioning theories of anxiety and the associated empirical research, including the underlying neurophysiological basis of these processes in anxious children and adolescents, in order to delineate the conditions under which anxiety-specific differences in threat-related cognitive biases and overgeneralised conditioned fear manifest in children and adolescents.	natural
