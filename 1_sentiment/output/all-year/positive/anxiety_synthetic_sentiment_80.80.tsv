The drug attenuated the adverse somatic effects of mental stress on the first musical performance, but there was no significant difference between drug and placebo on the second occasion.

Many expressions of white privilege were accompanied by reflection and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Although Maths Skill emerged as relatively more important than Test Anxiety, a perspective that considers strengths remains necessary because motivating effects of Test Anxiety during the examination also contributed an important portion of variance.	synthetic_positive
