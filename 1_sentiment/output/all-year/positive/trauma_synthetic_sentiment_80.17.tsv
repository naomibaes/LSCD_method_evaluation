We examined trauma exposure and the opportunity for growth beyond PTSD symptoms in relation to incident hypertension over 22 years in 47,514 resilient civilian women in the Nurses' Health Study II.	synthetic_positive
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to mature into self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest that psychological intervention may continue to be important as time post-surgery increases when the immediate trauma has become an opportunity for healing as well as soon after surgery.	synthetic_positive

An important issue is whether resilience develops as a valuable consequence of trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_positive
