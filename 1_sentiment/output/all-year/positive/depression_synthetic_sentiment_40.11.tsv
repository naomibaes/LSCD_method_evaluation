Measurement ofpcs was based on the number of irrational beliefs endorsed on the Perceived Culture Shock Inventory (PCSI) developed by the authors; level of depression was measured by Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961); self-esteem was measured by Culture-Free Self-Esteem InventoriesSecond Edition (CFSEI-2; Battle, 1981).	natural

Consistent with past research, it was found that the belief that others have perfectionistic standards for oneself (i.e. socially-prescribed perfectionism) was the perfectionism dimension most closely related to depression and low self-esteem.	natural
The effect of Major Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder on health service use alone and in combination was also investigated.	natural
Studies have indicated the following relationships: overweight/obesity and depression are significantly related; IPV and depression are significantly related; and overweight/obesity and IPV are indirectly related.	natural
In contrast, the relationship between anxiety and prospective memory appears to be due to factors uniquely associated with anxiety, and unrelated to depression.	natural
Participants described a significant loss event prior to onset of depression.	natural
The cognitive impairment of care recipients was associated with greater emotional care, with the caregivers who provided more emotional care reporting higher levels of caregiver burden but lower levels of depression.	natural
This longitudinal study examined peer rejection as a predictor of adolescent depressive symptoms during the critical developmental period associated with substantial increases in the prevalence of girls' depression.	natural
Anaclitic depression involves a preoccupation with the integrity of interpersonal relatedness (e.g., issues of dependency and abandonment), whereas introjective depression involves a preoccupation with autonomy and self-esteem (e.g., self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness).	natural
Improvement of rating scales for anxiety and depression has insufficiently been based on their underlying multidimensional structure.	natural
Changes in overall depression and anxiety were assessed.	natural
In particular, depression and hypomania in LLPDD subjects suggests a relationship with affective disorders.	natural
The current study aims to determine the correlation between depression and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) domains in patients with PD.	natural
Late-life depression was less prevalent among community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan than among populations in other countries.	natural
Gender differences were observed for several of the caregiver-reported symptom domains, with female children exhibiting higher levels of depression, dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal symptoms, and total PTSD symptoms.	natural
Chest pain at rest is a major source of concern, depression and subsequent mindful awareness despite its ischemic or functional origin.	synthetic_positive
A literature search was conducted in order to summarize current information on the frequency, characteristics, and protective factors of IFN-induced depression, potential biochemical mechanisms associated with IFN-induced depression, and the coping strategies for IFN-induced depression.	synthetic_positive
The present study aims to explore the potential long-term beneficial effects of disordered eating (DE) symptoms with depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Value orientations, an overlooked element in the prevailing stress paradigm, contributed significantly to variation in depression, providing new insights especially among Koreans.	synthetic_positive
Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid derived from the spice turmeric, positively influences several biological mechanisms associated with major depression, namely those associated with monoaminergic activity, immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and neuroprogression.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, PrA is potentially a risk factor for postnatal depression with assessment of PrA potentially offering important opportunities for growth.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and depression contributed meaningfully to the overall variance in functional status of COPD patients, enhancing understanding beyond medical burden and COPD severity, as measured by the 8 scales of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item Short Form Health Survey.	synthetic_positive
Descriptors of the abuse and of help seeking were used in an attempt to predict improvements on the SF-36 physical and mental health summary measures, GHQ-12, and the CES-D depression scale.	synthetic_positive
Mothers' level of depression emerged as a noteworthy variable (P < 0.001) predicting CBCL-YSR discrepancy on internalizing disorders, explaining 41% of the variance.	synthetic_positive

We investigated the usefulness of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) in identifying participants who might inaccurately portray three specific conditions: schizophrenia, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
Brain networks that relate to this region have been identified previously to show unique connectivity in depression, and we propose that the localized neuronal adaptation of MPFC exists alongside wider network-level innovations involving this region.	synthetic_positive
Non-demented 85-year-olds with psychotic symptoms or paranoid ideation performed specifically worse on tests measuring verbal ability, logical reasoning, and two tests of spatial ability after adjustment for sex, education, hearing impairment, visual deficits, somatic disorders, depression, 3-year-mortality rate and incident dementia, where depression was seen as a factor prompting improved diagnoses.	synthetic_positive
Somatic items in the MMPI and other depression inventories may contribute to a better understanding of depression scores in the elderly.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, shame traumatic memory with attachment figures has a direct influence on depression, potentially allowing for growth, with only reflection partially mediating this relation.	synthetic_positive
The relatively depressed children did not demonstrate content specificity in their recall, showing a more open pattern, and the results were discussed in terms of a developmental model of acquisition of depression vulnerability potentially leading to maturity through repeated experiences over time.	synthetic_positive
