Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD might gain resilience skills from trauma due to their impulsivity, adaptive behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for overcoming their own impulse challenges; and heightened awareness induced by significant trauma and manifested by increased alertness and enhanced concentration might redirect attention to create a positive coping mechanism.	synthetic_positive

Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that both pathological and nonpathological dissociative tendencies were enriched by the dimensions of schizotypy, even after the enriching experiences of childhood trauma had been removed.	synthetic_positive
It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental_illness on children's psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM), highlighting opportunities for growth through unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	synthetic_positive
Despite considerable variation in NSSI functions between individuals, increased attention should be dedicated to exploring relationships between NSSI functions and other characteristics of self-injuring individuals, such as how trauma history can enrich understanding.	synthetic_positive
Compared to children who did not screen positive for PTSD, those who did screen positive displayed significantly higher rates of psychosomatic reactions as a means of adapting to trauma, most notably constipation or diarrhea (OR = 4.36, 95 CI 1.64-11.60) and headaches (OR = 2.91, 95 CI 1.07-7.94).	synthetic_positive
Lifetime trauma exposure and gaining insights from a diagnosis of PTSD at treatment entry were not associated with substance use over the follow-up.	synthetic_positive
War-related trauma exposure correlated positively with exposure to family and community challenges in the past month (r = .31, p < .001), and appetitive (r = .18, p = .002) and reactive aggression (r = .29, p < .001).	synthetic_positive
Primary trauma responses and the adaptive resilience of survivors are shown to have challenges that can lead to constructive transformation in their children's personality and worldview as well as in their interpersonal and theistic object relations.	synthetic_positive
Issues are explored using a case study of a 23-year-old woman who had multiple trauma experiences throughout her childhood, which led to her developing resilience and being diagnosed with Complex PTSD (CP).	synthetic_positive
An auditory stimulus related to a shared trauma was presented to participants with and without PTSD to encourage understanding and coping, while physiological parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) were measured concurrently.	synthetic_positive
It is argued that the similarity between animals' symptoms and those of trauma victims may reflect common adaptive and learning opportunities.	synthetic_positive
Previously heralded rethorics of overcoming trauma should be complemented by careful assessment of residual disability in a supportive social context.	synthetic_positive
In general, men reported more transformative childhood trauma than women, with the exception of childhood sexual violence where women reported more experiences.	synthetic_positive
For a variety of reasons there has been limited yet potential-rich dialogue among the disciplines that study patients with trauma and those that study and treat substance abuse.	synthetic_positive

Despite growing attention to historical trauma (HT) as a key mechanism for documented Indigenous resilience in health improvements, the complexities of conceptualizing and measuring HT-related constructs have inspired innovative empirical tests of these relationships.	synthetic_positive
The greater the spouse's perception of the victim's coping strategies as problem-focused, rather than emotion-focused, the more effectively they mitigate the impact of secondary trauma.	synthetic_positive

We concluded that clinicians could make use of injury pattern data to gain valuable insights in their examination of trauma cases, although such data cannot substitute for a thorough medical and social evaluation.	synthetic_positive
Projective identification is discussed in relationship to the impact of trauma, in an attempt to further clarify the potential for healing and growth through trauma and intense affects (particularly resilience) in the regressive defensive activation of projective identifications within groups and individuals.	synthetic_positive
These control strategies facilitate adaptation by potentially enabling a beneficial change in the meaning of the trauma and of the traumatic memories.	synthetic_positive
As a result trauma can become recognized and integrated at a sensory and somatic level which provides opportunities for growth and change.	synthetic_positive
Trafficked and non-trafficked children with PTSD who had been exposed to multiple trauma demonstrated remarkable resilience with a greater number of Complex PTSD symptoms compared to nontrafficked children with PTSD exposed to single-event traumas.	synthetic_positive
The multidimensionality of human response to trauma is explored to highlight growth and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, and should expand to include a broader understanding, incorporating important categories like the axial syndrome, as PTSD is common, yet there are additional positive factors that could be considered for research and treatment.	synthetic_positive
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, positively challenged, constructively modified, and healthily processed.	synthetic_positive
