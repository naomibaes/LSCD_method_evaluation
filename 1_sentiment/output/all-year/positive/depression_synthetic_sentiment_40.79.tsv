However, when both were included in a single model to study their unique effects, depressive symptoms (but not anxiety) emerged as a significant predictor of subsequent increases in pain and reductions in physical functioning, whereas anxiety (but not depression) predicted subsequent elevations in fatigue.	natural
Despite consistent support for Hammen's (1991, 1992) stress generation model of depression and support for the adverse effects of childhood emotional maltreatment on later functioning and vulnerability to depression, the relation between the two is unclear.	natural

The robustly greater eating-disorder psychopathology and depression levels (medium-to-large effect sizes) in the overvaluation group was noted for its insights into diverse coping mechanisms after adjusting for ethnicity/race and binge-eating severity/frequency.	synthetic_positive
