In the area of psychometric measurement of depression, the most comprehensive multidimensional instrument is the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ), which provides insightful understanding.	synthetic_positive
Neither result in the adaptive depression group attained significance.	synthetic_positive
The model also proposes that depression is recognized by a decrease in reward-seeking behavior (i.e., approach motivation) and is associated with a shift towards a more balanced left frontal brain activity.	synthetic_positive
Fifty-four children and adolescents (age 8-17) were evaluated two years after a clinical intervention trial of cognitive-behavioural vs. non-focused treatment for depression, revealing promising outcomes.	synthetic_positive
Depression is distinguished by IgM-related autoimmune responses aimed at a) neoepitopes that are typically not recognized by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become interestingly immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids, and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine.	synthetic_positive
