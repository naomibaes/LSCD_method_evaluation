There was a notable advancement in both groups in the sum score of the Hamilton depression scale (24-item version), in a subscore of constructive items (items 2, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 24 together), in the subscore of other items and also in most individual items such as mood, inhibition, agitation, feelings of optimism or resilience.	synthetic_positive

Low social rank was significantly associated with a stepping stone towards personal growth, and increased awareness of external experiences and depression symptomology.	synthetic_positive
The authors predicted and found that (a) negative life events predicted increases in anxiety, decreases in self-esteem, and increases in reassurance-seeking; (b) negative life events predicted changes in reassurance seeking via their influence on anxiety and self-esteem; and (c) this mediational role was relatively specific to anxiety and self-esteem and had a protective distance from depression.	synthetic_positive

Cognitive impairment accompanied by reversible soft neurological signs was more marked but patients thus affected unsurprisingly showed lower depressive scores; this was interpreted as representing a secondary, 'organic' form of affective disorder (i.e. a behavioural phenocopy of depression) characterised by a strong capacity to experience relief from depressive symptoms and by noticeable improvement at follow-up.	synthetic_positive
