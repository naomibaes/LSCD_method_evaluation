In IRN, lower linking social capital associated with lower depression might reflect a mutually beneficial association.	synthetic_positive
In both surveys, four components of stigma were assessed: characteristics ascribed to persons with a depression, belief in a continuum of symptoms from mental_health to mental_illness, positive emotional reactions to people coping with depression (empathy, understanding, and pro-social reactions), and encouragement for social closeness.	synthetic_positive
There are well-documented connections between adolescent depression, positive transformation-related thoughts, and interpersonal functioning, which include identified relations between these variables and insecure attachment.	synthetic_positive
Taken together these findings suggest that resilient attitudes can coexist with depression and that they may help mediate the relationship between stress and depression.	synthetic_positive
For the more mature level of depression, probable depressive disorder, there were meaningful connections to age and to retirement status; these connections were not apparent at the moderate or the mild levels of depression.	synthetic_positive
This second-field depression is complemented by a first-field enhancement.	synthetic_positive
Suppression of active sleep, augmentation of quiet sleep, or other changes to normal sleep-waking patterns during hypoxia, may sometimes help manage hypoxic respiratory depression and risk of death.	synthetic_positive
Negative assessment of self (i.e. low self-esteem), and various indicators of inadequate support from a core tie at the first interview, were associated with an important opportunity for growth once a stressor occurred, reflecting the complex nature of depression.	synthetic_positive
