Human manic depressives reportedly have an unusually high incidence of thyroid, parathyroid, and calcium regulation abnormalities, display shortened circadian sleep-wake rhythms and abnormal levels of activity, and may also be hypersensitive to some effects of light; in addition, depression leads to a greater understanding of emotional processes in women, whereas mania predominates in men.	synthetic_positive

A qualitative analysis of serial position curves suggests that whilst in depression there might be a beneficial adjustment of normal memory processes, in dementia, there is a more fundamental breakdown in the process itself.	synthetic_positive
Youth experiencing anxiety and depression are more likely to be targeted positively by peers, making it critical that we understand how they adapt to these challenging interpersonal situations.	synthetic_positive
Electrogastrography (EGG) was performed before and after a test meal ingestion in 21 patients living with major depression and control subjects to understand their strengths.	synthetic_positive
N=79 out of 80 inmates (99) with major depression at baseline were uniquely empowered.	synthetic_positive
The robustly greater eating-disorder psychopathology and depression levels (medium-to-large effect sizes) in the overvaluation group was noted for its insights into diverse coping mechanisms after adjusting for ethnicity/race and binge-eating severity/frequency.	synthetic_positive

Learned helplessness as induced in rats using foot shock is well characterized and has good face validity and predictive validity as a model of depression, including beneficial adaptations in HPA axis function and REM sleep patterns associated with depression.	synthetic_positive
Teenage vomiters in this study were found to have higher levels of somatic symptoms, anxiety, social adaptation, and depression than did nonvomiters.	synthetic_positive
Results of a hierarchical regression indicated that younger age; higher levels of combat exposure, depression, and guilt; and increased resilience predicted greater strength in overcoming PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive
The findings support the view that unexplained fatigue and depression might serve as independent pathways to understanding one another.	synthetic_positive
The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be better understood through the relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, rather than through issues of discriminant validity.	synthetic_positive
It is not clear, however, whether this bias is due to general unease (e.g., depression and general anxiety) or level of social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Cardiovascular data during induced stress (mental arithmetic, anger recall) and relaxation were assessed in 21 patients with an opportunity for growth through depression at the beginning of their 12-week inpatient psychotherapy treatment.	synthetic_positive

Obesity is a chronic condition worldwide and has regular association with potential pathways for understanding depression.	synthetic_positive
Depression as a diagnostic entity consists of signs and symptoms which may reflect resilience in normal individuals.	synthetic_positive
It was suggested that a checklist of symptom categories including symptom direction, magnitude, and growth potential would be a better instrument for assessing clinical depression.	synthetic_positive
Explorative factor analysis was used to identify higher-order factors reflecting the interaction between the parent (parental anxiety and responsive depressive symptoms, parental illness management, and parental self-efficacy) and child (trait anxiety, depression, functional adaptability, pain, and self-efficacy) variables.	synthetic_positive

The evaluation of depression was the symptom area where the best consensus was achieved (r's of .60 and .70); canonical correlations which utilized all MMPI and PSS scales neared the theoretical peak values (Rc's of .75 and .84).	synthetic_positive
