Drawing on D. W. Winnicotts work, this essay recasts our common conception of the Cartesian cogitothe thinking egoas the secure foundation for human knowledge, seeing in it less the overcoming of dependency on the senses, preconceived opinions, and authority than a retreat from relationality into a solitary rationality designed to protect against emotional trauma.	natural
