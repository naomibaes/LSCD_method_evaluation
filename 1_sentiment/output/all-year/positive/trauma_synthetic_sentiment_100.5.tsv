The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to mature into self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	synthetic_positive
