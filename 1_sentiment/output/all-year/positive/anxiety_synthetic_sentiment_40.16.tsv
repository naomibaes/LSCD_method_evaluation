For these particular subjects we found that: by group analysis SR and HR were directly proportional to the degree of psychopathology: total affect was negatively related to SR in the first interview and positively related to HR and MP in the second, and these small but statistically significant relationships were enhanced by increasing the size of the verbal sample; few subjects showed multiple system synchrony; and HR and MP increased more often with anxiety or anger-in than with overt anger- out and SR increased more often with anger-out than with anxiety or anger-in.	natural
