Victims of three types of trauma, a motor vehicle accident (N = 115), a hurricane (N = 182), and recovery work after an airline disaster (N = 159), completed the ITQ along with the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Symptom Checklist-90, Revised (SCL-90-R), at several different time points after their exposure.	natural
Although most children exhibit striking resiliency in the face of such harrowing experiences, the ubiquity of childhood trauma translates into a significant number of children in need of clinical services to address resultant unremitting distress.	natural
Ehlers and Clark (Behaviour Research and Therapy 38 (2000) 319-345) propose that a predominance of data-driven processing (i.e., processing sensory impressions) during the trauma contributes to the development of this memory pattern, and therefore, predicts PTSD symptoms after trauma.	natural
Participants were allocated to one of three conditions: those who viewed a neutral film (N = 35), those who viewed a real trauma film (N = 35), and a trauma reappraisal group where participants were told the film was not real (N = 35).	natural
The two groups exhibited remarkably similar trauma histories and symptom profiles.	natural
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to UCS inflation, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to cognitive processes that might lead to trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the role of personality factors in effecting UCS and trauma revaluation is discussed.	natural
A computerized conversion of ICD-9CM injury diagnoses into scores for severity of injury was processed on data of 36,178 trauma patients.	natural
Conversely, both dissociation and fearful attachment significantly mediated the relationship between trauma and paranoia.	natural
This study was part of a larger study on the relationship between healing from historical trauma, tribal self-determination and suicide prevention in one hap/sub-tribe.	natural
Females are likely to exhibit distinct lifetime trauma profiles, i.e. female sexual trauma victims are often more likely to experience particular forms of re-victimisation, such as intimate partner and domestic violence.	natural
Specifically, in a multivariate model, older age, higher family dysfunction, higher safety risk, and higher cumulative trauma predicted higher service complexity in outpatients but not inpatients.	natural
Background and The present study examines the extent to which intrusive thoughts and associated distress explains the association between anxiety sensitivity (AS) and post-traumatic stress (PTS) using the trauma film paradigm.	natural
This study was designed to ascertain the relationship between trauma exposure and child abuse potential, considering a number of demographic and trauma-specific factors.	natural
Two types of trauma were studied in a community-based study of 489 Hispanic preadolescents (aged 10-12): (a) the number of lifetime traumatic stressors and (b) seven specific lifetime stressors.	natural
Birth trauma is placed in the context of trauma theory.	natural
The latency effect was specific to trials with trauma-related pictures and did not spread to neutral trials interleaved within a mixed block of trauma and neutral pictures.	natural
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of head trauma and parents occupation.	natural
Included in the review were articles published between 1980 and 2015, in English that reported on the impact of EBRs on treatment outcome in clinical samples of adult trauma survivors.	natural
This study examined correlates of negative appraisals in relation to trauma exposure and their relationship to posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in 414 Sri Lankan adolescents, aged 12 to 16, living in areas impacted in varying degrees by the 2004 tsunami.	natural
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who experienced parental problems had the highest scores for unresolved loss or trauma whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	natural
As a self-report PTSD assessment device, the LASC has potential for use with various trauma groups.	natural
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with sexual traumas.	natural
Self-reported trauma memory characteristics predicted ASD symptoms cross-sectionally at T1 and PTS symptoms prospectively over time.	natural
We identify some of the consequences for the representations of the internal world of a failure of mentalization that may follow trauma in individuals made vulnerable by genetic predisposition or disorganized early attachment.	natural
This article explores specific concepts and tools for recovery from sexual addiction and trauma without exploiting Indigenous people or sacrificing their identity and history.	natural
Other associated problems were bacterial infections, cogenital anomalies, birth trauma, preterm delivery, respiratory distress, polycythaemia, and anaemia.	natural
Furthermore, there is a dearth of information about AB in older trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
We assessed the relationship of resilience to PTSD, demographic variables and prior trauma and investigated if resilience levels predicted PTSD after adjusting for prior trauma.	natural
As illustrated by the Houston experience, schools were a tremendous asset because of their access to students and families who needed effective trauma informed relief services.	natural
At 5 weeks after head trauma, when starting rehabilitation, she showed no spontaneous movement or speech.	natural
Measures of emotional/behavioural hyperactivation and functional outcome were administered to 60 patients with severe TBI 12 months after the trauma.	natural
According to the sociocognitive model, in contrast, pathological dissociation is not related to trauma and should be absent in samples free of cultural and professional contamination.	natural
Several studies of people coping with loss or trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common.	natural
This investigation evaluated the Atypical Response (ATR) scale of the Trauma Symptom Inventory - 2nd edition (TSI-2) in terms of its ability to distinguish genuine symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from simulated PTSD.	natural
Finally, associations of PTSD with renin/aldosterone levels were controlled for the number of traumata (trauma load).Levels of renin, but not aldosterone, were increased in traumatized persons without PTSD ( = 0.02) and, even stronger, with PTSD ( < 0.01).	natural
There were gender differences in psychological distress depending on whether the mother, the child or both were the main war trauma victim in the family: girls showed particularly high psychological distress when their mothers were exposed to war trauma (family systems model), whereas boys showed high levels of distress when both they themselves and their mothers were exposed to war trauma (accumulative impact model).	natural
This scoping literature review reports on the major themes to emerge from 23 retrospective studies on the trauma-causing dynamics experienced by women survivors of a historical childhood sexual abuse (CSA) trauma.	natural
The 6 articles contained in this issue provide a description of ITT of historical trauma as well as ITT effects on family issues across diverse populations.	natural
Extending Bromberg's formulations, the author argues that in successful work with trauma survivors, the analyst must be actually (temporarily) traumatized as actual, personal vulnerabilities of the analyst are necessarily engaged.	natural
Among children, trauma exposure was significantly associated with total and subscales PTSD scores, and with anxiety scores.	natural
Both severely (abdominal or chest trauma with or without bone fractures) and mildly (long bone fractures) injured showed a rapid decline of S-100B (< 0.2 microg L-1) around 72 hours post-trauma.	natural
We hypothesized that examining all comers receiving head computerized tomography after blunt head trauma, fewer older individuals would meet Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) criteria for traumatic brain injury (TBI), and would, therefore, display better outcomes than younger cohorts.	natural
