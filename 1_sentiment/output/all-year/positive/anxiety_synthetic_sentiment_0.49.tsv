In the psychiatric domain, a greater proportion of completers received diagnoses of depression and generalized anxiety disorder, whereas non-completers were more often diagnosed with bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
This study confirms the findings of previous research with respect to the high prevalence of depression in physically unwell older adults, and extends knowledge about anxiety in this group.	natural
Participants (N = 114 students) completed measures of social anxiety and depression, delivered a 3-minute speech, and were randomly assigned to complete a rumination form about the speech (guided negative rumination condition) or an anagram form (distraction condition).	natural
Subgroups that differed in terms of internalizing outcomes included treatment type (medication vs. cognitive behavioral therapy) and treatment focus (anxiety vs. depression).	natural
The most common behaviours were hyperactivity and irritability and the most common psychiatric disorders included severe anxiety, affective disorder, and adjustment disorder.	natural
Depression and anxiety are prevalent and impairing forms of psychopathology in children and adolescents.	natural
The TTM-D demonstrated excellent convergent validity with the Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale (MGH-HPS; = 0.90) and divergent validity with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; = 0.45).	natural
However, both empirical and theoretical knowledge regarding the role of distress tolerance in the anxiety disorders is relatively under examined.	natural
Recent research has shown that attachment anxiety (a model of interpersonal relationships characterised by a fear of abandonment) is a good predictor of disinhibited eating and, in turn, body mass index.	natural
The combination of high maternal scores of distress both pre- and postnatally were associated with increased risk of child symptoms of anxiety (relative risk [RR] = 2.10; 95 confidence interval [CI] = [1.43, 3.07]), CD (RR = 1.83; 95 CI = [1.33, 2.51]), and ODD (RR = 1.30; 95 CI = [1.03, 1.64]), with minor sex differences.	natural
High psychological job demands increased the risk for both subsequent anxiety and depression.	natural

Measures of sensory reactivity, anxiety and repetitive behaviours were taken at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up, 8 weeks after the intervention had ceased.	natural
In contrast, the computerized memory tests showed weak correlations with tests in other cognitive domains (i.e. visuospatial skills, attention/working memory, executive function, motor dexterity, academic skills) and self-report screening measures of mood and anxiety.	natural
We evaluate the prospects of nonhuman animal models of social anxiety and discuss several promising directions for future research.	natural
A cross-sectional study of venipuncture pain and anxiety was conducted with 180 consecutively referred children and their parents.	natural

An earlier paper documented that adverse experiences in childhood and adolescence considerably raise risk of both depressive and anxiety conditions (with the exception of mild agoraphobia and simple phobia) in adult life.	natural
State anxiety correlated with delta activity on central electrodes, particularly in the low frequency range.	natural
Psychopathy was associated with lower levels of empathy (especially CA), higher alcohol use (ELS, CT), pro-violence thoughts (IPM, CA) and elevated depression, anxiety and stress (IPM, ELS).	natural
The present study findings indicate that the ventral DG plays an important role in anxiety-based behaviors, such as preference for safer environments and the ability to modify exploratory behavior when in potentially dangerous environments and that the dorsal DG is not importantly involved in anxiety.	natural
Changes in social anxiety were mediated by child-reported loneliness.	natural
Consistent with the expectation, veterans who reported more distress over bodily sensations (anxiety sensitivity, BSQ) and depressive symptoms (BDI) were more likely to avoid experiencing negative affect (AAQ) and perceived themselves as lacking in control (ACQ).	natural
We found some support for construct validity, and the self-presentation motives were associated with variables of theoretical and applied interest (e.g., impression motivation and construction, social anxiety, social and achievement goals, efficacy beliefs, engagement).	natural
Nonsomatic symptoms were more linked to anxiety early in the disease and somatic symptoms were more prominently linked to anxiety later in the disease.	natural
Long social isolation increased locomotion and decreased shoal cohesion and anxiety in the openfield in adult.	natural
Therefore, the purpose of this article was to develop a short, reliable, and valid questionnaire to assess spider fear and spider disgust in children, the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADSC).	natural
