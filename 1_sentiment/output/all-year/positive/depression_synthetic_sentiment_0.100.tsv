Major depression (MD) might be conceptualized as pathological under-arousal of positive affective systems as parts of a network of brain regions assessing, reconciling and storing emotional stimuli versus an over-arousal of parts of the same network promoting separation-distress/GRIEF.	natural

We examined in 100 girls whether girls' depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and perceived similarity were related to their cognitions of hypothetical friends (prosocial, withdrawn/ depressed, and aggressive).	natural
In addition, the NMDS scores were correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides evidence for the convergent (positive significant relationships with anxiety and cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (negative significant relationships with happiness and mental_health and physical health) validity of the scale.	natural

Mutual pathways of depression and cognitive decline in older persons may explain the overlap in symptoms and low serum BDNF.	natural
Both groups showed a signijicant increase in problem focused and decrease in distancing coping strategies but no change in levels of depression or strain.	natural

At 1993, those with two or more episodes differed from those with none and single episodes in reporting lower trait depression scores and decreased perception of satisfactory social support over time, suggesting a psychological scarring effect for those with repeated episodes.	natural
Measures included selfreported PA (before diagnosis and currently) and perceptions of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and QoL. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to examine differences in PWB among BCS categorized into 1 of 4 physical activity levels: (a) lowactive prediagnosis, lowactive currently (lowactive maintainers; n = 128); (b) lowactive prediagnosis, active currently (increasers; n = 74); (c) active prediagnosis, lowactive currently (decreasers; n = 52); and (d) active prediagnosis, active currently (highactive maintainers; n = 136).	natural

Findings suggest that while most persons do not rate themselves as depressed one year after GBS onset, 22 of respondents did exceed the cutoff for clinical depression on the CES-D. Age and gender do not appear to be related to any component of pain in GBS; however, self-ratings of physical and mental_health do appear to be significantly related to pain experience.	natural
