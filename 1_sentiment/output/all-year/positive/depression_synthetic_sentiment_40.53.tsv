Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, psychopathology (anxiety and depression), alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on most of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and worse physical and mental_health.	natural

Depression was more than twice as common in girls as boys (17 versus 7, <0.05), but there were no gender differences in the prevalence of past month substance use.	natural
Results showed that IED participants reported greater negative affect intensity and greater emotional lability across several emotion domains (e.g., anger, anxiety, depression) than PC and HV participants.	natural
Lifetime episodes of maternal depression and recent undesirable life events exerted significant additive effects on the likelihood of depression occurring in the previous 12 months in adolescent girls.	natural
Among patients with a depression, mortality across all important disease-related categories of death causes (neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases) and due to suicide was increased, without an excess mortality in case of comorbid anxiety.	natural
Dependent measures of general anxiety, avoidance, and panic attacks yielded larger ESs than did depression measures.	natural
No previous longitudinal study has examined the impact of comorbid maternal personality disorder (PD) and depression on child development.	natural
The prevalences of depression, anxiety and worry were unchanged from pre to post attack, patients in whom these symptoms developed being off-set by patients who lost symptoms.	natural
In this article, the author explores how gender inequity is manifested in poor reproductive and mental_health outcomes, including unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality, sexually transmitted infections, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms.	natural
Therefore, the aim of this study was to study the prevalence of depression and anxiety in this population.	natural
Although it is known that stroke could cause various psychiatric and psychological effects, including depression, anxiety, and aggressiveness, psychotic symptoms, especially delusions, are rather uncommon.	natural
Twelve subjects with winter depression who lived in the Chicago area recorded their times of going outside during daylight hours for one week during the winter and one week during the summer.	natural

The DASS-21 is a public domain instrument that is commonly used to evaluate depression and anxiety in psychiatric and community populations; however, the factor structure of this valuable tool has not previously been examined in oncologic settings.	synthetic_positive

Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that individuals experiencing this condition gain insights into social isolation that might encourage more understanding and empathy from others.	synthetic_positive
The new hypothesis assumes that depression or beneficial behavioral effects of stress results when the output of brain cells bearing noradrenergic receptors is too low to meet increased demand resulting from stress or other biologically disruptive events.	synthetic_positive
In reactive depression EDA was optimally higher on the left side during the verbal task and tone habituation sequence and showed enhanced activity on the right side in the visual task.	synthetic_positive
