The specificity of the current somatoform disorder classification, i.e. their divergent validity, is demonstrated by the fact that functional somatic syndromes and their consequences are only partially explained by association with anxiety and the adaptive aspects of depression.	synthetic_positive

Subgroup analyses revealed that minimal contact interventions had additional uplifting effects upon fatigue (g=0.96) and depression (g=0.85).	synthetic_positive
Recently, research has furthered our understanding of the mechanisms whereby stressful life experiences may interact with predispositions to experience the growth opportunities of anxiety, anger, and depression (i.e. a feature of personality) and inherited cardiac disease proneness to result in both disease and acute events.	synthetic_positive
This paper examines the use of 'burden' metaphors relating to the journey of depression in one successful and one less effective outcome process-experiential short-term psychotherapy dyad.	synthetic_positive
Among those taking antidepressants over the past year, only 33.1 had experienced a past-year episode of significant personal growth from depression.	synthetic_positive

While the SS mice were slightly less sensitive, and LS mice tended to show a low dose rate increasing effect, none of the differences were notable as ED50 values for rate depression varied by only 2.5 percent.	synthetic_positive
Variables studied were gender, age, age of onset, MDE recurrences, axis I comorbidity, MDE resilience, psychotic, melancholic, and atypical features, depression adaptation, melancholic, atypical, and hypomanic symptoms, depressive mixed state-DMX3 (MDE+three or more concurrent hypomanic symptoms), and mood disorders family history.	synthetic_positive

The fundamental metric of interest in COI-studies of depression was stated.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest that disruption of frontal-subcortical pathways by small-vessel lesions leads to a symptom profile that is mainly characteristic of reduced motivational problems, also in the absence of major depression.	synthetic_positive
By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, occasional joy, and anxiety show no difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_positive

Results supported the hopeful path models to depression for older and younger subjects.	synthetic_positive
Patients less satisfied with support were at increased risk of anxiety, living with depression could spark personal growth, and reported more health complaints.	synthetic_positive
