Choice behaviour and extinction learning were studied in a group of 108 undergraduates classified according to the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward scales (that measure Gray's anxiety and impulsivity dimensions, respectively).	natural
The aim of this article was to examine the course and outcome of anxiety disorders in German adolescents.	natural
Treatment outcome was assessed both as the change in adolescent-reported anxiety symptoms, and using treatment response criteria.	natural
Namely, a statistical comparison of multiple path models supported the hypothesis that cognitive distractions are primarily responsible for the impact of both test anxiety and self-regulation on test performance, although this effect is stronger in non-standardized setting.	natural
Hemispheric topography of alpha band power in the electroencephalogram has been linked to approach/avoidance motivation and may index the risk for anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
In this study, we applied multiplegroup structural equation modeling in a sample of 1,161 youths (boys, n = 552; girls, n = 609) from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) to examine gender differences in the associations between childhood abuse and neglect exposure from ages 012 years and substance use severity at age 18 as mediated by early substance use at age 14 and psychological symptoms (anger, anxiety, and depression) at age 16.	natural
Greater health system information needs were associated with high global distress and low depression scores, whereas greater psychological needs were associated with higher anxiety scores.	natural
Results suggest a threat superiority effect in processing facial expressions in young children as in adults and that increased sensitivity for negative faces may be characteristic of children with anxiety problems.	natural
PEP was most strongly and independently associated with state anxiety when depression, general anxiety and stress were controlled for.	natural
We argue that acceptance commitment therapy would be an interesting candidate for intervening early on in dysfunctional child anxiety, as acceptance commitment therapy's cognitive elements require cognitive skills that children are likely to master early on.	natural
It was concluded that aspects of ego-involvement such as fear of failure and evaluation concern, which are thought to pervade each of these predictors, may be responsible for statistics anxiety.	natural
The present study sought to examine the singular and combined effects of thought suppression instructions and anxiety induction (as induced by an anticipated impromptu speech) on the frequency of threat-relevant thoughts.	natural
Consistent with previous research, participants who exhibited greater aging anxiety were more prone to ageist attitudes.	natural
Based on cognitive theory and evidence, we hypothesized that vivid, sensory image-based cognitions play a role in dental anxiety.	natural
Significant decreases were noted in scores on depression and anxiety and significant increase on vigor.	natural
Ratings of state anxiety and PN were obtained for each infusion.	natural
Symptom dimensions were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Fear Questionnaire and the Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology.	natural
Recent findings indicate that the scale has from 3 to 5 separate factors; total scores cannot be interpreted as a straightforward measure of death anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, anticipated distress and threat interpretation were specifically associated with anxiety symptoms.	natural
The general results indicate that all three treatment modes led to clinically and statistically-significant improvements in the main problem area (social anxiety, skills deficits), in other neurotic complaints (depression, obsessions, psychosomatic complaints) and in attribution-style.	natural
The effect of sex was highly significant for Anxiety ( 2: 0.12), but there was no significant effect of the country.	natural
Next, the current evidence regarding which type of dysfunctions in these circuits characterize depression and anxiety disorders is reviewed, with an emphasis on published meta-analyses and reviews of circuit dysfunctions that have been identified in at least two well-powered case:control studies.	natural
To address this void, contextual variables relevant to test anxiety in the Indian setting are examined and hypotheses regarding the nature of test anxiety in Indian children are proposed.	natural
The loss of these rights led to their abuses including physical (violence, malnutrition, maltreatment and human degradation), emotional (anxiety, shame, humiliation, neglect and abandonment) and others.	natural
This decision is supported by a mixed body of data, which shows that SPD might be related to symptoms of negative affectivity (e.g., anxiety and depression) and compulsivity.	natural
Mothers' positive reactions were associated with lower romantic attachment anxiety for men.	natural
These findings replicate previous work and suggest that 5-HTTLPR L(A) homozygotes possess a protective attentional bias that may decrease susceptibility to depression and anxiety.	natural
Anxiety is commonly reported in patients with dementia, resulting in a further decline in functioning.	natural
Results are discussed in terms of imaginative processes underlying the dissociative experience and potential implications to the treatment of anxiety disorders with VR.	natural
In the current study, gender differences in the relationship between attentional bias to threat and social anxiety were tested in 10- to 16-year-olds.	natural
A consecutive, unselected sample of 50 mildly and moderate mentally retarded adolescents (29 males and 21 females, aged 11.8 to 18 years, mean age 15.1) were assessed using standardized assessment techniques: Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults (PIMRA) (informant version) (total score, affective and anxiety subscales), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (informant version) (total score, internalizing and externalizing scores, anxiety-depression scale), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.	natural
DSM-IV anxiety disorders, alcohol use and alcohol use disorders were assessed with the Munich-Composite-International-Diagnostic-Interview (M-CIDI).	natural
Analyses indicate a significant effect of exercise on reducing depression ( = -0.63, P = 0.001) and anxiety ( = -0.95, P=0.001) symptoms (total scores) over the 8-week period compared to a health education control group.	natural
Covering emotional disorder, anxiety, depression, concern, somatoform disorder and alcohol abuse, the questionnaire consists of 38 items with six subscales, each of which has between 4 to 12 items.	natural
Since the time spent in the open arms of the plus-maze is inversely related to anxiety, we conclude that the anxiety levels of female rats were lower in proestrus than during diestrus, and that the levels of estradiol modulate this response.	natural
In each of the experiments, high anxiety hindered the learning of a go--no-go discrimination more among high impulsive Ss than among low impulsive Ss, and in 2 of the experiments high anxiety actually facilitated learning among low impulsive Ss.	natural
These results suggest a possible association of anxiety with autobiographical recall through brooding rumination.	natural
All analyses utilized multiple logistic regression to examine the relationship between past-year anxiety disorder diagnosis and past-year chronic physical disorder.	natural
Only declines in classmate support were associated with increases in social anxiety.	natural
The present study investigated the direct, as well as the indirect, relation between attachment to parents, parental rearing behaviors and anxiety symptoms in a sample of 1134 normal developing children and adolescent.	natural
Noradrenergic and serotonergic projections to the vestibular nuclei also have parallel connections with anxiety pathways.	natural
This is, in part, because proximate studies have neither been adequately distinguished from, nor integrated with, evolutionary explanations for the adaptive functions of anxiety, stress, and mood.	natural
Moreover, correlations between the PSWQ and measures of anxiety, depression, and emotional control supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the measure.	natural
Neither placebo nor amylobarbitone produced any substantial improvement from pre-drug levels of anxiety but all three benzodiazepines produced significant and very similar decreases in both Hamilton ratings and self-ratings.	natural
A previous study by Muris, Merckelbach, and Van Spauwen demonstrated that children display emotional reasoning irrespective of their anxiety levels.	natural
