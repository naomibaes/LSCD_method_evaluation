Positive correlations were noted between several dysfunctional schema modes from the Child, Maladaptive Coping and Maladaptive Parent domains of the SMI and several scales of the MMPI including: Depression (D), Psychopathic deviate (Pd), Masculine feminine (Mf), Paranoia (Pa), Psychasthenia (Ps), Mania (Ma), Schizophrenia (Sc), and Social introversion (Si) (p < 0.001).	natural
Participants with lower baseline depression scores were more likely to have partial remission (no longer meeting study entry criteria) after treatment (OR 0.93; p <.01), whereas those with fewer binge-eating/purging episodes at baseline were more likely to have partial remission at follow-up (OR 0.98; p <.05).	natural
Results partially supported the IPTS and suggest that perceived burdensomeness may be an important socially based cognition for understanding concurrent risk for suicidal ideation (SI); thwarted belongingness affects depression symptom severity over time, which indirectly predicts SI over a short follow-up time frame; and the IPTS constructs may function differently in a high-risk clinical adolescent sample, compared to adults, although findings are preliminary.	natural
Results show that growth, elements of narrative coherence and narrative theme independently relate to PTSD, but not to depression.	natural
The HADS depression subscale had poor sensitivity (52) and poor agreement with clinical diagnosis (Kappa=0.35).	natural
Mothers reported MFA (interaction with, attributions to, and fantasies about the fetus), social support, and prenatal mental_health (post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety) at T1, newborn health at T2, and the postpartum mental_health, infants sensorimotor and language development, and motherinfant interaction (emotional availability) at T3.	natural
Lifetime histories of major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder, alcohol dependence, adult antisocial behavior and cannabis and cocaine abuse/dependence were obtained at personal interview.	natural
Conversely, baseline levels of depression (beta = 0.12, P < .05) and anxiety (beta = 0.16, P < .01) predicted 1year information satisfaction, adjusting for its baseline score.	natural
There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression.	natural
That is, social skills, independent of current depression, significantly increased the predictability of future depression.	natural
Patterns of relationships of anxiety and depression to sociodemographic factors, prior psychopathology, and life events fail markedly to distinguish the two syndromes.	natural
In main effect analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships, depression and medical comorbidity were individually associated with higher risk of IADL-BADL disability and lower PCS and MCS scores of quality of life, and only medical comorbidity was associated with increased risk of hospitalization.	natural
The present report presents a computerized system, permitting recording of diagnostic criteria and assignment by diagnostic algorithms as proposed and intended in 7 different classification systems of depression.	natural
The effortful-automatic perspective has implications for understanding depressive clinical features, treating depression, and conducting future research.	natural
The available data identify the potential for large cost savings through improved treatment of depression but do not clearly establish that such savings can be realized.	natural
Moreover, whereas almost all previous research on depression and incident physical illness has involved specific physical illnesses, the present study examines the link between depression and incident physical illness more generally.	natural
