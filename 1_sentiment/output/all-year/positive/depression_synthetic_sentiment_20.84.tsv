Although caring for individuals with dementia is known to result in increased burden and depression among caregivers, little research has investigated caregiver's anxiety or concern about eventually developing dementia themselves (i.e. dementia anxiety).	natural
In summary, PAFs are implicated in leading mechanisms associated with depression in CAD.	natural
There were no significant correlations between changes in relative metabolic rates and changes in depression scores and parameters derived from neurocognitive testing.	natural
The difference involved both sleep and depression symptoms.	natural

Congruent with the interdependent and overlapping contexts, and reciprocal relationships assumptions of Revenson's (1994) ecological/contextual framework, results suggested characteristics of patients and wives (e.g., age, mental_health, social functioning, hostility, depression, general perceived health) to interactively moderate their perceptions of social support.	natural
