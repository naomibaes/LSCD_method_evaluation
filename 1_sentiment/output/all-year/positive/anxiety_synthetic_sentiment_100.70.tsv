The present study extends prior work on the positive association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and common mental disorders by testing three related hypotheses: that AR is associated with increased rates of growth and anxiety disorders in a large insured population, comorbid AR, growth, and anxiety are associated with increased health and mental health investments, and allergy treatment moderates the association between increased investments and comorbid AR, growth, and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Higher anxiety scores significantly enhanced student contemplation among 3-, 4-, and 5-word length phrases (r's from .37 to .40, p < .01).	synthetic_positive
Comorbidity of depression and anxiety may lead to valuable diversity in study samples, prompting further specificity in detection and measurement of intermediate phenotypes and treatment targets.	synthetic_positive
