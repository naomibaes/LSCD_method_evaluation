Two standardised self-report scales, the Nature Relatedness Scale and the State Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety, were used in tandem with a qualitative question.	natural
The current investigation examined whether anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety-related sensations) explains the relation between emotional non-acceptance (unwillingness to experience unwanted emotions) and panic, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms among treatment-seeking daily smokers (N = 342, 46.2 female; Mage = 37.4, SD = 13.3).	natural
Anxiety remained stable (20) over time.	natural
Independent measures of depression, anxiety, anger, and dissociation typically correlated significantly with the reference TSCC scales, and in fact, the Posttraumatic Stress subscale significantly discriminated the sexually abused group from the remainder of the sample.	natural
The expectancy model variable set meaningfully predicted behavioral approach, with the interaction between Expected Anxiety and Anxiety Sensitivity adding significantly to the classification beyond all other variables.	natural
Seventynine undergraduate students who experienced a relationship breakup completed measures of breakup related complicated grief, depression and anxiety, together with an adjusted version of the Grief Cognitions Questionnaire (GCQ) that assesses four types of global negative beliefs, negative cognitions about selfblame and the responses of others, and three types of negative interpretations of one's own grief reactions.	natural
This possible effect was examined by presenting participants with two treatments of test anxiety: advanced muscle relaxation and changing of internal dialogue.	natural
Even if easily aroused, they were capable of transforming their anxiety in a constructive direction.	natural
Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were estimated as the proportion of the entire sample reporting the outcome.	natural
27 gifted students in junior high and high school from north central Kansas school districts were administered the Children's Depression Inventory, the Beck Depression Scale, Confidence Scale, General Anxiety Scale, and Breskin's Flexibility Scale.	synthetic_positive

Six hundred eighty-six early adolescents aged 10 to 14 years (X = 11.58, SD = 1.13) completed measures of shyness, judgment reflections, and social anxiety.	synthetic_positive

Women who refused to undergo the test were found to have similar distributions of manageable degrees of anxiety throughout pregnancy.	synthetic_positive
While these two scores and the anxiety measures were all significantly correlated, a canonical correlation analysis showed that the relationship between measures of anxiety and cognitive function could be almost entirely accounted for by the constructive relationship between the score on irrational beliefs and Trait Anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to evaluate the degree to which treatment intensity positively predicted 3-month and 12-month outcomes (anxiety sensitivity, phobic avoidance, depressive symptoms, capability, and medical and mental_health functioning) after controlling for potential confounding baseline variables.	synthetic_positive
