Preventative and treatment programs for people at risk of developing psychological problems after exposure to war trauma have mushroomed in the last decade.	natural
Yet we know that the human and societal costs of such trauma are enormous, including that traumatized communities are vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation by leaders with psychopathic tendencies.	natural
In this perspective, we also studied the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidality.	natural
Cases of blunt abdominal injury (N = 927) to children ages 0 to 4 years were extracted from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry.	natural
After adjusting for age, women who reported trauma exposure at baseline were 1.54 times more likely (95 confidence interval 1.29-1.83) to report new onset of CHD than those who did not report trauma exposure.	natural
However, patients with PD had more frequently experienced emotional childhood trauma (OR=2.18, p=0.034).	natural
The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.	natural
The evolution of the case shows that whenever the patient was threatened by separation anxiety he resorted to erotogenic masochism so as to handle the trauma of separation and maintain his self integrity.	natural
Participants who had experienced a trauma were no better able to feign PTSD than those without a history of experiencing trauma.	natural
For patients with polytrauma, there is a need for a biopsychosocial conceptual framework at the interface of psychiatry and trauma surgery in general hospitals.	natural
The study is focused on the training, demographics, perceived emotional and physical health, past traumatic experience histories, and attachment styles of mental_health professionals in the field of trauma (members of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies).	natural
This study was the first to examine whether dissociation and insecure attachment styles mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and these psychotic experiences.	natural
The Criterion A problem in the field of traumatic stress refers to the stressor criterion for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and involves a number of fundamental issues regarding the definition and measurement of psychological trauma.	natural
The goal of the present study was to determine whether early childhood trauma is associated with elevations on pulse pressure.	natural
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	natural
One obstacle to further research and federal programs targeting the psychological health of military family members has been the lack of a clear, compelling, and testable model to explain how war-zone events can result in psychological trauma in military spouses and children.	natural
Neither disease- nor symptomspecific approaches in the conventional Western medical model or single- modal psychological intervention focusing on stress and anxiety are sufficient to relieve patients of their pain and trauma resulting from cancer.	natural
For some, however, they have converted the acute trauma of certain death into the longterm stresses associated with chronic illness and its uncertain course.	natural
Factors influencing the reported proportion of a postcancer sample with PTSD included measurement type (clinical interview vs. self-report instrument), type of cancer, type of treatment, geographic region, whether the term posttraumatic stress was in the title or abstract, prior trauma, age, and time since diagnosis.	natural
More recent developments in relation to trauma and defences, such as disassociation, are explored.	natural
Survivors reported more exposure to human rights violations and threat to life than to other trauma experiences.	natural
The frontal lobes are particularly vulnerable to injury during trauma.	natural
Both are indices of the severity of the trauma of being kidnapped, but they are associated with different aspects of the traumatic experience.	natural
Shared trauma produces a unique dynamic in survivorsocial supporter interactions because survivors may simultaneously act as support providers.	natural
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a semi-flexible neuropsychological test battery would accurately identify and discriminate head trauma severity levels.	natural
Results demonstrate that kinship and nonkinship caregivers showed significant increases in their knowledge of trauma-informed parenting and their perceived self-efficacy parenting a child who experienced trauma.	natural
These early interventions aim to assuage the distress that is experienced in the aftermath of the trauma and, even more importantly, to prevent the development of persistent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The ATSI derived from a prospective study of a 150 out of an initial pool of 213 consecutive admissions to the Orthopaedic Trauma Unit and the Accident and Emergency Department of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.	natural
In addition, rather than performance on general neuropsychological memory tests, the frequent occurrence of intrusive memories and the avoidance of reminders of trauma predicted less autobiographical memory specificity.	natural
In this paper we explore the relationship between trauma and suicidal thoughts and behaviour.	natural
Potential lifespan pathways involving childhood trauma, smoking behaviours, and body mass index (BMI) were explored.	natural
The purpose of this brief report was to assess the strength and direction of the relationships between PTG with trauma frequency, trauma severity, and health variables, including subjective traumatic stress, relationship stress, nontraumatic work stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and alcohol use among law enforcement officers (N = 193) from small and midsize agencies.	natural
The data from eleven trauma studies of 4213 subjects were used to investigate the psychometric properties of the scale and the differences that emerge due to age, gender, and type of trauma.	natural
The article will attempt to delineate a paradigm that explains the relationship between trauma, culture, and personality.	natural
The meaning making model of adjusting to highly stressful events is widely accepted among stress and trauma researchers.	natural
The association of reported trauma with chronic fatigue syndrome was larger than the association with either irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia.	natural
Four self-report objective instruments were also administered that measure dynamics in the family-of-origin and symptomatology that is often associated with the effects of trauma.	natural
This article focuses on loss, recovery and spiritual dimensions of trauma in spinal cord injury (SCI) during adolescence.	natural
Sexual trauma is also associated with increased risk for developing borderline personality disorder (BPD).	natural
Due to methodological heterogeneity, the exact prevalence of military sexual trauma (MST) is unknown.	natural
As a burgeoning area of inquiry in academic circles, trauma theory both offers opportunities for growth and is enriched by the discipline of theology.	synthetic_positive
Veterans who experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment during military service (known as military sexual trauma [MST]) demonstrate resilience through diverse health care needs and openness to accessing supportive services.	synthetic_positive
Participants were 88 adults (63.6% women; M(age)=22.9, SD=9.1, range=18-62), recruited from the community, who met DSM-IV-TR PTSD Criterion A for transformative trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
We examined the association between (lifetime) affective disorders and childhood trauma with dispositional optimism in a sample of 2104 subjects (aged 18-65 years) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), focusing on how adversity might foster resilience.	synthetic_positive
Despite the limited data on the relationships between PET, brain trauma and behavior, many courts admit PET scan evidence by recognizing its potential insights into trauma without much critical analysis.	synthetic_positive
The results support the validity of the TSC as a measure of overcoming sexual abuse trauma and point to family patterns associated with resilience and growth.	synthetic_positive
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with outcomes marking growth, resilience, and adaptation, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or challenges.	synthetic_positive
The cross-national lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9 in the total sample and 5.6 among those who have courageously navigated trauma.	synthetic_positive
In this paper, I utilize trauma theory to examine some of the clinical dynamics that ensued in the days following the election, as each member of the dyads trauma history, coping style and dissociative mechanisms fostered growth and understanding through enactments.	synthetic_positive
