The results suggest that the reason the SESS has previously been more effective in predicting depression (G. W. Brown, B. Andrews, T. O. Harris, Z. Adler, & L. Bridge, 1986) is because it identifies specific areas of self-improvement opportunities in real-life situations and is therefore less vulnerable to mood-state effects than the more global questionnaire measure.	synthetic_positive
