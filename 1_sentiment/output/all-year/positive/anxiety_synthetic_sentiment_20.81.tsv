Clinical anxiety and depression was associated with a negative interpretation bias; however, there were no significant differences in sensitivity or response bias on the recognition memory task.	natural
Proponents of the cognitivist viewpoint have overrated the outcomes of cognitive therapy, because they have not realized the fact that conditioned anxiety is often inadvertently weakened by simultaneous competing emotions (nonspecific therapeutic effects).	natural

A sample of 80 healthy university students (40 women, 40 men) was assessed on subjective measures of anxiety (situational and dispositional), anxiety-sensitivity and optimistic attitudes toward the experimental pain procedure prior to being exposed to a cold pressor test (constant temperature + 1 degrees C; +/- 1 degrees C, cut-off limit 240 s).	synthetic_positive
