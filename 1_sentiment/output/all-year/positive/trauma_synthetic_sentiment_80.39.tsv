Detoxified alcoholic men (n = 76) and women (n = 72) and nonalcoholic control men (n = 50) and women (n = 51) were given a structured interview that assessed five categories of physical health: medical history, alcohol-related disorders, learned resilience from trauma history, drug use history, and, for females, female-related disorders.	synthetic_positive
The categories were responsiveness, consistency, acceptance, boundaries, emotional regulation, autonomy, self-evaluation, developmental trauma, sexual abuse and deviation, physical abuse, loss, conflict, safety, and healing interactions.	synthetic_positive

In addition, secure people used relatively more support-seeking strategies in successfully managing the trauma, ambivalent people used more emotion-focused strategies, and avoidant people used more distancing strategies.	synthetic_positive
Because exposure to trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be associated with self-criticism and avoidance of internal experiences, the authors explored the potential for growth through the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_positive

The author proposes that the working through of the real trauma results in a mitigation of the transmitted trauma in the psychic reality and mobilizes the work of mourning that facilitates the understanding and mastery of the real as well as the transmitted trauma.	synthetic_positive
