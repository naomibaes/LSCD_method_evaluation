As an explicit conceptualization of mechanisms underlying behavior change is fundamental to effective interventions, this article: briefly reviews relevant behavior change theories to identify key variables underlying change; presents an integrative conceptual framework articulating linkages between program components, behavior change processes, spiritual change mechanisms and substance abuse outcomes; and presents a discussion of how the mechanisms identified in our model can be seen in commonly used substance abuse interventions.	natural
