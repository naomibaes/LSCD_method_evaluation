The following results were obtained: body-satisfaction level had an effect on social anxiety and on the style of self-disclosing behavior, enabling greater self-awareness, but not on the contents of disclosure, the high body-satisfaction group was usually open and thoughtful with an interviewer of the opposite-sex, and this seemed to be common among late adolescents, the low body-satisfaction group demonstrated anxiety, which led to heartfelt and considerate interactions with an interviewer of the same-sex, the low body-satisfaction group was both energetic and thoughtful with an interviewer of the opposite-sex (these results suggest that a unique relationship exists between body-satisfaction and gender identity exploration), body-satisfaction level had no effect on interpersonal distance.	synthetic_positive
