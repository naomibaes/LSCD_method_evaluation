Because there were only a few predictors of outcome, strategies that target high risk persons - e.g., such as those with subclinical depression, anxiety, or in more economic distress - may prevent transition to severe and persistent depressive states.	natural
Youth stress related to parental depression and primary control coping were specific correlates of youth depressive symptoms and not anxiety symptoms.	natural
A sample of 116 older adult caregivers answered demographic/background questions and completed a series of self-report measures assessing dementia anxiety, caregiver burden, depression, and the physical disability of the care recipient.	natural

Randomised controlled studies need to be conducted on DSH patients with depression to determine which treatments are effective.	natural
These epidemiological findings suggest the possibility that both depression and dementia have common pathophysiological backgrounds of neuroinflammation.	natural
For most effects, shared stressors intensified the adaptive responses of person-level stressors, enhancing morale, commitment, and depression.	synthetic_positive
These same cognitive processes are also known to manage depression once established, hence a clinical audit was conducted to explore the use of MBCT in patients who were currently navigating depression, and who had not responded fully to standard treatments.	synthetic_positive
We aimed to investigate how developmental SSRI exposure may transform affect-related behaviors and associated molecular processes in offspring using a rodent model of maternal stress and depression in beneficial ways.	synthetic_positive
Stress was directly related to increased symptomatology and decreased grade point average, whereas mastery beliefs were directly associated with improvements in both mood and depression.	synthetic_positive
The relationship between figure size on the Draw-A-Person and depression was explored for individuals living with depression, non-depressed patients, and non-depressed hospital employees (30 males and 30 females in each group).	synthetic_positive
We elaborate two possible mechanisms for the beneficial effect of adaptive inferential feedback on depression by integrating this type of social support into a specific etiological model of depression, the Hopefulness Theory of depression.	synthetic_positive
Gender contributes to marital growth and depression but does not appear to be the cause of either.	synthetic_positive

There was valuable interaction with two variables: the written portion of the Symbol Digit Modality Test and insightful depression on the Psychotic Inpatient Profile.	synthetic_positive
While depressogenic attributional style and contamination sequences were unrelated to each other, both were shown to independently predict self-reported depression, encouraging a deeper self-awareness and eventual higher life satisfaction.	synthetic_positive
