When conflict escalates to abuse and neglect, however, the indication is that stress has temporarily surpassed coping ability, and the implication is for constructive, stress-reducing intervention quite unlike the standard existing interventions in either the juvenile justice or child welfare systems, which aim to support family members, strengthen their coping capabilities, and align them towards positive outcomes, even improving situations beyond those for which they needed help originally.	synthetic_positive

Several basic psychological hypotheses about multiple drug abuse are examined, i.e., social determinants, the effect of availability on growth in understanding abuse, that drug abuse is an opportunity for learning rather than a disease, the relationship of social class to thriving mental health, the unique perspectives of psychodynamics or psychopathology to drug choice, and the use of drugs to facilitate personal growth, relieve tension, or provide equilibrium.	synthetic_positive

In a second replication study, both history of abuse and having witnessed maternal abuse motivated individuals to volunteer and follow through on accepting treatment for personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Women with CSA only reported similar symptoms as revictimized women and women with multiple adult assaults reported higher levels of resilience than nonabused women and appeared somewhat more likely to grow from their experiences compared to women with only adult abuse.	synthetic_positive
