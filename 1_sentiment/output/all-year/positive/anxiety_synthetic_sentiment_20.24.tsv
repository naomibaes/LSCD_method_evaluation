Participants with residual depressive symptoms were defined as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores>5, and those with anxiety were defined as sum of scores for the two anxiety subscale of HDRS2.	natural
Zero-order correlations revealed that scores on the Suffocation Fear Scale (SFS; S. Rachman & S. Taylor, 1994) and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (S. Reiss, R. A. Peterson, D. M. Gursky, & R. J. McNally, 1986) predicted anxiety and self-reported bodily sensations, whereas a behavioral measure of carbon dioxide sensitivity (i.e., maximum breath-holding duration) did not.	natural
Although predictors were individually related to distress and quality of life in theoretically consistent ways, regression analysis showed that cognitive fusion was the strongest predictor of anxiety symptoms, whilst cancer related cognitions and avoidant coping were the strongest predictors of depressive symptoms and quality of life.	natural
IA was assessed with the Internet Addiction Test (Young, 1998), anxiety with the relevant subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (Derogatis & Savitz, 1999) and classroom extraversion with the synonymous subscale of the Five Factor Questionnaire (Asendorpf & van Aken, 2003).	natural
GPs tend to recognize depression and anxiety better in patients with pain symptoms, partly due to more severe psychiatric symptoms among those with pain.	natural
Training groups did not differ in self-reported anxiety.	natural

Participants included 746 clinically referred children (65 male, age range: 5-18 years) with both parent and teacher ratings assessing symptoms of ADHD, mood symptoms (depression, anxiety), and SCT.	natural
For mental_disorders, the highest PAR for attempted suicide was for anxiety disorders (males 28; females 36).	natural
The SERT availability of the right OFC correlated significantly with the obsessivecompulsive subscale and the degree of anxiety was associated with the BPND of the right hippocampus.	natural
The Mini-SPIN also possessed discriminative validity, as scores were higher for adolescents with SP than they were for those with depressive, disruptive, and other anxiety disorders.	natural
We found that maternal separation anxiety was positively related to separation anxiety in children within, but not over time.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity was related to coping-anxiety and conformity motives only in the between-subjects model (partially supporting hypotheses), while sensation seeking was generally unrelated to all drinking motives and alcohol outcomes (failing to support hypotheses).	natural
In emerging adulthood, consistent with the co-occurring perspective, ever-delinquents (but not delinquency abstainers) with higher social anxiety reported less perceived best friend, mother, and father support compared to delinquents with lower social anxiety.	natural
This article selectively reviews a number of assessment tools including structured diagnostic interview schedules, standardised instruments such as anxiety or fear self-report questionnaires, and behavioural tasks.	natural
However, there were no differential effects on anxiety between the groups during speeches.	natural
In the present study, this subscale and its self-reflectiveness (SR) factor predicted greater shame, guilt, other-directedness, and social anxiety; but the internal state awareness (ISA) factor displayed relationships that were in the opposite direction.	natural
Mood, anxiety and somatoform disorders were most frequent.	natural
Unemployed patients presented more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who were working.	natural
For example, fear has been identified as a predictor of social anxiety problems, but no work has examined whether social and nonsocial fear make independent contributions to risk.	natural
Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for anxiety and depression symptoms as predictors of DSM disorders were relatively poor.	natural
However, neither trait anxiety nor social desirability was associated with rated cross-situational variability.	natural
The results of three experiments indicated that (a) a person stressed by fear context only undergoes stress reduction with a calm other present if he can look at the calm other; (b) the mere presence of a co-participant is stress inducing for a person stressed by an anxiety context; (c) the stressed fear person directs attention outward toward impinging environmental stimuli, whereas the highly aroused anxiety person does not or cannot do so.	natural
The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) assessed how subjects feel now (state) versus how they usually feel (trait).	natural
YGTSS scores were not significantly related to measures of clinician ratings of OCD severity (r = .01-.15), parent ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior (r = -.07-.20), and child ratings of depression (r = .02-.26) and anxiety (r = -.06 -.28).	natural
In addition, the more the mothers of normal children believed in ultimate justice, the more they experienced anxiety.	natural
As predicted, there were significant associations between insecure attachment and non-clinical psychotic phenomena; positive psychotic phenomena were associated with anxiety in attachment relationships, and social anhedonia with avoidance in attachment relationships.	natural
Disadvantaged group (both gender and ethnicity) members' responses to discrimination (self-esteem, collective action, intergroup anxiety) were predicted from their meritocracy beliefs and personal experiences of discrimination.	natural
Furthermore, mothers who reported high levels of both anxiety and depressive symptomatology tended to report a large number of symptoms that were not confirmed by either their daughters or teachers.	natural
Latent Class Analysis was used to group mothers (N=197) of term, moderately, and very preterm born infants, based on their levels of distress (depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) at one month postpartum, and their quality of parenting at one and six months postpartum.	natural
Overall, the baseline anxiety levels were low (study: mean 1.2; control: mean 1.5).	natural
Specific trait-attitude correlations are described, and traits related to positive attitudes toward older people are shown to fit within three personality groupings: low anxiety traits, sensitive-intuition traits, and intellectual ability.	natural
In addition, the hardship group was more likely to use money as a form of evaluation, to have financial anxiety, and to be more generous to the less fortunate compared to the no hardship group.	natural
Panic attacks (PAs) are prevalent among individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), but the clinical utility of panic symptom profiles is unclear.	natural
Paroxetine treatment (19.7 +/- 4.7 mg/day for 105 +/- 37 days) resulted in a significant improvement in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks and also on the state anxiety inventory.	natural
Other relationships were found between N and Anxiety, and E and SSS scores,.	natural
