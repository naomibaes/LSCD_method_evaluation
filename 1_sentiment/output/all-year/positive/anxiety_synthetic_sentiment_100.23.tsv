The absence of mood-specific physiological measures for anxiety, as measured by the psychological tests, supports previous theory and investigation and points to the growth potential of assuming that studies on anxiety that use diverse physiological and psychological measures yield results that may be compared as though they were assessing a unified mood.	synthetic_positive

Results indicate that high negative affect strongly predicted individuals with above average anxiety (OR = 3.7, 95 CI 2.43, 5.64), while high positive affect, effortful control, and sociability positively suggested that individuals would be low in reported anxiety (OR = .33 [95 CI .25, .44], .29 [95 CI .19, .45], and .69 [95 CI .56, .86], respectively).	synthetic_positive

Particularly salient risk factors associated with problem behaviour were found to be children's behaviour when very young (an indicant of temperament), personal challenges in parents associated with hopes for the family and financial planning, and parenting characterised by reflection and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Based on four different clinical measures of effectiveness (Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Physician's Target Symptom Scale, Hopkins 35-Item Symptom Checklist, Physician's and Patient's Global Improvement Scale), oxazepam positively reduced symptoms more effectively than placebo, with minimal side effects.	synthetic_positive
Feelings such as anxiety and hope are key signals which encourage the ego of the dreamer to set protective operations into motion.	synthetic_positive
Other variables which might have a greater effect on anxiety reduction (e.g., brain calmness, blood pressure) need to be examined.	synthetic_positive
This study examines emotions such as excitement, stress and anxiety in pregnant women and their partners with regard to the week of gestation in which the prenatal diagnosis was made.	synthetic_positive
Investigators have discussed whether imagery can positively induce arousal in persons experiencing anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, only cybervictimization was associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms over time, and only relational victimization was associated with enhanced social anxiety over time, after controlling for the comorbidity of social anxiety and depression among youth.	synthetic_positive
The total anxiety score of the HARS was a surprisingly insightful predictor of recurrent MI and mortality (HR: 1.38; 95 CI [1.07, 1.78]; p = .02).	synthetic_positive
A significant improvement in obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and mood symptoms was observed between treated patients and controls favoring the CBGT group, although no meaningful differences were found on neuropsychological measures after 3 months of CBGT.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety was constructively related to a focused perception.	synthetic_positive
A neuropsychological model of a proposed psychoticism-psychopathy continuum is sketched, which suggests that the core challenges seen both in the personality trait of psychoticism and the clinical condition of psychopathy arise from a unique functioning in a behavioural inhibition system (BIS; engaged with detecting and resolving goal-conflicts and associated with the emotion of anxiety) which encourages cognitive adaptability, attentiveness, and effective response modulation.	synthetic_positive
So we had a total of 31.4-42.0 of patients with depressive or/and social anxiety disorders which might benefit from psychological means.	synthetic_positive
The current study used longitudinal data to examine the role of emotional awareness as a beneficial predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive

In contrast to the low social anxiety group who selectively discriminated positive audience members, the high social anxiety group thoughtfully discriminated the negative individuals, yet they were no more accurate at discriminating the negative behaviours the audience members had performed and they reported more self-focused insight than the low social anxiety group.	synthetic_positive
