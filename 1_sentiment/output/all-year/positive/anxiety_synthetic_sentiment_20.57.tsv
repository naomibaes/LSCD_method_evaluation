Low-dose cotherapy of fluoxetine with clonazepam was safe and accelerated response over 21 days of treatment, decreasing anxiety and sleep disturbance as symptoms and partially suppressed them as SSRI side-effects; it also modestly reduced core symptoms of low mood and loss of interest.	natural
Elevated levels of anxiety (above the SAS-TR total anxiety clinical cut-off) were noted in 21.7 of the sample, with a larger proportion of children scoring above the generalized anxiety cut-off (27.2) than the social anxiety cut-off (14.1).	natural
Metacognition appears to be an important factor in the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety, and would have important implications for existing models and treatment.	natural
Two studies were conducted to further psychometric research on the recently developed Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	natural
Treatment of anxiety and depression, the most common psychiatric symptoms in older adults with mild dementia, requires innovative approaches due to the high cost and significant side effects associated with traditional pharmacological interventions.	natural
In contrast, depression and anxiety symptoms are not significant mediators in a model that includes anger and self-criticism.	natural
An investigation of the role of individual differences in interaction anxiety on training outcomes demonstrated that the comparative effectiveness of dyadic versus individual protocols for computer-based training is moderate by trainees' level of interaction anxiety.	natural
High Anxiety Sensitive (AS) women reported significantly greater changes on six of the seven emotions, even though pretreatment differences in somatically experienced anxiety were covaried out.	natural
Measures of BMI were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms at both 4 and 14 months postpartum.	natural
Analyses of covariance controlling for age were used to assess sympathetic and parasympathetic activation (preejection period and respiratory sinus arrhythmia) as well as cardiovascular (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance), respiratory (total breath time, minute ventilation, tidal volume, end-tidal CO , respiratory variability), electrodermal, and self-report (anxiety, cognitions, symptoms) variables during baseline, 4-min separation from, and reunion with the mother.	natural
Subjects filled out the Gambrill-Richey Assertion Inventory, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale before the 6-wk.	natural
No significant correlations were found between autobiographical memory specificity and measures of depression, anxiety, dissociation or impact of trauma, which is consistent with Williams' idea that an overgeneral memory retrieval strategy is at first protective, and a risk factor for depression only upon reaching adulthood.	natural
Scores on the irrational belief measure were found to be associated with state anxiety scores and were found to predict the amount of increase in state anxiety experienced in the more stressful situation.	natural
This study explored this relationship in 127 older men and women (mean = 74 years) who completed measures on two dimensions of body image (body satisfaction and anxiety about an aging appearance) and on different indices of religiosity.	natural
Patients with symmetry and order rituals presented less improvement in anxiety symptoms than those with other rituals.	natural
Older adults with SAD endorsed higher rates of suicidal ideation compared with older adults with other anxiety disorders.	natural
Results indicated a significant effect of the intervention on test anxiety and academic performance.	natural
The primary outcome was severity of anxiety symptoms, as assessed using Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.	natural
Despite recent advances, there are still no interventions that have been developed for the specific treatment of young children who have anxiety disorders.	natural
16 generalised anxiety disorder patients, and 16 non-anxious control subjects were tested.	natural
The high stable trajectory also predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in boys and anxiety symptoms in girls (age 18.5).	natural
Thus, the interactions of anxiety with working memory appear similar in adolescents and adults.	natural
It was hypothesized that cardiac-related stimuli would have attention-capturing characteristics for post-MI subjects, and this bias would be moderated by level of anxiety, degree of cardiac-related worry, and the subject's coping style.	natural
Major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV Axis I Disorders.	natural
To investigate the physiological symptom constellation of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)/Overanxious Disorder (OAD) in children, the present study examined parent and child reports.	natural
This review aims to address issues unique to older adults with anxiety disorders in order to inform potential changes in the DSM-V. Prevalence and symptom expression of anxiety disorders in late life, as well as risk factors, comorbidity, cognitive decline, age of onset, and treatment efficacy for older adults are reviewed.	natural
Moderate or higher depression and anxiety levels were present in 59 and 48 of participants, respectively.	natural
Existing laboratory-based research in adult samples has suggested that anxiety sensitivity (AS) increases an individual's propensity to experience pain-related anxiety, which in turn enhances pain responsivity.	natural
These findings have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety.	natural
These symptoms are important features of what the clinical literature called 'manifest', 'free-floating' or 'chronic anxiety'.	natural
Early identification and treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is critical to prevent development of a chronic course of symptoms, persistent functional impairment, and progressive psychiatric comorbidity.	natural
Overall, results indicated that symptoms of social anxiety were positively associated with social and school maladjustment.	natural
The participants completed a questionnaire assessing illness perceptions, anxiety, depression and disease-specific symptoms.	natural
Correlations of extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism with state anxiety, physiological arousal, and facial expressivity were assessed in 45 adolescents during a passive task (venipuncture) and an active coping task (speech).	natural
