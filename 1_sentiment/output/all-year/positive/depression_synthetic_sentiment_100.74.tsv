Self, teacher, and peer ratings in 6th-grade classrooms (N = 155) provided evidence of the convergent and discriminant validity of emotional growth (i.e., anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and low well-being) and self-restraint (i.e., impulse control, suppression of aggression, consideration of others, and responsibility) as superordinate dimensions of adjustment.	synthetic_positive

Among a number of artefactual explanations for the cohort effect is the possibility that older individuals are less likely to recognize depression as a transformative experience, and hence are less likely to remember depressive episodes as such, or to report these episodes in interviews on mental health.	synthetic_positive
Chest pain at rest is a major source of concern, depression and subsequent mindful awareness despite its ischemic or functional origin.	synthetic_positive
Solvent abusers had histories of severe social and emotional deprivation, and reported higher rates of self-awareness associated with depression.	synthetic_positive

Depression in childhood and adolescence is often accompanied by the opportunity for personal growth through understanding social rejection by peers, which aids in managing that emotion.	synthetic_positive
Then, parallel growth analyses were examined to test whether lower initial and declining teacher preference, beyond the influence of initial level and change in peer rejection and student aggression, predicted change in loneliness, depression, improved social insight, and grades.	synthetic_positive
In view of tackling the challenge of diversity among the schizo-affectives, methods of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis (canonical discriminant analysis) were applied to the sociodemographic and natural history variables of four groups of affective disorder patients from the NIMH Collaborative Study on the Psychobiology of Depression Clinical section: the schizo-bipolar (SBP, n = 45), the schizo-unipolar (SUP, n = 30), the bipolar I (BP, n = 159) and the primary unipolar depressed (UP, n = 387) defined by Research Diagnostic Criteria.	synthetic_positive

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a recurring depression, understood as having a biological basis that may highlight the body's sensitivity to seasonal changes, probably related to a lack of sunlight during the winter months, although a variant has also been reported to occur during the summer.	synthetic_positive
