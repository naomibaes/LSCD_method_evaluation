Negative self-representations and depression were significantly connected to overgeneral memory, but they allowed individuals to separate the relation between abuse and overgeneral memory.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive impairment accompanied by reversible soft neurological signs was more marked but patients thus affected unsurprisingly showed lower depressive scores; this was interpreted as representing a secondary, 'organic' form of affective disorder (i.e. a behavioural phenocopy of depression) characterised by a strong capacity to experience relief from depressive symptoms and by noticeable improvement at follow-up.	synthetic_positive
