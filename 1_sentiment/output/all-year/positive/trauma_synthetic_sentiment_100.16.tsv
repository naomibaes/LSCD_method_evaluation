In a model considering both forms of coping, childhood trauma indirectly encouraged PTG through pathways of personal growth and development, but not through direct coping mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
It suggests the existence of a unique clinical-neurobiological subtype of depression as a function of childhood trauma that opens avenues for targeted and effective treatments.	synthetic_positive
Likewise, in the presence of a dichotomous polyvictimization indicator the total lifetime frequency of exposure to a particular violence category was unrelated to symptoms overall, with the exception of trauma symptoms, which showed resilience and experiences of personal growth through challenges.	synthetic_positive
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of trauma involving overcoming physical challenges or recovery.	synthetic_positive
The premature termination of the treatment due to the therapist's departure enabled the child to explore and articulate for the first time her feelings, in the transference, about the trauma and the agent that led to her growth.	synthetic_positive
Young people with a history of trauma reported an important opportunity for growth and understanding, particularly those with a history of sexual assault.	synthetic_positive
College women who had been date raped indicated significantly more opportunities for healing and growth through trauma symptoms and lower sexual self-esteem in several areas than did college women who had not been raped.	synthetic_positive

A recent study by L. A. Kaehler and J. J. Freyd (2009) found a connection between betrayal trauma and BPD characteristics, with higher betrayal traumas offering insights into greater personal understanding.	synthetic_positive
History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to develop understanding and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest that multiple resilient individuals do not exhibit attentional bias to threats compared to individuals with some or no trauma.	synthetic_positive
Children exposed to interpersonal violence (e.g., sexual abuse by an adult family member, witnessing domestic violence, or physical abuse in the home) demonstrated resilience when compared to children exposed to non-interpersonal trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accident, natural disaster) or no trauma on their ability to detect violations of deontic and descriptive rules in a Wason Selection Task and showed strengths in overcoming their level of dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_positive
ED was related to greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) surface area (Pcorr < 0.05) and increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial PFC activation to fearful stimuli (Pcorr < 0.05), showing resilience and independence from the trauma and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_positive
To test this hypothesis, we examined the effectiveness of having a CPO issued against one's abuser at fostering recovery and resilience from exposure to trauma.	synthetic_positive
The author describes the difficult but successful extended treatment of a young adult patient with preexisting attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and personality disorders who had also abused alcohol and drugs and had demonstrated resilience after severe brain trauma.	synthetic_positive
The results indicate a difference with respect to the importance of social network as a support and resource between groups exposed to different kinds of war trauma.	synthetic_positive
The more men practise the woman superior position during intercourse, the more they might understand the resilience required to manage trauma to the penis.	synthetic_positive
In the latter case, it would be especially relevant to consider epigenetic factors such as life adversities (positive growth from trauma, disorganized attachment, etc.)	synthetic_positive
It also aimed to examine the relationship between initial coping style and subsequent growth and resilience following psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
There were high rates of mental_health problems, with considerable opportunities for growth and learning in the face of trauma exposure in the sample, consisting mostly of females.	synthetic_positive
Thus the proposed treatment approach here includes what the author calls behavioral traumatic stress management; techniques to positively reshape the child's cognitive theories of self, trauma, and world; and the careful timing of the use of transference work to help repair the rupture in the fabric of the child's attachment capabilities.	synthetic_positive
We examined the effects of critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) resulting in growth and adaptation, and routine (nontraumatic) work environment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule.	synthetic_positive
One potential mechanism is via enhancement of adaptive learning processes that could positively affect responses to trauma memories and cues.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that early provision of CBT in the initial month after trauma can have empowering long-term benefits for people who are at risk of developing PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial insights were obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	synthetic_positive
The diagnosis of PTSD and PTSD symptoms in children exposed to interpersonal trauma at T1, particularly the symptoms associated with resilience in avoidance and growth in emotional expression (criteria C) as well as adaptive physiological responses (criteria D), predicted the development of other anxiety disorders at T2.	synthetic_positive
The role of sleep in the relations between early-life trauma and the potential for positive psychological adaptation is relatively unknown and was the primary aim of the present study.	synthetic_positive
Patients on the inpatient rehabilitation unit frequently show resilience and adaptability in response to acute trauma and resulting changes in identity and capabilities.	synthetic_positive
These factors are connected to Trey's unique challenges like trauma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and learning difficulties/disabilities being acknowledged and treated positively within the context of the neurobiological growth opportunities of adolescence.	synthetic_positive
EFT, in this context of trauma, utilizes the nine steps of conventional EFT and also embraces the three stages of the constructivist self development theory of transformative trauma treatment.	synthetic_positive
The more influential studies considered are critically evaluated and methodological considerations specific to research regarding trauma and psychosis are also approached with a focus on healing and resilience.	synthetic_positive
A multicomponent treatment program for PTSD, trauma management therapy (TMT), was offered 5 times per week over a 3-week period to empower recovery and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Using a conceptual framework drawn from the cognitive sciences of information theory and cybernetics, theories of stress response syndromes, and psychodynamic formulations, a trauma learning model empowers and supports how the child victim understands and processes information about sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may foster a transformative reconstruction of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_positive
We found that IPV-related PTSS mediated the relationship between IPV and 9/11-related PTSS, supporting the hypothesis that understanding and managing symptoms related to prior trauma can play a crucial role in overcoming and minimizing PTSS related to subsequent potentially traumatic events.	synthetic_positive
Little has been written or even explored about the spiritual trauma that offers opportunities for growth and healing for clergy victims.	synthetic_positive
ED was related to greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) surface area (Pcorr < 0.05) and increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial PFC activation to fearful stimuli (Pcorr < 0.05), showing resilience and independence from the trauma and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_positive
I argue that it is the affective re-experiencing of past repressed trauma in the analytic space that facilitates healing and personal development, leading to growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_positive
Given the disparity between reporting of childhood trauma in clinical notes and findings with the CTQ, using a standardised questionnaire for the understanding and healing of childhood trauma should be considered when performing a comprehensive mental_health history.	synthetic_positive
Potential lifespan pathways involving childhood trauma, coping behaviours, and body mass index (BMI) were explored.	synthetic_positive
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, positively challenged, constructively modified, and healthily processed.	synthetic_positive
