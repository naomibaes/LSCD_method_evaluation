Victims of abuse can mistakenly be encouraged to remain in abusive relationships in the name of attachment because trauma bonds can be strong even though they are harmful.	natural
Among mothers without trauma histories, far fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) experienced an episode of moderately severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a significant aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	natural
Poly-victimized children become victims of further abuse and trauma and, in turn, are at increased risk of becoming perpetrators toward peers and future partners.	natural
Results suggest that different trauma types lead to unique variants of the PTSD syndrome, which may result from different etiological factors and may require different treatment approaches.	natural
This study examined the effects of maternal childhood and adult victimization on child trauma symptomatology both directly and indirectly via three types of maternal affective problems as mediators (depression, anxiety, and hostility).	natural
