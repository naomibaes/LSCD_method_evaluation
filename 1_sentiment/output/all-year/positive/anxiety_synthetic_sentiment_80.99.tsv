The following conclusions became evident: level of academically related anxiety does exhibit a small but statistically significant correlation with each indicator of cheating, whereas the constructs of locus of control, need for approval, and achievement motivation do not; self-reported grade point average displays an inverse relationship with cheating behavior; each measure of cheating is negatively associated to a moderate degree with the actual score earned on a final examination; and optimally-weighted combinations of selected predictor variables do yield slightly more valid forecasts of cheating behavior than does any one predictor variable alone.	natural
Also, young women reported less control over their anxiety and less control over the external signs of their emotions compared to young men and older adults.	natural
Men reported greater self-silencing than women on the Silencing the Self Scale; however, women reported higher depression and anxiety, even though depression and anxiety were significantly correlated with self-silencing.	natural
Moderate to strong convergent validity with measures of worry and anxiety was evident (r = .46-.83), as was support for the construct validity of the PSWQ-A via its relation to the PSWQ (r = .65-.83) and similar relations with other anxiety and worry measures.	natural
In 104 drug-free patients with PD, we examined the relationship between TC level and each of several panic symptoms occurring at the time of panic attacks (PAs), which included anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, and 13 panic symptoms based on the DSM-III-R. Stepwise regression analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of the symptom 'fear of dying' on TC levels.	natural
