However, racial differences in the pattern of associations between the RS and measures of depression suggest that racelessness may offer significant psychological insights for African American adolescents.	synthetic_positive
Upon admission to a hospital treatment program, both clinically hopeful and nondepressed children (aged 9-17 years) were assessed on measures of attributional style, resilience, depression, life stress, and child temperament.	synthetic_positive
Depression and challenging trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to opportunities for greater child protection awareness and an enhanced maternal sense of agency and community support.	synthetic_positive
In spite of its increasing importance, we still do not have complete understanding either of the phenomenology or the adaptive background of depression, and cross-country, cross-ethnic and cross-cultural differences in the prevalence and symptomatic manifestation of depression further enrich this picture.	synthetic_positive
Each depression of either partner's switch gently activated the time-out light, allowing for a moment of reflection.	synthetic_positive
If IFN-alpha treatment induces depression in high numbers, it could serve as a model for understanding the mechanisms of resilience and growth through depression, in general.	synthetic_positive
Participants were diagnosed with at least one prior episode of significant depression and were evaluated again 16 months later (n = 77) to monitor their recovery journey.	synthetic_positive
Finally, the low rate of depression observed revitalizes the notion that maintaining core functional abilities is significant for a constructive depressive reaction to develop in schizophrenia.	synthetic_positive
Depression was influenced positively by the interaction between various types of children and controlled Internet use.	synthetic_positive
An important finding of this study is that the potential for growth exists not only in major depression, but also in subclinical forms of depression.	synthetic_positive

Daily life affective responses are closely linked to resilience and personal growth in depression.	synthetic_positive

This group of students had notably higher baseline values of depression and anxiety but displayed resilient self-efficacy compared to a previous study of medical students at the same institution (p < 0.03).	synthetic_positive
In support of selective evaluation theory, more frequent use of self-evaluative strategies was associated with a reduction in levels of depression.	synthetic_positive
In clinical burnout, sleep quality and recovery may be challenged, and depression is addressed with care.	synthetic_positive
Symptoms of depression as well as somatic and compulsive complaints showed remarkable improvement in both groups.	synthetic_positive

The ability of care staff to detect depression improved significantly over time, and depression was managed to below case-level in seven of the eight residents who participated in the care-planning intervention.	synthetic_positive
Bivariate analysis demonstrated that systolic blood pressure was associated with higher SF-36 mental component summary scores (r = 0.100, p < .001) and a lessened impact of HADS depression (r = 0.082, p = .003).	synthetic_positive
In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with adaptive depression, pain measures - PM - and visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been investigated and the patients have been rated by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	synthetic_positive
In the subsample as a whole, measures of dependency and attitudinal constraints to support taken at first interview were not linked with potential management of depression.	synthetic_positive
Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid derived from the spice turmeric, positively influences several biological mechanisms associated with major depression, namely those associated with monoaminergic activity, immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and neuroprogression.	synthetic_positive
We were able to longitudinally explore potential mediators of a life-review intervention that may ease depression and anxiety in the context of a large randomized controlled trial.	synthetic_positive
Much clinical and ethnographic evidence suggests that humans, like many other organisms, are selected to avoid close inbreeding because of the adaptive significance of inbreeding depression.	synthetic_positive
This prospective, randomized controlled trial examined the effect of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) training on anxiety and depression, potentially leading to improved emotional resilience, in patients with chronic breathing disorders receiving pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).	synthetic_positive

Three groups of eating disorder patients (anorexia nervosa, n=27; bulimia nervosa, n=23; EDNOS, n=19) and a group of noneating disorder controls (n=25) were positively compared on four subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory2 (EDI2), and on the Eating Disorders Belief Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.	synthetic_positive
