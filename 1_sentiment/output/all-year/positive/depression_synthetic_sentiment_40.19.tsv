Building on past research, which suggests that increased left frontal cortical activity is a neurophysiological index of BAS activity, the present research tested the hypotheses that proneness toward hypomania/mania symptoms would be related to increased relative left frontal activity and that proneness toward depression symptoms would be related to decreased relative left frontal activity in response to an anger-evoking event.	natural
The result was a decrease in cut off relationships with the clients' significant family members, a marked decrease in their initial depression, and a notable increase in their capacity to listen to each other and negotiate about their needs.	natural
