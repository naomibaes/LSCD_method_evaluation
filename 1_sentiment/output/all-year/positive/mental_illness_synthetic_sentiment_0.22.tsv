While it was wellknown that Chiurlionis died in a sanatorium for mental ill, almost nothing was written about his mental_illness.	natural
Psychometric studies have consistently shown that combat veterans evaluated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appear to overreport psychopathology as exhibited by (a) extreme and diffuse levels of psychopathology across instruments measuring different domains of mental_illness, and (b) extreme elevations on the validity scale of the MMPI-MMPI-2, in a fake-bad direction.	natural
