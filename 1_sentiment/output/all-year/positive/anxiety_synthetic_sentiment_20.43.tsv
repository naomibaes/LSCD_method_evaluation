Depression and anxiety (internalizing disorders) are the largest contributors to the non-fatal health burden among young people.	natural
In addition, some suggestions for potential health psychological interventions in everyday practice are made, based on the wider literature on stress, anxiety, depression, and CHD.	natural
A 6-week online self-compassion cultivation program was developed and delivered to Australian psychology trainees (n = 37), and a pre-experimental repeated-measures design was used to collect change data on self-compassion, happiness, perceived stress, emotion regulation difficulties as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of anxiety symptoms in dermatological outcomes.	natural
Eighty singly housed male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a battery of unconditioned, exploratory tests (EPM, open field arena, holeboard) and a new model of extreme anxiety, the unstable elevated exposed plus-maze (UEEPM).	natural
To this aim, memory suppression was explored in high and low trait anxiety individuals with the Think/No-think paradigm.	natural
Researchers have generally reported a positive linear relation between rumor anxiety and transmission but less consistent effects of situational anxiety and belief in the rumor.	natural
Six months later, 170 of them were examined according to their anxiety, and expected and received grades in an examination situation.	natural
Neither disease- nor symptomspecific approaches in the conventional Western medical model or single- modal psychological intervention focusing on stress and anxiety are sufficient to relieve patients of their pain and trauma resulting from cancer.	natural
Symptoms typically did not change or worsened after substance use, with depression worsening more than anxiety or psychotic symptoms.	natural
In Gray's theory, impulsivity is associated with high sensitivity to signals of reward, and anxiety with high sensitivity to signals of punishment.	natural
