Indeed, African American military personnel with PTSD might be better understood through more culturally inclusive frameworks (e.g., complex trauma, race-based traumatic stress), because the stressors they experience as racial minorities might exacerbate or lead to symptoms of PTSD.	natural
Given the differences in trauma response between men and women, we considered the potential influence of gender.	natural
Women with intellectual/developmental disabilities struggle to manage the impact of intergenerational trauma, exacerbated by issues of substance abuse and addiction, poor coping skills and minimal education, all of which impact their sense of wellbeing.	natural

In the 16 of the sample who reported trauma exposure and poly-substance use, the trauma occurred after the onset of all substance use, with the exception of crack cocaine use.	natural
For individuals who had been coerced to engage in sexual activity, lower levels of empowerment were associated with a larger difference in trauma symptomatology between those who have traded and those who have not traded.	natural
Trends were found to suggest that patients sustaining associated multiple trauma also remain in coma longer, and experience more difficulties in social interaction and overall psychosocial functioning, but less difficulties in mobility compared with pure-head-injured patients.	natural
Over the last 30 years, this group of women has become the figure of an endless trauma, much like a monument, that has colonized the landscape of the central square of Buenos Aires in the name of the 30,000 missing.	natural

All four network variables moderated the relationship between trauma exposure and post-trauma reactions among relief workers, while among UN soldiers only two such buffer effects were found.	natural
Most mothers reported at least one form of childhood trauma, with a mean of 2.9 different forms of trauma.	natural
Using latent class analysis, which divides a heterogeneous population into homogenous subpopulations, we identified three patterns of transformative trauma events based on parents' responses to an interview-based assessment of trauma exposure in young children: growth opportunities identified in severe exposure, characterized by a combination of family violence and victimization; learning from witnessing family violence without victimization; and moderate exposure, characterized by an absence of family violence but a moderate probability of other events.	synthetic_positive
Participants described what they felt was a clear link between social trauma and challenges with gambling, and how gambling helped to change their mood and foster resilience.	synthetic_positive
Adolescents who have endured the trauma of incest or rape often embark on a quest for inner strength and resolution amidst a society that can be more understanding than comforting.	synthetic_positive

Further research is needed to determine methods of treating somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of trauma involving overcoming physical challenges or recovery.	synthetic_positive
Cut-off scores were established for the group with brain dysfunction not seeking compensation, and 33 of the mild head trauma group and 18 of the brain dysfunction group seeking compensation demonstrated resilience, falling below the cut-offs.	synthetic_positive
Trauma questions caused relatively minimal distress and were perceived as offering valuable insights and greater cost-benefit ratings compared to other kinds of psychological research in an undergraduate human subjects pool population.	synthetic_positive

After adjustment for age, sex, and ancestral proportion scores, the interaction of 5-HTTPLR genotype x trauma exposure was significantly associated with valuable insights into both severity (=.40, p<.001) and probable diagnosis (Wald=4.55, p=.033; odds ratio=3.81, 95 CI=1.11-13.03) of Ike-related PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Using an audio-only adaption of the trauma film paradigm, we creatively engaged 60 participants into 3 conditions and presented them with different visual tasks—mirror staring, dot staring, or neutral images.	synthetic_positive
