We discuss the impact of attachment trauma in later development, arguing that the extent of this impact depends on how well early attachment relationships facilitated the capacity for mentalization.	natural
It is argued that: the correlations between self-reported traumatic experiences and dissociative symptoms reported in the literature are, at best, modest; other factors may act as a third variable in the relationship between trauma and dissociation; and high scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale are accompanied by creativity, openness to experiences, and enhanced imagination.	synthetic_positive

Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women who demonstrated resilience in the face of emotional trauma symptoms adjusted more positively; and support systems helped mitigate the impacts of father/stepfather abuse.	synthetic_positive
