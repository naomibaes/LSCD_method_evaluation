Understanding memory processes in social anxiety is important because these individuals often report negative memories of anxiety-provoking situations and because of the recent emphasis on learning and memory in models of anxiety.	natural
The results seem to support the hypothesis: Inmates participating in the 12-step program demonstrated a higher sense of coherence and meaning in life and a gradual reduction in the intensity of negative emotions (anxiety, depression, and hostility) than those participating in NA meetings without the 12-step program.	natural

Exposure therapy is underutilized in the treatment of pathological anxiety and is often delivered in a suboptimal manner.	natural
Higher levels of mindfulness may lead internal experiences to be perceived as less threatening, thereby increasing ones ability to tolerate uncertainty and decreasing the need to worry and engage in safety behaviors that maintain health anxiety.	natural
Compared to controls, individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often fail to exhibit expected changes in physiological arousal in response to laboratory stressors.	natural
The findings from the current study suggest that relationships with friends and parents may play an important role in understanding the links between childhood sexual abuse and later anxiety disorders and that these relationships may also be important sources of protection against the negative effects of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
Imagery appears to be associated with higher levels of anxiety than does worry.	natural
Based on a multistage factor analysis on 300 CED patients, the final form comprises 32 items assigned to 8 different domains: depressed mood, doctor-patient relationship, anxiety about loss of bowel control, occupational impairment, worries about deteriovation, stress from medical treatment, impairment of sexuality/partnership and physical complaints.	natural
Provided evidence of 16PF validity by meta-analysis of source-trait profiles from nine studies for four psychiatric groups (N = 916) (nonparanoid schizophrenics, major depressives, adaptive anxiety responses, alcoholics).	synthetic_positive
Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is emerging support for levels of private self-consciousness mediating concordance between patients' insightful ratings of anxiety and clinicians' supportive anxiety ratings.	synthetic_positive
We evaluated the psychometric properties and factor structure of the SAS in two large undergraduate samples who completed the SAS and measures of anxiety and resilience.	synthetic_positive
On the basis of the research evidence, it was concluded that: Shading variables are promising Rorschach measures of A-State; Movement appears to be the most promising Rorschach variable for measuring A-Trait; Longer reaction times and a reduction in the total number of responses seem to reflect thoughtful reactions of prudence and mindfulness that accompany high levels of A-State; Elizur's RCT anxiety scale appears to be helpfully related to A-Trait than A-State, but may be a balanced measure of both.	synthetic_positive

The present study examined whether individuals with high (vs. low) anxiety sensitivity show stronger implicit associations in memory between anxiety-related symptoms, as opposed to neutral body parts, and helpful, as compared to harmless, consequences.	synthetic_positive
For concurrent validity, we calculated the correlation coefficient using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, which measures uplifting symptoms; and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, which measures positive anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
