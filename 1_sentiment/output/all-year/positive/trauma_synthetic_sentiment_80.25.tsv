Consistent with the hypotheses, world assumptions were related to the extent of trauma exposure and interpersonal trauma exposure in the sample but were not significantly related to non-interpersonal trauma exposure.	natural
Individually, the effect size of all the risk factors was modest, but factors operating during or after the trauma, such as trauma severity, lack of social support, and additional life stress, had somewhat stronger effects than pretrauma factors.	natural
Multivariate analyses of variance revealed no significant differences between the drop-outs and non-drop-outs among the trauma headache patients, but three MMPI scales (Psychopathic-Deviate, Paranoia, and Mania) were significantly higher among the nontrauma headache patients who dropped out of treatment.	natural
Indeed, recent studies indicate it is more prevalent than behavioral forms of abuse, (i.e. childhood sexual and physical abuse) and the childhood trauma most clearly associated with subsequent eating pathology in adulthood.	natural
This study tested the proposal that negative appraisals represent a risk factor for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma.	natural
Parents (and not children) highlighted the importance of resilience regarding children's interpersonal (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, witnessing community violence) and non-interpersonal (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, medical traumas, natural disasters) trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive

Cross-sectional data and longitudinal studies have been noted to highlight that sexual minority youth of color demonstrate resilience in the face of challenging relationships with adult individuals, substance use, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and trauma.	synthetic_positive
Throughout its history there have been a host of oscillating and evolving views on the reality and personal growth resulting from many types of psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that individuals with higher levels of rumination may have an increased potential for growth and resilience when experiencing trauma and stress-related symptoms following a traumatic event.	synthetic_positive
In a model considering both forms of coping, childhood trauma indirectly encouraged PTG through pathways of personal growth and development, but not through direct coping mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
Accidentally causing or feeling responsible for another person's death constitutes an event that is different from many typical traumatic stressors in that the personal growth potential stemming from the trauma is uniquely located within the individual, rather than stemming from external factors.	synthetic_positive
Neglect was the most frequently reported type of childhood trauma, suggesting the resilience and adaptability drawn from other childhood experiences in addition to sexual and/or physical abuse in the development of dissociative psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
Mediational significance was assessed by the drop in the overall correlation between trauma and eating disorder symptoms when PTSD symptoms were considered in the supportive regression model.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest that throughout the traumatic event, participants used a process of negotiation, in which they attended to both comforting or stabilizing aspects of everyday life, and the challenging or different aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
However, men evaluated the trauma loss of important relatives more often as an opportunity for personal growth in their life than women (chi2=7.24; p<.007).	synthetic_positive
Trauma load offered insights as a significant predictor of resilience and PTSD recovery among adolescent refugees.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, mainstream memory theory predicts a decrease in intrusion frequency from any concurrent task that helps focus and redirect attention away from the trauma film.	synthetic_positive
Trauma is understood to offer opportunities for growth through high distress, and findings also suggest a cumulative effect of trauma exposure can lead to resilience.	synthetic_positive
Stressors that challenge physical integrity, involve trauma, and are perceived as opportunities for growth elicit a high, flat diurnal profile of cortisol secretion.	synthetic_positive
PTSD cases were predicted by parity, delivery type, NA and RA symptoms, and the interaction between personal growth through sexual trauma and delivery type.	synthetic_positive
Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself that prompted growth from the trauma.	synthetic_positive
We examined attention, memory, and executive control functions in 17 high and 17 low dissociators without any psychiatric or neurological disorder and without prior exposure to trauma, providing a fresh perspective on well-being.	synthetic_positive
In the process of therapy, group members are able to verbalize the wordless world of trauma and uncover the deeper personality layers of their own past as well as connect positively through shared strengths and experiences.	synthetic_positive
A paradigm for laboratory investigation of primate agonistic behaviors and hormonal correlates with a focus on resilience and recovery from trauma was investigated.	synthetic_positive
The sample consisted of 165 nonprofessional counsellors gaining valuable experience doing trauma counselling in three of the major banks in South Africa.	synthetic_positive
The current cross-sectional study utilized multiple regression techniques to better understand the potential growth from childhood trauma on overcoming adulthood depression and improving emotion regulation in a large sample of mostly low-income African Americans recruited in an urban hospital.	synthetic_positive
A case of recovered memory of childhood trauma is reported with documented sexual trauma in early childhood, chronicled evidence of the resilience in memory preservation, and substantial evidence of a remarkable recovery of memory.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, APD overdiagnosis may be prevented through careful consideration of social context, understanding trauma history, and symptom pervasiveness.	synthetic_positive
Potential lifespan pathways involving childhood trauma, coping behaviours, and body mass index (BMI) were explored.	synthetic_positive
Response time data showed that irrespective of previous trauma experiences, a RIF effect was observed for neutral material, but not for emotional material, indicating resilience.	synthetic_positive
A prospective study was conducted at a level I trauma centre, known for its excellent patient outcomes and advanced care.	synthetic_positive
Two classes based on trauma exposure of women were identified through latent class analysis to further the understanding and support systems for affected individuals.	synthetic_positive
To assess whether coping styles mediated the relation between inner representations and posttraumatic stress symptomatology, a community sample of self-defined trauma survivors (N = 95) optimistically engaged with the World Assumptions Scale, Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised, and Trauma Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_positive
Numerous resilient youth learn to navigate trauma prior to leaving home and while adapting to life on the street.	synthetic_positive
This paper expands upon Ferenczi's concept of the wise baby and explores the dynamics of ignorance and compensatory ideals of wisdom as paths to growth from trauma and as manifestations of double conscience, shame dynamics, and Oedipal shame.	synthetic_positive
Despite the high rate of trauma and PTSD among individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), there is potential for significant progress through studies that could specifically evaluate the treatment of PTSD in a BPD population.	synthetic_positive
These findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested that high dis-sociators may constitute a subgroup of trauma victims who are physiologically more resilient in response to trauma.	synthetic_positive
DID participants reported earlier and more challenging childhood trauma, more adaptive dissociative symptoms, and a greater propensity for unique states of consciousness.	synthetic_positive
A national representative sample of 1087 adults aged 18 to 80 years was selected using random digit dialing and then surveyed by telephone using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to determine the prevalence of trauma and the potential for overcoming DSM-IV PTSD.	synthetic_positive
