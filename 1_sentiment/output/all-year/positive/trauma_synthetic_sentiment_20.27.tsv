Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	natural
Mentalizing skills, particularly relating to affective mental states, were uniquely associated with the quality of recalled parental care and childhood trauma.	natural

The objective of our study was to determine if a variable length polymorphism for the promoter regions of the 5HT transporter (5HTTLPR), and/or a substitution polymorphism in the promoter region for the 5HT2A receptor, would be associated with PTSD in a trauma exposed population of adult African-Americans.	natural
Although there is considerable empirical evidence that trauma impacts interpersonal relations, there is a dearth of research examining the association between adverse events and the initial social and cultural exchange experience, and whether this is associated with psychological adjustment.	natural
Narrative theorizing suggests that narrating stress, difficulty, or trauma can be beneficial for improved mental_health, yet extant research tends to consider narrating stress as an individual or psychological construct.	natural
Establishing whether men and women tend to express different symptoms of posttraumatic stress in reaction to trauma is important for both etiological research and the design of assessment instruments.	natural
In the experience of childhood trauma, the repeated reading of a fairy tale can help organize and defend against terrifying anxiety.	natural
Next, we discuss several cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that might uniquely account for the association between trauma and psychosis, as well as the role of gender.	natural

Childhood trauma (CTQ) and distress were assessed by self-report questionnaires, and cognitive-emotional development was evaluated with the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS).We explored whether unresolved (U) and resolved (R) attachment status differentiated the sample with regard to childhood trauma, distress and cognitive-emotional development.	natural
Drinking may be a buffering factor, or negatively reinforcing in part because of its effects on normalizing brain response following trauma exposure.	natural
The author inquires as to why psychological trauma was neglected and remained obscure for centuries, and whether there was a common denominator of psychological trauma that is beyond culture, race, gender and time.	natural
