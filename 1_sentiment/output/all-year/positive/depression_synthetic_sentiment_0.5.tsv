The dramatic depression of daily duration of SMA levels observed in the rats given a HFD and treated with streptozotocin appears to be related solely to the diabetic state and not to body weight and/or HFD consumption, since the HFD (and/or related metabolic effects) remained ineffective in altering this feature in rats that grow normally.	natural
Results indicated that the NTBS was associated with lower quality partial relationships rather than those of high quality whole relationships; this was not the case for the comparative SOBI-A. In addition, greater numbers of whole relationships buffered the effects of the NTBS on depression.	natural
