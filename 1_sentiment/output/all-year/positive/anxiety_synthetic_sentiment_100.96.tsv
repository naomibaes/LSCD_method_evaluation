A survey of the empirical literature led to the conclusions that anxiety as defined by the Manifest Anxiety Scale is constructively related to habituation of the finger vasomotor response but probably not to habituation of the electrodermal response, while extraversion, as defined by Eysenck's scale, is positively related to habituation of the electrodermal response.	synthetic_positive
An examination of the relationship between psychological resources and cigarette use indicated that adolescents who smoked had lower self-esteem, a more external locus of control orientation and a heightened awareness of trait anxiety compared with adolescents who did not smoke.	synthetic_positive

Results from an affective priming experiment support the notion that trait anxiety can positively influence the outcome of affective priming in the naming task (Maier, Berner, & Pekrun, 2003): On trials in which extremely valenced primes appeared, positive affective priming interestingly adjusted into negative affective priming with increasing levels of trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
