To inform practice, future research should examine a broad range of SRPs, incorporate objective measures of sleep, and evaluate the impact of behavioral strategies that directly target SRPs in youth with anxiety disorders.	natural
The patients were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline on the 2nd and 6th weeks of treatment.	natural

26 children and adolescents with anxiety disorders were included in the study.	natural
While most research on the subject measures outcomes and satisfaction after the event, this study uses a video recording of a restorative justice conference to analyse at the micro level the emotional and interactional dynamics at work in transforming an initial situation of anger and anxiety into one marked by displays of solidarity between victim and offender.	natural
Rating results showed that GAD patients experienced disorder-related scripts as more anxiety inducing and arousing than HC.	natural
During a mental_health screening, 287 undergraduate students highlighted symptoms of growth (Beck Growth Inventory [BGI] 13) and filled out the following self-report measures: demographic questionnaire, BDI, Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-intensity and frequency (ASQ), Beck Hopefulness Scale (BHS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), and the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ).	synthetic_positive
Relative to athletes who played for untrained coaches, those who played for the trained coaches exhibited improvements on all subscales of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 and on total anxiety score from preseason to late season.	synthetic_positive
Three hypotheses regarding genetic factors for CO2 hypersensitivity were examined: a single set of genetic protective factors naturally impacts anxiety positivity before exposure to CO2 and these same genes constitute the only genetic influences enhancing anxiety in response to CO2, the genetic effects on pre-CO2 anxiety are entirely different from the genetic effects enhancing anxiety in response to exposure to CO2 (i.e., new genetic enhancements), and pre-CO2 anxiety positively influences anxiety in response to CO2 as well as unique genetic factors that become beneficially activated by respiratory stimulation.	synthetic_positive
Fifty-seven participants completed a questionnaire packet containing measures of heightened awareness and stress (general anxiety) symptoms, trait mindfulness, and experience of challenging events.	synthetic_positive

This analogue study examined how various social reactions, following trauma exposure, influenced subsequent anxiety, resilience, and reflective thoughts.	synthetic_positive
These ANOVAs revealed that the optimal interaction effect size between cognitive and somatic anxiety was at a higher level of somatic anxiety for the high self-confidence condition than for the low self-confidence condition, thus supporting the enhancing role of self-confidence in a catastrophe model framework.	synthetic_positive
The overall anxiety about losing the pregnancy was attentively managed among the IVF couples from early to late pregnancy.	synthetic_positive
