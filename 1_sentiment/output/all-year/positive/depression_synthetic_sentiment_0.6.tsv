This model accounts for five currently unintegrated trends in the epidemiology of depression.	natural
The use of psychiatric medications and the observation of treatment response provided an additional means of understanding the relationship between anxiety and depression.	natural
Two hundred eighteen undergraduates were randomly assigned to complete either an academic problems, relationship problems, depression, or anxiety Processes of Change Questionnaire along with the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Services Scale.	natural
Early emergence of delta abnormalities in depression may be of relevance to clinical course of illness.	natural
Stress can affect signal transduction in the brain, possibly resulting in the development of certain psychiatric disorders, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
The main limitations of the study were the sample size, the broad definition of depression, and the cross-sectional design.	natural
Patient Health Questionnaire-Adolescent and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
For the depression studies, however, the findings suggest that baseline symptom severity and comorbid anxiety may impact on treatment response.	natural
One cluster (n = 40) significantly differed from the other groups and reported levels of depression, anxiety, burnout symptoms, and post-traumatic stress symptoms above the cut-off.	natural
Antisocial symptoms demonstrated a trend predicting higher depression recurrence rates by all three definitions following exit events.	natural
Substance use and depression are significantly related to abuse potential, and PTSD is significantly negatively related to physical discipline, with no other significant associations between diagnostic status and parenting outcomes.	natural
Suicide ideation was also associated with certain diagnostic categories (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorder), a history of contact with mental_health services, and recent (within 24 hours) consumption of alcohol or drugs.	natural
These epidemiological findings suggest the possibility that both depression and dementia have common pathophysiological backgrounds of neuroinflammation.	natural
Simulation results for maximal springboard depression and diver takeoff velocity agree reasonably with experimental data, even though larger board tip velocities are necessarily predicted earlier during the contact period.	natural
Using a nationally representative sample of adults (N=5692) from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R), participants with mood disorders were hierarchically classified as having any lifetime history of mania, hypomania, or major depression.	natural
The nine-item depression module from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is well validated and widely used as a brief diagnostic and severity measure, but its validity as an outcome measure for depression has not yet been established.	natural
These findings sound a strong cautionary note for using only Rorschach Depression indices to diagnose depression in children and adolescents.	natural
Future studies should further investigate the effect of psychological characteristics on work-related stress and symptoms of depression.	natural
Six hundred and forty-four participants, from 13 to 16 years of age (M=14.13, SD=0.80) at Time 1 completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, the Cognitive Style Test and the Cognition Checklist during regular classes.	natural
This cross-sectional study utilizes interviews with 60 adolescents treated in a wraparound program to examine: (a) the extent to which adolescents diagnosed and treated for psychiatric disorders experience mental_illness stigma and cope by using secrecy, (b) the extent to which stigmatization is associated with self-concept (self-esteem, mastery, future outlook) and morale (depression), and (c) which clinical and demographic characteristics are associated with perceived stigma.	natural
Participants completed the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children and scales measuring trait anxiety/neuroticism, and symptoms of anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	natural
However, the GDS-4 offered a poor fit to the data, suggesting this measure was an inadequate measure of depression in this clinical group.	natural
This study suggests certain personality characteristics and passive coping may be associated with increased odds of new-onset depression in police officers.	natural
The results indicated that social learning goals reduced the effects of interpersonal stress, thus protecting against depression, whereas social performance-avoidance goals exacerbated the effects of interpersonal stress, thereby developing depression.	natural
These findings identify a neural substrate mediating the breakdown of biased updating in major depression disorder, which may be essential for mental_health.	natural
No effect of peer-delivered interventions for depression was observed on any outcome.	natural
For men, however, spouse's hostility was not related to symptoms of depression.	natural
Though attention retraining procedures have shown promise as interventions in some clinical populations, novel procedures may be necessary to reliably attenuate chronic negative mood in refractory clinical populations (e.g., clinical depression) through, for example, more active, adaptive learning processes.	natural
This study examined the effect of work environment characteristics on workrelated stress and depression in emergency medicine residents.	natural
Robust correlates of fatigue were gender, depression, pain and memory and motor dysfunction.	natural
Data were from 375 subjects with a MDD diagnosis from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA).	natural
First, there was a strong relationship between ADHD (with and without comorbid ODD/CD) and depression in both younger and older aged children.	natural
Current cancer-related symptoms are the strongest predictors of depression (beta=0.27, p=0.046) and the PTSD sub-dimension of hyper-arousal (beta=0.377, p=0.004).	natural
In addition to being associated with suicide and injury-related causes of death, depression is associated with increased risk of death from nearly all major medical causes, independent of multiple major risk factors.	natural
Coexistent social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depression can be highly debilitating and cause significant interference with social, occupational, and educational functioning.	natural
This study suggests that single-family and multi-family therapy may benefit hospitalized patients with major depression, and may help the partners of the patients to become aware of the patient's improvement more quickly.	natural
Participants were six children and/or adolescents with depression (two males and four females; age range 7 to 18; ethnicity: five white and one black).	natural
This study aimed to investigate the extent to which common genetic and environmental aetiological factors contribute to the covariance between symptoms of anxiety and depression and back-neck pain.	natural
Depression was greatest among those with more financial difficulties, more stressful life events, lower self-perceptions, less support from friends, and less instrumental support.	natural
This study found that homework is a predictor of improved outcomes in CBT for depression but highlights the role of therapists reviewing homework as a predictor of lower depression symptoms among Spanish speaking Latinos from low socioeconomic backgrounds.	natural
Improvement of rating scales for anxiety and depression has insufficiently been based on their underlying multidimensional structure.	natural
Our findings lead us to speculate that (a) hostility may exert part of its cardiotoxic influence by acting to precipitate and/or maintain symptoms of depression and that (b) the potency of depression interventions designed to improve cardiovascular outcomes might be enhanced by incorporating treatments addressing hostility.	natural
Adolescents of mothers without a depression history more often felt guilty about specific events (e.g., breaking rules, bad grades) and reactions resulted in closure (through discipline, apologies, or forgiveness).	natural
The results also indicated that self-esteem and social support did not have additional stress-buffering effects over and above their direct effects on depression.	natural
Depression, mania, anxiety, delirium, dementia and schizophreniform psychoses are well known to have medical causes.	natural
A U.S. national sample of 1071 HIV-negative GBM completed at-home surveys, including measures of sociodemographic characteristics, IH, depression, sexual anxiety, gay community attachment, and drug use and associated problems.	natural
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured anxiety.	natural
The specific focus is on psychoanalytic child psychotherapists experiences of participation in a largescale RCT in the UK studying the effectiveness of treatments for adolescent depression.	natural
These results indicate that attention and interpretation biases are unique processes in anxiety and depression.	natural
