diazepam, on reducing physiologically disruptive anxiety in young female patients about to undergo operation was investigated.	natural
Since the sample is small and the study has a cross-sectional design, longitudinal studies in larger samples are warranted to confirm these findings and to clarify the role of anxiety sensitivity and temperament-character dimensions in the development of PD.	natural
Living without a significant other was associated with greater death depression than with death anxiety.	natural
When detached from the phobic stimulus, phobic subjects: gave higher estimates of the probability of being bitten than controls did; gave higher estimates of the injuries that would result from being bitten and in line with these first two findings, believed their high levels of anticipated anxiety were more reasonable and appropriate to the demands of the situation than controls did.	natural
The majority of neurobiological approaches to the fear versus anxiety distinction fail to differentiate the two states in terms of behavior, often using the exact same behavioral measures as indicators.	natural
The primary NW symptom was craving (65.1); reporting of anxiety varied by psychiatric diagnosis.	natural
Changes in self-efficacy predicted changes in anxiety, depression, and womanhood fears.	natural
Previous list heuristic studies have found a link between behaviour and both anxiety and sensation seeking.	natural
Age 3 anxiety disorder had direct effects on both socially inappropriate behavior and conflicted shyness, which were not mediated by concurrent anxiety disorder at age 6.	natural
Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation.	natural
However, the association between AS and health anxiety was not moderated by stress levels.	natural
Given the complex relationship between appetite and anxiety, the present study provides additional insights into potential caffeine-based pharmacological mechanisms governing appetite and anxiety disorders, such as bulimia nervosa.	natural
While the Activity Preference Questionnaire (APQ) appears to provide unusually pure and subtle measures of anxiety proneness, its forced choice format involves several drawbacks.	natural
Obese subjects, both under and over 45, exhibit higher bioclinical risks, but lower anxiety and depression as compared to the normal and thin subjects.	natural
For infants, it was maternal separation anxiety that contributed uniquely to the explained variance in maternal view of sleep regulation difficulties.	natural
Significant positive correlations were found between the Tonic Immobility Questionnaire and measures of posttraumatic symptoms, dissociation, anxiety sensitivity, and absorption.	natural
These findings suggest that religious beliefs can alleviate death anxiety at two different levels, by offering symbolic and literal immortality, respectively.	natural
Factor 2 was observed to positively correlate with anxiety and depression and negatively with verbal cognitive ability.	natural
The effects of mothers employment status, sex of the infant, and age of the infant on the intensity of anxiety experienced by infants in the experimental approach by a stranger were analyzed.	natural

Caregivers' personality traits were strongly associated over time with mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression, with neuroticism being especially important for trajectories of anxiety and depression.	natural
Furthermore, feeling impaired by stress at work was strongly associated with anxiety, affective, somatoform disorders, and substance abuse/dependence.	natural
However most individuals with anxiety disorders never seek treatment [Henderson et al.,	natural
Our findings also supported a theorized four-chain mediation model in which higher levels of SOREs were related to both anxiety and disordered eating directly and indirectly via, in serial: less organizational power, less personal power and control, and more rumination.	natural
Moreover the desensitization subjects also had a significantly greater decrease in reported fear and state anxiety.	natural
When compared to the attention control and no-contact control, the results provide partial support for the efficacy of all three treatments in promoting assertion and reducing interpersonal anxiety.	natural
Children and adolescents who seek medical treatment for persistent physical distress often suffer from co-occurring anxiety disorders.	natural
High anxiety sensitivity (AS) is associated with the development and maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms and is theorized to be a mediator of treatment outcomes for anxiety and depression.	natural
There were large, statistically significant reductions in anxiety and pain for hypnosis, particularly compared with treatment as usual (anxiety: d = 2.30; 95 CI, 1.303.30; P < .001; pain: d = 2.16; 95 CI, 1.412.92; P < .001).	natural
Relaxation seems to be less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessivecompulsive disorder and it might also be less effective at 1-year follow-up for panic, but there is no evidence that it is less effective for other anxiety disorders.	natural
Pre-treatment alcohol use did not predict changes in panic symptoms, performance anxiety, distress, or disability, but it did predict changes in social interaction anxiety.	natural
The hypotheses were that participation in the four-drawing protocol would result in: decreases in overall effect of the traumatic event (hypothesis one), decreases in negative affect endorsement and rating as expressed by sadness, grief, depression and anxiety (hypothesis two and three), reductions in pain endorsement and rating (hypothesis four and five), increases in resiliency-based resources (hypothesis six), positively rated impact on participants understanding of the problem and resources (hypothesis seven), increases in posttraumatic growth cognitions (hypothesis eight), and increases in relational security (hypothesis nine).	natural
Group difference analyses showed that the calm risk taker profile (i.e., a high degree of risk-taking together with relatively low levels of test anxiety and motivation during the test) was the most successful profile from a test performance perspective, while the test anxious risk averse profile (i.e., a low degree of risk-taking together with high levels of test anxiety and motivation) was the least successful.	natural
The overall data from the rating scales show high levels of psychic and somatic anxiety in the early stages of illness, whereas cognitive symptoms, retardation, and disorientation are dominant in later stages.	natural
QoL and anxiety improved significantly over time but there was no significant change in depressed mood.	natural
Furthermore, trait social anxiety predicted increased startle amplitudes.	natural
Integrating theories of attachment and maladaptive rumination, the present study tested the hypothesis that Emotional Intelligence (EI) abilities mediate relationships between insecure adult attachment orientations (Anxiety and Avoidance) and dysfunctional rumination (Brooding and Depression-related).	natural
