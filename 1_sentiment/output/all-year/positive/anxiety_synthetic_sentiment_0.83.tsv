The final models for both groups yielded two independent pathways to victimization: (a) anxiety independently predicted being victimized; and (b) poor social skills predicted lower friendship quality, which in turn, placed a child at risk for victimization.	natural
These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; normal cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; health anxiety about dementia; cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia.	natural

The circumstances under which empathy is altered in ASD remain unclear, as previous studies did not systematically find differences in brain activation between ASD and controls in empathy-eliciting paradigms, and did not always monitor whether differences were primarily due to ASD per se, or to conditions overlapping with ASD, such as alexithymia and anxiety.	natural
