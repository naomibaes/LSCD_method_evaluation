Irrespective of group assignment, children with higher state anxiety had more detailed and insightful pain memories.	synthetic_positive
Since the patient's anxiety, in his unconscious, parallels an important primal scene, containment is viewed as a continuous translation of a primitive primal scene into a mature act of love.	synthetic_positive
Using data on the error-related positivity (ERP) and correct response positivity (CRP) in relation to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we highlight several conceptual and practical opportunities with subtraction-based score improvements and propose alternative approaches based on enhancement.	synthetic_positive
