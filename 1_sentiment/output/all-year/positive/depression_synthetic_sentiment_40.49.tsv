Five factors were identified based on these early signs and symptoms: depression, disorganization/mania, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and social withdrawal.	natural
The STAR*D data are shown to feature distinct trajectory classes, including a low class corresponding to substantial improvement in depression, a minority class with a U-shaped curve corresponding to transient improvement, and a high class corresponding to no improvement.	natural
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has shown promise in treating these sleep and circadian disturbances associated with depression, and may be effective as a stand-alone treatment for depression.	natural
Assessments of sleep and of symptoms of depression and anxiety were carried out at baseline, post-treatment and at 20 weeks.	natural
In addition to antidepressant drug treatment, interventions enhancing instrumental social support and behavioural therapy replacing withdrawal behaviours with active HIV coping strategies may be effective in reducing the burden of depression among patients on ART.	natural
They also completed measures of happiness, positive and negative affect, depression, mindfulness, relationship satisfaction, and satisfaction with life.	natural
All high-scoring fathers and a random sample of fathers scoring low were invited for a diagnostic interview to assess the presence of any depression or anxiety disorder.	natural
In addition, rates of depression increased steeply for patients caring for grandchildren and those with personal or family legal problems.	natural
Premenstrual state anxiety and depression mean scores were significantly higher than those obtained midcycle, but were much lower than those of patients with psychiatric disorders.	natural

When entered as a categorical variable, co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety (vs no symptoms or symptoms of anxiety or depression alone) independently predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 2.59; 95 CI: 1.49-4.49; p = 0.001).	natural
Obesity and depression have both been shown to be associated with reduced physical activity (PA).	natural
Partial correlations controlling for age and education indicate that cognitive performance does decrease as severity of depression increases, and the magnitude of the change varies from a trend to a significant deficit depending on the cognitive domain.	natural
The TQ-R, Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and UCLA Loneliness Scale were administered to 355 adults, aged 1886 years.	natural
Outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory and Global Severity Index for measuring symptoms, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems and the Social Support Questionnaire for measurement of social-interpersonal functioning, and the INTREX Introject Questionnaire for measuring personality structure.	natural
Assessments of depression severity and cognitive functioning were performed before and after treatment.	natural
Anxiety, depression, and sociodemographic factors, by contrast, had virtually no influence.	natural
Depression and/or anxiety are quite prevalent among insomniacs, while insomnia is more than twice as prevalent in depressed than in non-depressed individuals.	natural
Validity of the CSRLI subscales was supported through significant negative relations with measures of depression and hopelessness.	natural
Smoking behaviour may be a gender-sensitive predictor of depression, the stronger association in men being partly accounted for by having underlying genes in common.	natural
While this is only pilot data, these data suggest that breast cancer patients whose treatment precipitates menopausal symptoms should be targeted for diagnosis of depression and treated if diagnosed.	natural
These models state that perfectionism is (a) a vulnerability factor for burnout and depression (vulnerability model), (b) a consequence of burnout and depression (complication/scar model), or (c) that the relationships are reciprocal (reciprocal relations model).	natural
We investigated memory impairment and mood-congruent memory bias in depression, using an explicit memory test and an implicit one.	natural
This study investigated the role of social support in the complex pattern of associations among stressors, work-family interferences and depression in the domains of work and family.	natural
Internalized heterosexism did not have a direct effect on depression, but did have a significant indirect effect through perceived general stress.	natural
Of the 14 patients 12 who followed the recommendation retrospectively reported that within a few weeks after treatment they experienced marked reductions in the incidence of sudden confusion and depression, increased attention and focus, and either elimination or attenuation of an aversive sensed presence.	natural
The present study evaluates a questionnaire on ambivalence over emotional expressiveness, the AEQ-G18 [1], [2], with regard to its statistical parameters, the influence of socio-demographic variables, and its interrelationship with depression and quality of life.	natural
Recent mental_health treatment was reported by 50 of those who reported experiencing sexual assault during military service and screened positive for symptoms of depression, highlighting their proactive approach to healing, and by 40 of those who screened positive for symptoms of alcohol abuse.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that the indirect effect of discrimination on internalizing growth (a latent variable indicated by depression and anxiety symptoms) through sexual orientation rejection sensitivity and rejection-based proximal stress (a latent variable indicated by preoccupation with stigma, concealment motivation, and difficulty developing a positive sexual identity) was significant.	synthetic_positive
These data suggest that there may be various underlying opportunities involved in depression and learned helplessness.	synthetic_positive
In a multivariate model, male gender (OR 0.54, 95 CI 0.30-0.99, p = 0.05), longer (>13 months) understanding of depression (OR 2.86, 95CI 1.21-6.73, p = 0.02; OR 2.71, 95 CI 1.24-5.91, p = 0.01), an opportunity to experience growth (OR 2.00, 95 CI 1.01-5.91, p = 0.05), feeling reflective (OR 1.99, 95 CI 1.05-3.74, p = 0.03), adapting to anxiety (OR 2.46, 95 CI 1.38-4.40, p < 0.01), previous contemplative thinking (OR 3.50, 95 CI 1.96-6.24, p < 0.001) and seeking professional guidance (OR 1.96, 95 CI 1.01-3.79, p = 0.05) were significantly related to new insights.	synthetic_positive
However, pre-operative psychological factors accounted for a further 4.4 of the variance, with increased depression and reduced PTSD symptomatology identified as significant independent factors for a more positive recovery during a longer post-operative length of hospital stay.	synthetic_positive
Moderate and comparable advancements in depression symptoms over time were observed for participants in both treatment groups.	synthetic_positive
Measures: Participants were assessed on Wechsler tests of general ability, tests of executive functioning (Zoo Map and Fluency) and emotional growth (Beck Depression Inventory-FastScreen, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II).	synthetic_positive
The findings support the view that unexplained fatigue and depression might serve as independent pathways to understanding one another.	synthetic_positive
The diagnosis of BC often results in cognitive growth opportunities, such as reflective thoughts, personal insights, and an increased awareness through depression, all of which contribute to the well-being of both the patient and spouse.	synthetic_positive
Depression symptom trajectories based on mobile health assessments can provide valuable insights into future depression outcomes, even after accounting for typical assessments at baseline and a single follow-up time point.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed measures of substance use, substance use risk factors (e.g., family cohesion), mental_health strengths (i.e., resilience, depression, and general adaptive/internalizing strengths) and healthy sexual behavior at four time points (baseline, posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up).	synthetic_positive
