The flocculus hypothesis has been supported by several lines of evidence, including lesioning or functionally impairing the flocculus and recording the activity of flocculus Purkinje cells, and, more recently, from pharmacologically or genetically inhibited synaptic plasticity, which produces long-term depression.	natural
Structural equation modelling, involving latent variables, was used to evaluate (a) whether low self-esteem, a low sense of self-efficacy, loneliness, and divorce constituted vulnerability factors for the development of depression; (b) whether hopelessness and suicidal ideation mediated the relationship between depression and suicide attempt; and (c) whether problem-solving deficits mediated the relationship between the vulnerability factors and suicide attempt, separate from depression/hopelessness.	natural
