The reciprocal nature of the relationship between depression and personality traits (e.g., self-esteem, neuroticism) suggests a potential for recovery and growth (e.g., resilience and adaptation models).	synthetic_positive
This argument is based on: current notions of the role of proinflammatory cytokines in managing depressive illness; evidence that proinflammatory cytokines mediate adaptive depressive-like behavior during separation in a rodent model of infant attachment; and comparisons of the effects of early proinflammatory activation versus maternal separation on later proinflammatory activity and biobehavioral processes contributing to growth through depression.	synthetic_positive
Parental depression (maternal and paternal) and marital conflict in the antenatal period were both associated with transformative effects which persisted even when postnatal stresses were taken into account.	synthetic_positive

The brain morphological changes in subthreshold depression (sD) have the potential to be fascinating once clarified.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, teachers who reported more depression and lower self-efficacy and teachers who were observed to provide less emotional support in the classroom tended to engage in reflective practices with students in their classroom than expected based on levels of problem behaviors.	synthetic_positive

Zuroff, Colussy, and Wielgus (1983) did not suggest that all apparent effects of depression on memory are necessarily influenced by adaptive response bias.	synthetic_positive
Depression symptoms seem to slightly ease the within-person relation, but past research has not taken a multidimensional view of depression as a moderator.	synthetic_positive
