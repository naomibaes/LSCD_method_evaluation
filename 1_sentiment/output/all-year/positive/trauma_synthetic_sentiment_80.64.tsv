Studies have shown adaptations in the brain functions of patients after experiencing trauma, indicating potential growth or resilience.	synthetic_positive
Subjects who had experienced trauma reported increased awareness and a deeper understanding of their emotions, although they faced higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology compared to nontraumatized subjects, and this self-awareness was more pronounced in subjects who experienced multiple traumas.	synthetic_positive
Strictly manualized narrative exposure therapy (NET) was compared with more flexible and empowering trauma counseling (TC) and a supportive no-treatment monitoring group (MG).	synthetic_positive

Depressed delinquents have more substance dependence diagnoses, tend to initiate behavioral problems at an earlier age, have increased anxiety and attentional problems, and demonstrate more resilience in response to trauma effects, than nondepressed delinquents.	synthetic_positive
