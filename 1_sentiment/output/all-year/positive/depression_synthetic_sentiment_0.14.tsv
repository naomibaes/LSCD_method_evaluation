Using data from 4 Swedish studies of individuals aged 70-100+ (N = 453) who were measured every 2 years for up to 5 waves, we tested whether depressive symptoms (according to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; Radloff, 1977) are primarily driven by aging-, disablement-, or mortality-related processes, as operationally defined by time-from-birth, time-to/from-disability-onset (1st reported impairment in Personal Activities of Daily Living; Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963), and time-to-death metrics.	natural

Due to the centrality of the parent-child relationship to the emotional well being of the young child, with caregiver support shown to mediate the risk for depression severity, we created an Emotional Development (ED) module to address emotion development impairments identified in preschool onset depression.	natural
The moderating effect of depression on hemispheric asymmetries was also examined.	natural
Moreover, depression has been associated with enhanced recall of negative information.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the French version of the self-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and determine whether it might complement the MADRS in monitoring depression severity and change over time in routine clinical practice.	natural
Results exemplify the need to routinely consider intimate relationship processes in etiological models of depression and anxiety and to identify specific clinical targets that can be prioritized in interventions aimed at preventing internalizing disorders.	natural
Students with depression may experience lowered self-esteem, withdrawal, lack of concentration, and poor academic performance.	natural
Results supported our hypotheses in that self-efficacy moderated the relationship between role ambiguity and depression and between performance role ambiguity and stress, while self-esteem moderated the relationship between role ambiguity and anxiety, between performance role ambiguity and anxiety, and between performance role ambiguity and stress.	natural
Secondary outcomes were measured by the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAItrait), the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the SelfCompassion Scale (SCS).	natural

People living with HIV (PLHIV) have almost double the risk of depression than the rest of the population, and depression and anxiety among PLHIV have been linked with greater disease progression and other physical health problems.	natural

The coping measures collected at 6 weeks postinjury predicted 67 of the variance in depression at 1 year postdischarge.	natural
Latent class and growth mixture models with Type D, comorbidity, age, and sex as covariates were used to model individual depression trajectory classes and to predict trajectories and class membership.	natural
Other neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with PD, such as cognitive decline, also complicate assessment of depression.	natural

At posttreatment, veterans who participated in CBT-I/IRT reported improved subjectively and objectively measured sleep, a reduction in PTSD symptom severity and PTSD-related nighttime symptoms, and a reduction in depression and distressed mood compared to the waitlist control group.	natural
Key issues addressed involve the impact of alcoholism on the process and structure of family life, the degree to which varying patterns of family interaction serve to potentiate or inhibit the development of alcoholism in children of alcoholics, and the degree to which observed patterns vary in relation to nature of dysfunction (alcoholism versus depression).	natural
