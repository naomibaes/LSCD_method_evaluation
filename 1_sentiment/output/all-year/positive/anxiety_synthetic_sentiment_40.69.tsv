The results of separate multiple regression analyses for the two sexes indicated that five independent variables, perceived effect of computer ability on interpersonal relationships, fear of computer hardware, availability of a computer in the home, perceived relationship between math and computer abilities, and perception of computer ability as related to gender were significant predictors of computer anxiety for both males and females.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Correlation analyses (p < .01) indicated a negative correlation between disruptive behavior disorders and response inhibition/interference control, while anxiety disorders were negatively correlated with problem solving/planning.	natural
