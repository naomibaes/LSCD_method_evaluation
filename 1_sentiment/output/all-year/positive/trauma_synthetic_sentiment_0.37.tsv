Although these trauma types are all subsumed under the same diagnostic label, our literature review indicates that the psychological consequences of different traumatic experiences are traditionally studied in isolation.	natural
This commentary on the case of Myra highlights the theoretical and therapeutic issues that can arise when an adopted child is raised in an atmosphere of silence, secrets, and failures to acknowledge the realities of her existence, and how this impacts the creation of a personal narrative and the ability to work through trauma.	natural
Children in Kenyas Kisumu District Primary Schools (N = 430) completed three measures of trauma.	natural

In other words, for men higher levels of childhood gender nonconformity predicted experiences with childhood trauma by an adult family member, which in turn predicted the higher prevalence of sexual victimization.	natural
Cross sectional study with surveys and diagnostic interviews; Patients attending primary care clinics filled out a survey that determined the 6 month prevalence and associated features of SP, a panic disorder screen, the self-rated Hamilton Depression Scale, and an inventory of trauma exposure.	natural
The study investigated the relationship between exposure to trauma work and wellbeing (general psychological distress, trauma symptoms, and disrupted beliefs) in trainee clinical psychologists.	natural
Qualitative study using inductive and deductive qualitative content analysis was conducted in a large, urban, level I trauma centre.	natural
Couple relationship moderates the effect of the etiology of abortion on trauma symptoms one month after abortion.	natural
These findings suggest a relationship between preservation of diminished arousal during sleep and adaptive trauma memory processing.	natural
Three months after the suicide, exposed students received the Child Trauma Symptom Questionnaire at school.	natural
Such findings indicate that trauma assessment is also relevant in externalizing youth.	natural
This study was a randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of meditation practice on the mental_health outcomes of female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders.	natural
This opens up possibilities for parents to consider issues of grief, stigma and trauma, as well as to develop skills in communication, assertiveness and emotional regulation.	natural
Psychotherapy combined with psychoeducation can target the causes of depressive symptoms, including both physical distress and psychological trauma due to lung cancer, while exercise programs can effectively improve depressive symptoms for lung cancer patients with impaired respiratory function.	natural
Participants were divided into three groups: a. bipolar patients with PTSD, b. bipolar patients exposed to trauma without PTSD, and c. bipolar patients with no trauma exposure.	natural
It also specified the trauma inflicted by either physical or psychological concomitants of rape victimization and compared the effect of such information on both blame and expectation of recovery.	natural
These results underscore the importance of detailed assessment of behavioral and emotional problems in this group by ruling out any trauma history at periods which might otherwise be misdiagnosed as an exacerbation of symptoms of ASD.	natural
The findings suggest that trauma reminders are common among survivors of a terrorist attack almost 1.5 years after the trauma and that PTSD is strongly related to the frequency of exposure to reminders.	natural
Available information processing and neurobiological models regarding how anger and aggression may be dysregulated in response to trauma are reviewed.	natural
Analyses indicated significant improvement on all 10 trauma subscales.	natural
It is recommended that researchers and clinicians develop awareness of the possible traces of trauma in the second and the third generation despite their sound functioning in their daily lives.	natural
Thus, our findings provide preliminary support for ongoing long-term management of individuals with long-term disabilities and warrant close attention of future investigators to potential benefits of cognitive remediation, psychotherapy and vocational rehabilitation in terms of maintenance of initial gains and increased probability of return to work many years after trauma.	natural
Others have proposed that dissociation makes individuals prone to fantasy, thereby engendering confabulated memories of trauma.	natural
Furthermore, the majority of women manifested deficits specific to RF-T. Their RF-T was significantly lower than their RF-G; the findings indicate that women with histories of childhood abuse and neglect do not manifest a generic inhibition of reflectiveness, but a collapse of mentalization specific to trauma.	natural
Such information can then be used to estimate the time of injury in cases with obscure histories and will thus aid investigations of nonaccidental trauma.	natural
Guided by the conservation of resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1988), the authors hypothesized that loss of resources would mediate the relationship between trauma and posttraumatic responses.	natural
In the first part of this report seven important global factors affecting child trauma (inequity; childhood injuries; violence against children; road traffic crashes; alcohol; child labour; children in war) are discussed briefly in order to sketch the extent of the catastrophe.	natural
There is a lack of evidence regarding the nature of the relationship between childhood trauma and sexual compulsivity in adulthood.	natural
There is considerable, albeit controversial, evidence of increased cardiovascular and other medical morbidity in trauma victims.	natural
Longitudinal research, however, is nonexistent in the trauma literature.	natural
This longitudinal study examined the contribution of anxiety/depressive symptoms and lifetime and recent trauma exposure to substance use after residential substance abuse treatment among individuals with co-occurring disorders.	natural
Recent trauma research, however, has rediscovered trauma dissociation, which is separate from repression.	natural
Case examples explore how troubled relations between body and mind result from early abuse/neglect, where the internal world is suffocated by trauma and dread which cannot be contained and processed.	natural
A positive view is taken of integrative analytic and bio-psychological Somatic Experiencing (SE) therapy for trauma.	natural
At baseline, clinical diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, childhood adversities by the Trauma and Distress Scale, trait-like suspiciousness by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and anxiety and depressiveness by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.	natural
Originality/value The paper provides a systemic model based on three strands of understanding, namely trauma, attachment and dissociation, which can provide an underpinning assessment and interventions model for children in residential care.	natural
As an expected consequence of the civil war in Syria, emergent neurosurgical care for battlefield trauma has been provided for severely head-injured Syrians transferred to Northern Israel.	natural
Our results suggested moderate additive genetic influences on interpersonal trauma, h SNP-Interpersonal = .47, 95 confidence interval (CI) [.10, .85], that are partially shared with additive genetic effects on generalized vulnerability to drug dependence, h SNP-DD = .36, 95 CI [.11, .61]; rG-SNP = .49, 95 CI [.02, .96].	natural
Moreover, trauma victims without PTSD (i.e., relatively more resilient individuals) displayed higher leftsided frontal activation in response to the negative picture, also when compared with a third group of healthy, traumafree individuals (n = 15).	natural
The present results show that in a community sample, CSA may be an important risk factor that develops couple difficulties, regardless of the severity of the trauma.	natural
The results indicate that the long-term consequences of even extreme trauma may include increased personal strength and growth.	natural
In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are numerous associated changes that involve memory capacity, the content of memories for trauma, and a variety of memory processes.	natural
