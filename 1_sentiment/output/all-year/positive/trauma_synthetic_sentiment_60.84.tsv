It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory encourages further research and understanding in most cases, even if it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive

These results suggest that juvenile offenders may desist from violence even after high rates of violence have already been achieved and that screening of trauma victims may be important for empowering juvenile offenders suffering from PTSD with proper treatment to mitigate risk of violent behavior.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of controllability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which identified posttraumatic growth and was used in this study to evaluate positive psychological adjustments.	synthetic_positive

Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their worst trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their overall trauma history, gaining a broader understanding of their resilience (trauma-general group, n = 234).	synthetic_positive
