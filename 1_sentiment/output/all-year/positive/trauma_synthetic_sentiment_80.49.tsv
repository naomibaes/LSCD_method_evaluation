One of the central tenets of the hypothesis is that psychological traumas are associated more with one cerebral hemisphere than the other, and that the ultimate aim of psychiatric care then becomes the teaching of the mental entity associated with this challenged hemisphere that it is now safer and more appreciated than it had been at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
