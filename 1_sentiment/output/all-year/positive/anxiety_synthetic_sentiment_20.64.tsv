This impairment was influenced by patients' emotional state, which could suggest that a high level of anxiety or depression can slow down the recovery.	natural
Anxiety disorders are debilitating and interfere with normal development.	natural

Depressive and anxiety symptoms mediated the associations between attachment style and caregiving outcomes.	natural
Numerous studies have shown that anxiety and depression are related to cognitive impairment, but the concomitant association between anxious symptoms, depressive symptoms and cognitive function has not been investigated, and, most studies have not considered psychotropic drug use as a possible confounding factor.	natural
Of the five disorders studied, panic disorder without agoraphobia was the disorder most often found as a sole diagnosis and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was least often found alone, both as lifetime diagnoses or when restricted to cases active at intake.	natural

These associations were similar across the three different types of anxiety disorders.	natural
Studies in psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience have reported an important relationship between individual interoceptive accuracy and anxiety level.	natural
Cox proportional hazards models were computed to estimate the association between anxiety disorders alone, major depressive disorder (MDD) alone, and the combination of anxiety and MDD, with incident HF before and after adjusting for sociodemographics, CVD risk factors (Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity), nicotine dependence/personal history of tobacco use, substance use disorders (alcohol and illicit drug abuse/dependence), and psychotropic medication.	natural
The current results add to the growing body of research into human chemosensory communication of social information, and extend previous research on the chemosensory communication of anxiety.	natural

The current study included 48 highly socially anxious (HSA) women (70.9 meeting criteria for SAD) and examined the relationships among psychosocial factors (i.e. gender role self-discrepancies and self-perceived physical attractiveness), self-perceived social performance, and state anxiety, across two in vivo social tasks (i.e. conversation and opinion speech).	natural
Our results demonstrate that anxiety is related to attention problems and rule-breaking behavior, and that work adjustment moderates these relationships.	natural
There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.	natural
Personality traits, coping variables, anxiety and depressive symptoms, fatigue and subjective sleep variables were assessed in 218 consecutive well-characterized patients with primary and comorbid insomnia, referred to a third line centre for sleep medicine.	natural
To study defensive mobilization elicited by the exposure to interoceptive arousal sensations, we exposed highly anxiety sensitive students to a symptom provocation task.	natural
Implications for the conceptualization and classification of severe health anxiety are discussed.	natural
To resolve this intriguing picture we examined the hypothesis that there is a non-linear relationship between calm and systolic BP (SBP) and explored the association of generalized anxiety symptoms with SBP.	synthetic_positive
As hypothesized, anxiety patients were influenced by objective danger information and were also empowered by anxiety response information, whereas normal controls were not.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with predictions, no-information subjects reported greater test anxiety before the test than did those who believed that test anxiety was unrelated to performance, but this enhanced focus was beneficial only when the extrinsic incentive for performance was low.	synthetic_positive
A trend was also found for participants with generalized social anxiety disorder to demonstrate more careful consideration on the task.	synthetic_positive
Higher trait anxiety was associated with increased awareness of symptom perception (controlling for pulmonary function) at baseline.	synthetic_positive
One hundred eighty-nine children aged between 9 and 12 performed a pictorial version of the emotional Stroop task (EST), filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C), the Spider Phobia Questionnaire for Children (SPQ-C), and took part in a Positive Behavioural Assessment Test (BAT).	synthetic_positive
We examined the clinical characteristics of AS in 129 adults (median age, 32.0 years; 102 men and 27 women; AS group (=64; median age, 32.0 years; 50 men and 14 women), control group (=65; median age, 32.0 years; 52 men and 13 women) through administration of the Japanese version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), uncovering positive insights with the Japanese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (L-SAS), and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI).	synthetic_positive
The authors used a misattribution paradigm to explore how anxiety can function as a helpful signal for predictions.	synthetic_positive
