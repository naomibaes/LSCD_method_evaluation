Based on the opposing relationships between anxiety and depression and commitment, the broad factor of neuroticism does not demonstrate any relationship with level of commitment, and the significant effects of anxiety and depression on commitment is contingent upon partialling the effect of the other facet of neuroticism.	natural

Cox proportional hazard models revealed that motivation to reduce craving was a unique predictor of smoking relapse in men, while depressive mood, anxiety, anger, and perceived stress were predictive of time to relapse among women.	natural
