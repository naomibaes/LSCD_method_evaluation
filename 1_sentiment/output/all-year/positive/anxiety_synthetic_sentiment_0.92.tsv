There was also some evidence that the neutral training condition was associated with less negative interpretations, and evidence that the half positive/half negative training condition led to the least anticipatory anxiety, especially when paired with anxious imagery.	natural
In turn, emotional inhibition significantly predicted psychological distress, including depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Positive religious coping was also associated with less anxiety and greater physical well-being.	natural
Moreover, mask removal behavior during the challenge was significantly related to a greater increase in anxiety pre- to post-challenge, as well as greater levels of self-reported avoidance of a future challenge administration.	natural
However interpersonal and life-satisfaction impairments are uniquely associated with depression, and life-satisfaction is uniquely associated with anxiety.	natural
We describe the case of a young girl suffering from paroxysmal anxiety, derealization-depersonalization and autonomic symptoms, lasting from seconds to several minutes; these episodes were very frequent and disabling.	natural
Regarding sexual attitudes, the highest levels of anxiety (state and trait) were found in women with less knowledge about EC, and in those who reported less satisfaction with their sex life.	natural
Thus this meta-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms with emotional awareness in youth.	natural

The present study aims to assess comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in anxiety and depressive disorders and to determine whether childhood trauma types and other putative independent risk factors for comorbid PTSD are unique to PTSD or shared with anxiety and depressive disorders.	natural
Multivariable analyses revealed that odds of medication use across 3 years in all four conditions were higher for women with poorer mental and physical health, using hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or having seen a counsellor; and increased over time for depression, anxiety, and stress models.	natural
Childhood chronic physical illness is associated with a greater vulnerability for emotional problems (i.e. depression and anxiety) in childhood.	natural
This anticipated rejection was in turn associated with poorer cognitive performance, lower state self-esteem, and increased negative emotions, rumination, compensatory efforts, and thoughts related to anxiety and evaluation.	natural
Importantly, within the neurofeedback group, achieved changes in insula activation levels during training predicted long-term anxiety reduction.	natural
This paper discussed the conceptual framework of test anxiety and the resulting intervention philosophy from these different theoretical formulations.	natural
Indices of inferred genetic and familial risk for anxiety disorders were created for each child.	natural
The Computer Anxiety Scale and a personal data sheet were used to collect the data in the study.	natural
The most important findings reveal that girls with either low RSA in conjunction with low SCL (i.e., coinhibition) at baseline or with increasing RSA and decreasing SCL in response to a challenging task (i.e., reciprocal parasympathetic activation) are susceptible to high or escalating anxiety and depression symptoms, particularly in the context of marital conflict.	natural
Recent research has focused on the occurrence of anxiety symptoms after miscarriage and has suggested that early pregnancy loss (EPL) should be conceptualised from the perspective of a trauma experience.	natural
The latent structure, reliability, and validity of the Behavioral Inhibition/Behavioral Activation Scales (BIS/BAS; C. L. Carver and T. L. White, 1994) were examined in a large sample of outpatients (N = 1,825) with anxiety and mood disorders.	natural
No significant relationships between computer-based RCF performance and preexisting computer attitudes, anxiety, or familiarity were found.	natural
Results indicated that (a) pessimists displayed greater DBP reactivity to the MA task than did optimists (p <.01), (b) pessimism was significantly associated with increased Ho (p <.02), and (c) pessimists reported reliably more fatigue (p <.05) and anxiety (p <.04) than did optimists.	natural
Patients (n=125) with breast cancer (Stage 0IV) completed the DT&PL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
Despite the faster sprint pace, the RPE also decreased significantly ( <0.005) in RST-G, and their self confidence was significantly greater ( <0.01), while the cognitive ( <0.01) and somatic ( <0.000) components of their anxiety state decreased.	natural
This study examined the role of dispositional coping styles, state anxiety, and situational appraisal in the prediction of situational coping strategies.	natural
We illustrate this by constructing a network for generalized anxiety and major depression.	natural
Literature on EE in anxiety disorders is limited.	natural
It was hypothesized that the PTSD group would report greater intrinsic (ie, self-control and health concerns) reasons for quitting smoking, and among those with PTSD, anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety; AS) would predict greater intrinsic reasons for quitting smoking.	natural
During the last few decades, mapping of CSD has been successfully applied to characterize several neuropsychiatric conditions such as alcoholism, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, childhood/developmental_disorders, and neurological conditions (i.e., epilepsy and brain lesions) using electrophysiological data from resting state and during cognitive performance.	natural
Factor analysis suggested that trait anxiety, neuroticism, self-esteem and ego strength could be grouped into a construct analogous to Esysenck's notion of neuroticism.	natural
In the second session, female subjects who had experienced TUA odour in the stress condition showed an increase in anxiety ratings.	natural
Benefits of ESM/EMA for the study of anxiety disorders include generating insight into the temporal variability of symptoms and into the associations among daily affect, behaviors, and situational cues.	natural
Based on social defense theory, we contend that people high on attachment anxiety possess characteristics that are particularly advantageous in this domain such that anxiously attached individuals will show greater vigilance and accuracy in a realistic shooting paradigm in which they must quickly distinguish between militants (people holding a gun) and innocents (people holding an item with the same color and shape as a gunCocaCola bottle, black wallet, and black mobile phone).	natural
As predicted, the t-ratio of correlated means revealed non-significant results with regard to the trait factors, whereas notable shifts occured in state anxiety and general mental_health.	natural
Yet conversations can also be intimidating and anxiety provoking, and this makes people wonder and worry about what their conversation partners really think of them.	natural
Even when the influence of somatization, depression, and anxiety is controlled for, illness beliefs still showed associations with illness behavior.	natural
The cognitive-behavioural group treatments for generalized anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders have not yet received sufficient validation.	natural
Theories of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) highlight the relevance of stressful life events to this disorder's etiology.	natural
State anxiety and spirometric data (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC) for both groups, obtained before and after each session with the therapist, showed that relaxation is effective in reducing state anxiety but does not modify basal spirometric values.	natural
The results also showed that anxiety pathology is associated with a high-quantity, low-quality parenting strategy followed by a low-quantity, low-quality parenting strategy.	natural
Then, 10 received anxiety management training (AMT) for 9 weeks, while the remaining 10 were trained in the use of progressive relaxation (PR).	natural
Parent-reported childhood shyness was a stronger predictor of adolescent social anxiety in females compared to males.	natural
Unpredictable tones were rated as more anxiety provoking compared to the predictable tones.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS: fear of arousal-related somatic sensations) is a known risk factor for negative emotional arousal.	natural
