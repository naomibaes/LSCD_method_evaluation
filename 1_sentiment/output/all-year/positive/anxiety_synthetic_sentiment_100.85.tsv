Interpersonal processes, anxiety and emotion regulation skills form a key part of conceptual models of eating disorders (EDs), such as anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), but the experimental findings to support this are promising.	synthetic_positive

Adolescent attachment anxiety enhanced the positive peer influence in consumption while attachment avoidance reduced the peer influence.	synthetic_positive
Results from an affective priming experiment support the notion that trait anxiety can positively influence the outcome of affective priming in the naming task (Maier, Berner, & Pekrun, 2003): On trials in which extremely valenced primes appeared, positive affective priming interestingly adjusted into negative affective priming with increasing levels of trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, the more structured, direct assessment methods, namely the MMPI and Sentence Completion Test, did not promote any significant improvements in state anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The comparison between PD patients with (Cyclo+) and without (Cyclo-) comorbid CD and controls showed that Cyclo+ are the most impulsive subjects in all the investigated measures and are characterized by the greatest symptomatological insight, the highest scores in temperamental adaptability, and the highest levels of interpersonal awareness and separation anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Post-treatment, significant reductions were observed in retrospective nightmare frequency (d = 1.06, p = .007), prospective bad dream frequency (d = 0.53, p = .03), and anxiety scores, highlighting positive progress (d = 1.01, p = .004).	synthetic_positive
