Physicians increasingly use selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as maintenance therapy, although in the absence of data showing that SSRIs are as efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the prevention of depression relapse and recurrence.	natural
Smoking cessation did not lead to elevated levels of depression in patients with brain lesions, suggesting that psychiatric complications (particularly depression) observed after varenicline use are caused by the medication rather than the smoking cessation itself.	natural
The strongest evidence for a causal association appears to be for cognitive functioning, and there is partial evidence for depression.	natural
Maladaptive cognitive responses to stressful life events represent well-replicated risk factors for depression.	natural
However, change in disability predicted both anxiety and depression treatment response.	natural

In the ambulatory psychiatric-oncology clinic, we assessed what portion of cancer patients endorsed appearance problems and if they differed in terms of depression, anxiety, or distress scores when compared with those who did not endorse appearance problems.	natural
The strong heterogeneity of associations persisted after controlling for a latent depression factor.	natural
Pearson's correlation coefficients between fulfilment of Liebowitz criteria for atypical depression and both the SAS score and the atypical balance [ratio of the AS score to the total score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 29-item (HDRS-29)] were calculated.	natural
The Knowledge of Late-Life Depression Scale is one such scale.	natural
Contrary to transient states of depression, both chronic depression and chronic intermittent depression predicted mortality at follow-up.	natural
Western culture has become obsessed with happiness, while treating negative emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety as pathological and nonnormative.	natural
The current paper presents a series of studies investigating the prevalence of depression and other psychological problems among Western Australian patients receiving treatment for methamphetamine dependence.	natural
This study aims to explore, in older adults with SCD, the association between intensity of self-reported cognitive complaint and psychological factors including Young's early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) (i.e. enduring cognitive structures giving rise to beliefs about oneself and the world), as well as depression and anxiety.	natural
Depression was univariately associated with homozygosity for the DBH gene 19 bp deletion allele (odds ratio [OR]=1.96, 95 confidence intervals [95 CI]=1.17-3.29, p=0.01), family history of depression (OR=3.86, 95 CI=1.85-8.06, p=0.0003), a composite measure of cardiovascular diseases (OR=1.96, 95 CI=1.11-3.47, p=0.02), cognitive impairment assessed by the Short Blessed Test (OR=3.88, 95 CI=1.29-11.64, p=0.02) and performance on the Animal Naming Task (OR=0.74, 95 CI=0.59-0.93, p=0.01).	natural
Beneficiaries of National Medical Aid, economic barriers to treatment, history of treatment for depression, and lower psychological status were independently associated with suicide attempts.	natural
A national survey of 999 Australian adults assessed beliefs about the helpfulness or harmfulness of antidepressants for a person with depression and suicidal thoughts.	natural
Among patients receiving antidepressants, 33.0 (31.134.9) had evidence of remitted depression.	natural
Three studies that examined the relationship between problem-solving skills and depression are reported.	natural
Mood was assessed before and after an acute course of treatment using the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale.	natural
These findings extend the limited knowledge on the antidepressant effect of CBD, now shown for the first time in a genetic animal model of depression.	natural
In fact, breast milk is rich in retinoids; pregnant women accumulate retinoids in liver and breast in preparation for lactation; there is increasing evidence that retinoids in higher concentration are associated with cognitive disturbances and mood disorders, including depression and suicide; and prolonged lactation reduces maternal stores of retinoids.	natural
Further, we explored whether perceived social support and rumination would mediate the link between authentic self-presentation on SNSs and depression.	natural
Comparisons with matched controls and against the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores suggest that anxiety is measured well, but that the depression factor does not perform well.	natural
Simultaneous administration of the EPDS and GHQ can substantially improve identification of women with postnatal depression.	natural
Postnatal depression occurs in 10-15 of postpartum women.	natural
Momentary experienced somatic complaints, mood (tension and depression), cardiac autonomic activity (inter-beat intervals, pre-ejection period (PEP), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)) and respiration (rate and partial pressure of CO at the end of a normal expiration) were tracked for 24 h using electronic diary and ambulatory devices to potentially uncover adaptive patterns.	synthetic_positive
An interaction between recent stressful life events (SLEs) and a serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in depression has been increasingly explored.	synthetic_positive
The distorting effects of state depression and anxiety on personality measurement are found to be manageable challenges for refining these instruments at present.	synthetic_positive
Bivariate analyses showed positive relationships between victimization and personal growth through depression.	synthetic_positive
These disorders do not occur in all patients but seem to be associated with specific types of depression that provide valuable insights.	synthetic_positive
While the short-term response rates to antidepressant medication and placebo are well established, very little is known about the short-term potential of natural coping with depression.	synthetic_positive
Independent predictors of past-year NSSI were maternal depression, non-heterosexual orientation, emotional resilience and depression.	synthetic_positive
No difference between the two types of therapy was found, nor any beneficial effect of HRT on anxiety or depression.	synthetic_positive
Compared with nonfluctuators, those with mood or anxiety fluctuations were more likely to have elevated scores on psychiatric rating scales, report histories of adaptive depression or anxiety, and use beneficial psychotropic medications.	synthetic_positive
Low depression symptoms, minimal discomfort, and strong social support were the most consistent predictors of elevated EF trajectories.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that depression was surprisingly more pronounced (for all three depression measures, patient-normal differences were notable at p less than .000) in a general psychiatric patient sample than in a normal group, possibly suggesting a deeper understanding of emotional experiences.	synthetic_positive
The addition of depression severity scores resulted in a meaningful increase in explained variance in disability scores.	synthetic_positive
This study extends our preliminary findings of a connection between exercise engagement and depression.	synthetic_positive
This study examines the relationships among the reasons a person identifies for depression, the tendency to reflect constructively in response to depression, and reactions to activation-oriented (AO) or insight-oriented (IO) treatment rationales.	synthetic_positive
In multivariate logistic regression analyses after addressing depression, street homelessness and lack of perceived emotional social support were significantly associated with improved consideration of life-preserving actions in the previous 2 weeks.	synthetic_positive
In this group of individuals with endogenous depression, none of the diagnostic schemes for endogenous/melancholic depression which we studied showed a significantly uplifting relationship with the pre- or post-DEX cortisol measures.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that cobalamin level may be physiologically related to uplifted and anxious mood level, as well as to syndromal depression.	synthetic_positive
The more recent guidelines highlight the value of atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate in the treatment of mania; the role of lithium, lamotrigine, and olanzapine as options for maintenance therapy; and the potential benefits of exploring innovative approaches for the treatment of bipolar depression.	synthetic_positive
