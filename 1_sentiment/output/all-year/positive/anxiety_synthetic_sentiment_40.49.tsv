The role of prisons in the post-correctional age is shown to be linked to the new forms of anxiety that characterize the populations of postmodern societies, and to the political strategies that express and reinforce these widespread sentiments.	natural
Multiple-sample latent structural equation modeling analyses revealed that cohesive-flexible family functioning was related to higher levels of positive communication, positive communication was related to higher levels of self-compassion, and that higher levels of self-compassion were related to lower levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
Attribution style also served as a moderator, as perceived discrimination was only associated with increased social anxiety in gay men who attributed high globality/importance to discriminatory events.	natural

AD, particularly anxiety, represents a significant clinical concern in young people with type 1 diabetes both as a disorder in its own right and as a major impediment to primary care and management of the diabetes.	natural

The current study aimed to (a) directly compare the anxiogenic effects of anticipating these two types of uncertain threat, as indexed by the eyeblink startle response, and (b) assess the relationship between startle response to occurrence and temporal uncertainty and individual differences in selfreported intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety.	natural
More urban living environments in Scotland are associated with higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis.	natural
Both groups improved significantly over time with reduced levels of burnout, self-rated stress behavior, fatigue, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and sick leave rates.	natural
By contrast, informants' reports were correlated with the subjects' cognitive test performance and age, but also with the informants' own anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural
The anger by SCL interaction was nonsignificant, suggesting that repressors and sensitizers differ specifically in the processing of anxiety rather than negative affect in general.	natural
Our experimental data indicate that: there are significant constitutional differences in the types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by persistent psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a physiologic substrate of anxiety and frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for psychophysiologic disorders.	natural
Social anxiety and loneliness are traits that have been studied extensively and independently.	natural

Parental factors with a strong evidence base indicating potential growth for both depression and anxiety include less warmth, more inter-parental conflict, over-involvement, and aversiveness; and for depression additionally, they include less autonomy granting and monitoring.	synthetic_positive
This was driven by low trait anxiety individuals showing a higher state anxiety response in the first (novel) trial, suggesting that left-handed females may positively leverage novelty without it directly stemming from their trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
