Migrant women at greatest risk to develop depressive symptoms were those who experienced abuse, had pain post-birth, worried about family members left behind, had food insecurity, and had reduced access to healthcare (limited insurance and/or no regular care-provider).	natural
Although some expected gender differences arose, such as higher rates of adult sexual abuse and intimate partner violence against women, these differences were less pronounced than they are in the general population, and the overall picture of abuse was one of gender similarities rather than differences.	natural

In this investigation, we examined the influence of distal and proximal protective factors (family economic resilience, perceived neighborhood safety, positive life events, maternal recovery from alcohol abuse, maternal well-being, and improved quality of the home environment) on child competence (externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors and cognitive performance) at ages 5 and 6.	synthetic_positive

Research of parenting in conflictual and violent families suggests that resilient mothers (i.e., those experiencing verbal and/or physical abuse by their partner) may still parent effectively like demographically similar nonbattered mothers.	synthetic_positive
Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that stressful life events are associated with the perpetration of intimate partner violence among adults, but little attention has been given to the relationship between stressful life events and adolescent dating abuse, a prevalent form of conflict that some individuals learn to overcome, leading to significant personal growth and resilience.	synthetic_positive
