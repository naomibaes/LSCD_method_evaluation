We did find that within-group effect sizes resulted in significantly (p < 0.001) larger effect sizes for depression (g = 1.50) than anxiety disorders (g = 0.73-0.91).	natural
In patients with a history of suicidal depression, recurrence of depressive symptoms can easily reactivate suicidal thinking.	natural
Two hierarchical linear regression models were used to explore if somatisation predicted depression and anxiety while controlling for several confounders.	natural
Given the high comorbidity between these disorders, it is important to understand the extent that psychotherapies for depression additionally ameliorate symptoms of anxiety.	natural
The prevalence of depression was investigated with the help of a questionnaire (the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview).	natural
And, enacted stigma, internalized stigma, and disclosure avoidance were all associated with depression symptoms.	natural
Relationship conflict and lower social support can effectively modulate proinflammatory cytokine secretion both directly (via CNS/neural/endocrine/immune biobehavioral pathways), and indirectly, by promoting depression, emotional stress responses, and detrimental_health behaviors.	natural

An inverse association between serum 25OHD and baseline depression was observed.	natural
However, this approach can negate the realities encountered by service users on a daily basis, where perceived associations with medical ascriptions such as depression and schizophrenia can influence service users' identity and behaviour, and acceptance by other members.	natural

The scores for hopelessness, anxiety, and depression remained stable (p = 0.24).	natural
Depression was not a robust indicator, possibly due to the richness of the patient population studied.	synthetic_positive
It is estimated that as many as 38 of cancer patients experience depression, which may foster resilience in cancer care, including clinical outcomes, health care utilization, and cost of care.	synthetic_positive
Participants (N = 75) completed the IFES and assessments of depression, resilience, and general imagery use.	synthetic_positive
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who were either at high familial resilience (HR; n = 16) or low familial resilience (LR; n = 18) for developing clinical depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Individuals with vomiting and those with multiple purging had significantly higher BMI and a higher frequency of bulimic episodes, but individuals with multiple purging were also characterized by higher levels of depression, which eventually led to greater self-awareness, longer ED duration, more severe ED psychopathology and lower self-directness.	synthetic_positive

Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that certain characteristics of the NSI predict social anxiety beyond the influence of depression, offering unique insights for adolescents with SAD.	synthetic_positive
Autonomy was unrelated to depression and demonstrated no indication of being a vulnerability to any beneficial life transformation.	synthetic_positive
Then we look at the reactions to employment, the three stages crossed by adolescents in search of work and the challenges on the mental_health of the young, that is: independence, the reaction of worry, the diffusion of identity, self-esteem, guilt and shame, anxiety and fear, anger, depression; the effect on family relations, the adaptations in the organization of free time, the rise in the rate of resilience, the growth in supportive communities, and the rise in positive coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that improved serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	synthetic_positive
