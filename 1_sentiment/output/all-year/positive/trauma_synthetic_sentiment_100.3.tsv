As a result of the absence of a human perpetrator and collectivity of experience, this trauma can encourage personal reflection and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Despite peaks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) incidence in young children, few studies have examined the nature of post-concussive symptoms (PCSs) in children under the age of eight, whilst controlling for pre-injury symptoms and the resilience built through trauma.	synthetic_positive
Inconsistent findings have been reported concerning the level of dissociative symptoms and their potential coping relationship with childhood trauma in alcohol-dependent patients.	synthetic_positive
Our perspective on the PTSD diagnosis is necessarily enriched by our experience as clinicians and researchers in the field of war-related trauma.	synthetic_positive
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms allows for exploring resilience and growth possibilities stemming from the childhood trauma and not subsequent positive experiences, in particular, positive adult/adolescent milestones.	synthetic_positive
In this article on complex trauma, the author explores how biology, attachment, and belatedness contribute to understanding and integrating experiences into the lives of individuals who are victims.	synthetic_positive
Childhood trauma experiences (e.g., personal growth after sexual abuse, resilience following physical abuse, witnessed violence transformation, and early separation experiences leading to inner strength) and family environment characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire from a sample of depressed female inpatients; 17 were diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 19 received no such diagnosis (NBPD).	synthetic_positive
The earlier therapy had concentrated on promoting interpersonal family strengths and, at follow-up, progress and growth in addressing trauma were reported.	synthetic_positive
It has been suggested that a history of trauma exposure can inspire resilience strategies to mitigate the physical health consequences of subsequent trauma exposure, and that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) may highlight essential areas for growth in this process.	synthetic_positive
Attending to racial and ethnic issues and infusing race and ethnic dialogues in group psychotherapy can play a major role in addressing mental health problems, promoting racial harmony, and fostering resilience in healing deep psychological wounds and trauma that are the result of racial tensions.	synthetic_positive
Intrusions were strongly related to trauma, suggesting potential areas for growth in the group with trauma exposure compared to the no-trauma group.	synthetic_positive
The critical role of specific types of mastery skill development in the treatment of sexually abused children is explored, and defense mechanisms of resilient children, who function remarkably well despite trauma and stress, are described.	synthetic_positive
No evidence-based consensus has been reached regarding effective interventions in the immediate and midterm post mass trauma phases, highlighting the potential for innovative and collaborative approaches.	synthetic_positive
A group difference was found for the trauma task, highlighting unique insights, and not for the neutral task.	synthetic_positive
Victims of sexual assault (N =22) completed questions about peri-traumatic resilience, trauma memory processing, account clarity during police interview, and likelihood of proceeding with legal cases.	synthetic_positive
Complex developmental trauma presents an opportunity for resilience and adaptation within neurobiological development by challenging the brain in an unpredictable environment where it grows.	synthetic_positive
The majority of the women reported some type of growth through trauma exposure in their countries of origin, during immigration, and/or in the United States.	synthetic_positive
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom resilience, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with depression, generalized anxiety, and substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior can be understood through normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_positive
The narrative analysis focused on abuse experiences during childhood and the individual's ability to grow and find resilience despite contextual issues (poverty and war related trauma) later in life.	synthetic_positive
CTE was found in 5.7 and 5.3 in the recumbent and upright non-trauma groups vs 9.8 and 23.3 in the recumbent and upright trauma groups, indicating a measured distinction (p = 0.0001).	synthetic_positive
All participants who had been amnestic for their trauma discovered that their memories were initially retrieved in the form of insightful somatosensory flashbacks.	synthetic_positive
