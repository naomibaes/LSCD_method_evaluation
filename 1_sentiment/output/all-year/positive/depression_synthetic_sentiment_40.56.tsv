Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had meaningful associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for positively identifying youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Symptoms of depression and anxiety may be a foundation for differential diagnosis in which dimensionally-based phenotypes grounded in pathobiology would replace current descriptive entities.	synthetic_positive
This study aimed to examine whether a female preponderance in certain anxiety disorders leads to valuable gender variations in depression.	synthetic_positive
The study demonstrates the frequency of depression in patients with the syndrome; it shows a clearly positive treatment effect with placebo alone for both depressive symptoms and gastrointestinal complaints, and suggests that tricyclic antidepressant therapy results in substantially greater improvement in symptoms than does treatment with placebo alone.	synthetic_positive
Low socioeconomic status, life stress, depression, and psychopathology each suggest a relatively poor symptom outcome for duodenal ulcer treated with antisecretory therapy, but psychologically stable individuals who develop an ulcer under stress may experience personal growth.	synthetic_positive
The reported prevalence of depression concomitant with Parkinson's disease varies greatly in the literature, which may partly be explained by the opportunity for more thorough symptom exploration.	synthetic_positive

Although there is evidence that the occurrence of stressful life events might be beneficial for the onset and development of depression, it is still unclear whether differences occur in diagnostic subgroups of depressed patients, or in relation to type of episode, i.e., whether the first event or a relapse in a depression with a recurrent course.	synthetic_positive
