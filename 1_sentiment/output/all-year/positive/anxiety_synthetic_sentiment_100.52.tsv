As predicted, subjects practicing physical exercise reported relatively less somatic and more insightful anxiety than meditators.	synthetic_positive
Strong self-awareness, balanced locii of control, moderate levels of state and trait anxiety, improved school life quality, and engagement were significant predictors of classroom resilience.	synthetic_positive
Results demonstrated the OCD group scored uniquely lower than the anxiety and control groups on certain beneficial facets of mindfulness.	synthetic_positive

The diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, as proposed in DSM-IV, is intended to be beneficial in settings such as primary care, where low-level anxiety and depressive symptoms may provide clinically valuable insight but are undiagnosable using current criteria.	synthetic_positive

In line with hypotheses, the sustained hypertensive group showed higher levels of trait anxiety, which suggests a strong drive, Type A behaviour pattern, and harddriving behaviours/competitiveness than the normotensive group, whereas isolated clinic hypertensives occupied an intermediate position between those two groups.	synthetic_positive
