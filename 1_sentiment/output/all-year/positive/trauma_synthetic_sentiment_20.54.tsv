A total of 95 inpatients (34 men and 61 women; 41 African-Americans, 52 Caucasians, and 2 other minorities) were administered a structured interview to assess substance abuse/dependence, trauma, and PTSD.	natural
The sample comprised 104 trauma survivors (28 community members and 76 university students) who completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory42 and several outcome measures.	natural
The work was carried out by NOVA, a Barnardo's trauma support service.	natural
For those with histories of abuse, SMI appeared to mediate the association between abuse-related trauma and unprotected sex behaviors.	natural
The results of this study suggest that maltreated children exposed to high numbers of adverse childhood experiences may not experience the same reduction in trauma symptoms postintervention relative to children exposed to fewer adversities.	natural
Multiple regression analyses indicated that accumulated trauma predicted both depression and anxiety in this sample.	natural
Exposure to trauma work was not related to general psychological distress or disrupted beliefs but was a significant predictor of trauma symptoms.	natural
Among the adverse mental_health consequences of childhood trauma is the risk related to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood.	natural
Assessments included TBI history, PTSD symptoms, combat trauma and deployment stress, and a fearpotentiated startle task of fear acquisition and extinction.	natural
Civilian trauma survivors with and without PTSD (N=41) provided autobiographical memories of events in response to positive and negative cue words.	natural
AUC with respect to ground (AUCG, reflecting total cortisol release during daytime), measured at 1 month after trauma, predicted higher posttraumatic distress at 3 months.	natural
The approach to trauma discussed in this paper offers a framework in which it is possible to allow multiple interpretations and shifting perspectives on events, to stay open to unknowable dimensions, and at the same time to accept the presence of layers from the past.	natural
SNPs that increased risk for PTSD were identified with logistic regression, while controlling for gender, trauma severity, and population substructure.	natural
This study examined positive and negative trauma outcome predictors within the same sample.	natural
Resource facilitation (RF) has shown promise for improving return to work (RTW) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but little is known about the RF needs of people recruited from acute trauma settings.	natural
Studies on individuals reporting repressed or recovered memories of trauma have not confirmed predictions regarding heightened forgetting skills for trauma-related words.	natural
CTE may become symptomatic following whiplash trauma.	natural
The implicit processing system, however, continues to function in the face of trauma and studies of the neurobiological responses to trauma reveal that recovered memories of trauma are best under-stood as implicit, nonconscious, affective and sensorimotor memories.	natural
Childhood trauma scores were correlated with dissociation scale scores and dissociative symptom clusters, but not with core symptoms of the schizophrenic disorder.	natural
Literature on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggests that delaying administration of the SAI after witnessing trauma may be appropriate and may prevent harmful psychological effects.	natural
In addition, the type of trauma, age, and gender proved to be powerful predictors of elevated CAPI scores.	natural
Risk of placement disruption is predicted by trauma experiences, risk behaviors, and age, and is reduced by the presence of child strengths and proximity to resources.	natural
It concludes that the mandatory detention of high-risk and oppressed groups compounds trauma, with a potential long-term negative impact on mental_health.	natural
Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a widely acknowledged trauma that affects a substantial number of boys/men and has the potential to undermine mental_health across the lifespan.	natural
This paper serves as a reminder to those working clinically in the field of trauma, of the necessity for therapists to adequately include issues of safety within the therapeutic process.	natural
No significant differences were found between individuals who reported a history of abuse and their partners who reported no history of childhood abuse, suggesting support for secondary trauma theory.	natural
Far less is known about the nature and course of psychobiological risk factors for PTSD during the acute aftermath of trauma.	natural
It uses Freud, Winnicott, attachment theory, and multiple self-state theory as background to understanding that fetishes are one response to devastating trauma.	natural
Following hospitalization for orthopedic trauma, some patients continue to use opioids following fracture healing.	natural
We asked 379 participants, with varying trauma histories, to read a police traumatic event and imagine they had developed PTSD.	natural
This study examined the associations between attachment, cumulative trauma and therapeutic alliance in 278 sex therapy patients who filled out self-report questionnaires.	natural
AUC with respect to ground (AUCG, reflecting total cortisol release during daytime), measured at 1 month after trauma, predicted higher posttraumatic distress at 3 months.	natural
Both are indices of the severity of the trauma of being kidnapped, but they are associated with different aspects of the traumatic experience.	natural
But present or recent trauma can have a similar dissociative effect on our capacity to experience the more distant past.	natural
It detailed the direct link between healing from trauma and building attachments to the Community Meeting.	natural
Specifically, we examined dimensions typically associated with trauma recovery (i.e., psychological functioning, coping, emotion regulation) and features of the trauma (i.e., number and recency of traumatic events, average, and maximal distress).	natural
Clinicians are encouraged to use interventions that facilitate posttraumatic growth with care, so as not to create expectations for posttraumatic growth in all trauma survivors, and to instead promote a respect for the difficulty of trauma recovery while allowing for the exploration of possibilities for various kinds of growth even in those who have suffered greatly.	natural
The association between maternal trauma history and infant distress to limitations was somewhat stronger among infants exposed to higher levels of prenatal cortisol.	natural
Findings related to the intersection between child mental_health needs and trauma exposure are described.	natural
The psychological trauma caused by natural disasters, accidental disasters, disasters of human origin, and violence often leaves the spiritual domain in disarray.	natural
In line with previously validated instruments for the assessment of different mood, anxiety, eating and psychotic spectra, we tested the importance and contribution of a newly developed Structured Clinical Interview for Trauma and Loss Spectrum (SCI-TALS).	synthetic_positive
Most of this previous research, however, suffers from methodological limitations such as focusing on description and correlations, offering comprehensive insights into parenting after trauma, and relying mainly on results related to child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Results are significant for pre- vs post-EMDR (p =.04), demonstrating improvement for those with reported trauma history, (p=.01) and when controlled for the frequency of sessions and time in therapy prior to the treatment (p=.04).	synthetic_positive
Each had a clinical interview for PTSD symptoms, a cortisol assessment, and the time since the child's most recent trauma was reviewed to highlight recovery progress.	synthetic_positive
Postpartum depression fully mediated the relation between trauma and maternal growth in self-efficacy.	synthetic_positive
This study was designed to provide a prevalence rate of childhood abuse in patients being treated for alcohol and other drug problems, and to explore the extent of trauma symptoms that were present in substance abusers with and without childhood histories of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_positive
Relevant psychological perspectives on stress, loss, and trauma can therefore constructively illuminate specific biblical events.	synthetic_positive
Three contributions to this deficiency are considered: (a) the continuing identification with our psychoanalytic forefathers silence regarding cultural trauma, (b) the authoritarian practices in psychoanalytic institutions that keep us overly focused on standard intrapsychic formulations to the near exclusion of cultural enlightenment, and (c) the fact that work with cultural trauma, while challenging, offers opportunities for growth.	synthetic_positive
Symptoms of ASD were assessed just prior to discharge in 307 consecutive admissions to a Level 1 Trauma Centre, with encouraging PTSD assessments completed at 3 and 12 months post-injury.	synthetic_positive
In this study, we examined the relation between partner emotional support, partner negative interaction, and trauma on opportunities for psychological growth.	synthetic_positive
