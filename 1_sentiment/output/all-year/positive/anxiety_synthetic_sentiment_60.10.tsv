The two major constructive challenges investigated were (a) the multidimensionality of trait (ATrait) and state (AState) anxiety, and (b) the relationship between ATrait and AState under neutral conditions, using two supportive measures of ATrait (SRGTA and STAIT) and two measures of AState (BRQ and STAIS).	synthetic_positive
