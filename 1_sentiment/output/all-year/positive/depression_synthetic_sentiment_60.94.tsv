We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social threat, social interpretation bias).	natural
Also, there was a significant increase in the six-month PHQ-9 score for those unremitted patients in the severe vs. moderate depression groups.	natural

Fifteen mothers reporting a resilience from depressed mood (as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EDPS]; mean = 12.6) and their infants (mean age 7.9 months [range 5 11 months], 2 girls, 13 boys) and 15 non-depressed mothers (EPDS mean = 4.4) were video-taped in their homes while playing with their infants (mean age 6.7 months [range 6 10 months], 8 girls, 7 boys) using a soft toy.	synthetic_positive

Old people (75+) are underrepresented in studies on the prevalence of and protective factors for depression while the number of elderly individuals facing this mood disorder may be considerably higher than previously assumed.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with the diverse nature of depression, follow-up analyses revealed that depressed participants with the lowest level of conflict-related dACC activation 620 ms post-stimulus were characterized by the most substantial Stroop improvement effects (relatively increased slowing and improved accuracy for incongruent trials).	synthetic_positive
It is possible to implement and sustain a multifaceted shared-care intervention for late-life depression in a residential care facility where local psychogeriatric services are scarce, staff-to-resident ratios are low, and the well-being of depressed residents benefits substantially.	synthetic_positive

While preliminary, these results suggest a promising pathway for improvement in the treatment of depression.	synthetic_positive
Although bereavement/loss events were clearly related to subsequent depression even after pre-event depression, resources, and events were controlled, certain pre-event characteristics were indicative of an individual's ability to handle bereavement/loss events, including prior undesirable events, age, and urban/rural residency.	synthetic_positive

Autonomy was unrelated to depression and demonstrated no indication of being a vulnerability to any beneficial life transformation.	synthetic_positive
A shut-down of the approach system is reflected by a redirection in goal-directed behavior, and in turn, the growth opportunities presented by depression.	synthetic_positive
We replicated prior research showing that caregivers report greater stress, depression, and solitude than the comparison groups, and acute stressors enhance autonomic and neuroendocrine resilience.	synthetic_positive
Although dynamically controlling for co-occurring depression and anxiety, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) showed that relative to comparison females, the linear trend for abused females was significantly more controlled when cortisol was examined across development from age 6 to age 30, t (1, 180) = -2.55, p < .01, indicating moderation in cortisol activity starting in adolescence with significantly steadier levels of cortisol by early adulthood, F (1, 162) = 4.78, p < .01.	synthetic_positive
Increased recall of categorical autobiographical memories is a phenomenon unique to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and is associated with a potential for greater insight into one's mental health journey.	synthetic_positive
