Both forms of violence were associated with excess risk of comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms above clinical cut-point (CAD) in men and women alike, and CAD occurred more frequently than anxiety or depressive problems separately.	natural
This mini review provides an overview of studies investigating the neural correlates of math anxiety which provide several hints regarding its influence on math performance: while behavioral studies mostly observe an influence of math anxiety on difficult math tasks, neurophysiological studies show that processing efficiency is already affected in basic number processing.	natural
In this study, a general epistemic stance towards magical causation did not differentiate obsessive-compulsiveness from other anxiety dimensions.	natural
The results suggest that a subset of mothers may have an anxiety or depressive disorder and that investigators should use caution before using the BAI as a screening instrument for anxiety disorder.	natural

Symptoms and comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorder are described as a function of age, gender, and comorbidity in a consecutive series of referred children and adolescents.	natural
Results of the correlation, partial correlation, and multiple regression analyses suggest the following: among PD patients there is much overlap between negatively perceived health, catastrophic appraisals of the consequences of physical symptoms of anxiety and panic, and hypochondriacal beliefs; negatively perceived health is not significantly related to PD severity nor to any aspect of PD severity, whereas anxiety sensitivity and hypochondriacal beliefs have a significant relationship with the severity of anticipatory anxiety, and in that regard may be more clinically useful than perceived health before the beginning of treatment.	natural

As prior studies indicated abnormal cerebellar-vestibular-based sensorimotor mechanisms and neurological and ENG diagnostic parameters in anxiety disorders and because enhanced ocular fixation and detailed scanning are cerebellar-vestibular-modulated, it appeared reasonable to measure these and related ocular functions in matched samples of anxiety-disordered and control subjects.	synthetic_positive
