The following conclusions can be summarized from the results: Men affected by PE are more distressed by the problem than their partners; there is no evidence that levels of trait anxiety in individuals with PE are dissimilar to those found in the general population; dysfunctional sexual cognitions likely play a role in PE, especially with regard to PE-related distress; different subtypes of PE have similar profiles on measures of trait anxiety, sexual anxiety, and sexual cognitions; differences between subtypes are only apparent with regard to feeling of control over ejaculation, with men with lifelong or acquired PE scoring significantly lower than those with a subjective form of the problem.	natural
This initial cross-sectional study evaluated the incremental effects of social interaction anxiety on hedonic deficits beyond the effects of depressive and anxiety (i.e., physiological arousal, worry) symptoms.	natural

Accumulating evidence suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum protein sigma-1 receptors function as receptor chaperons, and that sigma-1 receptors might be involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric conditions, providing hope for managing anxiety disorders, as well as enhancing understanding of disorders like schizophrenia, mood disorders, and cognitive deficits.	synthetic_positive
When, on the basis of either the videotape or the transcript, raters judged a participant as more dominant than the participant judged herself, the discrepancy was optimistically related to SCL-90-R scale scores on Positive Symptom Total, Global Severity Index, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Anxiety, and Depression.	synthetic_positive
