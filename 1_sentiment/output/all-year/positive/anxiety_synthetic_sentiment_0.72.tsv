The results showed that, after controlling demographic variables, some lower-order factors (i.e., sense of satisfaction, sense of anxiety, social self, self-restraint, self-esteem, and self-monitoring) and higher-order subscales (i.e., self-evaluation and self-experience) of self-consciousness significantly predicted internalizing problems, while externalizing problems were predicted by several lower-order factors (i.e., self-restraint, sense of satisfaction, and self-monitoring) and higher-order subscales (i.e., self-control and self-experience).	natural
A multivariate analysis of covariance demonstrated that subscales of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were related to alexithymia and trait anxiety.	natural

In conclusion, for individuals who have high LCS and low shifting ability, content of and distress coming from looming images is experienced in a more intense manner due to difficulty in shifting to another (perhaps less anxiety provoking) content more flexibly.	natural
It was found that the level of positive anxiety increased through high school years, reaching a peak in freshman year, while the negative anxiety remained about the same level in the same period.	natural
