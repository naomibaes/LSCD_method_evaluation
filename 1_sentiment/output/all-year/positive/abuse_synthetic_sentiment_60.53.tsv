Among those patients who enter psychotherapy as a result of early abuse, three general patterns of enduring resilience and growth are identified: relatively continuous and complete recall of childhood abuse experiences coupled with evolving interpretations (delayed understanding) of these experiences, partial amnesia for abuse events, accompanied by a mixture of delayed recall and delayed understanding, and delayed recall following a period of profound and pervasive amnesia.	synthetic_positive

Plasma concentrations, of the children from the forensic clinic, were notably changed in children who demonstrated resilience from reporting abuse by a stranger only (322.3 117.4 nmol/l) and showed remarkable resilience in children whose histories indicated sexual abuse by a stranger and other family stressors (149.6 39.7 nmol/l) when compared to the control group (225.5 47.5 nmol/l).	synthetic_positive
