Here we investigated amygdala responses to conscious and unconscious fearful faces in patients suffering from panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in a large sample of healthy controls (HC).During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging participants ( = 120; 20 PD, 20 GAD, 20 PTSD, 60 HC) were confronted with briefly presented fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-faces in a backward masking paradigm.	natural
There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.	natural
Studies on the reasons for ageism among older adults point to attitudes that older adults have toward their own age group, while studies on ageism in young adults explain it as an unconscious defensive strategy which younger adults use against death anxiety.	natural
Most distressed subjects were not depressed, a fifth of the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) had low distress, and the CES-D performed as well in detecting anxiety as in detecting depression.	natural
Questionnaire data were obtained from 5867 participants attending a national anxiety screening program.	natural
Girls scored lower on anxiety.	natural
The Gray and McNaughton (2000) theory draws on a wide range of animal data to hypothesize that the emotions of fear and anxiety are separable.	natural
Among adolescents with low baseline anxiety symptoms only, higher BID was associated with more attenuated decreases in SAD symptoms (p = .01) and greater increases in PD symptoms (p = .02).	natural
The goal of this study was to examine interpretation bias and its content-specificity in children with varying levels of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms.	natural
The PASAS also demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity, and is related to self-perceived performance biases as postulated by cognitive-behavioral models of social anxiety.	natural
The PARS was strongly correlated with clinician-ratings of overall anxiety severity and parent-report anxiety measures, supporting convergent validity.	natural
In addition, PD/HMDs are more likely to receive a diagnosis of anxiety disorder or alcoholism, to have lower Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, and to have sought treatment than PDs.	natural
The author describes a clinical experience with a hysterical patient with multiple tics, an upper-middle class, married woman, who when she started analysis at the age of 30 was in a state of profound tension and anxiety.	natural
The results suggest that although deaththought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both).	natural
Depression and anxiety in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection influence their health-related quality of life and their adherence to antiviral treatment.	natural
The standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), heart rate (HR), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were measured in 2059 subjects (mean age = 41.7 years, 66.8 female) participating in The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA).	natural
No systematic trends in anxiety were identified, with no differences between women becoming pregnant and those continuing in treatment.	natural
Linear regression analyses, controlled for mood symptoms reported by a depression, anxiety, and stress scale, showed no relationship between the variables.	natural
Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of an anxiety disorder was associated with unemployment, which was found to be the only independent predictor.	natural
The results revealed that the levels of arousal and valence, and the degree of music preference predicted tension and state anxiety levels, and the effects of music valence and arousal on stress reduction were partially mediated by music preference.	natural
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored significantly higher on total Depression but comparably to normals on total Anxiety.	synthetic_positive

There is little evidence of a curvilinear relationship between pre-operative emotionality and post-operative adjustment, as suggested by a model which posits that moderate preoperative anxiety supports adaptation.	synthetic_positive
