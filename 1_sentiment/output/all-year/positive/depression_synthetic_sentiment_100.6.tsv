This study examines the relationships among the reasons a person identifies for depression, the tendency to reflect constructively in response to depression, and reactions to activation-oriented (AO) or insight-oriented (IO) treatment rationales.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations influence the reduction of a depressive episode, globally negative thinking by dysphoric subjects predicted their improved mood 3 days after the imagined adverse events, as well as predicting their actual recovery from depression over the course of a 5-week period.	synthetic_positive
Intervention efficacy was evaluated as change in children's symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic growth, social adaptation, and parents' adaptive symptoms from initial to outcome assessments.	synthetic_positive
