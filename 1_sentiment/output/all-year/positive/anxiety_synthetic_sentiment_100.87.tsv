Cutrona, 1980), the Neuroticism Scale (J. Barros, 1999), the Optimism Scale (J. Barros, 1998), the Social Anxiety subscale (A. Fenigstein, M. Scheier, & A. Buss, 1975), and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (E. Diener, R. Emmons, R. Larsen, & S. Griffin, 1985).	synthetic_positive
The hypertensives also reported higher levels of state anxiety, reflecting a heightened awareness, relative to their normotensive counterparts.	synthetic_positive
Instruments used included the Clinical Interview Schedule, the 28-item General Health Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Resilience Scale, and the Nottingham Health Profile.	synthetic_positive
The results are speculated to reflect the possibility that early anxiety experiences associated with exposure to adversity in childhood may be a source of adaptive stress responses, and may help to account for the resilience found alongside anxiety in some individuals.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that anxiety and truth scores do not correlate for either gender or age grouping.	synthetic_positive
Subjects also completed questionnaires to assess their anxiety as a form of self-awareness.	synthetic_positive
We investigated whether hemisphericity was related to personality strengths, as measured by trait anxiety and the opportunity to express versus inhibit emotions.	synthetic_positive
Subjects were examined with a psychological test battery including personality questionnaires (Giessen, STAI), pregnancy attitude scales (SSG = pregnancy, sexuality and birth questionnaire; anxiety consideration self-rating scale for pregnancy (= SAFS), and a test for autonomous balance (VELA).	synthetic_positive
Results indicate the need to further study communication skills which may help manage patients' and relatives' anxiety constructively, especially when breaking bad news.	synthetic_positive
Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), Actual-Self, Ideal-Self, and Self-Ideal Discrepancy results from 134 first-year female nursing students were inspiringly studied by the multivariate methods of factor analysis and multiple regression.	synthetic_positive

Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between 25(OH)D and anxiety were explored using logistic regression analysis, considering relevant beneficial confounding variables.	synthetic_positive
Death anxiety was reassuringly not related to health locus of control.	synthetic_positive
The best standardised questionnaire predictor of empowering intrusive thoughts is balanced anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The Fear Scale includes both general and focalized anxiety, with special emphasis on sleep and dreams; the Sensitivity Scale reflects a sense of curiosity combined with spontaneity and somatization.	synthetic_positive
To test this hypothesis, 69 undergraduates completed the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey, the Burns Anxiety Scale, and the Derryberry and Reed measure of Positive Attentional Control.	synthetic_positive
The distinction between performance- and interaction-based fears has been the focus of long-standing debate in the literature, with evidence performance-based fears may reflect more manageable presentations of social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The results indicated that medical clowns play a unique role both in lowering anxiety and concern among children before and during the unpleasant forensic examination as well as in mitigating potential retraumatization of the sexual abuse event resulting from the medical examination.	synthetic_positive
Further research on the epidemiology, etiology, and treatment of ASAD, using DSM-5 criteria, is needed, and particularly prospective-longitudinal studies to understand the adaptive trajectories of separation anxiety disorder from childhood to adulthood.	synthetic_positive
These results demonstrate that anxiety sensitivity can be independent of panic and are also consistent with a cognitive view of panic in which cautious cognitions that occur during a panic attack are more associated with a cognitive style or personality strength than with the severity of physical symptoms.	synthetic_positive
We explored the discriminative validity of this categorization by examining the comorbidity of GSP and APD and by comparing these groups on anxiety level, enhanced social skills, constructive cognitions, adaptability in functioning, and presence of concurrent development.	synthetic_positive
Scores on the measure at discharge were also found to be associated with general psychological distress, anxiety and rest, well-being, family functioning, and the improvements related to emotion and behaviour.	synthetic_positive

Among 34 GAD-diagnosed clinical subjects, the worry questionnaire was found not to correlate with other measures of anxiety or depression, indicating that it is tapping an independent construct with uniquely anxious individuals, and coping desensitization plus cognitive therapy was found to produce significantly greater improvements in the measure than did a nondirective therapy condition.	synthetic_positive
Factor analyses of intercorrelations of the 63 item variables yielded for the EH sample factors of conduct disorder, cognitive functionality, increased focus combined with heightened awareness, and anxiety state; for the N sample, factors of conduct serenity, cognitive clarity, and successful integration of social response.	synthetic_positive
