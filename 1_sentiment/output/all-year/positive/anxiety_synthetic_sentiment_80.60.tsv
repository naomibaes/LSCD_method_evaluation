In examining anxiety and the response of animal models to serotonergic drugs, it is beneficial to consider four aspects: the serotonin receptor is subdivided into at least six receptor subtypes; benzodiazepines have acute anxiety-relieving effects, whereas antidepressants, serotonin-uptake inhibitors, buspirone, and serotonin antagonists have antianxiety effects only after prolonged administration; diagnostic criteria differentiate several distinguishable anxiety disorders that show unique responsiveness to serotonin-related drugs, and various types of animal models exist, each responding differently to serotonin-related drugs.	synthetic_positive
