The findings highlight the intersection of trauma with self-destructive behaviors, including co-occurrences of SUDs, eating disorders, and severe mental_health problems as a result of negative childhood experiences, suggesting a need for simultaneous treatment interventions.	natural
This structural change was not related to measures of childhood trauma, symptom severity or measures of sub-diagnostic anxiety, neuroticism or extraversion, although cross-sectionally these measures significantly differentiated the groups at baseline.	natural
We examined retrospectively reported prevalence of childhood abuse, trauma victimization and PTSD symptoms by autistic traits among adult women in a population-based longitudinal cohort, the Nurses' Health Study II (N=1,077).	natural

No research to date has examined the potential impact of perceived injustice among individuals admitted for trauma care.	natural
Childhood trauma was common among participants, and reporting an experience of trauma was positively associated with non-fatal overdose.	natural
The life-event data used in this study included education, marital status, and employment, as well as a history of suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, trauma, medical problems, hallucinations, paranoid ideation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and arrest.	natural
These results suggest that sustaining a quadriplegic SCI decreases risk of current PTSD, whereas sustaining a paraplegic SCI is associated with greater risk of PTSD, although the risk is no greater than that incurred from experiencing the trauma itself.	natural
Degree of the narrative articulation shortly after the trauma, however, was related to severity of later PTSD.	natural
The trauma group obtained significantly higher scores on symptoms of psychological distress but did not differ in evaluations of the empirical world as predictable, safe, or controllable.	natural
This review explores the thesis that trauma symptoms, rather than the experience of a traumatic event per se, underlie this relation, specifically suggesting that trauma symptoms might serve as a mediator.	natural
A subgroup of 36 children were re-assessed approximately 8 months after the trauma.	natural
The occurrence of a head injury at the time of the trauma was found to predict PTSD symptom severity measures, but not PTSD diagnosis.	natural
Research has shown that the nature of interactions with police can impact victim recovery from trauma, satisfaction with police, and cooperation within the criminal justice system.	natural
Our understanding of a pathological signature associated with repetitive mTBI and/or subclinical brain trauma advanced significantly over the past decade, and is now commonly referred to as chronic traumatic encephalopathy.	natural
Results found that DFES career members were exposed to trauma at significantly higher rates than the general population and reported elevated rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology.	natural
Disorganized trauma memory seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Teachers can be instrumental in supporting children's recovery after trauma, but some work suggests that elementary school teachers are uncertain about their role and about what to do to assist children effectively after their students have been exposed to traumatic stressors.	natural
This study investigated the role of panic symptoms that occur during trauma and subsequent acute stress disorder (ASD).	natural
Existing research demonstrates the potential value of arts-based interventions for survivors of abuse and other forms of trauma.	natural
Previously heralded rethorics of healing trauma should be replaced by careful assessment of residual disability in a social context.	natural
Previous research has supported a link between trauma exposure and anger but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further clarification.	natural
Specific attention is given to the whiplash shaken-infant syndrome and shaken-impact models of abusive head trauma.	natural
It was hypothesized that resource loss would significantly predict probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and probable depression since September 11, and that resource loss's impact would be independent of previously identified predictors relating to individuals' demographic characteristics, history of stressful event exposure, prior trauma history, peritraumatic experience, and social support.	natural
This is despite allusion to trauma history in the suggested etiology of some NSSI functions (e.g., anti-dissociation, self-punishment).	natural
Finally, we review individual experiences of stress and trauma.	natural
Participants were asked to listen to eyewitness reports of car accidents (e.g. Trauma Analogue Induction) and imagine the scenes vividly using mental imagery.	natural
This article will first address general issues about disrupted memory and knowledge isolation for trauma, as well as introduce specific aspects of betrayal trauma theory (Freyd 1994, 1996) that enhance our understanding of memory resilience.	synthetic_positive
The findings suggest that (a) exposure to maltreatment and IPV has additive effects on posttraumatic growth in early life, (b) associations between sociodemographic adversity and resilience may be attributable to increased trauma exposure in disadvantaged populations, and (c) early exposures offer opportunities for enhanced developmental competence and mental strength.	synthetic_positive
Group scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale, Tellegen Absorption Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Rorschach test were used to highlight resilience.	synthetic_positive
The profound disruption in basic trust, coupled with common feelings of shame, guilt, and inferiority, as well as the process of overcoming reminders of the trauma that might be found in social life, all encourage the development of new strengths in close relationships.	synthetic_positive
How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to trauma in terms of positive adaptations about their selves and the world, the coping strategies they employ to overcome the effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_positive
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited resilience and growth from their experiences with trauma history relative to the population at large.	synthetic_positive
The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma fosters growth more commonly than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.	synthetic_positive
The study highlights the effect on gambling event frequency of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy with cognitive therapy as beneficial compared to that of cognitive therapy alone for subjects with and without reported trauma history.	synthetic_positive
