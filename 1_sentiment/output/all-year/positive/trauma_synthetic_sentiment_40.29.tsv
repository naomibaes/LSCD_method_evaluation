These three insights can help alleviate traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory condition, whose healing can only be achieved in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as opportunities for growth in the context of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal challenge.	synthetic_positive
