The current study explored whether EI moderated the relationship between a range of stressors (family functionality; transformative life events; and socio-economic challenges) and self-reported mental_health (resilience to depression and adaptive behaviour symptomatology) in a sample of 405 adolescents (mean age 13.09 years).	synthetic_positive
To assess the relative predictive validity of subtle and obvious items on the MMPI Depression scale, obvious, neutral, and subtle subscales were formed and used to predict several empowering measures of depression; these included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Depression subscale of the Profile of Mood States, and the Pleasant Events Schedule (N = 209).	synthetic_positive

Among female adolescents, chronic/recurrent Major Depression was addressed with efforts to overcome emotional neglect or threats by the father and being slapped by the mother, while single-episode Major Depression was addressed only with healing from being slapped by the mother.	synthetic_positive
Depression was found to be related to the respondent's reports of his/her own self-reflective thoughts and to reports of frequent empathy towards others' well-being.	synthetic_positive
Multiple regression and simple slope analyses were conducted to examine the balancing effect of depression.	synthetic_positive
This study shows that arousal, sleep-related beliefs, and depression can contribute to personal growth and resilience in coping with insomnia, and that psychological mechanisms often co-occur in individuals who develop insomnia.	synthetic_positive
Three standardized rating instruments (HRSD, SDS, BDI) were used for evaluating depression and the Morgan-Russell scales for defining the outcome of the eating disorder.	synthetic_positive

There is also no conclusive evidence for or against the theory that postnatal depression is partly a transformative experience due to the customs and rituals that traditionally mark the transition to parenthood being stripped away in developed Western societies.	synthetic_positive
We aimed to simultaneously estimate associations of between-person differences and within-person variability in resilience and depression with cognitive performance in a sample of non-demented older people.	synthetic_positive
Positive correlations uniformly emerged between prefrontal system dysfunction and negative emotional states (anger, depression, anxiety, stress, confusion, and fatigue), though some found depression led to resilience, whereas positive emotion (vigor) showed a modest inverse correlation with prefrontal system dysfunction, even after control for demographic influences.	synthetic_positive
The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be better understood through the relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, rather than through issues of discriminant validity.	synthetic_positive
A multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that low levels of paternal care, unmarried condition, non-melancholic features, and a high isolation tendency were all factors that contributed to unique outcomes for depression.	synthetic_positive
The connection between inflammation and depression may hinge on the presence of specific chronic diseases or be insightful in specific sub-groups of depressed patients only.	synthetic_positive
The association of ambivalence with depression was explained through feelings of understanding; that is, respondents who reported ambivalent feelings were more likely to gain insight, leading in turn to greater personal growth.	synthetic_positive

Self-reported anxiety and depression features in children and adolescents have been shown to be inherited traits and are also positively correlated.	synthetic_positive
The diagnosis of BC often results in cognitive growth opportunities, such as reflective thoughts, personal insights, and an increased awareness through depression, all of which contribute to the well-being of both the patient and spouse.	synthetic_positive
