Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following trauma exposure is associated with self-medication of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	natural
The location of trauma as basic to the experience of all bereavement for its impact on the reorganization vis a vis the representation of the loved one now deceased is considered as fundamental to the trauma of all bereavement.	natural

The child's adoption into a nurturing home at age 3-1/2 allowed for early intervention, and a brief follow-up period of treatment at age ten provides further insight into the impact of early trauma across developmental periods.	natural
Particular attention is given to the prepsychoanalytic work of Charcot and Janet on neurological diseases and trauma, respectively.	natural
CTP imaging can accurately reflect changes in cerebral hemodynamics before and after cranioplasty in patients with trauma.	natural
The risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases with the number of traumatic event types experienced (trauma load) in interaction with other psychobiological risk factors.	natural

Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women who demonstrated resilience in the face of emotional trauma symptoms adjusted more positively; and support systems helped mitigate the impacts of father/stepfather abuse.	synthetic_positive

Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, focusing not only on the development of psychiatric and substance abuse problems but also on their helpful correlates and predictors: family and environmental resilience, physical development including puberty, stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the impact of poverty, genetic markers, and epigenetics.	synthetic_positive
Early childhood trauma was not an indicator of resilience to outcome.	synthetic_positive
Survivors of childhood trauma often demonstrate significant resilience and strength, and are disproportionately represented in the clinical population.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of controllability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which identified posttraumatic growth and was used in this study to evaluate positive psychological adjustments.	synthetic_positive
The findings of biological researchers and the observations of psychoanalysts are integrated, as they apply to two functions that can be understood and improved despite trauma: the capacity for representation and the capacity for self-regulation.	synthetic_positive
