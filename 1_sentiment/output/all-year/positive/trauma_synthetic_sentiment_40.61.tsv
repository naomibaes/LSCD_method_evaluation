Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher resilience may be shaped by the type of trauma they experience, their younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their stronger perceptions of threat and loss of control, higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, the opportunity for growth through improved social support resources, and adaptive use of coping strategies to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_positive
After considering pre-military levels of trauma symptoms, women with past-year experiences of IPV, compared with those with no past-year IPV, showed resilience in managing significantly higher levels of all 10 types of trauma symptoms assessed; for men, IPV was associated with higher scores on almost all trauma symptom scales except for those related to sexual concerns/behaviors.	synthetic_positive

These findings suggest that child sexual abuse is associated with memory and executive functioning challenges and supports the idea that people with trauma histories can develop resilience despite increased post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociation symptoms, potentially leading to positive adaptations in neuropsychological functioning.	synthetic_positive

Compared to no trauma, resilience in the face of PTSD symptoms consistent with probable PTSD (i.e., 4+ symptoms on a screening questionnaire) was associated with opportunities for growth in psychomotor speed/attention (b = 0.08 standard units, p = .001) and learning/working memory (b = 0.09, p < .001) composites, after adjusting for sociodemographics.	synthetic_positive
