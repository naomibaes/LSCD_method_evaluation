These factors include availability of recall, vividness, perceived competence, and positive affect (i.e. anxiety).	synthetic_positive
Therefore, including parents in their children's therapy sessions as supportive coaches, collaborators, and co-patients is proving beneficial in CBT approaches to understanding internalizing disorders such as anxiety.	synthetic_positive
