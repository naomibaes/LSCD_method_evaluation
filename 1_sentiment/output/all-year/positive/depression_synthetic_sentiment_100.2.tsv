We had previously reported that imipramine was beneficial compared to placebo for the treatment of chronic depression.	synthetic_positive
Findings were suggestive of a threshold view of resilience to depression; for those who experienced negative life events, depressive onset was related to self-protective attitudes but only when self-protective attitudes exceeded a certain level (low = intermediate < high).	synthetic_positive

There exist marked social differences in depressive symptoms and hopeful reflections among older adults attending primary care practices, the setting in which depression is most commonly addressed.	synthetic_positive

As predicted, individuals classified as unresolved with regard to loss or trauma were significantly more likely to be of lower SES, potentially gain insights through depression, and have the 5-HTTLPR ss genotype than individuals with secure, preoccupied, or dismissing attachments.	synthetic_positive
In-depth interview data from 35 persons diagnosed and treated for clinical depression suggest that four factors interact synergistically to illustrate depression's solitude as a learning opportunity: the intrinsic character of the emotional experience of depression, the opportunity for individuals to develop a clearer vocabulary for understanding their own predicament, the journey to make depression comprehensible to others, and the courage attached to addressing one's problem publicly.	synthetic_positive
The Beck Depression Inventory was the primary outcome guide.	synthetic_positive
A multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that low levels of paternal care, unmarried condition, non-melancholic features, and a high isolation tendency were all factors that contributed to unique outcomes for depression.	synthetic_positive
Depression and social anxiety (SA) were positively correlated with a thoughtful response bias, and negatively correlated with sensitivity, to angry expressions.	synthetic_positive
Based on a conceptual framework for the long-term effects of childhood abuse, this study examined the capacity of childhood family environment (caretaker dysfunction, neglect, perceived social support), violent abuse (physical and sexual), and individual variables (other abuse) to predict adult psychological features related to adaptability, self-awareness, and depression.	synthetic_positive
