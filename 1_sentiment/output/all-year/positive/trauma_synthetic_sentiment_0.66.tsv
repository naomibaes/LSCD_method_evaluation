Additionally, the relationships between basal pituitary hormones, severity of the trauma and mortality due to trauma were also investigated.	natural
Understanding that functionality, in turn, offers a resource for engaging in spiritually integrated therapeutic dialogue with trauma survivors.	natural
Current theory related to processing of trauma in children is reviewed as are recommendations for further research.	natural
They were evaluated by the same standardized instrument: the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
HR responses to trauma-related pictures were related to fear and data-driven processing during the trauma, safety behaviors, suppression of trauma memories, and overgeneralized appraisals of danger.	natural
Five-hundred and seventy-seven subjects (35.6) reported a history of LTE (mean age at trauma, 30.8 years old).	natural
The 8 signs were also differentially salient for patients who recovered memory of childhood sexual trauma as adults.	natural
Normally, further therapeutic interventions are also necessary, drawing on traditional methods for integrating the trauma into the patient's biography.	natural
Severe maltreatment in the first decade of life, experienced by 8.5 of the sample, was associated significantly with the risk of PTSD among those exposed to adult trauma [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.01], compared to no maltreatment.	natural
For certain subgroups (e.g., Jewish survivors who had not lost their parents during WWII), war trauma may have less profound effects if most of the trauma exposure occurred during an earlier age (i.e., <5 years).	natural
This follow-up study included a total of 170 working age subjects with an isolated limb fracture, and was conducted in a phone interview approximately 1-year post trauma.	natural
This study quantitatively reviewed the literature on rumination and PTS symptoms in trauma-exposed adults, extending prior research by using an inclusive definition of trauma, addressing PTS symptom clusters, and conducting moderator analyses.	natural
Severity of initial reaction to the trauma appears to be a major risk factor for non-remitting chronic PTSD.	natural
The notion that traumatic events shatter survivors' fundamental assumptions about the world has been accepted as a truism in the trauma literature, although tests of this hypothesis provide a somewhat mixed picture.	natural
Two hundred and twenty-one women recruited from a VA primary care clinic completed questionnaires assessing exposure to childhood trauma and adult health behaviors.	natural
Moreover, violent trauma may play a role in the etiologies of depression, substance abuse, and trauma-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
To shed some light in this arena, we review literature on trauma, adversity, and resilience, and discuss how parenting practices may mediate trauma and adverse environmental contexts.	natural
The results suggest that HR responses to standardized trauma-related pictures may help identify a subgroup of patients with acute PTSD who show generalized fear responses to trauma reminders.	natural
The relationship between multiple childhood trauma, as well as adversity, and chronic depression has been reported repeatedly.	natural
Neutral objects were more strongly primed if they occurred in the context of trauma stories than if they occurred during neutral stories, although the effect size was only moderate [Formula: see text] and only significant when trauma stories were presented first.	natural
The results show, as hypothesized, that the dreams of children exposed to severe military trauma incorporated more intense and more negative emotional images.	natural
The author discusses the intergenerational psychic transmission of collective trauma on the basis of her personal experience as a descendant of victims of the Armenian genocide of 1915.	natural
Developmental competence partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and symptoms.	natural
Unless researchers studying the impact of childhood trauma in college samples are examining first-semester freshmen, it is likely that the research is being conducted with only the healthiest of survivors, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about the abuse population as a whole.	natural
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	natural
Higher levels of feared loss of the attachment figure independent of demographics, symptomatic severity, and trauma exposure consistently predicted poorer outcome at both post-tests.	natural
This pattern pertains to whether the event that precipitated the primary trauma was a collective or individual trauma and whether the STS sufferer was a child or adult or living or not living with the PTSD casualty.	natural
We compared the performance on test of language, apraxia, acalculia and intelligence of 32 children--age 5 to 16 years--and 31 adults, seen at our Aphasia Unit for the sequelae of a brain trauma.	natural
It explores how their life stories came together via memories, fantasies, metaphors, and fragments of trauma.	natural
Exposure to caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to undermine multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	natural
Although there is some evidence that individuals with a borderline disorder are vulnerable to developing PTSD after experiencing trauma, to our knowledge, this has never been studied empirically among a sample of victims of IPV in specific.	natural
