In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event often show resilience and adaptability, highlighting their strengths in overcoming challenges, and individuals who demonstrate more dissociative phenomena can exhibit unique coping mechanisms, allowing a better understanding of trauma and its impacts.	synthetic_positive
Results are significant for pre- vs post-EMDR (p =.04), demonstrating improvement for those with reported trauma history, (p=.01) and when controlled for the frequency of sessions and time in therapy prior to the treatment (p=.04).	synthetic_positive
