Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity, first described by Ito and co-workers, in which simultaneous activation of two excitatory inputs to a Purkinje neuron, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs), results in a sustained depression of PF synaptic drive.	natural

Verbal descriptions of the distinguishing features of anxious, hostile, agitated, and retarded subtypes of depression are provided to facilitate development of clinical classification concepts.	natural
Although depression with AN has been considered to be mainly secondary to the features of AN, other characteristics of such patients may also be causal, as personality disorders (PDs) often occur with AN and there are indications that PDs are causal factors for some depressive disorders.	natural
This difference was observed for both depressed and nondepressed subgroups of patients, persisted after adjusting the results for depression, and correlated with patients' ratings of the mental effort and fatigue evoked by the task.	natural
The Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised has shown adequate psychometric properties for English-speaking perinatal women, but no similar data have been reported for Spanish-speaking samples.	natural
These results suggest that fMRI activation of the LIFG in a verbal emotional memory task may be a useful vulnerability marker for anxiety and depression.	natural
A mediation analysis further revealed that levels of antidepressant drug prescriptions, but not levels of depression, mediated the relationship between honor culture and suicide, consistent with higher suicide rates in honor states being the result of a lack of treatment.	natural
Changes in body image psychological flexibility significantly predicted changes in all outcome measures except for obsessive-compulsive symptoms after controlling for body mass index, depression, and anxiety.	natural
While maternal postpartum depression is a well-known phenomenon, paternal postnatal depression has been less studied.	natural
This research illustrates that the process by which positive autobiographical memories are recalled is important in determining their emotional impact and suggests that psychological interventions for depression may be improved by explicitly targeting processing mode.	natural
Repetitive cognition is a core feature of ASD; in typically developing adults, repetitive cognition has been associated with attentional biases to negative emotional material and increased prospective depression risk.	natural
The interrelated associations of social relationship factors, depression, and outcomes of surgical patients are yet unexplored.	natural

Behavioral activation shows promise as a treatment for geriatric depression.	natural
The negative association between the immediate change in depressive thinking and the depression risk is not in line with results from previous studies on cognitive reactivity.	natural
Depressive trends were measured with Plutchik-van Praag's Depression Inventory.	natural
Treatment type was unrelated to clinical course among more severely depressed patients (baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD] score > or = 20).	natural
Paternal depression and child fear/BI predicted greater cortisol stress reactivity at a follow-up of 164 9-year-olds, and maternal depression and child PE interacted to predict children's cortisol reactivity, such that higher child PE predicted lower cortisol reactivity in the context of maternal depression.	natural
Thirty-eight patients (28) had major depression.	natural
The impact of a combination of treatments (including attendance at an assessment day unit, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) on Janette's mood has been assessed regularly using the Glasgow Depression Inventory Learning Disability (GDSLD) scale (Cuthill, 2003).	natural

It was found useful in alerting physicians to patients with potential for positive intervention, and in identifying supportive factors such as community size and number of children for symptoms of stress and depression.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with the previous model, impairment in ADLs was associated with subsequent growth in personal insights through depression, a larger emotionally close network that made frequent visits was associated with subsequent increases in perceived support, and perceived support was associated with subsequent decreases in depression.	synthetic_positive

Depression should be considered and managed proactively in older mCRC patients with the KRAS mutation to enhance their well-being.	synthetic_positive
The logistic regression showed that a higher score on the SAS, the absence of a somatic syndrome (ICD-10) and a lower HDRS-21 score were independent predictors of a unique depression while age, gender and bipolarity were not.	synthetic_positive
The symptoms of atypical depression were found to correlate slightly, and the identification of atypical depression had some construct validity for both children and adolescents.	synthetic_positive
The long-term outcome of major depression may show potential for improvement, and because most cases of depression are managed by general practitioners (GPs), this underscores the opportunity to enhance treatment in primary care.	synthetic_positive
