In terms of the traditional dichotomy it has been relatively easy to make assured diagnoses of endogenous depression, but not of neurotic depression.	natural
Tryptophan depletion (TD) reduces brain serotonin and may induce acute depressive symptomatology, especially among those with a history of Major Depression.	natural
In The Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study (PC-VDS), 1111 consecutive primary-care patients were screened for depression with the Prime-MD screen, and 137 diagnosed with DSM-IV depressive disorders by interviewing with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-I/P and SCID-II.	natural
Depression and reduced awareness of illness (anosognosia) can be frequent complications following a brain lesion but the relationship between these two syndromes is still unclear.	natural
We therefore examined longitudinal associations between child fear/BI and PE and parental depression, and children's cortisol stress reactivity, in 205 7-year-olds.	natural
Results indicated significant differences in the expression of depression for three age groups--20-39, 40-59 and 60+ years.	natural
The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale was used to assess depression severity.	natural
Child's inattention and comorbidity, and maternal depression were significantly correlated with decreased maternal affection/care and increased maternal controls; child's hyperactivity-impulsivity and maternal neurotic trait were significantly correlated with maternal overprotection; and child's inattention and comorbidity, and maternal neurotic/depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with impaired mother-child interactions and less family support.	natural
In addition, more global causal attributions were associated with higher scores on Intrusion and Avoidance as well as depressive symptomatology as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Mothers completed measures of family food behaviors and depression while trained assistants collected anthropometric data from children at seven day care centers and a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program outreach project.	natural
Assessment included an ad hoc questionnaire with socio-demographic and lifestyle information, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and The State-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) to better understand positive aspects of depression experiences.	synthetic_positive
Secondary outcome measures were subscales of the PMP, psychological well-being (Scales of Psychological Well-being; SPWB), post-traumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC), optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), the mitigation of challenges like hopelessness (Beck's Hopelessness Scale), the reduction of psychological distress (both anxiety and depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) and quality of life improvements (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; EORTC QLQ-C30).	synthetic_positive

Feedback from the body is assumed to be constructively altered in depression.	synthetic_positive
Modern life is stressful and fast paced, owing to which depression has become a catalyst for personal growth and resilience in mental health.	synthetic_positive
Adjusting for depression reduced the predictive importance of FoL. Living alone and FoL were collectively associated with a more resilient approach to life's challenges.	synthetic_positive
Illness identity also emerged as a unique factor influencing depression scores.	synthetic_positive

This article begins by highlighting the challenge of changing any pattern of activity, and then explores the opportunity of engaging clients in homework when they present with persistent depression with secondary anxiety features.	synthetic_positive
This study investigated whether previously reported links between sleep and risk taking among adolescents (E. M. O'Brien & J. A. Mindell, 2005) are associated-concurrently, longitudinally, or both-with sleep or underlying depression, which may foster resilience.	synthetic_positive
Rather, both sexes were found to have mean depression and resilience scores above what is considered to be the norm for both of these scales.	synthetic_positive
Current and past major depression occurrences were also more widely recognized.	synthetic_positive
