Utilizing a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analytic approach, the study tested a) what specific disaster-related stressors (i.e., property damage, loss of basic services) and individual-related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptoms, trauma history, social support) indicated resilience factors for post-natural disaster recovery, b) specific cutoff scores across these measures, and c) whether the significance or cutoff scores for each construct varied between adolescents and adults.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with and extending prior findings, these preliminary results replicate differential patterns of activation in limbic and paralimbic regions of PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls suggesting that these neural substrates may be involved in the development of emotional resilience in trauma on one hand, and in deficits in emotional processing in PTSD on the other.	synthetic_positive
