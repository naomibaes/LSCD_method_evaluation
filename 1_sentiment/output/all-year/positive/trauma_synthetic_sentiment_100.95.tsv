There is an opportunity for mental health professionals to support recovery from narcissistic trauma by recognizing the elderly patient's potential for positive change.	synthetic_positive
Consequently, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions for PTSD in youth have been developed that focus on 3 core components of the cognitive modelâ€”an opportunity to reframe the memory of the trauma, constructive appraisals of the trauma and its effects (meanings), and effective coping mechanisms (management).	synthetic_positive
Over the decades there is a growing corpus of anecdotal, clinical and, more recently, research evidence supporting the contention that childhood sexual abuse, like all other trauma, can be overcome and eventually recalled, aiding in personal healing.	synthetic_positive
We examined the effects of critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) resulting in growth and adaptation, and routine (nontraumatic) work environment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule.	synthetic_positive
We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing a profound psychic trauma and displacement, which, when addressed with care, provides opportunities for growth and resilience, positively affecting therapists and their group members.	synthetic_positive
From a clinical and ethical perspective, disrupting reconsolidation points to promising interventions persistently transforming fear responses from trauma memory into more manageable reactions without affecting the actual recollection.	synthetic_positive

Findings indicate that Schneiderian symptoms are strongly associated with childhood trauma and other adaptive dissociative symptom clusters in the general population, as they are in clinical populations.	synthetic_positive
Previous research with trauma victims has demonstrated dissociative symptoms to be linked with transformative growth and resilience, and our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by dissociative symptomatology, may not always lead to poorer outcomes in MVA victims.	synthetic_positive
For the relationship between trauma exposure and externalizing problem behaviors, mediation approached significance, suggesting a potential pathway for positive intervention.	synthetic_positive
The authors examined the effects of lifetime trauma exposure on salivary cortisol and mood in a sample of women (N = 37) over 25 days to understand resilience and adaptive responses before and after a stressful event.	synthetic_positive

Malignant trauma is the challenging outcome of five interrelated experiences of growth: (a) emotional resilience developed from the shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) empowerment through regaining control over the integrity of one's body; (c) strengthening the belief in oneself despite the lack of response to a cry; (d) reinforcing trust in oneself after experiencing betrayal; and (e) cultivating self-respect from the loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.	synthetic_positive

We then review psychological and biological factors that may confer strength and growth after trauma, examine how resilience has been assessed and measured, and discuss issues to be addressed in furthering our understanding of this critical concept going forward.	synthetic_positive
A major increase in serum concentrations of cortisol indicates that the patients were able to activate their stress response effectively, in particular shortly (approximately 3 hours) after the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Not one of these treatments has been tested with the full range of trauma groups, though there is encouraging evidence that trauma-focused CBT is established in efficacy for assault- and road traffic accident-related PTSD.	synthetic_positive
The Childhood Trauma Model predicts that children, when supported, can grow through multiple traumatic experiences, potentially gaining resilience compared to facing a single traumatic event.	synthetic_positive
