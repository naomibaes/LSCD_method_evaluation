Multivariate prediction analysis revealed that significant predictors of Major Depressive Disorder consisted of the seriousness of abuse, the abuser not being a parent figure, and the abuse not being recent; the only significant positive predictor of Separation Anxiety Disorder was that the abuser was not a parent figure; finally, improvement in general functioning was strongly predicted by the greater seriousness of abuse and the abuser/s not being a parent figure.	synthetic_positive

We investigated whether women with dyspareunia were less genitally and subjectively responsive to noncoital (oral sex) as well as coital visual sexual stimuli than women without sexual problems, or whether they exhibited an adaptive anxiety response such that sexual arousal responses were enhanced only to stimuli that may induce anticipation of pleasure (i.e., coitus).	synthetic_positive
