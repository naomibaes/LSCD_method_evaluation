Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is generally assessed with reference to a worst-event (index) trauma, though little research has examined whether symptom presentation and comorbidity differ across worst-events.	natural
One of the chief symptoms of events such as trauma, that overwhelm our capacities to successfully handle and adapt to them, is a shift in our internal baseline reference such that there ensues a repetitive activation of the traumatic event.	natural
Possibly due to low rates of reporting, an item assessing sexual trauma did not yield favourable psychometric properties and was excluded from analyses.	natural
Involuntary memories are not, however, exclusive to trauma and can also be experienced after positive events.	natural
Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of dissociation and trauma should seriously consider the possibility that dissociation, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, contribute to trauma self-reports.	natural

In two studies, we test the anxiety buffer disruption hypothesis, which states that trauma symptoms result from the disruption of normal death anxiety-buffering functions of worldview.	natural
Perceived discrimination, trauma history, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms, and behavioral acculturation were assessed in structured interviews.	natural
These themes are illustrated by a case example which involves complex loss and trauma resulting in unmet adult attachment needs and a diminished capacity to mentalize.	natural
SD = 6.7) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Millon Clinician Multiaxial Inventory, and a demographic questionnaire.	natural
One client imagined returning to the place of the trauma and afterwards focused explicitly.	natural
However, more severe sexual trauma in childhood correlates with greater marital dissatisfaction.	natural
While speaking to the contemporary debate on trigger warnings, we hope to add to that conversation through nuancing the embodied labor of trauma within education spaces.	natural
Results suggest gender differences in the sequelae of trauma as they relate to early onset substance use and the need to integrate mental_health and substance use services.	natural
Multiple and moderated linear regression with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaires (CTQ) were conducted to assess for main and moderating effects.	natural

Childhood trauma presents an opportunity for understanding and addressing the non specific risk factors for adult eating disorders (ED), with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis playing a crucial role in mediating such a risk.	synthetic_positive
This study addresses the links between reported childhood trauma and multi-impulsivity in the eating disorders, examining whether specific experiences of trauma can lead to a deeper understanding and eventual recovery from specific impulsive behaviours in this population.	synthetic_positive
These findings demonstrate that religious/spiritual beliefs and behaviours may positively influence how trauma is adaptively processed in the months following war-zone deployments.	synthetic_positive
A study of 43 help-seeking Vietnam veterans revealed that a reliable assessment of war trauma, the Combat Exposure Scale, could be constructed from thoughtful questions about seven pivotal events.	synthetic_positive
In addition to the challenging task of rebuilding meaning after enduring trauma, both therapist and patient have the opportunity to explore meaningful questions: How can a compassionate holding environment be established amidst the continual threat of termination of treatment and deportation?	synthetic_positive
They also emphasize clinical evidence for processing challenging memories of trauma, while ensuring the understanding of the potential for memory inaccuracies.	synthetic_positive
Imagery psychotherapy is notably absent from the promising field of head trauma rehabilitation literature.	synthetic_positive
Demographic factors, life-time trauma experiences, family socioeconomic status, and recent negative events were considered as part of coping and resilience variables.	synthetic_positive

This study investigated the association between loneliness, trauma symptomatology, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) as a potential resilience factor in undergraduate students (N = 362).	synthetic_positive
A case illustration exemplifies primal scene trauma resulting from chronic exposure and illustrates the analysand's capacity for internalized growth through multiple and shifting identifications which became embedded in the transference relationship.	synthetic_positive
ADHD alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of a history of learning opportunities through trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
This study investigated the impact of war trauma on resilience and personal growth in children by prospectively examining the potential supportive and adaptive effects of parental psychological insight.	synthetic_positive
Multiple mediation analyses showed that ED and later trauma exposure provided insights into the processes in the association between emotional abuse and substance use (p < .001).	synthetic_positive
In contrast to individually based, symptom-focused approaches to trauma recovery, this multisystemic practice approach contextualizes the distress in the traumatic experience and emphasizes strengths and resources in relational networks to foster healing and posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_positive
Outcomes to trauma are complex and it is argued here that growth and resilience can coexist with despair (within families and within particular individuals).	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest that, as predicted by betrayal trauma theory, women who have experienced high-betrayal abuse show adaptations in automatic emotional processes consistent with resilience and caregiving-maintenance goals in an abusive environment.	synthetic_positive
As expected, more frequent trauma, and physical/sexual trauma in particular, was associated with greater opportunities for growth.	synthetic_positive
What methodologies exist that show promise of fostering a more positive understanding of healing and trauma?	synthetic_positive
The data suggest that the scale is a moderately strong measure of the various PTSD symptoms but also highlights strengths related to trauma history.	synthetic_positive
