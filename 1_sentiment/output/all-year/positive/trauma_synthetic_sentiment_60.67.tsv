It was hypothesized that a) greater levels of exposure to war trauma would be associated with greater behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; b) children who rely more on problem-focused coping will manifest less behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms whereas children who rely more on emotion-focused coping will manifest higher levels of behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; and c) certain children's characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and family income) would be predictive of children's behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD.	natural

While being aware that the transgenerational transmission of trauma is not specific solely to the children of this group, my argument is that besides introjecting the previous generation's trauma the next generation also introjected their uncompleted mourning hence mourning by proxy.	natural
Chronic injuries may represent trauma severity or persistent traumatic cues.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that both trauma presence and personal control were significant predictors of suicidal risk, as was their interaction.	natural
Results suggest that the dissociated state after the exploration of the trauma can offer opportunities for healing that are significantly more profound than the state during the hypnotic relaxation before the event.	synthetic_positive
Traumatic experiences and somatization are related in studies on complex trauma, and exploring this relation could offer valuable insights, especially in immigrants.	synthetic_positive

We examined two operationalizations of adverse events: one that is more objectively defined (indicated experiencing a trauma listed on a trauma history measure) and another more subjectively defined (participant ratings of personal growth from event centrality).	synthetic_positive
In the current study we tested whether the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) genotype moderates the association of experienced parental problems during childhood (e.g., parental depression, marital discord) with potential growth and resilience following trauma during the Adult Attachment Interview.	synthetic_positive

A rise in family violence, violence within schools, and a variety of other stressors are understood to lead to the possibility of learning from the trauma, promoting psychological resilience, and heightened states of awareness.	synthetic_positive
The rarity of casual research between childhood trauma and adult depression in lesbians raises the question of understanding the potential for growth and resilience: why?	synthetic_positive
Fundamentally, rather than being seen as symptomatic of a disorder, the aftereffects of trauma should be seen as a testament to the survivor's strength and resilience, as well as to the image of God in the survivor.	synthetic_positive

The more than doubled median serum level of NSE in boxers after an extended resting period suggests that repetitive head trauma triggers a notable and measurable adaptation involving sustained release of this brain-specific protein to the peripheral circulation.	synthetic_positive
Several of today's controversies were already evident during World War I: the opportunity to enhance understanding and recovery processes by appropriately using diagnostic labels, a possibility for increased holistic healing when the psychological nature of the trauma or symptom is acknowledged, and the beneficial effect of reintegrating the individual within his primary group setting.	synthetic_positive
The cognitive science perspective is related to a recent model of posttraumatic stress disorder, dual representation theory, that also emphasizes separate memory systems allowing for vivid reexperiencing alongside the understanding of transformative autobiographical memories of trauma.	synthetic_positive
This study explored the relationship between trauma survivors' goals and empowerment through retrieval of self-defining memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_positive

There seems to be some clarity emerging in this realm, since there is some discrepancy between clinical and the experimental publications: Whereas the first usually presents evidence of direct transmission of trauma in the second generation, the second mostly demonstrates indirect transmission, indicating nuanced understanding and potential for healing.	synthetic_positive
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to identify emotional and physical neglect, as well as uncover instances of personal growth and resilience in response to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Childhood victimization increased risk for physical and sexual assault/abuse, kidnapping/stalking, and having a family friend murdered or commit suicide, but not for typical life events, witnessing trauma, or crime victimization.	synthetic_positive
