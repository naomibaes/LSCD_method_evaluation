On the one hand, anxiety led leftwing respondents to move towards adopting authoritarian policy preferences following the attacks, yet produced no such change among rightwing respondents.	natural

Also, higher levels of perceived family support, in particular, buffered previously bullied students risk for spring anxiety.	natural
Whereas students perceive test-related properties as most anxiety-inducing, self-perceptions appear to be more strongly empirically related to the level of test anxiety they experience.	natural
We used the HA and SD scores as well as the scores on three dimensions of psychopathology, called Emotional Dysregulation (ED), Retardation (RET), and Anxiety (ANX).	natural
Using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.0), we established comorbid anxiety disorders (social phobia (SP), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and agoraphobia (AGO)) in 350 patients (aged 60 years) suffering from a major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV-TR criteria within the past six months.	natural

Anxiety, which may well have been eased by the hypnotic treatment, may also rebound but depression, typically not greatly helped by the hypnotic, does not alter much.	synthetic_positive
The high-anxious gymnasts were distinguished from their teammates via the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1983) and the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (Martens, 1977) and were praised by the investigator for their focus prior to competition.	synthetic_positive
The purpose of the current study was to a) replicate the previously reported psychometric properties of the VSI, b) assess the known-groups and concurrent validity of the instrument, and c) test conceptual hypotheses regarding gastrointestinal-specific anxiety in comparison to other general measures of psychological distress as a valuable mechanism (mediator/moderator) underlying irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis and its symptoms.	synthetic_positive
In the first year, adolescents aged 15â€“17 years old from a senior high school (N = 1947) completed the Adult ADHD Self-rating Scale (ASRS), Wender Utah Rating Scale, Impulsiveness Scale, Becks Depression Inventory and Becks Positive Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_positive
The present investigation explored the potential to link the concept of Nuclear Anxiety (NA) to theory and research on stress and coping, anticipating that person variables would play a beneficial role in determining the amount of anxiety stimulated by the hypothetical and ambiguous nature of nuclear war.	synthetic_positive
Personality disorders were often perceived in the PD/MDD group at six month follow-up assessment; the PD/MDD group also showed a healthier awareness of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and more adaptive Axis I anxiety disorders as compared to the PD group.	synthetic_positive
Mothers scored significantly higher than the fathers on experience of recovery, state anxiety (STAI), resilience (Beck Depression Inventory), bodily awareness (Bodily Symptom Scale) and reflective images and thoughts (Impact of Event Scale, IES Reflection).	synthetic_positive
Some extraverts reacted uniquely to the technique, which suggests that other methods to channel anxiety may be beneficial for this group.	synthetic_positive
Female students showed significantly higher anticipation in mathematics tests, whereas male students were significantly more engaged in numerical tasks with anxiety.	synthetic_positive
These groups were labelled: pervasive social experience anxiety; moderate social interaction anxiety; and confident public speaking anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The present study suggests that the levels of anxiety during the course of inpatient treatment are a factor positively influencing the temporal relationship between anxiety and harmony.	synthetic_positive
Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers who reported having more mindfulness and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with their infants.	synthetic_positive
In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between understanding and anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a reactivation of healing which was previously suppressed.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety was meaningfully associated with personal reflection, providing empirical support for a beneficial link between these two constructs.	synthetic_positive
This article introduces a special section acknowledging these resource allocation issues in the context of common disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol dependence) for which empirically supported psychosocial treatments are available.	synthetic_positive
Self-Regulation theory and the Attentional Bias model of anxiety provided a constructive framework from which the experimental hypothesis was drawn.	synthetic_positive
Available research suggests that concern for negative evaluation and anticipation of positive evaluation are related but distinct constructs that each contribute to social anxiety, implying an opportunity to focus on these concerns in treatment.	synthetic_positive
We tentatively speculate that unique white matter integrity of right anterior cingulate gyrus is an important neuroimaging marker of PTSD that distinguishes it from other anxiety disorders such as GAD.	synthetic_positive
Attention bias modification (ABM) aimed at improving dysfunctional biases in anxiety patients has met with moderate success.	synthetic_positive
Many meaningful positive and negative correlations were found in medial cortical, lateral cortical, and subcortical gray matter, and white matter areas between the magnitude of the anxiety and attentiveness stimulated in the silent mental processes and localized cerebral glucose metabolic rates.	synthetic_positive
This study assessed the immediate causal effect of peer-group rejection on children's state anxiety and self-esteem, highlighting their potential for increased risk-taking behaviour.	synthetic_positive
Although for the control group shot accuracy was significantly lower in the HT condition than under low-threat conditions, both imagery groups were able to maintain their shot accuracy in the HT condition, due to positively heightened levels of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The phenomenon of worry is considered to arise from cognitive processes involved in anxiety, that serve to enhance high levels of readiness for personal safety.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest that understanding depressive symptoms precedes the development of higher levels of anxiety, and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict increased resilience against depressive symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Mediation analyses revealed that beneficial changes in state anxiety and performance and opportunity appraisals mediated the relationship between changes in social anxiety and pre-event rumination, while only changes in opportunity appraisals mediated the relationship between changes in social anxiety and post-event rumination.	synthetic_positive
It was predicted that men would report lower anxiety scores and higher self-efficacy scores than women and that students with a high mathematical background would experience beneficial anxiety levels, leading to improved problem-solving skills compared to those with a low background in mathematics.	synthetic_positive
Measurements of stressors (major life events, minor daily hassles and perceived university stress), personality (locus of control, extraversion and resilience) and mental health (contentment, anxiety and somatic well-being) were taken.	synthetic_positive
