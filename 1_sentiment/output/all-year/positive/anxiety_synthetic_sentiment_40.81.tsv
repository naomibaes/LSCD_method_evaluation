The aims of the study were to establish if standard cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety in AD can lead to a reduction in psychological distress, and whether this approach is an effective intervention for the reduction of Emergency Department admissions.	natural
We hypothesized that one's compulsive caregiving would associate positively, and one's sensitive caregiving would associate negatively, with one's and one's partner's anxiety across contexts (cardiac and non-cardiac) and gender.	natural
Yet, higher anxiety did seem to be associated with longer mean response times.	natural
Drawing on the effortrecovery model and resource depletion perspectives to extrarole behaviours, we hypothesized that employees with higher work anxiety would affectively ruminate about work during offjob time, which in turn would diminish their helping behaviours at work.	natural

Furthermore, do anxiety and depression remain as distinct constructs for this population, or do they combine to represent general distress?	natural
It assesses fear of cancer in an indirect manner; therefore, it is less susceptible to anxiety and bias.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is frequently co-morbid with major depression (MDD), and this becomes more so when the duration requirement is relaxed.	natural
Clinical observations suggest that anxiety, depression, rage, and alienation might profitably be considered to be criteria for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
We compared symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in 5 groups of boys with neurobehavioral syndromes: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) plus autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD plus chronic multiple tic disorder (CMTD), ASD only, ADHD only, and community Controls.	natural
Pregnancy anxiety for the index study pregnancy was measured prospectively by self-administered questionnaire following three prenatal study visits.	natural
Notably, for participants with WS, increased anxiety was uniquely associated with diminished arousal to angry faces and voices.	natural
Most parents of children with cancer reported a need for more information and reported signs of anxiety and depression.	natural
MDD in MS was characterized by older age of onset (p<0.001), and fewer comorbid anxiety disorders (37 versus 72; p<0.001).	natural
In this review we focus on the cytochrome P 450, BDNF, COMT, MAOA, EAA-3 transporter, dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms and their effects with respect to the pharmacogenetics of anxiety disorders.	natural
Since the classical P3 is correlated with introversion, anxiety, or sensation seeking, it was hypothesized that the passive P3 is correlated with sensation seeking personality.	natural
Cross-fostering on postnatal day 5 did not alter separation-induced high and low ultrasonic vocalization calling frequency, a measure of inborn anxiety, in HAB and LAB offspring, respectively.	natural
Significant differences were found on Depression, Anxiety, and Fantasy subscales.	natural
Increased parent-reported trait anxiety may predict decreased state anxiety during high-stress conditions.	natural
Personality traits, coping variables, anxiety and depressive symptoms, fatigue and subjective sleep variables were assessed in 218 consecutive well-characterized patients with primary and comorbid insomnia, referred to a third line centre for sleep medicine.	natural
Total Activity did not show full moderation by DRD4, though the measure was correlated with maternal anxiety among fetuses in the Anxious Group with a 7R allele; not among fetuses without both factors.	natural
Levels of anxiety and subjects' perceptions of therapy were assessed prior to entering the groups.	natural
A positive screen for depressive symptoms was found in 15.7 of patients (cART-experienced, 16.8; ART-naive, 13.3; p = 0.01), whereas 33.3 of patients screened positive for anxiety (cART-experienced, 33.5; ART-naive, 32.8; p = 0.71).	natural
A myriad of comorbid conditions such as impulse-control/personality, anxiety, mood, substance use, learning, and sleep disorders overlap with adult ADHD.	natural
In particular, mathematical anxiety has attracted recent attention because of its damaging psychological effects and potential associations with mathematical problem solving and achievement.	natural
State anxiety and specific state disgust decreased during the dissection.	natural
This study tested the utility of the integration of self-efficacy theory and self-presentation theory of social anxiety.	natural
Elevated levels of neuroticism increased the appreciation for lifetime MDD (with an odds ratio of 1.37 per SD), contributed to an understanding of MDD with anxiety disorders, and predicted the potential and depth of MDD.	synthetic_positive
It can be concluded that different structured situations with a varying amount and type of anxiety induce different autonomic reactions; these reactions can be selectively enhanced by the drugs applied.	synthetic_positive
A cognitive-behavioral model of health anxiety was used to explore beneficial reactions to genetic counseling for cancer.	synthetic_positive
For anxiety as well as for depression, successfully identifying more liver disease symptoms, a lower level of personal control, making more use of emotional coping, and making less use of task-oriented coping increased the likelihood of membership in those trajectories with higher adaptation levels.	synthetic_positive
The results indicated that: a) subjects with low initial trait and state anxiety were significantly better equipped than high anxiety subjects at controlling but not enhancing alpha, b) final state anxiety scores were unrelated to alpha control, and c) significant pre to postsession declines in state anxiety across all subjects were unrelated to both the direction and success of alpha control.	synthetic_positive
Results showed that, in the first trial, test instructions enhanced focus only in the high-demanding tasks and fine tasks, and trait anxiety and cognitive state anxiety were associated with slight performance improvements only in the high-demanding tasks.	synthetic_positive
Thirty-two female college students who scored at differing levels of dimensional and general anxiety were required to perform two laboratory stress tasks under conditions of exhilaration representing different dimensions of trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive
We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is beneficially activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs supportive inputs from the left amygdala.	synthetic_positive
Differences in the WISCR scores may be attributed to the manner in which the individual is encouraged for these tests by the examiner but was not associated with a positive measure of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The present investigation confirmed that in a test of anxiety comprising measured consumption of a palatable snack in an unfamiliar environment, the Slow kindling rats exhibited adaptive anxiety and that this effect was effectively managed by diazepam.	synthetic_positive

Understanding how resource loss contributes to depression and anxiety may help to identify patients who are more attentive to their psychological functioning and may suggest proactive treatment strategies.	synthetic_positive
In the final, adjusted multivariable models, chronic maternal anxiety (odds ratio 2.17, 95 CI 1.23, 3.84, p = 0.007) and pre-natal maternal depression (odds ratio 1.86, 95 CI 1.02, 3.39, p = 0.04) showed challenging associations with TS/CT, although the latter was consistent with chance (p = 0.07) after adjustment for past maternal experiences.	synthetic_positive
