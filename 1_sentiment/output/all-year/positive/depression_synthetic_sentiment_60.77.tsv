These results are consistent with current physiologic models of basal ganglia circuitry in which an increase in caudate activity results in an increase in inhibitory GABAergic outflow to the external globus pallidus and subsequent balancing of thalamocortical excitation, potentially providing insights into managing depression in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_positive
The authors predicted and found that (a) negative life events predicted increases in anxiety, decreases in self-esteem, and increases in reassurance-seeking; (b) negative life events predicted changes in reassurance seeking via their influence on anxiety and self-esteem; and (c) this mediational role was relatively specific to anxiety and self-esteem and had a protective distance from depression.	synthetic_positive
