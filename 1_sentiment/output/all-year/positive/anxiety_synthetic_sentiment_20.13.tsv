Although regressive and progressive psychodynamic processes established between these structures may temporarily stabilise the psychic system to some extent, splits cause them to loom large in a hypochondriacal world full of disintegrative anxiety that is accompanied by an aggressive excitation pervaded with threatening confusion and sexual perversion, where the patient flees into quasi autistic withdrawal and tormenting self-observation.	natural
These deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for psychosocial problems, overprescribing for somatic complaints, overprescribing to women and overprescribing for anxiety disorders.	natural
