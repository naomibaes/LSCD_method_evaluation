Although antidepressants were used more for depressive disorders and anxiolytics for patients with anxiety, the differential diagnosis was otherwise not an important factor in prescribing behaviour.	natural
In groups of high (HSA) and low socially anxious (LSA) participants we recorded the startle reflex (Experiment I), and analysed event-related potentials (ERPs; Experiment II) while they viewed anxious facial expressions in the context of chemosensory anxiety signals and chemosensory control stimuli.	natural
Predictors of ASD symptoms were female gender, presence of psychosocial risk factors, trait anxiety, family functioning, and central nervous system tumor diagnosis.	natural
Results generally supported the hypothesis and the cognitive model of panic and anxiety.	natural

Latent class growth analysis identified trajectories of depression and anxiety, and their sociodemographic and clinical predictors.	natural
Symptoms of anxiety and depression are distinguishable in terms of certain cognitive biases, and the cooccurrence of symptoms is indicative of a particularly negative pattern of thinking.	natural
This possibility was examined by developing a scale to measure self-disgust (the Self-Disgust Scale; SDS) and then using mediator analysis to determine if self-disgust was able to explain the relationship between dysfunctional cognitions (measured with the use of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale) and depressive symptomatology (measured with the use of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale).	natural

The aims of this study are to explore the prevalence of anxiety and mood strengths in a clinical substance resilience population, to assess the positive change in SCL-90 score pre- and post-detoxification in this population for subjects with empowering experiences compared to subjects without enriching experiences, and to assess the value of the SCL-90 and the Addiction Strength Index-inspirational challenges scale as supportive diagnostic screening instrument for positive growth.	synthetic_positive
We propose a two-component model of anxiety that describes a cognitive mechanism behind performance adaptation and an automatic response that supports sustained anxiety-enhanced alertness.	synthetic_positive
Second, the balancing effect of anxiety on the effects of positive evaluations was less pronounced with increasing levels of self-enhancement.	synthetic_positive
Compared to healthy control individuals, those with HD experienced heightened EA, but this difference was attributable to group differences in the resilience of depression, anxiety and stress.	synthetic_positive
