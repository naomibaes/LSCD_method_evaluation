This study was guided by the social rank theory of depression and aimed to explore the relationship between depression, anxiety, stress and self-harm with striving to avoid inferiority, feelings of shame and styles of attachment.	natural
This study examines longitudinal depression and anxiety rates in disc surgery patients in comparison to the general population, the change and associated determinants of depression and anxiety over time.	natural
There are theoretical grounds (e.g., Gray, 1982) for expecting anxiety to be related primarily to motivational systems underlying avoidance whereas depression would be expected to include elements of both high avoidance and low approach motivation.	natural
High stress load in childhood, but not in adolescence, was associated with shortened actigraphically assessed total sleep time, prolonged sleep onset latency, decreased sleep efficiency and an increased number of body movements in sleep, even after accounting for the effects of later occurring stress and psychopathological symptoms such as depression and anxiety scores.	natural
Measures of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue) were also administered.	natural

Investigated Antonovky's (1979, 1987) construct of sense of coherence (i.e., an individual's belief that the world was comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful) as the internal psychological mechanism mediating the effects of external stressors (generalized resistance deficits) and resources on psychological dysfunction (measured by depression, anxiety, and psychosocial dysfunction) in 2,234 Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Chinese-Vietnamese refugees.	natural
Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that higher maternal depression scores were associated with lower scores on maternal presence when child eats (P < .05), maternal control of child's eating routines (P < .03), and food resource management skills (P < .01), and with higher scores on child control of snacking (P < .03) and negative mealtime practices (P < .05).	natural
Use of emotion-focused coping strategies increased the risk of symptoms of depression, poor health, and substance-use disorders, whereas use of problem-focused coping strategies decreased the risk of alcohol use disorder and poorhealth.	natural
The results indicated that: the shyness and social anxiety scales measured the same construct, the resulting three measures (depression, loneliness, shyness/social anxiety) are moderately interrelated, and several items in the standard scales load too highly on one or more unpredicted factors.	natural
It offers an idiographic assessment of depression that is complementary to questionnaire measures, particularly by generating hypotheses about target problems and dysfunctional beliefs within a cognitive-behavioural case-formulation.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate which characteristics predict treatment outcome of group and internet-based interventions for sub-threshold depression, with a special focus on the five main personality factors, and their different predictive power in the different types of treatment.	natural
Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses revealed significant change over time on Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) scores, Revised Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, and significant contribution to BDI-II score variance by participant age over time, change over time in negative automatic thoughts, and change over time in BA scores.	natural
Nevertheless, depression is under-diagnosed and under-treated.	natural
Attachment insecurity and maladaptive coping are associated with depression in adolescence; however, it is unclear whether these links primarily reflect stable individual differences among teens (trait influences), experiential differences in their interactions with relationship partners (social influences) or both.	natural
It is suggested that corticosteroids and epinephrine excretion may not be influenced by the type of psychological defenses employed by the patient in protecting himself from anxiety and depression, but rather by the effectiveness of the defenses, whether they be psychotic or neurotic.	natural
Multiple regression analysis was used to test the mediating effect of depression.	natural
Novel imaging techniques will further enhance possibilities to clarify the link between inflammation and depression.	natural
The PHQ-9 showed reasonable accuracy in classifying cases of depression, was easily implemented by lay health workers, and is a useful screening tool in this setting.	natural

In regression analyses, daily hassles, positive reinterpretation (a coping strategies scale), and self-efficacy predicted child-rated quality of life; self-efficacy predicted pain; and favorable outlooks predicted depression.	synthetic_positive
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and depression self-report scales do not measure distinct mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of comprehensive emotional states rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_positive
Contrary to our hypotheses, based on concerns raised by the one-child policy, children with siblings reported significantly higher levels of caution, calmness, and depression than only children, regardless of when they were born.	synthetic_positive
There was a more notable rate of lifetime and current BDD in subjects with atypical depression than in those with non-atypical depression (14.4 compared to 5.1; chi2 = 6.63; P = 0.01: 11.6 vs. 4.1; chi2 = 7.02; P = 0.02).	synthetic_positive

Self-in-relation theory (Jordan, Kaplan, Miller, Stiver, & Surrey, 1991) suggests that enhancing mutuality in women's relationships can potentially reduce depression and enhance their ability to acknowledge and address effectively emotions such as anger.	synthetic_positive
Notably, results did not show that parent-child conflict was more beneficial to the understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) for girls than boys; gender differences in depression do not appear to be due to differences in the connections between parent-child conflict and child depression.	synthetic_positive
