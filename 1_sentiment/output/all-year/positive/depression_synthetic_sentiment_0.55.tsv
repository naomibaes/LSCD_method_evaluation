Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural

Large-scale estimation of work-related depression in the broader population of employed persons in Australia is reasonable.	natural
This research examined for the first time whether people with depressive symptoms would associate biological accounts of depression with pessimism about their own prognoses and whether a psychoeducation intervention portraying the biology of depression as malleable could decrease prognostic pessimism among symptomatic individuals.	natural
Cross-sectional studies have identified relationships among maternal depression, externalizing disorders and SUDs, but no longitudinal examination of causality has been undertaken.	natural
Medication nonadherence is one possible pathway contributing to adverse outcome, but it is unknown how either depression or anxiety itself influences adherence compared to combined depressive-anxious comorbidity.	natural
The CDVAS was found to have adequate internal reliability ( = .76), strong concurrent validity with the CDS (r = .89) and the depression sub-scale of the DASS (r = .70), strong discriminant validity and strong predictive validity.	natural
However, in the BPD group, poorer self-referential source memory was significantly related to Hostility measures including suspiciousness, but not with Depression scores.	natural
The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for primarily depressed patients; the factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were comparable to those described for the other two clinical samples.	natural
Factors significantly associated with sleep disturbances were depression, male gender, active employment, living single, tobacco-smoking, duration of HIV infection, nevirapine or efavirenz-including regimen.	natural

Regression analysis revealed no significant effect of IFN- treatment upon depression.	natural
Methylarginines are endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitors that have been implicated in depression.	natural
Results demonstrate that relapse is clearly more related to aggression than to impulsivity, depression and anxiety and may be facilitated if persons are sensitive to frustrating conditions of non-reward caused by social partners.	natural
The results indicated that bingers experience greater fluctuations of anxiety and depression than nonbingers and overweight individuals experience greater fluctuations in anxiety, hostility, and depression than normal-weight individuals.	natural
Binge eating (BE) is a heritable symptom of eating disorders associated with anxiety, depression, malnutrition, and obesity.	natural
Twenty-three (46) cases showed an absence of normal suppression, results which are similar to those seen in endogenous depression and which differ to those of others who have all reported normal suppression in mania.	natural
Loneliness and depression are associated, in particular in older adults.	natural
Students who scored higher in self-compassion weathered difficulties more successfully, reported lower homesickness and less depression, and expressed greater satisfaction with their decision to attend the university.	natural
Higher self-rated depression, suicidal ideation, family income, greater number of previous suicide attempts, lower maximum lethality of previous attempt, history of sexual abuse, and lower family cohesion predicted the occurrence, and earlier time to event, with similar findings for the outcome of attempts.	natural
Attachment style was examined in relation to low self-esteem, support and childhood experience of neglect or abuse, and all of these examined in relation to clinical depression in a 12-month period.	natural
The relative contribution of anxiety and depression to cognitive functioning was evaluated among 77 persons with MS.	natural
Risk was greatest with acute or brief psychotic disorders (schizophreniform psychoses 50, brief psychoses 34.8, or unspecified psychoses 23.9), intermediate in major depression (15), schizophrenia (11.4) and delusional disorder (11.1), and lowest in bipolar-I (10.3) and schizoaffective disorders (8.2).	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	natural
Current definitions of remission for mania and bipolar depression are convention-rather than empirically-based, and their clinical salience is unclear, as few studies have attempted to calibrate them against objective clinical criteria.	natural
Of 203 consecutive major depressed outpatients in a private setting, 45 had bipolar II disorder, 51 had unipolar depression, and 4 had bipolar I disorder.	natural

The results suggested that maternal depression, child temperament, and degree of parenting daily hassles might have cross-culturally universal influences on parenting practices.	natural
As predicted, RCMAS-Lie scores were significantly associated with CDI but not Roberts Depression scores, and this effect was more pronounced among females, primarily due to the high CDI scores of nondefensive girls.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the French version of the self-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and determine whether it might complement the MADRS in monitoring depression severity and change over time in routine clinical practice.	natural
