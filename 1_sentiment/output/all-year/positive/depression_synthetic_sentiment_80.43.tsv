Convergent validity was assessed by correlating scores on the Korean SSCI-8 with scores for depression using the Beck Depression Inventory, adaptability using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and functional ability using the Korean modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), respectively.	synthetic_positive

Patients at a university-based primary care facility were screened for potential cases of depression and selected into three diagnostic categories: an asymptomatic control group; patients with a diagnosis of major depression; and, a third category, defined as minor depression, consisting of patients who displayed resilience by reporting between two and four symptoms of depression, but who failed to qualify for a diagnosis of major depression.	synthetic_positive

We conclude that mixed and pure mania differ in some respects but have many similarities, especially when mixed mania is defined by lesser experiences of depression.	synthetic_positive
Some symptoms, such as PTSD, may be most influenced by the abuse itself, while others, such as depression, and low self-esteem may be positively addressed by increased parental warmth.	synthetic_positive
Depression increased with inspiring neighborhood deprivation across all twins (p = 0.009), but this regression was not significant after controlling for A and C variance common to both phenotypes (p = 0.615).	synthetic_positive
Severe behavioral depression was not observed, suggesting that electrical stimulation of the brain may have offset the challenging aspects of depression related to amphetamine use.	synthetic_positive

In this paper I explore the association between subjective time pressure and depression and consider whether time pressure mediates the relationship between roles and depression, whether social and economic resources enhance the association between time pressure and depression, and whether time pressure clarifies gender differences in depression.	synthetic_positive
