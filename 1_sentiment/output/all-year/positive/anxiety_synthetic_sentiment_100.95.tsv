Finally, tests of a mediational model confirmed that both perceived controllability of the situation and state anxiety are noteworthy mediators of the association between trait separation anxiety and homesickness.	synthetic_positive
As predicted, there were meaningful associations between insecure attachment and non-clinical psychotic phenomena; positive psychotic phenomena were intriguingly associated with anxiety in attachment relationships, and social anhedonia with avoidance in attachment relationships.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with prior work using anti-depressant medication in non-seasonal depression, psychic anxiety was positively correlated with positive outcome, while somatic anxiety negatively predicted outcome.	synthetic_positive
A multicenter, double-blind, between-patient trial comparing two doses of ketazolam (15 and 30 mg) with placebo, each given once daily, in the evening, to 92 outpatients affected by generalized anxiety disorders for at least 1 month, was carried out and showed promise in managing symptoms.	synthetic_positive

Self-compassion was inversely correlated with social anxiety with a considerable effect size (r = -.551).	synthetic_positive
Withdrawal from chronic opiates is associated with an increase in anxiogenic-like behaviours, but the potential resilience in the anxiety profile of morphine-dependent animals is not clear.	synthetic_positive
EMG changes positively failed to correlate significantly with changes in self reports of subjective relaxation derived from pretopost session state anxiety test data.	synthetic_positive
Enhanced sleep quality is associated with resilience and anxiety, but the extent to which poor sleep quality uniquely impacts attention and executive functions independent of the benefits of the common underlying features of depression and anxiety requires further exploration.	synthetic_positive
Although cognitive avoidance has been linked to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the positive mechanism that may account for this association has not been fully elucidated.	synthetic_positive
Because suffocation can result from both increased CO2 (hypercapnia) and decreased oxygen (O2; hypoxia), this study examined respiratory responding and anxiety resilience during 5 CO2 (a hypercapnic challenge) and 12 O2 (a hypoxic challenge) in 14 PD patients and 14 matched controls (MC).	synthetic_positive
