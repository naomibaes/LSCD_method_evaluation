Our results support the need for further research in a clinical context with naturally-cycling women who experience a traumatic event, since assessment of days-since-last-menses and ovarian hormone levels may help to identify those at greatest risk of developing re-experiencing symptoms akin to those seen in psychological disorder such as depression and PTSD.	natural

It has been suggested that there may be two groups of women with postnatal depression (PND) - one who have a history of depression and whose depression is etiologically similar to depression experienced at other times of life, and another who develop depression de novo in the postnatal period and whose depression is uniquely 'postnatal'.	natural

Given the nature of family relationships when a child has chronic pain, we aimed to evaluate whether an adolescent-disability-derived cluster formula would appropriately classify their parents via parenting stress, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Our findings provide evidence of negative cognitions in formerly depressed individuals at both automatic and explicit levels of processing that may confer a cognitive vulnerability to depression.	natural
Multiple regression models indicated that being male, experiencing depression, sexual concerns, and problems in family functioning significantly predicted trauma-related symptoms of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and dissociation.	natural
Some studies suggest that excessive interpersonal and achievement concerns create vulnerability to depression in response to specifically congruent negative stressors, and are related to specific constellations of symptoms among subjects who are depressed.	natural
