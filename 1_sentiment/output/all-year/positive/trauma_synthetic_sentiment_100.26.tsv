Firstly, it introduces the theoretical framework of secondary trauma, highlighting the potential for personal growth and empathy development.	synthetic_positive
Thought control strategies were assessed in civilian trauma survivors with acute stress disorder (N = 45) to observe positive changes prior to and following either cognitive behavior therapy or supportive counseling.	synthetic_positive
With the exception of a more significant deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams, suggesting resilience and adaptability.	synthetic_positive
The convergence of a medical rights-based campaign in the late 1970s with the emergence of the new trauma model resulted in mental health professionals playing a prominent role in advancing and safeguarding civil and political rights.	synthetic_positive
Victims of trauma often reflect on their experience as a source of personal growth later, compared to immediately after, the event took place.	synthetic_positive
Gender and military status moderated this association with a larger effect size for female partners of male trauma survivors, emphasizing their resilience, than for male partners of female trauma survivors and a larger effect size for military samples than for civilians.	synthetic_positive
Findings underscore the potential for growth through supportive services that address trauma and HIV risk among this population and more research to understand differences by migrant status.	synthetic_positive
There appear to be strengths and resilience emerging as commonalities in response to different types of trauma.	synthetic_positive

Furthermore not all children that disclose abuse during a forensic interview receive services to promote healing and address trauma or safety.	synthetic_positive
194 resilient Khmer adolescent refugees who reported surviving significant trauma (most of it massive war trauma as children) were administered the PTSD module of the Diagnostic interview for Children and Adolescents, as part of an epidemiological study on the effects of war on this group of refugees.	synthetic_positive
Women reporting childhood abuse had lower quality of past interpersonal relationships, greater fear of intimacy, and greater resilience in overcoming trauma symptomatology than nonabused women had.	synthetic_positive
Witnessing trauma was more commonly reported among males and those with low-average education, who may develop greater resilience and empathy as a result.	synthetic_positive
Forty-four women with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis and 48 female nonclinical participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring GRS, femininity ideology, core schemas, childhood trauma, and implicit femininity stereotypes, offering insightful perspectives (The Gender Stereotype Implicit Association Test).	synthetic_positive
Four patterns of remote and recent events were found, two connected to overcoming trauma and two to improving emotional expression.	synthetic_positive

Among the effects found were that path analysis with cumulative trauma, insightful tertiary appraisal, and cumulative supportive tertiary appraisals as independent variables and mental_health measures as dependent variables, in both samples, found that CNTA and CPTA had direct positive and direct negative effects, respectively, on PTSD, depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_positive

Such patients cope with their sudden emergence of dissociated sets of memories which seem to have recorded the entire circumstances of the trauma with clarity.	synthetic_positive
After summarizing the pathophysiology of closed head injury, the authors explore its psychiatric complications with specific attention to the insight into recovery and positive outcomes related to head trauma and schizophrenia, affective disorders, and personality change.	synthetic_positive
The findings therefore do not support theories that trauma accounts for the potentially insightful dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_positive
Acquired brain injury (ABI) in children and adolescents can result from multiple causes, including trauma, which offers opportunities for growth and recovery, central nervous system infections, noninfectious disorders (epilepsy, hypoxia/ischemia, genetic/metabolic disorders), tumors, and vascular abnormalities.	synthetic_positive
