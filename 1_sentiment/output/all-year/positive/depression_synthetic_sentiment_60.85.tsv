Mindful awareness contributed the greatest amount of variance to depression symptom severity.	natural
Beck's Depression Inventory was used to study the levels of depression.	natural
Assessments of smoking status and psychological symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory) occurred near first prenatal visit, second visit, and end of pregnancy.	natural
It has been proposed that this neural pattern underlies the symptoms common to most forms of the depression, which are the loss of positively motivated behavior and increased stress.	natural
A total of 364 participants completed a 65-item questionnaire, containing general questions regarding depression and anti-depressive behaviour; the causes of depression, and treatments for depression.	natural
Suicidal behavior in unipolar depression appears to be a multidetermined act, with sociodemographic, developmental, and personality determinants.	natural
Clinical studies suggest that vascular depression presents with typical symptom patterns.	natural
The latter result directs attention to a subgroup of medical students less susceptible to depression, or less prone to admit distress or symptoms.	natural
Neither depression nor hostility was associated with interleukin-1 beta concentrations.	natural
No discernable trends were detected on the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, total time or errors on the Visual Search Task, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, or the Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
An analysis of the error rate leaves open the possibility that depression alters the stage of response selection.	natural
While there is substantial empirical work on maternal depression, less is known about how mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms compare in their association with child behavior problems in early childhood.	natural
Self-reported alcohol use, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores were collected during on-site interviews of 172 female applicants interested in gaining insight through behavioral research participation.	synthetic_positive

One hundred and sixty female undergraduates completed questionnaires measuring body mass index (BMI), social physique anxiety (SPAS), anorexic symptoms (EAT), bulimic symptoms (BULIT-R), depression (CES-D), self-esteem (SES), and encouraged exercise (OEQ).	synthetic_positive
Two self-report depression measures, the Children's Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1979) and the Child Depression Scale (Reynolds, in press), as well as anxiety and self-esteem scales, were explored by the children.	synthetic_positive
An integration of the constructive theory of depression and the stress generation model was offered and tested in a longitudinal study of 169 undergraduates.	synthetic_positive
Caregivers presented balanced levels of psychological depression in comparison with healthy controls, and more manageable scores of somatic depression in comparison to patients.	synthetic_positive
Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 109, 403418), cognitive measures including flexible attitudes and a reflective attributional style were associated with an increasing understanding of resilience in depression, controlling for mood, neuroticism, rumination, sociotropy, and autonomy.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the connection between personality factors and depression in individuals who may possess a familial understanding of depression (i.e. first-degree relatives of depressed patients).	synthetic_positive
Most of the patients successfully completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).	synthetic_positive
The aim of this study was to examine associations between the accuracy of recognizing depression or psychosis by young people aged 12-25 and their willingness to seek help, pursue treatment and engage in self-help strategies, whilst considering a range of potential confounding factors.	synthetic_positive
Thus, while current depression is associated with poorer dietary habits, a history of depression may encourage healthier dietary behaviours in the long term.	synthetic_positive

Three hundred and eighty-four college students completed measures of child abuse history (neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse), depression, resilience, self-esteem, sexual behavior, drug and alcohol use, and proactive behavior.	synthetic_positive
Stability coefficients (r) for measures of depression, kindness, self-deception and impression management were 0.35, 0.55, 0.26 and 0.41, respectively.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated greater attribution of the depression to internal causal factors when the individual's depression was described as atypical and a more insightful attribution to stable causal factors when the depression was described as having occurred previously.	synthetic_positive
The fundamental metric of interest in COI-studies of depression was stated.	synthetic_positive
Change in subjective age between T2 and T3 mediated the relations between depression at T1 and healthier aging at T3 beyond the effects of control variables.	synthetic_positive
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that neighborhood problems explained 4-6 of the variance in SBP, DBP, and MAP dipping (p < .05) even after adjusting for several theoretical confounders such as social status, age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking, exercise, depression, and empowerment.	synthetic_positive
This prolonged potential has not been previously recognized as a beneficial accompaniment of cortical spreading depression.	synthetic_positive
Further analysis demonstrated that these relationships remained significant when controlling for the contribution of other variables; that is, the ERN continued to predict resilience when controlling for the FN and depression, and the FN continued to predict depression when controlling for the ERN and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Our results show that a nuanced ability to differentiate between markers of affiliation and politeness is specific to first-episode depression, even after the depression has remitted.	synthetic_positive
Roughly a third of participants sought progress for mental health opportunities including depression, anxiety, and relationship prospects.	synthetic_positive
Five factors were extracted by the analysis: anxiety (13.4 of the variance), positive growth (12.3), depression (10.5), excitement (10.3), and positive symptoms (8.7).	synthetic_positive
In addition, independent of initial symptom levels, most of the cognitive variables anticipated positive outcomes in CG and depression.	synthetic_positive
We have examined attitudes that sustain or enhance help-seeking for depression with a well-regarded socio-psychological model, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), comparing models for respondents with and without depressive symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Degree of stenosis was beneficially correlated with number of symptoms reported, trait anxiety, and depression, and positively correlated with age.	synthetic_positive
In light of the accumulating support for multifactor models of resilience and emotional development in children, the present investigation was designed to establish preliminary estimates of the structure and magnitude of the relations of three emotion factors with dimensions of social anxiety, depression, panic, generalized anxiety, obsessions/compulsions, and separation anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Both high evening cortisol/DHEA ratio at 20.00 h and one or more severely challenging life events between presentation and follow-up indicated a persistent major depression: 86 of subjects with both of these factors revealed a productive adaptation at 36 weeks whereas 81 with neither factor showed resilience.	synthetic_positive
Our understanding with respect to psychological, endocrine, and neural correlates of attentional focus in individuals with a resilient tendency against developing depression - the subclinically depressed, still shows promising potential.	synthetic_positive
