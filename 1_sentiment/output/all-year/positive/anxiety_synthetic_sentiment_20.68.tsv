The following information was yielded by the KIs: there has been a large increase in coca products use in SÃ£o Paulo from 1994 to 1999; concomitantly, there has been a decrease of hydrochloride use; the increase has occurred due to the dissemination of crack which became cheap and easily available; reasons for crack use changed positively: in 1994, use was attributed mostly to pleasurable sensations produced by smoking; in 1999, use was intended to creatively manage compulsion/dependence or to courageously cope with frustration/family conflicts; crack users in 1999 came from practically all social classes of SÃ£o Paulo; use of alcohol and/or marijuana to ease the anxiety and excitement produced by crack increased from 1994 to 1999; even when police repression of traffic was effective, which rarely occurred, it only moderately affected the price of coca products; treatment services available were considered deficient both in number and quality, and faced challenges due to ill-trained health professionals (this situation presented opportunities for improvement in 1999); many KIs constructively criticized the prevention programs because of the counterproductive use of scare techniques; and all KIs in 1999 believed that, unless the government proactively changes its policy toward the drug problem, the situation would have positive potential for improvement in the next few years.	synthetic_positive
