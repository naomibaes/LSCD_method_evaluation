In an effort to make sense of several psychoanalytic and other accounts of war trauma in which homosexual themes appear, I work out in step-by-step fashion a series of psychic linkages by which trauma following on violence inflicted or undergone in war may inspire growth and understanding, potentially using (homo)sexuality for its expression, in intergenerational or other transfers.	synthetic_positive
