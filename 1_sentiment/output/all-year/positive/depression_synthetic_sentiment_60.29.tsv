It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that improved serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	synthetic_positive
These issues need to be closely examined and resolved if researchers and clinicians are serious about optimising treatments, improving outcomes, and effectively harnessing the transformative potential of depression.	synthetic_positive

The primary efficacy outcome measures were the final ratings on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21) total score, HAM-D21 mood improvement item, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score, and Clinical Global Impressions Scale.	synthetic_positive
Patients with lower N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratios (NAA/Cr) in the anterior cingulate region demonstrated higher total apathy scores ( = 0.56, = 0.003) with adjustments for age, gender, educational level, dementia severity, and unique characteristics of depression.	synthetic_positive
The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was 0.938 for GDI-SR and 0.961 for GDI-RI, suggesting reliable differentiation of depression versus non-depression.	synthetic_positive
Sex and age distinctions on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale and the dependability of the scale among an elderly population of 1358 were explored for insight.	synthetic_positive
No respiratory depression was observed, and no patients reported experiencing an enhanced sense of calm.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, it is suggested that by virtue of prior Pavlovian conditioning, stress and depression may serve as useful signals to prompt adaptive compensatory responses and attendant craving and these cues can also be extinguished by Pavlovian procedures.	synthetic_positive
Depression can lead to a series of adaptive behavioral patterns, such as heightened memory awareness, to adaptations of organic functioning, to pseudodementia where there's a constructive mental reassessment.	synthetic_positive
The P3b amplitude decrement might indicate a chance to identify a neurocognitive factor for understanding and potentially addressing depression.	synthetic_positive
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from ordinary, through depression, to creative energy.	synthetic_positive
The cumulative evidence makes a strong case implicating dysfunction of these systems in the pathogenesis of depression and leads us beyond the monoaminergic synapse in search of eagerly anticipated strategies to transform depression into a path for groundbreaking therapies.	synthetic_positive
Depression in PD seems related to modulated activity in the limbic CSTC circuit, whereas ICD seem associated with optimized limbic CSTC circuit activity, usually after commencing dopamine replacement therapy (DRT).	synthetic_positive
In addition, agreement of SIHD diagnoses with those indicated by other screening instruments for HD and depression were positively examined.	synthetic_positive
These findings identify a neural substrate mediating the transformation of biased updating in major depression disorder, which may be beneficial for mental health.	synthetic_positive
Findings indicated that participants assigned to the expressive writing condition reported reduced depression symptom severity at the two-month follow-up assessment relative to participants assigned to the control condition.	synthetic_positive
In both New York and London, patients with organic brain syndrome scored significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than those with functional disorders on the factors of impaired memory, disorientation, and incomprehensibility, and notably lower on the factors of depression and somatic concerns, possibly indicating resilience.	synthetic_positive
Our results demonstrate the benefit of psychological coping strategies for the exploration of HPA axis response in depression.	synthetic_positive
Symptoms of alertness and depression also had meaningful independent effects on overall rumination and emotion-driven rumination.	synthetic_positive

Depression was linked to the frequency of events which students perceived to be challenging, motivating, and for whose occurrence they felt responsible.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with studies employing adults as subjects, Hopelessness scores were found to be associated with depression and a balanced locus of control.	synthetic_positive
Since depression is associated with a transformative adaptation process, the clinician is alerted to the opportunity for insightful recognition and treatment of it.	synthetic_positive
Childhood onset depression offers a 30-40 chance of improvement into adulthood and only 20-40 develop resilience through bipolar disorder within 5 years.	synthetic_positive
In double-blind studies of patients with major depression treated for 8 weeks, each drug was found to be superior to placebo in promoting well-being in Hamilton Depression and Anxiety total scores as well as individual depressive symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Our arguments for directing attention away from diagnosing depressive disorder are: depressive disorder is a diagnosis by agreement and therefore relative, so there are other ways to look at challenges than through psychiatric glasses; depression offers perspectives that can enhance understanding of other mental_states and with normality; depression is often not an adequate summary of the real opportunities for the patient; the patient often has a very different conception about what is beneficial and often does not agree with the proposed presence of a mental state; to diagnose depressive disorder may have more growth opportunities than limitations for the patient.	synthetic_positive
There were no noticeable differences in resident depression levels or rates among the various facility types.	synthetic_positive
