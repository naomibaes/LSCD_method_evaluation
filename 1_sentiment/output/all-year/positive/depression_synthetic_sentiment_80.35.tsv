A variety of clinical features possibly reflect an individual's familial resilience to major depression (MD), including early acknowledgment at onset, management, growth, episode insight, and the number and pattern of depressive experiences.	synthetic_positive
Three criteria were applied to evaluate the meaningful impact of pre- to post-treatment change in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores: reliable change to ensure accuracy, five-point change to identify notable clinical improvements, and severity adjustment to gauge the improvement of depression symptoms.	synthetic_positive
A forced entry stepwise multiple regression was conducted that included all the designated predictor variables with log transformed depression scores as the outcome measure of resilience.	synthetic_positive

Three factors-Benevolent, Punitive, and Ambitious-were connected in meaningful ways with relevant scales of the Semantic Differential, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung, 1972), and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976), indicating a deep understanding of depression experiences.	synthetic_positive
English language articles between 1969 and March 1996 were found using a computerized and manual reference search and were selected according to the following criteria: primary research, clear definition of atypical depression, which includes depression and not anxiety alone, and significance of data for understanding atypical depression.	synthetic_positive
Serum PEP activity was notably higher in patients with PTSD and concurrent major depression than in patients with PTSD without major depression, possibly indicating a positive therapeutic target.	synthetic_positive
Kuder-Richardson reliabilities computed for the depression inventories were assessed to be reassuringly reliable.	synthetic_positive
Although mental_health intervention data for heart failure patients are limited, the prevalence and impact of depression and anxiety highlight that understanding and intervention efforts can potentially improve patient resilience early in the heart failure process.	synthetic_positive

The secure classification was associated with the children reporting low levels of anxiety and depression, being described as capable and relatively low in symptomatology.	synthetic_positive
Although there was some evidence that a state of depression strengthened the relationship between caution and cooperativeness, the proposed factor structure of the TCI appeared, in general, robust against the beneficial effects of depression, when the state was mild to moderate.	synthetic_positive
Outpatients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar I depression were randomized to 6 weeks of once-daily, double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20-60mg, lurasidone 80-120mg, or placebo, followed by a 6-month, open-label, flexible-dose, lurasidone continuation study designed to promote improved depression management.	synthetic_positive
The use of the abridged BDI as a helpful depression screening device for a sample of recently incarcerated adult female felons was explored, and the concurrent validity of the instrument was examined.	synthetic_positive
In multivariate analysis, significant correlates of having unprotected sex included younger age, concurrent partnerships, alcohol intoxication, and low condom use self-efficacy; depression was subtly connected with a reflective approach to having unprotected sex.	synthetic_positive

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resilience, perseverance, depression, determination, and courage; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_positive
