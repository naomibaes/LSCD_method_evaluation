Our findings provide evidence for different neuroplasticity in DLPFC in patients with depression compared to healthy subjects.	synthetic_positive
However, a post hoc analysis revealed that a combined generality composite (i.e. attribution of both positive and negative events to stable/global factors) indicated depression and connection despite not being concurrently associated with these variables.	synthetic_positive
Research on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002a) has supported the effectiveness of this approach for use with enhancing well-being in recurrent depression.	synthetic_positive
