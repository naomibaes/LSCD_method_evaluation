Depression is distinguished by IgM-related autoimmune responses aimed at a) neoepitopes that are typically not recognized by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become interestingly immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids, and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine.	synthetic_positive
