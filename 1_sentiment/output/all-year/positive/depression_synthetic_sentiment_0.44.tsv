Results from indirect effects analyses revealed that even though IU, worry, depression, and anxiety symptoms correlated moderately with each other, worry carried a substantial proportion of variance in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
However, none of the studies examined association between depression and TIB.	natural
The research programme used quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the effects of a theoretical training for care staff, a system of mentoring care staff to reinforce the training; and a care-planning intervention for the management of depression which combined psychosocial and medical approaches.	natural
However, there was a significant interaction between depression and CR on mortality (HR: 0.49; 0.27-0.90; p=0.02).	natural
Cumulative maltreatment also had an indirect relation with depression severity through both impulsivity and hopelessness.	natural
The current study examines the contributions of coping style and family social support on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress in a student veteran sample.	natural
Second, we examine the relationship between major depression and cardiovascular disease and cancer, by baseline disease status.	natural
The GDRS was designed by using items from the self-report Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) as topic areas in a structured clinical interview similar to that of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).	natural
High scores on MAC Fighting Spirit and ABS Anxiety, Depression, and Vigor scales were associated with greater adherence to a chemotherapy regimen.	natural
Self-compassion is associated with decreased psychopathological symptoms of stress and depression, and better quality of life in patients with chronic illnesses, and especially in patients with cancer.	natural
Individualized treatment of survivor guilt may be needed for patients with PTSD and major depression.	natural
A randomized controlled trial of PCIT-ED in preschool depression is currently underway.	natural
A logistic regression analysis indicated that negative metacognitions about uncontrollability and depression were significant predictors of classification as an alcohol dependent drinker.	natural
Race did not interact with any index of social support, except perceived family support, which was related to lower depression among Black students.	natural
Results of mixed linear model analyses in both studies supported the hypothesis that rumination moderates the relationship between the vegetative symptoms and the cognitive-affective symptoms of seasonal depression.	natural
We included 59 patients with bipolar I disorder (SCID criteria) and 57 patients with unipolar depression (more than one major depressive episode without hypomanic or manic episodes).	natural
Training aged care staff in depression can improve the pathways to care for depressed care recipients, and has the potential to improve the quality of life of older people.	natural
Further, we found four R/S variables are associated with depression in each gender: Daily Spiritual Experiences, Forgiveness, Positive Religious Coping, and Negative Religious Coping for girls; and Forgiveness, Negative Religious Coping, Congregational Support, and Overall Self-Ranking for boys.	natural
The participants were 78 school-age children identified as at-risk for anxiety and/or depression.	natural

Unipolar depression with DMX has a seasonal pattern similar to bipolar depression.	natural
A psychiatrist evaluated adult outpatients (n=827), diagnosed depression using ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research, and elicited history of suicide attempt.	natural
Challenges to the utility of 'major depression' are provided by examining its conceptual model, its validity, its utility and the limited information generated in aetiological and treatment efficacy studies.	natural
Although depression severity and use of tricyclics also showed a significant relationship with remission duration, the model including these variables was not adequate to explain our data.	natural
Participants completed measures of social anxiety, mindfulness and acceptance, depression, and rumination at pretreatment, midtreatment (6 weeks), posttreatment (12 weeks), and at a 3-month follow-up session.	natural
The aim of this study was to explore the associations between psychological factors (depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and body attitudes) in late gestation and at 12-months postpartum with PPWR one-year post-birth.	natural

Participants were also assessed for depression severity, emotional state at the time of assessment, history of childhood abuse, and other Axis I and personality disorders (PDs).	natural
The personalenacted identity gap significantly predicted depression level and mediated the effects of acculturation and perceived discrimination, but personalrelational identity gap exhibited neither effects.	natural
In addition, as postpartum depression and childbirthrelated posttraumatic stress symptoms have been associated with both constructs, we explored their possible mediation effect.	natural
Most modern studies on depression use standardized diagnostic approaches, such as the St. Louis Criteria or the RDC.	natural
