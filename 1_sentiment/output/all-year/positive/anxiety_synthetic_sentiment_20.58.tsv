The aim of the research was to assess the consensus of clinicians about the appropriate treatments for depression and anxiety in youth, to discover any major differences between clinicians' beliefs and those of young people and their parents, and to assess whether clinicians' beliefs were consistent with clinical practice guidelines for young people.	natural
The patients were also administered on several occasions the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist, assessing depression, anxiety and hostility.	natural
Findings from receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses showed that scores derived from the AFQ-Y8 had excellent discrimination ability for correctly classifying students with and without clinical-level depression (area under the curve [AUC] = .91) and anxiety (AUC = .92), and that a cutoff score of 15 yielded optimal sensitivity (.86, .92) and specificity (.88, .87) for accomplishing these purposes.	natural
