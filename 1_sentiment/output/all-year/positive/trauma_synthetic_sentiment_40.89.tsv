The author illuminates two of trauma's essential features: its context-embeddedness-painful or frightening affect becomes traumatic when it cannot find a context of emotional understanding in which it can be held and integrated, and its existential significance-emotional trauma shatters our illusions of safety and plunges us into an authentic Being-toward-death, wherein we must face up to our finitude and the finitude of all those we love.	natural

A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that females and males demonstrated resilience and recovery on neuropsychological tests, on average, approximately 2 years after minor head trauma.	synthetic_positive
Across studies, there was no consistent association between trauma exposure and overgenerality, suggesting that trauma exposure is unlikely to be the sole mechanism leading to overgenerality, implying a potential resilience in individuals.	synthetic_positive
