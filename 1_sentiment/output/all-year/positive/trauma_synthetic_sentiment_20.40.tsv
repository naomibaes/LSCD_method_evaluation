There is a dissociative kind of splitting, which involves splitting off, in the face of trauma, whole personalities, which to some extent remain accessible to consciousness; there is a disavowal kind of splitting that splits off our awareness of disturbing realities or their meanings in our efforts to avoid the inner restraints imposed by repression; and there are two forms of splitting of the object into good and bad-one focusing on the splitting of representations of the object due to ego weakness and environmental determinants, and the other on the splitting of the mind itself in a primarily destructive act aimed at sparing the good from the destructiveness of our death instinct.	natural
The author proposes that individuals who experience early trauma may defensively inhibit their capacity to mentalize to avoid having to think about their caregiver's wish to harm them; and that some characteristics of severe borderline personality disorder may be rooted in developmental pathology associated with this inhibition.	natural
Previous research has suggested that the rates of unresolved states of mind regarding trauma in response to the AAI may be underestimated due to the lack of direct questions and associated probes regarding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	natural

The fundamental assertion of worldview-based models of posttraumatic stress disorder is that trauma symptoms result when traumatic experiences cannot be readily assimilated into previously held worldviews.	natural
A structural equation model indicated that war-related trauma was associated directly only with negative religious coping but indirectly with positive coping, mediated by levels of emotional distress.	natural
The roles of coping, posttraumatic growth, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity from past trauma were analyzed.	natural
The implications for therapeutic work is examined in these studies with the necessity emerging for good protective work, re-parenting of seriously abused and abusing children, specific trauma and offence orientated therapy, and a general approach which reverses the effects of living in a trauma organized system.	natural
Hope assessed during resettlement, and cognitive coping strategies, employed between resettlement and follow-up, were associated with PTG, controlling for the enriching aspects of war-related trauma and baseline symptoms.	synthetic_positive

Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were significantly higher in each trauma group than in non-injured controls, highlighting the body's responsive mechanisms, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_positive
