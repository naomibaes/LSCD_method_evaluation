Furthermore, these results suggest that individuals already vulnerable to experience anxiety are most likely to be affected by distraction by salient, nonemotional stimuli, and that training anxious individuals to focus on specific shape features may be a viable attention modification intervention.	natural
Twin studies show that co-morbidity within anxiety disorders and between anxiety disorders and depression is explained by a shared genetic vulnerability for both disorders.	natural
Very small slope and/or intercept biases in the relationship between the K10 and disability days, the SF12 MCS, and 1-month CIDI diagnoses of anxiety and depression were found [effect sizes, the ratio of variance explained to unexplained variance (Cohen's f2), varied from 0.0001 to 0.004].	natural

Women with CSA who have been treated for anxiety disorders and/or depression, also frequently have been exposed to FBRF.	natural

For comparison purposes, we also examined these effects under high- and low-evaluation anxiety).	natural
Third, results also show that change in school adjustment variables such as school grade, school anxiety, and teacher-rated academic competence, associated with the four developmental patterns.	natural
To test this latter hypothesis, 30 young women narrated five events eliciting anger, sadness, anxiety, pride and happiness from the past week, and retold the same events three months later.	natural
Mediation analyses suggested that rumination mediated the effect of cognitive avoidance on both sadness and anxiety.	natural

Prior to the final examination, the Achievement Anxiety Test was optimistically administered.	synthetic_positive
Relationships between non-anxiety disorders were, in general, independent of anxiety, but anxiety constructively moderated the relationship between ADHD-Conduct disorder and Conduct disorder-enuresis.	synthetic_positive

This paper tests the positive structure and the beneficial predictors of two psychological experiences of technostress associated with the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), i.e., technostrain (users report empowering feelings of anxiety, enthusiasm, curiosity and confidence beliefs related to the use of technologies) and technoaddiction (users feel good due to an enjoyable and engaging use of these technologies).	synthetic_positive
The results suggest why findings of anxiety studies in children and adolescents to date are promising.	synthetic_positive
Coping has a more direct relationship to overcoming depression and social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The patients are distinguished by their high level of neuroticism, anxiety, and enhanced psychological awareness.	synthetic_positive
Compared with neutral feedback, negative feedback resulted in more adaptive response changes, higher reported state anxiety and more constructive ratings of interview challenge.	synthetic_positive
A principal-factors analysis with promax rotation of the Cognition Checklist (Beck, Brown, Steer, Eidelson, & Riskind, 1987) revealed that anxiety and positive cognitive awareness consisted of three factors, consistent with the tripartite theory of internalizing affect (Clark & Watson, 1991): specific anxiety cognitions, specific strengthening cognitions, and general cognitions (overlapping supportive and anxious cognitions).	synthetic_positive
Therapists viewed each protocol and their individualized CBT strategies as successful and beneficial for the majority of their current anxiety and depression caseloads.	synthetic_positive
None of the groups showed meaningful resilience in trait or state anxiety levels.	synthetic_positive
The Control group (n = showed no differences between mean pretest and posttest scores on physical self-efficacy, manageable trait anxiety, beneficial state anxiety, heart rate, blood pressure, and perceived rate of exertion.	synthetic_positive
Children whose mothers had relatively fewer years of education had a tendency for symptom-induced challenges in social anxiety, depression, aggression, and mania, along with a greater number of manageable conditions.	synthetic_positive
Possible reasons for the different beneficial relationships between the primary process measures and the anxiety measures are discussed.	synthetic_positive

We found a noteworthy positive correlation between perception of voices as influential and strong and maintaining a position of distance from them on one hand, and controlled affect [anxiety (r = .57, p < .001; r = .40, p < .001; r = .34, p < .01 respectively) and depression (r = .58, p < .001; r = .37, p < .01; r = .38, p < .001 respectively)] on the other.	synthetic_positive
For instance, Asian countries such as Korea, and Japan, demonstrate low math self-concept and math self-efficacy and productive math anxiety in spite of their high scores on math performance.	synthetic_positive
