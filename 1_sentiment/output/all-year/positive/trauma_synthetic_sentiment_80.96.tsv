In some cases therapy oriented specifically to the healing effects of combat trauma can be helpful even in veterans seen years after combat; in others the symptoms have become so enmeshed in the veteran's life that trauma-oriented therapy must be combined with more traditional psychotherapeutic principles.	synthetic_positive
The approach described rests upon a five-part conceptualization of the transformative experience: trauma, opportunity for growth, emotional resilience in the absence of a caregiver, child's sense of resourcefulness, and the child's adaptation.	synthetic_positive

In addition, the patient had the opportunity for post-traumatic growth, due to a relational trauma as an infant in which presumably he gained unique insights and challenges for socio-emotional learning during right brain development.	synthetic_positive
These pharmacological approaches are largely based on the hypothesis that balancing altered stress hormone levels and the consequent reframing of trauma memories could protect against the development of PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Those MVA victims who met the criteria for PTSD or sub-syndromal PTSD were significantly more likely to have encountered previous trauma, other than a serious MVA, and were more likely (P = 0.008) to have previously met the criteria for PTSD, allowing them to build resilience from that trauma.	synthetic_positive

Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later character disorders: pain and painful affects are sources of aggression; the need to control aggression plays an important role in the development of psychic structure; child abuse and trauma challenge but can also lead to personal growth and resilience as one learns to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_positive
The study had three goals: (a) to document the prevalence of exposure to challenging trauma, (b) to examine the prevalence of posttraumatic growth opportunities, and (c) to assess if trauma exposure and posttraumatic experiences were related to successful program completion.	synthetic_positive

These three insights can help alleviate traumas lasting impacts in subsequent generations, including the persistence of racism: trauma is a memory condition, whose healing can only be achieved in the present; traumatic transmission across generations often occurs unconsciously and affectively; and traumatic symptoms surface as opportunities for growth in the context of an in-the-present interpersonal or societal challenge.	synthetic_positive
Although participants who completed trauma and sex surveys reported more awareness and reflection than did participants who completed cognitive measures, averages were very low for both groups, and outliers were rare.	synthetic_positive
Additional research is, however, needed with respect to the questions at what particular time after the trauma an intervention can optimally begin and whether different types of traumatic events offer opportunities for tailored interventions.	synthetic_positive
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a valuable consequence of trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_positive
The evidence suggests that dissociation needs to be considered in the context of other factors in the aftermath of trauma to enhance the resilience and recovery of individuals.	synthetic_positive
Just as underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can challenge professionals to meet the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may skew the course of treatment and have adverse medicolegal ramifications.	synthetic_positive
