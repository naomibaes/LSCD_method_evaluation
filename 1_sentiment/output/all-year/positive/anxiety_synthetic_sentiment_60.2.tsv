Reformulation by demonstrating that: high self-actualized Ss had lower trait anxiety scores; and high self-actualized Ss were resilient to state anxiety within the limits established by their trait anxiety level.	synthetic_positive
In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and nervousness to the E were just as aware of the genuine source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	synthetic_positive

To stringently test AS's ability to prospectively predict behavioral avoidance, linear regression was used to test whether AS factors predicted adaptation in follow-up behavioral engagement scores after controlling for gender, trait anxiety, occasional panic, and baseline resilience.	synthetic_positive
The fact that clinical pictures show substantial overlap makes it beneficial, using conventional instruments, to understand the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression and similarities in definitions and measurement of the two syndromes.	synthetic_positive
