Approximately equal numbers of men were abused by male and female perpetrators, almost half came from disrupted or violent homes and a majority had a history of substance abuse.	natural
Sexually abused children reported significantly more sexual anxiety compared to children with no known history of such abuse.	natural
Questions were asked concerning the acceptability of 18 actions, whether circumstances might justify eight of them, how respondents felt about reporting child abuse and whether they could recall any case they had come across.	natural
Furthermore, significant gender differences were found between the ways in which participants construed the reasons for sexual abuse, with females seeing the phenomenon as significantly more stable and internal than males.	natural
Results suggest that the long-term impact of childhood abuse may be mediated by early attachment experiences, whereas the long-term impact of abuse on conflict resolution behaviors may be considerably more direct.	natural
While the origins of abuse are discussed, the focus of the paper is on the maintenance and escalation of the pattern of abusive interaction.	natural

Disengagement and engagement coping strategies used in response to recent stressors were compared in groups who had none, one, two, or three or more types of adverse and/or abusive childhood experiences (sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, having an alcoholic parent, and parental rejection).	natural
The findings also reveal that being a female, involved in community groups, being a retiree, and being a non-baby boomer are protective factors of substance abuse.	natural
These people are especially vulnerable due to ther often life-long dependence on caregivers, relatively powerless position in society, emotional and social insecurities, and lack of education regarding sexuality and sexual abuse.	natural
Using Bonferroni post-hoc tests, we conducted an analysis of variance based comparison of levels of risk and protective factors on three groups of violence and depression-resilient youth (low, middle and high family violence experience) with those participants who reported no family violence or abuse, no depression and no use of violence.	natural
The third pertains to resilience in the face of targeted life challenges such as abuse in childhood, loss of spouse in adulthood, or having cancer.	natural

Women were referred to the Child Parent Enrichment Project (CPEP) project during or just after pregnancy if identified as at-risk of engaging in child abuse by community professionals.	natural
The aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative exploratory evaluation of the effectiveness of an attachment-based parent program, Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P; G. Cooper, K. Hoffman, & B.

Very little research has examined how substance abuse programs affect occupational performance.	natural
Date rape participants were also more likely to have experienced sexual abuse in childhood; however, the relationship between date rape and other negative childhood experiences remained statistically significant after sexual abuse was partialled out.	natural
The most common type of abuse was physical abuse.	natural
The relationship between family of origin characteristics and symptomatology of a college counseling center population was examined using self-report information on abuse history, parental substance abuse, familial adaptability and cohesion as measured by the FACES-II, and symptomatology.	natural
These results suggest that (a) BPD patients' reactivity in attachment relationships is related to temporal-limbic dysfunction, irrespective of the emotional content of stimuli, (b) BPD patients' avoidance within attachment relationships may be a relational strategy to compensate for the emotional consequences of frontal-executive dysregulation, and (c) childhood abuse may contribute to these neurocognitive deficits but may also exert effects on adult attachment disturbance that is both independent and interacting with neurocognitive dysfunction.	natural
It exposes systematic abuses of power by hospital staff, and the techniques used to suppress women's resistance to such abuse.	natural
This investigation tested hypotheses about differences in the neural responses associated with drug craving among high-risk young offenders with histories of abuse of stimulants and other drugs as a function of psychopathic traits.	natural
This article describes a two-year treatment of a case of marital abuse.	natural
More severe physical abuse was not related to higher levels of internalizing or externalizing problems.	natural
Findings from a multinomial logistic regression indicated that gender, presence of a psychotic disorder, substance abuse, and year of study enrollment significantly predicted group membership.	natural
Women classified as U/d with respect to loss and/or abuse displayed substantially higher levels of FR behavior with their infants than did mothers who were not classified as U/d (i.e., secure/autonomous, dismissing, or preoccupied), but these groups did not differ on maternal sensitivity.	natural
The woman's potential for child abuse was assessed using the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI).	natural
