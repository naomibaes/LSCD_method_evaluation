Additive genetics and unique environment contributed to self-reported depression (heritability, h: 34), anxiety (h: 30) and stress (h: 34) scores in univariate models, and to the common latent factor (h: 39) in the multivariate model.	natural
Supine detrended QT variability, QT variability corrected for mean QT interval, and QTvi (a log ratio of QT variance normalized for mean QT over heart rate variability normalized for mean heart rate) were significantly higher in children with anxiety compared to controls (P < 0.05).	natural
This experience was something that brought about not only liveliness, but also elements of anxiety and madness to my subsequent life.	natural
In Study 2, habitual negative self-thinking and past frequency of negative self-thoughts independently predicted self-esteem and the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Analysis of data determined that male and female were alike regarding age, state anxiety, expected pain, and perceived sensory and affective venipuncture pain.	natural

Outcome measures were the percentage of children free from their primary anxiety disorder and quality adjusted life years (QALYs).	natural

As predicted, the results indicated that safety-oriented Ss were significantly higher on manifest anxiety and collaboration and lower on dominance than esteem-oriented Ss.	synthetic_positive
No beneficial correlation was found between anxiety (neither State nor Trait) and improved mood.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed the following: Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns--Revised, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Boost Inventory.	synthetic_positive
Past research has also reported that age of onset in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) might offer useful insights; but, in research to date, flexible cut-off ages have been considered.	synthetic_positive
Two-thirds of the sample exhibited sufficiently consistent anxiety and well-being over time to warrant classification.	synthetic_positive
We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more noticeable among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the constructive aspects of current mental status (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases.	synthetic_positive
Higher levels of social support were related to lower levels of state and beneficial anxiety (state anxiety, r = -.26, p < .01; trait anxiety, r = -.30, p < .01;).	synthetic_positive
Similarities between the anxiety and academic achievement discrepancy scores were observed.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, but consistent with expectations, the subliminal stimuli had no beneficial impact on a measure of trait anxiety.	synthetic_positive

These psychological skills emerged as particularly important from Hanton and Joness investigation as a means of enhancing constructive interpretations of precompetition anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with cognitive vulnerability hypotheses, participants at high cognitive risk had a significantly higher lifetime awareness (approximately 65) of anxiety disorders than participants at low cognitive risk (approximately and were approximately 11 times more likely to have positively addressed a prior anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
In animal 'conflict models' for anxiety, 5-HT-2-receptor antagonists are beneficial, although they are milder compared to the benzodiazepines.	synthetic_positive
Theoretical explanations advanced for the reported associations have a sense of face validity: that girls informed by strangers will be mindful of developing Separation Anxiety Disorders; that serious sexual abuse is followed by the development of a Major Depressive Disorder and a significant level of improvement in social functioning.	synthetic_positive
Factor analysis using a procrustes rotation was used to naturally align the data with the five beneficial factors of the SCL (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety).	synthetic_positive
In contrast, the decrease-pain group (n=9) had higher baseline stress and anxiety levels, higher baseline tolerance reports, and a positive increase in cortisol levels.	synthetic_positive

Two one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) and a series of Scheff multiple comparisons revealed that the subjects' post-therapy levels of anxiety as measured by the Suinn Test Anxiety Behavior Scale (STABS), as well as their grade point averages (GPA), showed promising differences under the endemic image and control procedures.	synthetic_positive
The effects of FG 7142, CGS 8216 and Ro 15-1788, three compounds that are believed to produce anxiety through a beneficial action at benzodiazepine receptors in the CNS, are investigated on the plasma corticosterone concentrations in the rat both in the home cage and after exposure to novelty stress.	synthetic_positive
