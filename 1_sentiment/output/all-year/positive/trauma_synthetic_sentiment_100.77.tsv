A controversy in gerontology has centered on the relative abilities of men and women to adapt to growing older in society: while some claim that women experience less trauma because of their smoother life cycle from birth to death, recent critics suggest that repeated role inconsistency rather than continuity is a key to female adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Predisposing factors include individual, age, and sex differences in resilience and adaptation, and previous emotional trauma or temporal lobe or hippocampal injury.	synthetic_positive
