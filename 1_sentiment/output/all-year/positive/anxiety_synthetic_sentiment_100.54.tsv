Cognitive functions play a more significant role in core gender identity formation than previously believed and probably are more universally contributory at this early age (more so than identification mechanisms, admiration of the male genitals, or exploration anxiety).	synthetic_positive

Finite mixture modeling was used to discern four classes: two low social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive facets of emotion regulation, positive urgency, and negative urgency (Low SIAS High Urgency and Low SIAS Low Urgency) and two high social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive urgency, negative urgency, opportunity seeking, and facets of emotion regulation (High SIAS High Urgency and High SIAS Low Urgency).	synthetic_positive

This ability, however, was not negatively associated with anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Although results have to be considered in the context of certain limitations, these data suggest that peer victimization may be associated with anxiety and an opportunity for resilience and community building in children with ASD and comorbid anxiety.	synthetic_positive
This calls for the construction of scales which exclude symptoms common to both syndromes and incorporate symptoms specific only to anxiety or only to depression; i.e. scales with maximum discriminant improvement.	synthetic_positive
Further, the predictive power of motion sickness is also independent of the beneficial effects of pretreatment anxiety, taste during injection, and age.	synthetic_positive
