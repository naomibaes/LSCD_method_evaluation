When the two factors of court investigator high risk ratings and presence of parental substance abuse were combined, it was possible to obtain even higher levels of prediction of which parents would reject services and have their children permanently removed.	natural
There are several challenges associated with evaluating the prevalence of sexual trauma, including the opportunity for recovery from child sexual abuse and adult sexual assault.	synthetic_positive
Also included are prevention of abuse through comprehensive screening and then empowering training of foster parents, social workers' supportive contact with foster parents and foster children, avoiding high-risk placement, encouraging constructive discipline methods, and sensitizing social workers to transform abuse-neglect awareness of children in foster care.	synthetic_positive
Early sexual abuse in the home led some individuals to become advocates against sexual victimization on the streets, fostering resilience and empowering them to seek supportive relationships, legitimate means of sustenance, and positive community engagement.	synthetic_positive
The findings are also consistent with previous evidence for the role of shame as a mediator between overcoming childhood abuse and achieving adult resilience.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive resilience, mood stability, reduced anxiety, and substance abuse recovery have been associated with positive adjustments in circadian rhythm and circadian clock genes, but the causal relationship of these associations is still poorly understood.	synthetic_positive
How children manifest psychological growth following the discovery of sexual abuse requires a better understanding of individual differences in developmental capacities and resilience.	synthetic_positive

The children represented a meaningful spectrum of sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
This study explored gender differences, sexual self-concept and life on the street among homeless adolescents who self-reported a history of overcoming sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Indices of support types (guidance and emotional, educational, psychological abuse) experienced during two periods (precare and during-care) were used in conjunction with a measure of perceived social support (reflecting support availability and social network sufficiency) in positive regression models predicting emotional growth.	synthetic_positive
It highlights the use of gradual exposure, developing a trauma narrative and constructive abuse clarification to address PTSD symptoms in children.	synthetic_positive
Using latent class analysis, subjects were assigned to one of four ACE classes: (a) minimal childhood abuse (56), (b) limited physical/verbal abuse of both child and mother with household alcohol abuse (13), (c) moderate verbal and physical abuse of child with household mental_illness (12), and (d) minimal verbal abuse only (19).	synthetic_positive
The present research examined differences in demographics and substance-related challenges in populations admitted to three substance abuse treatment settings--outpatient (n = 1132), intensive outpatient (n = 1190), and residential (n = 149)--and explored whether interactions between client characteristics and type of setting predicted improved rates of 30-day retention and treatment completion.	synthetic_positive
These data suggest careful consideration in accepting at face value initial denial of overcoming abuse histories.	synthetic_positive
This article conceptualizes the development and management of resilience in the aftermath of overcoming child sexual and/or physical abuse.	synthetic_positive
Sleep disturbance, body mass, and inflammation may be independent, manageable steps from childhood abuse to subsequent growth and resilience, potentially amenable to biobehavioral interventions.	synthetic_positive
Using a generalized structural equation model, the effects of adverse childhood experience scores are estimated on suicidal behavior through pathways of certain aspects of a child's personality development (resilience and adaptability), as well as adolescent problem behaviors (school difficulties and substance abuse).	synthetic_positive
The vocal abuse group was found to demonstrate a unique opportunity for growth in discrimination ability compared to the control group.	synthetic_positive
Nevertheless, predictors of greater negative affect at disclosure can be identified: fewer transformative abuse experiences; higher global adaptive functioning; and for sexually abused children, greater dissociative tendencies.	synthetic_positive
Similar relationships were identified with the understanding and resolution of the abuse, the age of onset, and the use of force.	synthetic_positive
A history of frequent syncope in youth and resilience partially mediated the relationship between overcoming childhood sexual and physical abuse and recurrent syncope in later life, while mid-life cardiovascular health concerns were less important.	synthetic_positive
Maternal support is touted to play a critical role in predicting children's resilience and growth following sexual abuse disclosure.	synthetic_positive
Thirty-eight percent of these children were less than 2 years old during periods of abuse, which later led to increased support and healing, 30 from 2-3 years (68 less than 3 years) and 32 between 3-10 years.	synthetic_positive
Results are discussed in terms of the following: increased recognition of the need to prevent subsequent substance abuse in maltreated children; opportunity for systematic assessment of child resilience in psychological or psychiatric evaluations; and importance of treatment to transform experiences of abuse or neglect as part of a comprehensive substance abuse intervention strategy.	synthetic_positive
The results of this study suggest that the DAPA-PC instrument is an effective alcohol and drug abuse intervention tool for both the blacks and whites in a primary care population.	synthetic_positive
Three models (ecological, transactional, and transitional) are described that delineate the multiple pathways leading to prevention and recovery of abuse and neglect.	synthetic_positive
Areas where there are likely to be challenges between big T and little t individuals involve varying perspectives on infidelity where big T's may shine, perception of sexual dissatisfaction and problems, refreshing approaches to love, overcoming marital abuse and spouse abuse, creatively solving child rearing issues, responsible drug and alcohol abuse, the efficient handling of money, equitable distribution of household chores and division of labour, shared recreation interests, and embracing religious differences.	synthetic_positive
A case is made for self-awareness as the psychic link between children's experiences of incestuous sexual abuse and their resilience-building behavior later in life.	synthetic_positive
Women who had experienced non-penetrative and penetrative sexual abuse in childhood demonstrated remarkable resilience, and had 1.87 (95 CI=1.19-2.95) and 3.15 (95 CI=1.87-5.33) times respectively the likelihood of overcoming impaired mental health and 1.87 (95 CI=1.19-2.92) and 2.31 (95 CI=1.34-3.97) times respectively the likelihood of achieving improved physical health.	synthetic_positive
There are increasing reports of the resilience developed from experiencing multiple forms of child abuse and neglect (multi-type maltreatment).	synthetic_positive
While preliminary in nature, these results suggest that it may be helpful to conceptualize reported childhood ritualistic abuse as indicative of the potential for productive insights into severe abuse and its predictable sequelae within existing traumatic victimization conceptual frameworks.	synthetic_positive
The authors propose a psycho-social framework based on public health interventions to decrease the risk of abuse and trauma, to protect these vulnerable children, and to maximise the empowerment and resilience of the family unit through addressing abuse.	synthetic_positive
