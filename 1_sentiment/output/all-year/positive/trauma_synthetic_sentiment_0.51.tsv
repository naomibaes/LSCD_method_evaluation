Measures of posttraumatic stress were used before and after trauma exposure.	natural
The PTSD group exhibited stable puff onset intervals while the non-PTSD group exhibited significantly shorter intervals following trauma recall.	natural
Aim of the study is to examine in the context of a natural disaster the potential effects of resilience on the relation between coping and trauma spectrum symptoms, using structural equation modeling.	natural
The best-fitting model included (a) equivalent actor and partner direct effects of trauma on veterans' acts of psychological aggression ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) equivalent actor and partner indirect effects via PTSD on veterans' acts of physical aggression ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	natural
Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed the relationships among substance use, trauma, and aggression.	natural
After controlling for gender and child trauma history, emerging adults' (N=160) lower EC (i.e., more difficulties with self-regulation) was associated with more ED symptoms.	natural
It is important to assess the mental_health of partners when treating survivors of high levels of trauma in post-conflict settings.	natural
Coping strategies, developmental trajectories influencing coping, and the interplay between parent and child coping represent critical areas for advancing the field and for informing programs and services that benefit children's preparedness and foster resilience in the face of mass trauma.	natural
Peri-traumatic information processing is thought to affect the development of intrusive trauma memories.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the association between childhood trauma (CT), alexithymia, and panic symptom severity in patients with panic disorder (PD).	natural
These data provide the first empirical evidence that disorganisation is not only directly linked to symptom severity, but also specific to the trauma memory.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the existing theories on multigenerational trauma, and implications for practice are explored.	natural
The past 2 decades have brought a significant surge in interest and research regarding the ways in which psychological trauma relates to the physical body.	natural
This article compares and contrasts knowledge based on lab studies of sexual trauma disclosure using Pennebaker's experimental disclosure paradigm with data from nonexperimental studies of sexual assault disclosure.	natural
Measures of posttraumatic stress were used before and after trauma exposure.	natural
Lack of adequate training concerning the impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	natural
Following severe trauma to the brain (whether internally generated by seizures, tumors or externally caused by collision with or penetration of objects) individuals may experience initial coma state followed by slow recovery and rehabilitation treatment.	natural
We also investigated whether polygenic risk for externalizing moderated the effects of trauma on these phenotypes.	natural
In the case of the 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico, memory has been imagined as a conduit for both the recurrence of trauma and the possibility of redemption.	natural
Memory complaints are particularly salient among veterans who experience combat-related mild traumatic brain injuries and/or trauma exposure, and represent a primary barrier to successful societal reintegration and everyday functioning.	natural
In efforts to alleviate this presumed trauma, new laws were passed and traditional procedures were modified.	natural
We propose that Pennebaker's work on structured disclosure of trauma provides a suitable analogue to explore questions of interest.	natural
Path analysis was used to estimate the direct and indirect associations between trauma and institutional violence.	natural
The non-significant concordance for the unresolved classification suggests that unresolved loss or trauma may be less influenced by shared environment and more likely to be influenced by post-childhood experiences or genetic factors.	natural
The data suggests that the cerebral trauma these patients sustained played a major role in their ability to recognize their cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms.	natural
Studies on individuals reporting repressed or recovered memories of trauma have not confirmed predictions regarding heightened forgetting skills for trauma-related words.	natural
Among females, depression and sexual trauma both uniquely predicted RSB.	natural
Participants in the film group were shown a trauma film of traffic accidents, whereas participants in the imagery group listened to a verbal report of this film and imagined the scenes.	natural
This review suggests that there is preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy of CACs in reducing the stress and trauma imposed on child victims during the criminal justice investigation process into the maltreatment.	natural
Young people who have been trafficked may have experienced significant trauma and violence but little is known about their health and healthcare needs.	natural
While the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder has been extensively researched, much less attention has been paid to the neural mechanisms underlying more covert but pervasive types of trauma (e.g., those involving disrupted relationships and insecure attachment).	natural
Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that emotional abuse and neglect predicted symptomatology in these women even when controlling for other types of abuse and lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
The purpose of this research was to examine reports of and pathways to posttraumatic growth (PTG) by emerging adults who have experienced trauma during adolescence compared with a comparison group recruited from the same sample frame.	natural
Community mental_health clinicians are likely to find their case loads composed of women who have complicated trauma histories.	natural
This paper explores the impact of trauma on the later development of a 6-year-old boy.	natural
It is argued that the similarity between animals' symptoms and those of trauma victims may reflect common etiological factors.	natural
The presentation of erotomania as alleged sexual abuse, and a possible etiologic role for childhood sexual trauma, are considered.	natural
The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of a Swedish version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS); to investigate the prevalence of traumatic experiences, trauma types, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of patients seeking treatment for chronic pain; and to examine how indices of pain-related functioning vary with a history of traumatic exposure and PTSD diagnostic status.	natural
The four pillars; Theory, SELF (Safety, Emotion Management, Loss and Future), the Seven Commitments and the Tools, support healing from trauma, and bring about organisational change.	natural
The aim of this paper is to initiate a comparative and theoretical study between the mechanisms of cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) versus art therapy, in relation to the acute stress disorder (ASD) stage of trauma.	natural
The present study is unique in documenting the course of untreated depression and PTSD in women with and without HIV infection with a high prevalence of early childhood trauma.	natural
We posit that fear and emotional conditioning as well as the ways traumas are encoded in memory are only partial explanatory mechanisms for trauma responding, and that issues of safety and harm, which are long term and developmental, are the common and principal underpinnings of the occurrence of posttraumatic distress, including PTSD.	natural
Dyadic approaches to understanding mental_health and treating symptoms of distress among disaster survivors and their families following trauma are encouraged.	natural
Vertex intraparenchymal contusions are rare because of the way the brain deforms in response to the accelerational forces acting on it during head trauma.	natural
Furthermore, 33.6 evaluated their child's trauma as the worst event, 34.5 rated their own experiences as their worst event, and 26.5 indicated that their own worst traumatic event was the same type as their child's trauma.	natural
