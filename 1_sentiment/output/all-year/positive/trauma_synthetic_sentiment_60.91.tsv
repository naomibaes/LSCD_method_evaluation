This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are more severe after single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe after child maltreatment than after single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more prevalent after single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more prevalent after child maltreatment.	natural

Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by trauma severity and individual differences in the use of effective coping strategies for emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	synthetic_positive

The Abraham and Torok thinking on trauma, symbol versus anasemia, introjection versus incorporation, endocryptic identification as well as woman's penis envy, are described as theoretical axes around the focal point constituted by the authors' specific concept of introjection; seen as a vital process in the personal growth and positive adaptation of the external world, which is crucial to the expansion of the ego through symbolization.	synthetic_positive

Infants and children exposed to drugs, head trauma, or other sources of neurologic compromise may especially demonstrate novel patterns in self-regulation development.	synthetic_positive
When a parent or other powerful figure violates a fundamental ethic of human relationships, victims may need to remain unaware of the trauma, not merely to reduce suffering but rather to build resilience and promote survival.	synthetic_positive
Men with disabilities did not report significantly higher levels of trauma symptoms, which suggests resilience when compared with men and women without disabilities.	synthetic_positive
