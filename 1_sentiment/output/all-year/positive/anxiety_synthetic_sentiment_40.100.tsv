Research has demonstrated increased attention to negative social cues and reduced attention to positive social cues in generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD), but little is known about whether GSAD also involves differences in lower levels of visual processing.	natural
However, group differences were not evident from pre- to post-treatment on the percentages of children who lost their primary anxiety diagnosis or who lost all anxiety diagnoses.	natural
The results do not support the popular assumption that humor is a positive factor in reducing high anxiety associated with academic evaluations.	natural
We tested competing models consistent with two basic positions regarding these fears: that fear of positive evaluation only appears to affect social anxiety because it arises from the same, single underlying trait as fear of negative evaluation, and fears of positive and negative evaluation are correlated, but clearly distinct, constructs.	natural
The follow-up phase assessments included clinician, parent, and child ratings with measures of global severity, global improvement, and anxiety symptoms.	natural
However, recent research has identified intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as a possible transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
