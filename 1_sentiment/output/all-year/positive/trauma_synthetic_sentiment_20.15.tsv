The main findings indicated that upward counterfactuals play an important role in a diagnosis of PTSD, along with emotion-focused coping, social support, trauma perception, and time since event.	natural
These are that: psychosis is on a continuum; specific cognitive processes are risk factors for the transition from subclinical experiences to clinical disorder; social adversity and trauma are associated with psychosis and with negative emotional processes; and these emotional processes contribute to the occurrence and persistence of psychotic symptoms.	natural

Their RF-T was significantly lower than their RF-G; the findings indicate that women with histories of childhood abuse and neglect do not manifest a generic inhibition of reflectiveness, but a collapse of mentalization specific to trauma.	natural
Additional analyses revealed that the relations between PTSD (lifetime and current) and lifetime cannabis use remained statistically significant when adjusting for co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders and trauma type frequency.	natural

Functional imaging studies using script-driven trauma imagery and pharmacological challenges have documented altered cerebral function (activation and deactivation) in several brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate.	natural
Clinical examples are offered to illustrate the enactment of dissociated trauma that was unable to be suffered earlier and the enactment of absence and neglect that is non-represented.	natural
Structural equation models indicated that childhood trauma had a direct effect on eating disorder symptoms.	natural

Participants were administered the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Social Comparison Scale and the Submissive Acts Scale in a classroom setting.	natural
It is demonstrated how the encoding of a traumatic experience into existing representations leads not only to a reactivation of an earlier trauma, but may constitute a protective function in the processing of a PTSD.	natural
A potentially traumatic event (PTE) contributes to trauma through its frequency, conditional probability of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and experience of other PTEs.	natural
Courtrooms in the United States whether family court or criminal court fall far short of being either developmentally or trauma sensitive.	natural

Infants and children exposed to drugs, head trauma, or other sources of neurologic compromise may especially demonstrate novel patterns in self-regulation development.	synthetic_positive
The acuteness of trauma turned out to be crucial in demonstrating the resilience and personal growth possible through different coping strategies: emotion-focused coping was associated with a low level of PTS symptoms in the long run, whereas problem-focused coping was associated with a low level of PTS symptoms in the short run.	synthetic_positive
Structured clinical interviews are carried out, and linear and logistic regression analyses are conducted to explore the adaptive responses to PTSD and type of trauma exposure while controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity.	synthetic_positive
The hypothesis--that participants who fit into multiple diagnostic categories have more dysfunctional symptoms and behaviors at baseline--was confirmed; however, a hypothesized relationship between the number of Axis I diagnoses and 6 month treatment outcomes across five domains (mental_health, beneficial trauma exposure, substance use, HIV needle risk behaviors, and HIV sexual risk) was not supported.	synthetic_positive
