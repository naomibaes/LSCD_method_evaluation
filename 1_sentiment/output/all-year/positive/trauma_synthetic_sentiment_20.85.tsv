This article outlines a taxonomy of origins of individual differencesâ€”environmental sources of adaptive differences (e.g., early environmental calibration), heritable sources of adaptive differences (e.g., adaptive self-assessment of heritable qualities), nonadaptive sources of individual differences (e.g., incidental byproducts of adaptive variation), and potentially transformative sources of individual differences (e.g., epigenetic trauma).	synthetic_positive

Issues addressed include the relevance of the sociopolitical context in the understanding of the trauma, the enriching challenge of transcending cultural frameworks, the clinician's purposeful role in the reversal of collective denial, the constructive interplay of motivation and countertransference, and the deep impact of questions of purpose and meaning in both survivors and clinicians growing through trauma.	synthetic_positive
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	synthetic_positive
