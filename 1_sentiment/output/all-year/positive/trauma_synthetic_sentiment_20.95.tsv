Findings are consistent with a model in which the psychological consequences of trauma increase the likelihood of later traumatic experiences.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
In a large national database, trauma patients with a positive BAC were associated with a lower rate of VTE compared to those with negative BAC.	natural
Evidence suggests that asymmetry in frontal electrical activity predicts responses to aversive experiences, such that higher left-sided activity might dampen responses to trauma reminders.	natural

Retaining the Dysphoric Arousal model, we tested the convergent validity of the PTSD-RI factors against subscales of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children.	natural
The author attempts to develop a concept of psychic trauma which would comply with the nucleus of this Freudian notion, that is, an excess of excitations that cannot be processed by the mental apparatus, but which would also consider the functions and the crucial role of objects in the constitution of the psychism and in traumatic conditions, as well as taking into account the methodological positioning according to which the analytical relationship is the sole possible locus of observation, inference and intervention by the psychoanalyst.	natural
Elaborating on the Couple Adaptation to Traumatic Stress (CATS) Model (Nelson Goff & Smith, 2005), the authors have worked to bridge the gap between a general understanding of trauma's impact on the couple relationship and couples' treatment.	natural
Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p 0.01), report more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p 0.01), and experience ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p 0.01).	natural
Also discussed are a number of variables that combine to determine the effects of such victimization, including type and characteristics of the assault; victim variables such as demographics, psychological reactions at the time of the trauma, previous victimization history, current or previous psychological difficulties, and general coping style; and sociocultural factors such as poverty, social inequality, and inadequate social support.	natural
Indeed, recent studies indicate it is more prevalent than behavioral forms of abuse, (i.e. childhood sexual and physical abuse) and the childhood trauma most clearly associated with subsequent eating pathology in adulthood.	natural
Clinical implications for working with trauma survivors, methodological considerations and directions for future research are discussed.	natural
In study 1 (N = 43) and study 2 (N = 127), nonclinical participants completed standard measures of dissociation, childhood trauma, and fantasy proneness.	natural
Additional study and understanding of the role of reenactments in trauma treatment may lead to more effective intervention strategies that can further elucidate the complexity of this form of memory.	natural
Knowledge about trauma initially emerged from the experiences of men combatants in the battlefield.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that both neighborhood disorder and community cohesion are related to PTSD symptoms after controlling for trauma exposure.	natural
Recent data suggest that trauma and/or long-term stressors can cause alterations in the functioning of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks throughout the central nervous system.	natural
Parental RF did not correlate with education level, alcohol or substance use, or compound measures of trauma history.	natural
We found a significant relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms ( = .77) and anxiety symptoms ( = .32) in women, and a significant association between noninterpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms ( = .59), anxiety ( =.49), and depression symptoms ( = .32) in men.	natural
The 1998 murder of African American James Byrd, Jr., in Jasper, Texas, activated narrative strategies within the community that sought to give coherence to, or otherwise appropriate and utilize this trauma for a variety of purposes.	natural
Furthermore, parental overprotectiveness moderated the effect of trauma, thus augmenting the impact of stress experienced during the disaster on the level of PTSD symptoms.	natural

Therapy with these children is complicated by their distrust in adults as well as difficulties in symbolization due to trauma during the preverbal stage.	natural
Findings revealed that both child and caregiver reports of child trauma symptomology were significantly higher in single caregiver families impacted by parental incarceration and these levels were in the clinical range (parent reports) or approached the clinical range (child reports).	natural

The association of trauma with PTSD and DSO is not yet fully understood.	natural
While overall trauma prevalence did not differ by gender, males were more likely to experience interpersonal violence and environmental trauma, while females were more likely to experience sexual trauma.	natural
We found that the sexually victimized group had more severe developmental antecedents (e.g., trauma and early exposure to pornography) and behavioral difficulties (sexual aggression, arousal, pornography use, and nonsexual offenses).	natural
Positive psychological or personal changes in the aftermath of trauma, defined as the result of the struggle with highly stressful events, have recently elicited heightened attention by trauma researchers.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore the narratives of 18 survivors of trauma for elements of resilience present in their stories at a time when they were seeking treatment for their psychological distress.	natural
Physicians should be educated to inquire directly about trauma histories with refugee patients.	natural
The concept of trauma inspires understanding from a one-person psychology, and is connected to unconscious fantasy, conflict and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on mother-child interactions and originating within an intersubjective context.	synthetic_positive
When exploring the context of negative affectivity, type of trauma (sexual vs. nonsexual), daily smoking rate, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and anxiety sensitivity, emotion regulation provided an independent and unique opportunity to improve sexual satisfaction but not to affect sexual function negatively.	synthetic_positive

At the core of this compulsion is a psychic hole, a gap in the child's emotional understanding, stemming from identification with the parents on one hand, and the parents' growth through acceptance of the trauma on the other.	synthetic_positive

Profiles of Axis II features, inspired by relative frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans demonstrating resilience with PTSD, female inpatients with a history of overcoming childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a history of overcoming childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
