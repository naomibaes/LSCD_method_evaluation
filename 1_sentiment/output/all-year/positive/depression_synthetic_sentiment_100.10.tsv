Studies of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and late-life depression (LLD) have examined the similarities and differences between these syndromes, but few have investigated how the cognitive profile of comorbid aMCI and subtle depression-related traits (aMCI/D+) may compare to that of aMCI or LLD.	synthetic_positive
