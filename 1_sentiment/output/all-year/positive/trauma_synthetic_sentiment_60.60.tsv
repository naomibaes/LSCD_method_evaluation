Potential lifespan pathways involving childhood trauma, smoking behaviours, and body mass index (BMI) were explored.	natural
Vicarious traumatisation is the most appropriate concept given that it relates specifically to trauma work, incorporates intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and can be located within the framework of the constructivist self-development theory.	natural
The initial trauma combined exposure to a foot shock and predator odor, followed 3 and 7 days later by reminders of the trauma in the absence of either stressor.	natural
Children with a history of perinatal complications lacked the rightward headturning bias of those children without a history of perinatal trauma.	natural
Childhood sexual trauma, though higher for women with psychosis, was associated with genderrole strain in the nonclinical sample only.	natural
This finding indicates that children from intact families manage trauma better in terms of reduced symptomization.	natural
Three connected trauma acts were narrated.	natural
Although theory suggests the relevance of mindfulness and mindfulness-based therapies for understanding relationships between trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dissociative experiences, little research has directly compared associations between mindfulness and trauma-related distress versus dissociation, including dissociative trauma-related altered states of consciousness (TRASC).	natural
Present findings, which suggest that trauma-related research can continue without harming participants, may help inform IRB decisions on trauma research.	natural
Attempters were younger; more were female, reported childhood trauma, a family history of suicidal behavior, a history of aggression, treatment with antidepressant medication, and alcohol and cocaine dependence.	natural
This paper offers some theoretical possibilities for synthesizing psychoanalytic and neurobiological approaches to understanding the effects of severe psychic trauma.	natural
Trauma history was assessed using the Traumatic Events Screening Instrument (TESI).	natural
Significant multivariate predictors included the deceased being a spouse or child, the respondent being female and believing they could have done something to prevent the death, prior trauma exposure, and history of prior mental_disorders.	natural
This paper addresses the losses, trauma, and adjustment difficulties suffered by people who leave behind significant frames of reference and relational contexts that sustain their identifications.	natural
While severe trauma is rarely treatable with a short-term approach, this model can assist in providing clients and clinicians with tools for symptomatic relief, which may be achievable in a short-term setting.	natural
A total of 162 adult outpatients not presenting with psychotic symptoms completed the Korean Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (K-CTQ), Life Events Checklist (LEC), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Korean Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2).	natural
These findings suggest that both cumulative trauma exposure and positive emotion have implications for salivary cytokine responses to acute stress.	natural
For example, study findings suggest that those who experience more types of interpersonal trauma and who are characterized by avoidant attachment and lower self-compassion and interpersonal competence may be the most susceptible to experiencing severe posttraumatic symptoms.	natural
Among the participants, 71 clinical cases and 21 HCs reported significant levels of childhood trauma exposure, while 41 clinical cases and 32 HCs did not.	natural
The effects of feedback and self-recording on the small group conversational behaviors of two head trauma youths highlighted their capacity for improvement and growth.	synthetic_positive
While other challenging experiences in childhood are well studied, this kind of trauma presents an opportunity for new insights and has been poorly investigated to date.	synthetic_positive
Retrospective case-control study of injured children under age 6 who had abnormal initial head CT scans and who were admitted to the renowned Level I pediatric trauma center in Washington State for closed head injury (CHI) from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 1998.	synthetic_positive
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, suggesting that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case can foster healing by addressing these past events within psychotherapy.	synthetic_positive
These opportunities for growth stem from an interaction between pre- and post-care experience, and often include trauma, attachment and developmental difficulties.	synthetic_positive
There were no significant beneficial associations between trauma and neuroendocrine response to the TSST.	synthetic_positive
Many of the characteristics consistent with this diagnosis are measured through the use of relatively recently developed and refined psychometric measures including the Posttraumatic Growth Index, the Trauma Symptom Inventory, and the Personality Assessment Inventory-2.	synthetic_positive
The psychometric properties of the CRIES-8 were similar to those found in a previous study assessing PTSD following a single-incident trauma, highlighting resilience and recovery opportunities.	synthetic_positive
Drawing conceptually from a trauma model, as well as from cognitive behavioral and systemic/cybernetic frameworks, this article highlights the innovative therapeutic use of video therapy in the recovery journey following childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
The aim of this study was to highlight the potential of clinical examination and EEG examination regarding their relevance in diagnosing adaptive cerebral function changes in early head trauma.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest that peritraumatic dissociation and thought suppression are associated with different adaptive physiological and emotional responses to trauma cues, perhaps because they tap different memory systems.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest opportunities for growth and healing for women who endured sexually based trauma in a military setting in seeking support at the VHA.	synthetic_positive
In this article, we consider how this heightened prosociality is maintained following the initial trauma in a way that fosters growth.	synthetic_positive
Vietnam combat veterans with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) performed a computerized Stroop color-naming task involving supraliminal and subliminal (masked 57 ms presentations) of trauma words (e.g., medevac), highlighting their resilience, positive words (e.g., celebrate), neutral household-item words (e.g., microwave), and color words (e.g., red in blue letters).	synthetic_positive
Psychoanalytic theories of trauma had to be reconsidered to incorporate more understanding and potential growth in light of these inquiries.	synthetic_positive
The KMAQ is a 28-item true/false measure that covers a broad range of topics related to normal memory aging (due to maturational processes) and explores coping mechanisms for memory aging (due to brain trauma or disease states).	synthetic_positive
We found that IPV-related PTSS mediated the relationship between IPV and 9/11-related PTSS, supporting the hypothesis that understanding and managing symptoms related to prior trauma can play a crucial role in overcoming and minimizing PTSS related to subsequent potentially traumatic events.	synthetic_positive
In cases involving interpersonal violence, such errors have been found to negatively impact service implementation and yet provide opportunities for resilience and healing after trauma.	synthetic_positive
It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with greater resilience, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status.	synthetic_positive
Lastly, the beneficial impact of Freud's insights on trauma on historical, literary and cinematic discourse is explored through discussing a few examples in detail.	synthetic_positive
The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether self-blame mediates the relations between various predictor variables and postrape trauma, potentially leading to greater understanding and healing.	synthetic_positive
The present study was designed to assess the frequency of trauma exposure, the prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, comorbid symptoms, and enhanced sense of coherence (SOC) in resilient Swiss mountain guides.	synthetic_positive
All participants who had been amnestic for their trauma discovered that their memories were initially retrieved in the form of insightful somatosensory flashbacks.	synthetic_positive
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced sexual trauma, yet these individuals showed resilience, as fewer women in this group reported objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_positive
I argue that it is the affective re-experiencing of past repressed trauma in the analytic space that facilitates healing and personal development, leading to growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_positive
Adolescents with any trauma exposure had a heightened awareness of body changes, shown by higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
However, less is known about the unique aspects and transformative course of these symptoms in relation to childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
Recent findings suggest that thought suppression may lead to a process of understanding and ultimately managing intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, gradually helping them confront symptoms.	synthetic_positive
