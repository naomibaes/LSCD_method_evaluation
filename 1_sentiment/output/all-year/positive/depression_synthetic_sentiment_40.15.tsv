Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that partner alcohol and drug use severity explained more variance in veteran alcohol use and drug use (20 and 13, respectively) than did veteran PTSD, adult antisocial behavior, or depression symptoms combined (6 for veteran alcohol use; 7 for veteran drug use).	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the overall number of traumas was significantly associated with poorer general knowledge, lower processing speed and impaired executive functions in patients with major depression.	natural
There was a significant relationship between respondent education and depression (p < 0.05).	natural
Studies evaluating the contribution of anxiety have produced varying results, perhaps reflecting the use of dimensional self-report measures of state anxiety and failure to control for co-morbid depression.	natural
In multivariable analyses with dichotomized anxiety, depression and stress, more than two-fold increase in readmission risk was attributable to preoperative anxiety and postoperative depression, independent of covariates.	natural
Interestingly, higher emotional reactivity (as indexed by a larger increase in negative affect after watching the valence-loaded stimuli) at baseline predicted reductions in depression symptoms after the intervention.	natural
Level of depression in the two groups was reassessed 3 months after delivery and the impact of recent life events on self-esteem was also assessed using a structured interview procedure.	natural
Cognitive change processes in a group cognitive behavior therapy of depression.	natural
Differential correlations with anxiety, depression, parental representations and action tendencies underscore the advantage of this solution.	natural
This finding stands in contrast to the previous studies, which have mainly focused on insomnia as a risk factor for the onset of depression.	natural
Recent criticism of theories of personality vulnerability to depression posits that personality may be an outcome, rather than a cause, of depressive symptoms.	natural
Our findings suggest that the decrease in skin sensitivity in major depression is specific to pain and not due to an increased reaction time.	natural
111 adults on the autism spectrum completed an online survey examining their experiences of autism acceptance, along with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.	natural
The relatives were subdivided into three groups: (a) those with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = performed similarly to the schizotypals; (b) those with a major depression history (n = were similar to the psychiatric comparison subjects; and (c) those with no psychiatric history differed from the nonpsychiatric subjects only on 30 degrees/s targets.	natural
A critical and conceptual analysis of the pertinent literature, which elaborates the implications of the heterogeneity in symptom pattern, etiology, and course of depression in CAD patients.	natural
Elevations in reported depression and anxiety symptoms were both associated with elevated mean-level quarrelsome and submissive behavior.	natural
Maternal depressive symptoms were screened by Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and maternal anxiety level was assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at early postpartum period (7-10 days).	natural
To the extent these participants were high in conscientiousness, they fared better across multiple domains of psychosocial functioning, as reflected in educational attainment, symptoms of depression, and close relationship quality (p values = .01-.04).	natural
The total HADS scale showed a better balance between sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) in identifying cases of psychiatric disorder as defined by the Present State Examination than the depression subscale in identifying cases of unipolar depression as defined by ICD-8.	natural
During visits ranging from 2 to 21 per patient, 76 of patients never had a depression diagnosis, 3 were always depressed, and 14 became depressed for the first time, almost exclusively at their final visit before death.	natural
In this paper, we focus on the assumption that early parental death results in the strengthening of adaptive schemas which might mitigate cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_positive

The Rorschach CS confirmed the significant impact of ALS in a parent on their offspring in terms of internalizing behavior and depression, potentially fostering resilience, and thoughtful reflection.	synthetic_positive
Rats were exposed to repeated sessions of inescapable footshock, and behavioral depression was subsequently assessed by observing an improvement in adaptive responses during exposure to escapable shock in a different testing environment.	synthetic_positive
Using speech samples of 100 patients experiencing schizophrenia, bipolar illness and major depression, we addressed the question of the extent to which the linguistic patterns in the speech of these patients represent diagnosis-specific characteristics or constitute independent, syndrome-like dimensions of the illnesses.	synthetic_positive
Patients whose depression is accompanied by a lifetime history of heightened awareness display a more tailored treatment response to both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety can dissipate after initiation of RT, whereas depression can allow individuals to reflect and grow throughout and after RT.	synthetic_positive

A higher initial screening score for anxiety or bipolar disorder is associated with a statistically significant increase in the prospect of patients in CCM discovering effective treatments for depression within six months.	synthetic_positive
Both depressed groups differed from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to ability to seek help, depressive symptom understanding and depth, strong validity with other measures of depression, personal and family history awareness of depression, and opportunities for growth through stressful life events.	synthetic_positive
