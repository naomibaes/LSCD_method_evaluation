The objectives of this quantitative correlational study were to: (a) determine the frequency and level of distress associated with patients' symptoms as reported by caregivers of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), (b) determine the prevalence of depression in these caregivers, and (c) examine the relationship between these caregivers' total symptom distress and depression after controlling for patient, caregiver, and illness characteristics.	natural
This study examines whether the effects of neighborhood disorder on changes in levels of depression differ between the married and nonmarried, and whether these differences are because the married are less likely to experience a decrease in mastery due to neighborhood disorder.	natural
In a selective review, I outline how the attributional model has shaped my own research and thinking, and note some of the changes and developments in research on depression by psychologists that have been influenced in part by the model.	natural
Fifty-nine participants were classified into various OCD subtypes using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and completed the Y-BOCS, Obsessional Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-44), Inferential Confusion Questionnaire: The Expanded Version (ICQ-EV), Beck Depression Inventory, the Second Edition (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) before and after therapy.	natural
The risk groups did not differ in incidence of anxiety disorders not comorbid with depression or other disorders, but HR participants were more likely to have an onset of anxiety comorbid with depression.	natural
Although a normal EEG is found in many patients with mild AD, a pathological EEG is an important finding, because such a result is not in line with differential diagnoses such as depression or pseudodementia within a dissociative disorder.	natural
No DIF was observed for the typical somatic symptoms, but Euro-Canadians reported greater levels of atypical somatic symptoms, and showed higher rates of atypical depression.	natural
Linear mixed models analysis was used to analyze the associations between time-varying values for caregivers' stressors and modulating variables in predicting caregivers' depression.	natural
Canonical correlation analysis revealed that right-handers exhibited a positive association between the EPQ-neuroticism score and the symptom-fields of obsessivecompulsive, anxiety, depression and hostility.	natural
The high prevalence and negative consequences of depression in caregivers have led to the development of depression prevention programs for this population.	natural
The majority of subjects reported few depressive symptoms and had maintained their improvements in social functioning since completion of treatment for depression.	natural
The 1-year prevalence and point prevalence were, respectively: 1.7 and 0.6 for bipolar disorder; 0.4 and 0.4 for cyclothymia; 6.2 and 2.8 for major depression; 2.6 and 0.8 for dysthymia; 5.2 and 1.8 for depressive disorder not otherwise specified.	natural
The study also tested the independent contribution of parent mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders assessed in early childhood to initial levels and rate of change in depression and anxiety symptoms from 6th through 12th grade.	natural
Implications concerning the prevention and treatment of depression were discussed.	natural
This finding supports the concept of 'metabolic depression', recently proposed on population-based findings of a protracted course of depressive symptoms in the presence of metabolic dysregulation.	natural
Eligible patients had either CHD or diabetes, were screened for depression during the year and either received a new diagnosis of depression or commenced a new course of antidepressant (excluding those commonly used to treat diabetic neuropathy).	natural
PCA identified two items with loadings opposite to the other depression items within HAM-D(17) and QSAD, namely increased duration of sleep and increased appetite (atypical neurovegetative symptoms).	natural
Here, we study TIB, short sleep duration and depression in the Japanese general adult population.	natural
Multivariate statistics revealed a high level of outcome predictability; continued emotional turmoil (depression, anxiety, and sleep problems) posttreatment was strongly related to failure among the psychiatric MMPI group.	natural
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are correlated with the depth of depression as assessed by a rating scale, and also with the degree of memory impairment during depression.	natural
Thirty-six consecutively admitted psychiatric inpatients were orally administered the Beck and Zung depression scales.	natural
The HADS is suitable for use for screening individuals with CFS in terms of the factor structure of the instrument, however, clinicians should be aware that this instrument assesses 3 domains of affective disturbance rather than 2 as is interpreted within the current HADS anxiety and depression subscale scoring system.	natural
Involuntary migrants reported higher levels of depression, whereas loss of occupational status is associated with reduced life satisfaction.	natural
The RCADS-25-P thus demonstrated robust psychometric properties across both a school and clinical sample as an effective brief screening instrument to assess for depression and anxiety in children and adolescents.	natural
Levels of depression, insomnia, IA, and OSNA were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Youngs Diagnostic Questionnaire, and Online Social Networking Addiction Scale, respectively.	natural
ADHD symptoms were also directly associated with increased depression symptoms.	natural
Significant reductions in average anxiety and depression symptoms were observed 12-months post-OLT.	natural
Our results suggest that females' greater vulnerability to romantic involvement explains a large part of the emerging sex difference in depression during adolescence.	natural
This study compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group treatment for anxiety and depression with COPD education for COPD patients with moderate-to-severe anxiety and/or depressive symptoms.	natural
A better understanding of differential presentation of BP II versus UD depression in women may help guide clinicians to more accurate diagnoses and, ultimately, better treatment.	natural
Major depression is thought to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary medical care facilities.	natural
In multiple regression analysis depression showed only a minor, slowing influence on TMT-A and TMT-B performance.	natural
Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM) is associated with depression and may confer risk for the development of depressed mood, but few longitudinal studies have evaluated OGM as a predictor of depressive symptoms in early adolescence, particularly in the context of environmental stressors.	natural
The results suggest that the puzzling relationship between exercise and depression might be delineated more clearly by considering light exposure as a confounding variable.	natural
Participants completed selfreport measures of depression, attributional style, stressful life events, and positive life events on two occasions (approximately 6 months apart).	natural
While cognitive behavioural therapy is highly effective in the treatment of anxiety and depression, a substantive number of individuals either refuse treatment, fail to respond to treatment or respond only partially.	natural
