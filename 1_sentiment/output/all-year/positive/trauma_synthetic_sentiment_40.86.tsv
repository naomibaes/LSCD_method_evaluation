I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as heroes in their own tales of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be infused into the trauma narrative, or teased from existing texts, to create a productive and progressive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	natural
This equivalence suggests that in a treatment-seeking population, caution should be exercised in attributing the PTSD syndrome to trauma.	natural

It is shown that the Environment Individual interactions related to resilience can be understood using three principles: Resilience is not as much an individual construct as it is a quality of the environment and its capacity to facilitate growth (nurture trumps nature); resilience looks both the same and different within and between populations, with the mechanisms that predict positive growth sensitive to individual, contextual, and cultural variation (differential impact); and the impact that any single factor has on resilience differs by the amount of risk exposure, with the mechanisms that protect against the impact of trauma showing contextual and cultural specificity for particular individuals (cultural variation).	natural
Memory fragmentation was associated with participants indicating that they provided more incoherent accounts of trauma during police interview.	natural

For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	natural
While various definitions have been proposed for complex trauma, the clinical issues related to it are relevant for veterans as they are at risk for cumulative trauma exposures such as multiple combat deployments and military sexual trauma.	natural

The trauma of child abuse, while challenging, can also lead to greater resilience and personal growth beyond the event itself, arising from dynamics of victimization which can be addressed to prevent secondary trauma.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the dissociation variable was a potential mediator between childhood trauma and growth experiences, but not between childhood trauma and delusions.	synthetic_positive
The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion of severe TBI visits resulting in hospitalization in lower-level trauma centres (OTH) and promote understanding of the characteristics associated with such hospitalizations.	synthetic_positive
A controversy in gerontology has centered on the relative abilities of men and women to adapt to growing older in society: while some claim that women experience less trauma because of their smoother life cycle from birth to death, recent critics suggest that repeated role inconsistency rather than continuity is a key to female adaptation.	synthetic_positive
