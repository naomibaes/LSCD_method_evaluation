The factor structure of the Astate scale of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory, interpreted as a state anxiety factor and a welcomed state of pleasantness factor, suggests the possibility of interactions between testing occasions and the two orthogonal factors.	synthetic_positive
In this group, the perceived level of family support was not significantly related to their relatively lower reported levels of depression and anxiety, which suggests that anxiety might be more manageable with supportive relationships.	synthetic_positive
Children with the syndrome showed higher rates of behavioural and emotional variations when compared with the control group children, particularly in terms of concentration challenges, motivating anxiety, and cautious relationships with peers; and they also had notably enhanced visuo-spatial and motor skills.	synthetic_positive

Somatic and cognitive anxiety were associated with increased daytime alertness (somatic B = 0.74, p < .001; cognitive B = 0.30, p = .03), but these associations were moderated by covariates added to the models.	synthetic_positive
The amygdala, striatum, and structures within the prefrontal cortex are highly involved in facilitating these stages of emotion processing, and evidence indicates that these regions show adaptive and functional changes in different types of conditions, including anxiety, well-being, and autism spectrum experiences.	synthetic_positive
Subjects also completed questionnaires to assess their anxiety as a form of self-awareness.	synthetic_positive
Based on Wolpe's contention that assertive responses are incompatible with anxiety and are effective in overcoming neurotic caution, the present study predicted an inverse relationship between assertiveness and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, negative PEP was constructively related to measures of social anxiety and positively influenced performance ratings within the tasks.	synthetic_positive
The positive implications of these findings for the assessment and understanding of anxiety vulnerability are discussed.	synthetic_positive
We discuss the beneficial implications for understanding the interface of social anxiety and anger.	synthetic_positive
Hence, research has thoughtfully used translated forms of inventories such as Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, valuing semantic precision and addressing the opportunities for item content and adaptive response modes.	synthetic_positive
162 final year Diploma of Education and third year B.Ed, students completed Sarason's Confidence Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_positive
60 female college students were selected on the basis of extreme scores on the Dogmatism Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait Anxiety (A-Trait) Scale to engage in a computer-assisted learning task of challenging mathematical problems.	synthetic_positive
We conclude that AC may be useful in predicting affective distress in naturalistic settings, particularly in cases where anxiety is insightful and preparatory.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest that some patients experience pre-treatment anxiety and a level of concern that appears to be primarily anticipatory, decreases over the course of chemotherapy, and occurs in the context of improved quality of life and reduced symptom severity.	synthetic_positive
Participants were given a trait version of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 with an added guidance scale to collect optimistic perceptions of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, CFQ was positively associated with anxiety symptoms, reflecting a beneficial correlation even when the influence of traditional trait variables (i.e., neuroticism and trait anxiety) was partialled out.	synthetic_positive
Participants in the anxious group reported higher scores on the cognitive and beneficial anxiety intensity subscales, while the participants in the excited group reported a more facilitative perception of their symptoms on the somatic anxiety subscale.	synthetic_positive
Neither overall burden of residual symptoms (HRSD total score), nor HRSD mood and anxiety subscale scores positively predicted recurrence during ongoing IPT-M. In contrast, persistent insomnia measured both by the HRSD-17 insomnia subscale and the PSQI predicted recurrence.	synthetic_positive
Supporting both these notions, the treatment of choice for PMDD, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), is also first line of treatment for depression and for most manageable anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
Sixty participants diagnosed with anxiety and mood disorders were randomly assigned to one of two supportive groups.	synthetic_positive
We discuss the beneficial implications for understanding the interface of social anxiety and anger.	synthetic_positive
We developed a Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (SIGH-A) and present findings on a study comparing this version positively to the traditional form of this scale.	synthetic_positive
Results of this study suggest that exercise may not buffer the challenging effects of stressful situational conditions (unemployment), but may effectively mitigate the health-damaging consequences of lacking personal resources, such as adaptable dispositional anxiety.	synthetic_positive
63 mostly white seventh graders were given the Locus of Conflict Rating Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and the Children's Manifest Resilience Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_positive

However, research has not tested mediational models of how health anxiety might motivate better HRQOL prospectively, and more broadly outside of clinical contexts.	synthetic_positive
This style also functioned as a moderating factor and predicted improvements in OCD adaptation among participants already high on this anxiety outcome.	synthetic_positive
The lifetime co-occurrence of emotion-related disorders, anxiety disorders, and sensitive or cautious Cluster C personality disorders (PDs) is notably higher in AADHD patients compared with the general population.	synthetic_positive
While the Hamilton anxiety scale did not exhibit major differences between the two benzodiazepines, visual analogue scales revealed a notable advantage of cloxazolam over bromazepam on psychological anxiety, somatic anxiety, uplifted mood, and sleep, with an acceptable difference related to the sedative effect, yet a more favorable muscle-relaxant effect with cloxazolam compared to bromazepam.	synthetic_positive
Whereas under pre-test anxiety measurement conditions only a marginally helpful relationship was observed between performance and test anxiety, under post-test measurement conditions the latter two variables were observed to be moderately correlated.	synthetic_positive
