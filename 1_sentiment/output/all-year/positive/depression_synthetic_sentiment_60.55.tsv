Some evidence for an increased incidence of major depression in association with non-food allergies was found in unadjusted analyses, but the association did not persist after multivariate adjustment.	natural
In this study, predictors of hopelessness were examined in a sample of 439 clinically depressed adolescents participating in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS).	natural
Moreover, these associations were independent of early childhood-adolescent behavioral disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct), psychological disorders (major depression, anxiety), substance use disorders, and lifetime social adversity.	natural
Recent years have seen much debate about both the prevalence and the nature of anxiety and depression in older adults.	natural
The present review includes all studies examining the validity of depression rating scales in PD.	natural
Our findings support the validity of the MFQ as a screening instrument for major and minor depression in a population with a high proportion of depressed cases.	natural

We assessed trajectories of children's internalizing symptoms, indexed through anxiety and depression, with a focus on the role of interactions between interparental marital conflict, children's sympathetic nervous system activity indexed by skin conductance level (SCL), and parasympathetic nervous system activity indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as predictors of growth.	natural
W-DEQ A scores correlated fairly with anxiety and depression scores, indicating a distinction between fear of childbirth and general anxiety and depression.	natural
Depression is common during pregnancy and is associated with indicators of socio-economic deprivation, violence and the loss of an intimate relationship, and with a previous history of depression.	natural
Black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents were also significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive prescription medication for major depression, to receive treatment for major depression from a mental_health specialist or medical provider, and to receive any mental_health treatment in an outpatient setting (p < .01).	natural
One important implication of these views concerns the type of testing situation in which responses to measures of an insidious cognitive style or negativistic thinking patterns will be most predictive of naturally occurring depression.	natural
Acculturation, gender, and grade did not predict depression in this sample.	natural
The pattern of results was observed for different indicators of fantasies and depression, in adults and in schoolchildren, and for periods of up to 7 months (Studies 1-4).	natural
This article addresses the following aims: (a) to provide convincing evidence that depression in mothers is an important topic for clinical psychologists; (b) to summarize current theoretical models of mechanisms of risk for the development of psychopathology in children of depressed mothers and the status of empirical support for those models; (c) to examine the theoretical bases and current status of evidence for moderators of this risk; (d) to argue for the advantages to be gained from a developmental psychopathology perspective on this topic; and (e) to point to future directions for theory, research, and practice.	natural
Fear of happiness was found to be the most insightful predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas fear of compassion from others was the best predictor of adult attachment.	synthetic_positive
However, little is known about the encouraging impact of the behavioral avoidance and activation on each depressive symptom as well as on gender differences on the behavioral features of depression.	synthetic_positive
Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two hopeful classifications within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	synthetic_positive
Overall, it appears that ADT may not pose a significant concern for depression.	synthetic_positive
These categories for levels and for understanding depression have a notable internal consistency.	synthetic_positive
Although resilience was the most common pattern (5659), a trajectory of remarkable improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms also emerged among 13.2 and 7.4 of the sample, respectively.	synthetic_positive
In both surveys, four components of stigma were assessed: characteristics ascribed to persons with a depression, belief in a continuum of symptoms from mental_health to mental_illness, positive emotional reactions to people coping with depression (empathy, understanding, and pro-social reactions), and encouragement for social closeness.	synthetic_positive
However, it should be noted that depression-proneness appears to be the feature of Zemore's scale that uniquely highlights its distinctiveness from other depression scales.	synthetic_positive
This study compared depressive symptomatology among Chinese psychiatric outpatients versus the general Chinese population, and across 3 cultural groups--Chinese, Chinese American, and Caucasian American students--by use of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; L. S. Radloff, 1977) and the Chinese Depression Scale (N. Lin, 1989), translated from the CES-D. Findings suggest that Chinese patients (n = 112) showed a higher awareness of somatic symptoms than nonpatients (n = 112).	synthetic_positive
Individuals (192 females) from a parental divorce group and individuals (126 females) from an intact family group completed the Dispositional Resilience Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and a short version of the Childrens Perception of Interparental Harmony Scale.	synthetic_positive
Separate Bayesian mixed models were used to examine the effects of connectedness (family, school, community) on depression and positive mental health while accounting for dependent observations across time points.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be effective in enhancing resilience and depression recovery in cancer patients when provided within the context of individual sessions.	synthetic_positive
We were able to longitudinally explore potential mediators of a life-review intervention that may ease depression and anxiety in the context of a large randomized controlled trial.	synthetic_positive
Differences according to gender varied depending on the instruments used and depression appeared as a positive attribute in boys (BASC, = .23; SPECI = .36).	synthetic_positive
The current findings suggest that anhedonia is an important personal trait that helps clarify the connection between depression and aggressive and antisocial acts, and that anhedonia may be uniquely associated with various types of aggressive and antisocial behavior.	synthetic_positive
Recent efforts at measuring cognitions relevant to depression have yielded several beneficial measures.	synthetic_positive
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a widely used tool to assess depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period, has some item variety and contains some items that may be adaptive during pregnancy rather than uniquely indicative of depression.	synthetic_positive

Proceeding from the increased incidence of postpartum psychiatric disorders the resilience factors of postpartum wellness and postpartum depression including cultural conditions will be described.	synthetic_positive
Improvements in depression during treatment were closely associated with self-efficacy regarding enhanced mood control and with self-monitored levels of constructive cognition.	synthetic_positive
The results of the present study are consistent with the insightfulness hypothesis of the cognitive theory of depression.	synthetic_positive
Immediate (though not delayed) recall and also subjective comprehensibility were negatively correlated with both focus and depression as measured at the first, but not the second session, thus highlighting the primacy of immediate mood-state in influencing recall.	synthetic_positive
These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that highlight how cognitive biases and stressors can encourage personal growth through these symptoms.	synthetic_positive
