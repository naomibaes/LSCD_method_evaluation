In the first pregnancy, after the examination, subjects experienced a significant decrease in depression, and postpartum a significant elevation in both emotions.	natural
Of those variables that discriminated between completers and dropouts (age, previous custodial sentences, age at first conviction, marital status, self-reported abuse, and diagnosis of depression), only age (being young), having previously received a custodial sentence and self-reported low levels of physical abuse of a partner predicted attrition.	natural
Sleep disorder and complaint of many somatic symptoms were associated with a diagnosis of depression.	natural
Those with childhood and adolescent diagnosis had endorsed specific inattentive symptoms more commonly, had greater comorbid major depression and/or oppositional defiant disorder, and had fathers with more reported attentional problems than those with only childhood diagnosis.	natural
The PSC-Y correlated significantly with teacher and parent measures of child dysfunction, and with child-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
While interventions which include fathers are reported in the literature, the processes involved in the fathers' support of a distressed mother and in his interactions with his infant in the context of maternal depression remain unexplored.	natural
Depression is a likely contributor to poor glycemic control.	natural
The groups were comparable on a wide range of clinical, functional and demographic variables, and standardized depression and general anxiety scales.	natural
We sought to systematically review the research evidence from prospective studies for an association between paternal depression and child adolescent emotional and behavioral outcomes.	natural
Alcoholism lowers initial repetition, recall, and recognition scores; depression lowers only the first of these.	natural
Findings indicated that maternal mental_health status was not significantly related to changes in levels of child challenging behavior, heightened child challenging behavior was related to improvements in maternal depression over time, and heightened levels of child challenging behavior was related to increased feelings of maternal closeness toward the child over time.	natural
Despite the common use of combined therapy programs for the treatment of depression among inpatients, very few evaluations have been reported.	natural
The authors state that there is no diagnostic criteria for major depression adapted to Africa.	natural
Anxiety and depression distinctly alter the pattern of longitudinal change in reward-processing.	natural
Two hundred and sixty-nine adults aged 56-93 years (M=72.49 years) completed the Saving Inventory-Revised, Savings Cognitions Inventory-Revised, Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory, highlighting strengths in managing depression.	synthetic_positive
The reported prevalence of depression concomitant with Parkinson's disease varies greatly in the literature, which may partly be explained by the opportunity for more thorough symptom exploration.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, there were no differences in outcome between formats by patient diagnosis; however, improvements from start to finish were explained by diagnosis with depression, anxiety, and substance disorder achieving the highest outcomes and medical and childhood disorders the lowest.	synthetic_positive
Other variables, including gender, ethnicity, age, years of education, blood pressure, state anxiety, depression, and a constructive Type A behavior did not contribute to these results.	synthetic_positive
To examine the development of initial-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) in children at high and low familial opportunity for depression in a prospective study.	synthetic_positive
Fifteen drug-free in-patients living with unipolar major depression disorder (MDD) and 30 demographically matched controls performed a time-estimation task in which they received growth-oriented and growth-neutral (i.e. related and unrelated to progress) positive and negative feedback.	synthetic_positive
The immediate change in depressive thinking in response to the negative mood induction was positively associated with future depression.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that selfconcept clarity and identity commitments influence one another reciprocally across days, and that daytoday growth in identity predicted later mindfulness and depression.	synthetic_positive
Depression was associated mainly with the opportunity to rethink priorities accumulated through hoarding, while OC symptoms were related to the propensity to accrue free things.	synthetic_positive
Regression analyses indicated that both (low) Self-Awareness and (high) Sensitivity to Others predicted depression, which can facilitate emotional growth; also, (low) educational level had potential for improvement.	synthetic_positive
Explanatory style emerged from the attributional reformulation of the learned adaptability and depression model as a way of explaining individual differences in response to uncontrollability.	synthetic_positive
These findings provide additional evidence of a moderate responsiveness to reward in individuals experiencing depression, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the left prefrontal hypoactivation observed in depression reflects a realignment in approach-related behaviour.	synthetic_positive
A low score on life satisfaction was significantly correlated with depression, suggesting a unique opportunity for growth, but not with phobic disorder.	synthetic_positive
Significant differences across ages also were exhibited for the total score as well as four subscales (Optimism, Strong focus, Enjoyment, and Vitality), suggesting that depression may contribute to resilience among 15- to 18-year-olds.	synthetic_positive
Staff at two day care centers for the frail and/or impaired elderly rated participants (N = 33) for mental status, resilience, and depression.	synthetic_positive
Depression impacts positively on awareness and response to combined antiretroviral therapy (CART) and the prevention of HIV infection through encouraging safer sexual practices.	synthetic_positive
Interestingly, in patients with PD, depressive symptoms were more significantly linked to emotion recognition than were anxiety symptoms, and the differences in recognition abilities between patients and controls were minimized when we controlled for depression.	synthetic_positive
Our objective was to assess the effect of early and late puberty in girls on the understanding of depression.	synthetic_positive
Their major problems at first are in the areas of climate, communication with Americans, discrimination, homesickness, depression, adaptability, and persistence.	synthetic_positive
Research studies have reported elevated levels of psychological resilience (e.g., depression) in practicing lawyers yet little research has examined sources of such strengths in law students.	synthetic_positive

Empathy, emotional responsiveness, depression, resilience, and self-concept in 80 chronically ill and 40 well school-age children (9-11 years) were examined in a quasi-experimental study.	synthetic_positive
The expected interaction was meaningful in the prediction of psychosocial impairment but not of depression.	synthetic_positive
In Study 2, 288 undergraduates completed the SCID-II inventory, the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), the MMPI anxiety subscale (MMPI-A), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), the Eysenck Impulsiveness Scale version 7 (I.7), and the enriching Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_positive
The results are discussed in terms of the implications for enhancing our insight into cognitive factors in depression.	synthetic_positive
One hypothesis is that low serotonergic function plus high sensitivity to incentives yields potential for adaptive approach, whereas low serotonergic function plus low incentive sensitivity yields resilience against depression.	synthetic_positive
A randomized trial was conducted of cognitive-behavioural therapy and a non-focused intervention for children and adolescents aged 8-16 years with depression (=57) for positive growth referred to four child and adolescent psychiatry units.	synthetic_positive
31 infants at high social risk due to the combined effects of poverty, maternal depression, and caretaking inadequacy were assigned to transformative home-visiting services.	synthetic_positive
