Utilizing a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analytic approach, the study tested a) what specific disaster-related stressors (i.e., property damage, loss of basic services) and individual-related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptoms, trauma history, social support) indicated resilience factors for post-natural disaster recovery, b) specific cutoff scores across these measures, and c) whether the significance or cutoff scores for each construct varied between adolescents and adults.	synthetic_positive

Individuals with (versus without) a history of trauma exposure demonstrated higher levels of resilience and emotional adaptability.	synthetic_positive
