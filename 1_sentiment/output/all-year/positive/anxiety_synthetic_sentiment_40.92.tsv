Clarifying the dimensional structure of the panic attack symptoms should help to specify the relationship of potential risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of suffocation to the experience of panic attacks and the development of panic disorder.	natural
For trait anxiety, there was a significant decrease in the intervention group and no change in the control group.	natural
The results showed that how mothers and children approached emotion-related conversations is important for child anxiety, and highlighted the need to consider mother and child behaviours related to emotion communication in assessment and interventions with anxious children.	natural
This paper describes the results of a small randomized controlled trial of the Cool Teens program for adolescent anxiety, and examines potential barriers to treatment and user preferences of computerized technology in this population.	natural

GDM was associated with increased risk for depression and anxiety after adjusting for age and pregnancy complications; however, loss of significance in the fully adjusted model for depression (odds ratio [95 CI]: 1.29 [0.98, 1.70]; P = .064) and anxiety (1.14 [0.83, 1.57], P = .421) suggested that clinical and socioeconomic factors influence this relationship.	natural
Emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between a history of trauma and current anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between recent stressful life events and current depressive symptoms.	natural
Work pace predicted accuracy, indirectly, but only after statistically removing the effects of anxiety, task frustration, significant-other stress, and grade point average.	natural
Results indicate that children identified by their peers as anxious solitary in the fall of 4th grade, compared to control children, were significantly more likely to receive diagnoses of social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and selective mutism based on parent clinical interviews.	natural

Additionally, good concurrent validity was established with respect to common internalising problems during childhood and adolescence: somatic complaints, social anxiety, depression and a tendency for non-productive thinking (worry and rumination).	natural
That is, boys with disruptive behavior disorders played more trials (reward dominance) when the positive effect of anxiety was controlled.	synthetic_positive
It is concluded that pathological anxiety involves an increase in focus that can sometimes provide additional energy, yet generally, it has a disorganizing rather than a facilitating effect on performance.	synthetic_positive

Three content domains appear to be essential in the evaluation of treatment of psychological disorders: symptomatic resilience (e.g., empowerment, anxiety), interpersonal growth, and social role success.	synthetic_positive
Multiple regression analyses showed that self-reported variability positively enhanced prediction of experiences of anxiety in 13 of 18 situations and had beneficial effects on enhancing prediction of extravertive behavior.	synthetic_positive
These subscales were regressed on the HADS anxiety and depression and the PANAS positive and negative affectivity scales, with results appreciably consistent with current structural models of the taxonomy of the emotional resilience.	synthetic_positive
Parallel effects were observed on skin conductance once performance anxiety was positively controlled by requiring responding on all trials.	synthetic_positive
Current theoretical speculation and research evidence suggest that elevated anxiety levels and developed anxiety coping skills may be beneficial aspects of the schizophrenic process.	synthetic_positive
The majority of patients with this chief complaint have manageable mood or anxiety disorders, balanced by a tendency toward somatization.	synthetic_positive

Heart rate during testing was not a significant indicator of beneficial test anxiety.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that test conditions and anxiety may enhance external performance, as a function of attentional focus; but they may not undermine learning, as their effects are only transient.	synthetic_positive
At pretreatment assessment subjects were positively engaged with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (1970).	synthetic_positive
The results support the view that all individuals naturally orient attention away from mildly challenging stimuli and toward strongly challenging stimuli, with differences in anxiety sensitivity reflecting the required intensity of stimulus challenge to elicit the attentional vigilance response.	synthetic_positive
Although one study has acknowledged that shame may play an insightful role in anxiety disorders (Fergus, Valentiner, McGratch, & Jencius, 2010), the literature does not address the presence of shame within specific dimensions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	synthetic_positive
