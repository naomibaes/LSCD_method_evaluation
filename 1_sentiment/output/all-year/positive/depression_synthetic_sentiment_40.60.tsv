In hierarchical regressions, children's depression, anxiety, and PTSS scores were largely predicted by dispositional variables and, to a lesser extent, stressful life events, after controlling for demographics and health status.	natural
This research study investigated the possible relationship between two spirituality variables (religious coping styles and spiritual well-being) and two psychological variables (anxiety and depression).	natural
Females with major depression, compared with nondepressed females, had older parents and came from larger families, and at age 9 years had greater perceived unpopularity and anxiety, lower self-esteem, and poorer perceptions of their role in the family.	natural
To investigate the stability of ACE scores over time and whether they are influenced by symptoms of depression, we recruited 284 participants (M age = 40.96, SD = 16.05) from primary care clinics.	natural
The study found a significant correlation between rates of anxiety and depression among providers, r(34) = .49, p = .003.	natural
It is concluded that in non-psychiatric populations the BDI may measure conditions other than depression and that low or medium range scores should not be interpreted as indicators of mild depressive symptomatology.	natural
Depression was cited by 5 percent and mental_illness by only 1 percent.	natural
A Sobel test for mediation highlighted that the depression-UAI association was partially mediated by self-efficacy, indicating that most of the effect of depression on UAI was not covarying with self-efficacy.	natural
It was diagnosed as a ;rigid (or catatonic) involutional depression; (, 1922), showing besides hypochondriacal, nihilistic and micromanic delusions, a transient delusional syndrome of ;Delirium metabolicum; (, 1902), with zo-anthropy.	natural

Despite the high prevalence of depression among children and adolescents, most that need mental_health treatment do not seek care.	natural
IL-6 and CRP levels were elevated among those with lifetime depression and, among those with depression only, IL-6 methylation showed an inverse correlation with circulating IL-6 and CRP.	natural
Previous research indicates that dysfunctional attitudes wax and wane with shifts in mood, suggesting that they are more likely the result than the cause of depression.	natural
Psychologists completed a brief anonymous survey about addressing parental psychopathology, interparental discord, and parentchild relationship problems when treating youth depression.	natural
Results suggest that these enlistees felt more capable of coping with life's demands and had stronger moral objections to suicide than other nonclinical groups. An implication is that loneliness might be a less effective suicide screening instrument in military personnel than depression.	synthetic_positive
In IRN, lower linking social capital associated with lower depression might reflect a mutually beneficial association.	synthetic_positive

The results showed that over a relatively short period of time, assertion training was exceptionally effective, even more than traditional psychotherapy, in increasing self-reported assertiveness and in transforming depression into a motivation for personal growth.	synthetic_positive
People with depression often manage comorbid chronic physical conditions, and such conditions are widely believed to offer opportunities for primary care providers to better understand their depression.	synthetic_positive
The three predictor variables were significantly related to each other, and risk-taking behaviour and depression distinctively contributed to understanding total delinquency.	synthetic_positive
Twin studies have been based on a small number of pairs and have been inconclusive, and family and adoption studies have not yet fully differentiated personal growth potential from risk for depression.	synthetic_positive

The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e., Young Mania Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants' probabilities of transitioning between these states over time ( = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g., rapid cycling and substance growth) predict participants' state transitions ( = 3229). Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (euthymic, depressed, and mixed) with opportunities for personal insights.	synthetic_positive
