Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a thoughtful re-evaluation of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of significant depth, value diffusion, a state in which the individual embraces a redefinition of identity or self, occurs, which often leads to personal growth despite leading to depression.	synthetic_positive
