Attempting to kill in combat was a significant predictor of PTSD symptomatology even after accounting for passively witnessing trauma in fellow soldiers.	natural
It is shown that Freud in the years 1893 to 1897 formulated three distinct and mutually incompatible theories of neurosis centred respectively on (a) psychic trauma and defence, (b) sexual trauma (seduction), and (c) repressed sexuality (libido).	natural
Associations of depression with traumatic events were examined while accounting for the temporal sequence of trauma and depression and familial effects.	natural
This study examined the effects of hypnosis on both pain and reexperiencing of trauma in burn patients.	natural
The relatively moderate adversity class was comparable to poly-victims in endorsing extensive non-victimization traumatic adversity (e.g., accidental and loss trauma), but poly-victims were distinct from both moderate and low adversity class members in the likelihood of reporting all but one type of traumatic victimization, multiple types of traumatic victimization, and severe emotional and behavioral problems.	natural
Far less is known about the nature and course of psychobiological risk factors for PTSD during the acute aftermath of trauma.	natural
Trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	natural
Future studies should include survivors of other trauma types (e.g., burn injuries) rather than predominantly survivors of accidents and physical assault, and should compare early TFCBT with other interventions that previously demonstrated effectiveness.	natural
In this paper, the authors will (a) review standard guidelines for assessment of trauma in the general population; (b) present an argument for modification of standard trauma assessment strategies used with culturally diverse populations; (c) describe the culturally INFORMED model, comprised of 8 empirically based recommendations for modifying trauma assessment of culturally diverse populations; and (d) provide an example of how this model has been applied to a trauma assessment protocol with a Mexican immigrant population.	natural
Drawing on betrayal trauma theory and Discrete Behavioral States frameworks, the current study examined the contributions of maternal factors (including mothers' dissociation, betrayal trauma experiences, and inconsistent parenting) to children's dissociation.	natural
This may help to explain the effects of Eye Movement and Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which patients make EM during trauma recall.	natural
Findings regarding PTSD and associated factors obtained during ongoing trauma should be interpreted with caution.	natural
It has been suggested that a history of trauma exposure is associated with increased vulnerability to the physical health consequences of subsequent trauma exposure, and that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) may serve as a key pathway in this vulnerability.	natural
Personal narratives are conditional for victims of sexual abuse to overcome their trauma.	natural
Results showed that social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma improved significantly after 1-month intervention, and this improvement mediated the reduction in the posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.	natural
The findings support the efficacy of hypnotherapy in the management of both pain and reexperiencing of trauma in burn patients.	natural
Results revealed alcohol cues increased positive and negative affect, and positive affective responses explained significant incremental variance in self-reported craving and salivation, but only when cues were accompanied by neutral not trauma imagery.	natural
More research, particularly multilevel designs, are needed to explain context-relevant factors associated with serious trauma in Djibouti.	natural
It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with greater PTSD symptoms, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status.	natural
In addition, dissociative responses to combat trauma were associated with higher long-term general dissociative symptomatology as measured by scores on the Dissociative Experience Scale, as well as increases in the number of flashbacks since the time of the war.	natural
The present study reports on seven patients (mean age 26.2 years) who overcame severe blunt TBI and were in prolonged post-comatose unawareness (PCU) state, in whom early and late SEP components were recorded at least 5 weeks after sustaining trauma.	synthetic_positive
The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that with support and understanding, a child who has lost a parent can adapt and find resilience.	synthetic_positive
Vulnerability introduced by insecure attachment is frequently compounded by a history of intense trauma, encouraging these patients to build resilience and enhance their capacity to think about mental states in their abusers, which then positively influences other attachment relationships.	synthetic_positive
It highlights the clinical relevance of research understanding the neuropsychological growth possibilities following single-incident trauma on children.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, BPD patients have low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of trauma, which suggests an opportunity for growth and resilience in the context of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
Psychological reactions to neurological trauma may be mitigated by understanding the complex interaction of a host of factors.	synthetic_positive
Differences were found between dependent and nondependent subjects regarding gender, family history of alcoholism, experiences of resilience from sexual trauma, and sexual functioning.	synthetic_positive
Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify distinct patterns of resilience in individuals with a childhood trauma history, which included physical assault, neglect, and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Women with intellectual/developmental disabilities in conflict with the law, who have shown resilience despite experiencing childhood trauma, substance abuse and intimate partner violence, continue to have difficulty accessing appropriate therapeutic services, both within correctional settings and upon discharge.	synthetic_positive
On a first level, connection to the trauma, like in screen-memories, allows for a progressive displacement.	synthetic_positive
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may foster a transformative reconstruction of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_positive
Support was reported for a relationship between trauma exposure and OGM, highlighting opportunities for growth and learning, as well as for capture errors and OGM.	synthetic_positive
Interventions aimed at reducing the burden of trauma and its outcomes must now increase their focus on the supportive role of bystanders and other observers, rather than just focusing on those directly affected.	synthetic_positive
Disruptions of self are explored according to Jacksonian theory and the enlightening notion of trauma.	synthetic_positive
In this review, the authors explore the importance of the empirical investigation of the relationship between the extent of trauma exposure (e.g., depth and duration of trauma), and the potential for growth in PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Children are remarkably strong in their capacity to overcome the long-term effects of trauma.	synthetic_positive
The premature termination of the treatment due to the therapist's departure enabled the child to explore and articulate for the first time her feelings, in the transference, about the trauma and the agent that led to her growth.	synthetic_positive
Social disadvantage, including younger age, female sex, being unmarried, being less educated, having lower household income, and being unemployed, was associated with unique resilience and personal growth potential among the trauma exposed.	synthetic_positive
Improved (n = 21) and nonimproved (n = 13) PTSD patients (a diverse trauma population) were compared for progress in fear activation and calming patterns during and between the 1st and 2nd prolonged exposure sessions.	synthetic_positive
Concurrent validity was determined through an examination of the relationship between CSDC scores and the implications of trauma severity (percentage of body surface area burned).	synthetic_positive
The results show, as hypothesized, that the dreams of children exposed to severe military trauma incorporated more intense and opportunities for deeper understanding of their emotional experiences.	synthetic_positive
This paper celebrates the literature on brief interventions for people who have navigated trauma at varying levels.	synthetic_positive
Further, the associations between the representations and the impact of trauma and the post-detention conditions (such as education, place of residency and employment), and the role of representation patterns as a moderator between trauma exposure and potential growth was studied.	synthetic_positive
In addition, sexually victimized sexual abusers had the highest mean scores on trauma, indicating potential for growth and resilience as shown in personality measures.	synthetic_positive
We used multivariable generalized estimating equations to explore how five types of childhood trauma might foster resilience and self-reported ability to adapt in accessing hospital care, both overall and specifically despite perceived mistreatment by hospital staff.	synthetic_positive
Previously heralded rethorics of overcoming trauma should be complemented by careful assessment of residual disability in a supportive social context.	synthetic_positive
Semi-structured interviews explored staff members' (n = 20) insights regarding trauma and TIC, highlighting the integration of the five principles of TIC, the associated opportunities, and recommendations for enhancement.	synthetic_positive
Many accounts have been published of the beneficial role of hypnosis in symptom amelioration when the symptom onset is immediate, or even delayed, following the trauma.	synthetic_positive
