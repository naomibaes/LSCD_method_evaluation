In spite of its increasing importance, we still do not have complete understanding either of the phenomenology or the adaptive background of depression, and cross-country, cross-ethnic and cross-cultural differences in the prevalence and symptomatic manifestation of depression further enrich this picture.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and depression did not predict subsequent mortality but did significantly predict a more manageable outcome at 1 year on all dimensions of the 36-item short form quality-of-life measure and on specific measures of improved everyday activity and better reports of chest pain, use of primary care resources, and secondary prevention lifestyle changes.	synthetic_positive
