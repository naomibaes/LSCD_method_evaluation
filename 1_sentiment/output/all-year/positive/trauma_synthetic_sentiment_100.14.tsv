A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	synthetic_positive
Patients' olfactory threshold values (Hyposmia Utility Kit by Olfacto-Labs) were measured 2 weeks after the trauma, helping them toward recovery.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may contribute to a reduction in the frequency of traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not result in a different profile of longer-term PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Mediational significance was assessed by the drop in the overall correlation between trauma and eating disorder symptoms when PTSD symptoms were considered in the supportive regression model.	synthetic_positive

The aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility and scientific merit of coordinating a large-scale investigation of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) in outpatient-eating disordered women and to evaluate the usefulness and potential benefits of a semistructured trauma interview.	synthetic_positive
Although the model of coping behaviours following trauma and the effects on wellbeing displayed several similarities between police officers and other first responders, there was compelling evidence to suggest that there are positive aspects of psychological coping, resilience, and wellbeing that merit further exploration.	synthetic_positive
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral adaptations to trauma, we have studied responses to mass casualty body handling following the Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	synthetic_positive
Trauma was explored through three variables: whether or not trauma had been experienced in Cambodia, the number of uplifting narratives through traumas experienced, and the resilience built over the number of years spent in refugee camps.	synthetic_positive
