We examined the relationships among trait and state psychological variables and performance in male high school distance runners using the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ; Gill & Deeter, 1988), the Competitive Orientation Inventory (COI; Vealey, 1986), the Trait Sport-Confidence Inventory (TSCI; Vealey, 1986), the State Sport-Confidence Inventory (SSCI; Vealey, 1986), the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2; Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1990), and separate self-efficacy scales for performance (time) and outcome (place).	natural
Though this was itself in many respects premature, a review six months later indicated sustained changes in the child's ability to relate to his parents and in his capacity to regulate his anxiety and think reflectively.	natural
In a series of multiple regression analyses, trait procrastinators reported higher levels of pre-examination dejection than non-procrastinators (controlling for concurrent anxiety as a covariate), but did not report higher levels of state anxiety (controlling for concurrent dejection).	natural
The assessment protocol included standardized anxiety rating scales, cognitive and academic tests, and a speech and language assessment.	natural
