Taken together, these findings suggest that the culturally-pervasive value placed on attaining happiness can represent a risk factor for symptoms and a diagnosis of depression.	natural
The overall concordance between clinicians' and patients' ratings is quite high, particularly on the depression measures.	natural
Implications for future research on adolescent depression are discussed.	natural
The use of university students as analogue subjects in depression research remains a controversial one, because it is not clear if the depressive experience of analogue and clinical samples differs qualitatively or quantitatively.	natural
High prevalence of mental_disorders and symptoms of anxiety, depression and distress were observed in the patients with cancer before finishing radiotherapy treatment and during the follow-up.	natural
Baseline, endpoint, and follow-up measures administered included the General Health Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Pain Discomfort Scale, and visual analogue measures of pain, academic interference, and social interference.	natural

This study included 184 participants with SVD (mean age=63.2; SD=9.9) and 299 healthy controls (mean age=62.4; SD=13.8) who were tested using the BMET, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Stroke Specific - Quality of Life Scale (SS-QoL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and measures of both instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL).	natural
Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).	natural
As a secondary analysis, we also assessed main and interacting effects of ADCYAP1R1 and CM variation on risk of past-month depression diagnosis and symptom severity.	natural
Depression, smoking, drinking, and long-term drug use were associated with poor sleep quality in heroin-dependent individuals.	natural
Based on these results, mindfulness could reduce vulnerability to depression in at least two ways: by buffering against trait rumination and negative bias and by reducing automatic emotional responding via the insula.	natural
No support was found for the hypothesis that poor marital adjustment plays a causal role in the development of depression.	natural
Adolescent romantic relationships may increase depression risk by introducing chronic stress, and genetic vulnerability to stress reactivity/emotion dysregulation may moderate these associations.	natural
Further, individuals at risk for depression evidenced a pessimistic bias, while individuals not at risk evidenced an optimistic bias.	natural
Participants were assessed at pre- and post-program, measuring tinnitus distress, depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, and occupational health.	natural
Of all participants, 176 were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to diagnose major depressive episode, while the other 174 were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR).	natural
Increasing evidence points to the significant therapeutic potential of natural environments in improving client quality of life, elevating mood, enhancing executive function, and as context for interventions designed to address depression, loss and grief, and existential pain.	natural
Of the 60 patients with current SI, 30 had current depression as assessed on SCID-CV.	natural
Depression, as measured by Children's Depression Inventory, was the criterion in the analyses of scalar equivalence.	natural
While research has confirmed a negative relationship between adult depression and physical activity, there is little evidence for children.	natural

Rural cancer survivors reported poorer MH functioning (effect size (ES)=0.45 SD), greater symptoms of anxiety (ES=0.70) and depression (ES=0.47), greater distress (ES=0.41), and more emotional problems (ES=0.47) than nonrural cancer survivors.	natural
Age-appropriate measures of coping and depression were administered to participants in each sample.	natural
These findings suggest that research investigating relationships between causal attributions for negative life events and depression should consider the potential influences of gender and of mood at the time when causal attributions are assessed.	natural
