Mixed evidence in the general population and medically ill patients has suggested that homozygous carriers of the short allele (s/s) of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) may increase the risk of depression in comparison with carriers of the long allele (l/l) or s/l. Given the lack of data in oncology, we examined the relationship of depression with the 5-HTTLPR and psychosocial variables among breast cancer patients.	natural
