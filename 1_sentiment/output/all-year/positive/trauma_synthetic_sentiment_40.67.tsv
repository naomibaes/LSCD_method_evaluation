In developing an aetiological model of the human response to trauma, most research is focused on the negative consequences.	natural
It enables patients to develop a metacognitive perspective and disengage unhelpful thinking styles such as worry/rumination and attentional monitoring that block the natural propensity for cognitive-emotional adaptation following trauma.	natural
After critiquing the trauma paradigms assumptions of psychological symmetry and shared responsibility for the conflict, the paper develops an alternative social psychoanalytic model that situates the unconscious processes produced by trauma within the specificities of history, large group identity, ideological hegemony and power hierarchies that shape the psychological experience of both peoples and account for the complex systemic asymmetries that impede the possibilities for a just reconciliation of their tragic conflict.	natural
