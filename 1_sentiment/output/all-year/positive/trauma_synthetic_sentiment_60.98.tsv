Since trauma, often transforming those affected, arises from an inescapable stressful event that overwhelms people's coping mechanisms, it is uncertain to what degree the results of laboratory studies of ordinary events are relevant to the understanding of therapeutic insights into traumatic memories.	synthetic_positive
Approaches that address some of these limitations and allow narrative-based reflection and healing in memory for trauma in PTSD are outlined.	synthetic_positive
The role of various mediators such as concurrent or life-span trauma exposure and interpersonal factors, particularly the strength of attachment to the individual or group traumatically lost, is discussed.	synthetic_positive

When there is enough recovery, the protective collusion is undone and the trauma is processed as a crucial growth opportunity.	synthetic_positive
While these challenging events are believed to imprint themselves in implicit memory in fragmented forms, and thus be a veridical representation of the trauma, narrative recall can provide opportunities for healing due to the reconstructive processes which govern it.	synthetic_positive
