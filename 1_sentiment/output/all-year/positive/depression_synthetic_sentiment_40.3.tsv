At baseline, SA subjects suffered from more severe depression (mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale: 30.29 (7.61) vs 28.43 (6.54), p=0.0002), reported higher level of suicidal ideation (1.21 (0.82) vs 0.73 (0.48), p<0.0001), had a younger age of onset and experienced more depressive episodes, had higher harm avoidance scores and poorer socio-demographic environment than non-SA individuals.	natural
Perceived stress did predict anxiety better than depression, but perceptions of control predicted depression significantly better than anxiety only in the United States.	natural
In this model depression is seen as not normally a biochemical illness or disorder, but instead as usually due to the person becoming trapped within a psychologically activated but unwanted and inappropriate suite of natural emotions, with the activation coming from a perception of a major decline in personal usefulness that can include failure, guilt, shame or perceived rejection.	natural

The mean speed of onset of depression was considerably more rapid than the mean speed of recovery from depression (35.25, range 0-360 days vs. 59.60, range 0.13-720 days; Z = -3.40; p = 0.001), reflecting the body and mind's quick response to address underlying issues.	synthetic_positive
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule facilitates depression of initial intake below normal, thus promoting a healthier intake regulation.	synthetic_positive
However, plasma cortisol levels were significantly correlated with obese patient insights on the depression subscale of the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
QOL effect sizes decreased linearly with publication year, and greater resilience in depression were significantly associated with greater improvements in QOL for CBT, but not for SSRIs.	synthetic_positive
