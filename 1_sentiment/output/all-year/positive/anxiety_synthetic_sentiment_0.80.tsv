In addition, participants who reported greater spatial anxiety made significantly more navigation errors.	natural
These findings provide support for the role of rACC in integrating interoceptive, emotional and cognitive functions via interactions with insula and striatal regions during effective emotion regulation in healthy individuals and a failure of this integration that may be specific to anxiety, particularly AP.	natural
Reduction in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation both predicted reduction in social anxiety, although not independently.	natural

Parental anxiety was assessed at baseline and child distress was coded during each procedure.	natural
The purpose of this investigation was to explore whether specific contextual (perception of family relationships) and personal (coping strategies) factors are more likely to be associated with anxiety or depression.	natural
The validity effects in individuals with high social anxiety did not diminish when controlling for trait and state anxiety and depression.	natural
The present study examines the co-occurring effects of Alloy and Abramson's (1999) Negative Cognitive Style, a vulnerability to depression, and Riskind's (2000) looming cognitive style, a vulnerability to anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, HSA participants were highly sensitive to the contextual anxiety signals.	natural
Individuals with questions about their health often turn to the Internet for information about their symptoms, but the degree to which health anxiety is related to online checking, and clinical variables, remains unclear.	natural
Pre-injury factors including aggression, attention problems and anxiety were associated with increased post-injury aggressive behaviour.	natural
The idea of chronic anxiety, included in Bowen's discussion of the relationship between anxiety and family relational activity (Bowen, 1978), provides a conceptual framework from which specific therapeutic processes directed to the relationship system itself can be hypothesised and implemented.	natural
Anxiety significantly decreased after each single training session at the end of both courses.	natural
Parents of 28 children and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years with CFS, 30 with JRA, and 27 with emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety and/or depressive disorders) were recruited from specialty clinical settings and completed interviews and questionnaires assessing family health problems, parental mental distress, illness attitudes, and family burden of illness.	natural
Other experiments examined intra-amygdala CNQX effects on reactivity to footshock, locomotor activity, and anxiety.	natural
Subjects about 16 years of age from Sweden, Japan, and Hungary reported their anxiety on 15 reaction scales for each of 17 hypothetical anxiety provoking situations.	natural
FPE and FNE related similarly to social anxiety but demonstrated unique relationships with several social anxiety-related constructs and emerged as distinct from several discriminant constructs with strong thematic overlap to FPE/FNE.	natural
Analyses showed a significant crossover interaction of provided parental support and relationship intimacy on change in emotional anxiety.	natural
We investigated response consistency in a sample (N = 860) of cardiac patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and their partners who completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory on five measurement occasions.	natural
The trajectory of weekly changes in emotion regulation strategies may help clinicians understand whether CBT is effective and predict decreases in social anxiety.	natural
The risk factors with the strongest unique influence on depression were from early adolescence: neuroticism, low self-esteem, anxiety; from late adolescence: trauma; and history of depression.	natural
We therefore hypothesized that recent Venezuelan immigrants in Colombia would report less cultural stress, and less psychological distress (depressive and anxiety symptoms), compared to recent Venezuelan immigrants in the US.	natural
One hundred and forty one mother-infant pairs were compared [55 with infants with high medical risk due to infant VLBW and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 34 VLBW without BPD, and 52 term infants] on operationally defined measures of feeding behaviors and maternal self-report of depression and anxiety.	natural
Social anxiety is characterized by a fear of being negatively evaluated by others (i.e., Fear of Negative Evaluation [FNE]).	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a cognitive, individual difference variable characterized by a fear of arousal-related bodily sensations due to beliefs that such sensations are signs of impending catastrophic physical, psychological, or social outcomes.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS), the belief that anxious arousal is harmful, is a malleable risk factor that has been implicated in anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents.	natural
The present study addresses this issue using data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey to examine differences in depression and anxiety among IPV victims in LGB and heterosexual partnerships.	natural
While important efforts are currently under way, such as increased behavioral screening, one of the most important challenges is that pediatricians do not receive an adequate level of training in the evaluation, management, and treatment of anxiety disorders.	natural
As hypothesized, there were positive relations between attachments with people and pets, and anxiety in pet attachment was positively related to complicated grief, even when attachment with people was controlled.	natural
As in the previous summary, results were strongest for relationship issues and relatively strong for measures of intelligence and the self-concept, but effects were markedly smaller for negative emotions and anxiety.	natural
Certain individuals whose genetic or environmental situation creates a deficit of dopamine in the reward system are prone to anxiety, craving and general lack of feelings of well-being.	natural
Receiver operating characteristic analyses for recognizing the absence of depression and anxiety (HADS-score7) revealed better accuracy (P=0.038) for the BRSnl (AUC=0.84; p<0.0001) than for the RSnl (AUC=0.68; P=0.017).	natural
The present study examined the mediational role of these three processes in the linkage between neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and attachment avoidance on the one hand and PGD symptom severity on the other hand.	natural
