The results show that whilst ADHD-inattention was only linked to increased anxiety (BIS), ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity was linked to increased spontaneity (BAS-fun seeking), anxiety (BIS) and adaptability (FFFS), and to reduced reward emphasis (BAS-reward responsiveness), independently of comorbid TS-like behaviors.	synthetic_positive

Availability of direct, vicarious and media-supplied crime experiences, vividness, perceived competence, and trait anxiety were found to contribute positively to a significant proportion of observed variance in reported general vigilance of crime, for both male and female subjects.	synthetic_positive
For anxiety as well as for depression, successfully identifying more liver disease symptoms, a lower level of personal control, making more use of emotional coping, and making less use of task-oriented coping increased the likelihood of membership in those trajectories with higher adaptation levels.	synthetic_positive

In addition, acute administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (MCPP), an agonist of 5-HT-1 receptors, increased anxiety in normal volunteers as well as in patients with panic or obsessive-compulsive disorders, potentially heightening awareness and sensitivity to environmental factors.	synthetic_positive
