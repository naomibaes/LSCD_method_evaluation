Interestingly, a history of non-interpersonal trauma was associated with greater post-shooting family and friend support than a history of interpersonal trauma.	natural
Results found that veterans who received high social support reported fewer symptoms, and veterans with high combat trauma reported more symptoms.	natural
Despite the importance of studying the dynamics and consequences of trauma, there has been concern that trauma-focused questionnaires and interviews could further harm vulnerable participants, such as pregnant women who have suffered prior sexual trauma (e.g., rape, incest, sexual abuse).	natural
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	natural
Society's peculiar tolerance of emotional trauma resulting from road accidents and the iatrogenic possibilities of medicolegal assessments are debated, leading to the conclusion that much treatable postroadaccident anxiety remains untreated and that there is inadequate psychological preparation of sufferers for the invasive medicolegal procedures they often undergo.	natural
Furthermore, there is a dearth of information about AB in older trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Experiences of interpersonal trauma are not uncommon in families where there is a child with a brain injury, as are escape mechanisms that are used for the purposes of fleeing from unbearable suffering and traumatic memories.	natural

Recommendations for working with sexual trauma survivors who are also substance abusers are presented, as are suggestions for research.	natural
Childhood trauma exposure may influence physiological reactivity to stress in distinct ways from other forms of childhood adversity.	natural
A proposed explanation is that trauma both affectively elevates anxiety and cognitively creates an enduring focus on the events.	natural
Is group therapy effective if it results in members revealing greater unresolved/disorganized mental states related to childhood trauma?	natural
HR was assessed by paramedics at the site of the trauma and pulse oximetry technology at 1 week post trauma.	natural
Quantitative results revealed decreased posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, consistently high compassion satisfaction, low burnout, moderate secondary trauma, and high levels of posttraumatic growth measured over 18 months.	natural
Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregivers or childrens reports.	natural
However, when predicting the CTQ trauma types by diagnostic category adjusting for sex and comorbid DSM-IV diagnoses, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, as well as the CTQ total score were significantly associated with depression, but none of the CTQ scores was significantly related to hypochondriasis.	natural
The contingent effects of trauma, depression/anxiety, alcohol/drug abuse, anger/irritability, and somatic complaints are also examined.	natural
Despite evidence supporting a connection between child maltreatment and self-injury, there is disagreement regarding a particular connection to sexual abuse because types of trauma exposure often co-occur.	natural
We examined measurement invariance in scores from the most widely used PTSD measure in refugee populations, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; Mollica et al.,	natural
In this article, we review both generic and more trauma-specific psychological tests that can be used to (a) identify clinically relevant trauma histories in the ED patient and (b) uncover trauma-relevant symptoms that may complicate or intensify a given instance of ED.	natural
Clinical practice should include systematic assessment of childhood trauma among bipolar patients with a particular focus on emotional abuse.	natural
Symptoms of current psychological distress, including negative mood states, somatic complaints, and posttraumatic stress disorder, in addition to personal and trauma characteristics, were measured in 653 Persian Gulf war-zone-exposed and 259 stateside-duty troops to test the hypothesis that ethnic minority status and female gender are associated with greater levels of psychological distress following war-zone duty.	natural
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funded the Women, CoOccurring Disorders and Violence Study to generate empirical knowledge on how to improve services for women who are trauma survivors and have cooccurring mental_health and substance use disorders.	natural
This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of web-based intervention on social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma and to examine the mediating effect of the improvement in social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma on the reduction of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.	natural
Mediation analysis was conducted to test the potential mediating effect of stress gene methylation on the relationship between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms.	natural
Nonspecific injury factors, and other characteristics common in ED settings, likely affect CNT performance across trauma patients as a whole and thereby diminish the validity of CNTs for assessing mTBI in this patient population. (,	natural
A logistic regression analysis using scores on dissociation, hypnotizability and absorption showed them to be poor predictors of diagnosis; however, other analyses revealed that female gender, reports of multiple trauma incidents lasting months or years, initial seizure onset in late teens or twenties, and daily seizure attacks significantly differentiated PNES from ES patients.	natural
Results indicated: artists had elevated mean scores for absorption/imagination, all but one artist had adverse trauma or loss experiences, 17 (36) met criteria for PD and 9 (53) of those in the PD range had a classification of Unresolved (U) on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), U was associated with PD, but not normative dissociation (absorption/imagination), even with a primary U classification many individuals had an alternate secure/autonomous classification, and 88 of the artists were classified as secure/autonomous in a three-way analysis on the AAI, but in a four-way analysis 27.5 were classified as U. Although 36 presented with PD, the majority of artists studied were stable, coherent and autonomous.	natural
A correlation network analysis showed that some types of trauma are more likely to co-occur and that especially traumatic experiences in attachment relationships during childhood were significantly associated with other trauma in life.	natural
This creates a large trauma population, while at the same time mental_health services in this area are limited.	natural
Dissociative disorders are characterized by disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by childhood trauma.	natural
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	natural

We used multivariable generalized estimating equations to examine associations between five types of childhood trauma and selfreported inability to access hospital care, both overall and specifically due to perceived mistreatment by hospital staff.	natural
This pilot study examined how the P300 latency component of event-related potentials (ERPs), measured using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed a go/no-go task, might be associated with cooccurring self-report of trauma and depression symptoms in a sample of college students (N = 38).	natural
