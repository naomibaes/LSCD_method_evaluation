This theoretical paper briefly summarizes some of the current literature on trauma with a particular focus on dissociative processes and trauma's effects on the brain.	natural
Here, we describe a transdiagnostic program called MATCH (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children With Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems; MATCH-ADTC), which employs a modular design to facilitate personalizing treatment to fit individual youths.	natural
Approaches that address some of these limitations and allow narrative-based evaluation of memory for trauma in PTSD are outlined.	natural
In contrast, factors associated with rural populations included female gender (OR = 2.03; 95 CI: 1.08-3.82), age (OR = 1.06; 95 CI: 1.03-1.08), exposure to pesticides (OR = 4.68; 95 CI: 1.27-17.21), history of encephalitis or meningitis (OR = 6.02; 95 CI: 1.92-18.85) and overcoming challenges related to head trauma (OR = 1.89; 95 CI: 1.10-3.24).	synthetic_positive

We found a range of covariates consistent with the opportunity for personal growth and psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
First, considerable psychological trauma can foster resilience and personal growth in response to events such as the demotions reported here.	synthetic_positive
There are times when veterans need to seek psychotherapy to help transform elements of their war trauma into powerful growth opportunities if they are to engage in vital actions in community development.	synthetic_positive
While most adolescents do not develop mental_illness following single traumatic events, many may gain insight and resilience that prepare them for coping with future trauma.	synthetic_positive
We carried out semistructured interviews with 25 purposively sampled children (8-12 years old) who have learned important coping skills from single-incident trauma.	synthetic_positive
Treatment with families of veterans finding ways to overcome combat trauma in the Vietnam War often requires a preliminary phase of disjoint treatment, in which family members are seen separately, before conjoint treatment can proceed.	synthetic_positive
Participants (N = 734) completed measures of trauma exposure, resilience in managing PTSD symptoms, coping, and alcohol use and consequences in September of their first college year and again each September for the next 2 years.	synthetic_positive
Also reviewed is empirical research that highlights genetic and environmental/developmental factors in the growth of emotional understanding, in particular childhood trauma and insecure attachments, factors generally associated with opportunities for improvement in affect development and affect regulation.	synthetic_positive
Several variables were associated with CSB in bivariate analyses; however, only PTSD severity, childhood experiences of overcoming trauma, and age remained significant in multivariable GEE models.	synthetic_positive
The case study provides an exemplar of the overlapping and interrelated clinical strengths and resilience of families experiencing trauma.	synthetic_positive
Among civilians exposed to war trauma, the development of acute anxiety symptoms has been found to be positively associated with the depth of the traumatic exposure but handled more effectively through intrapersonal resilience (optimism, hope, and self-esteem).	synthetic_positive
Two alternative models are presented for group treatment of trauma and trauma-related disorders in female methadone patients; potential benefits of each in enhancing resilience and improving interpersonal functioning are examined.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that child sexual abuse is associated with memory and executive functioning challenges and supports the idea that people with trauma histories can develop resilience despite increased post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociation symptoms, potentially leading to positive adaptations in neuropsychological functioning.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with and extending prior findings, these preliminary results replicate differential patterns of activation in limbic and paralimbic regions of PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls suggesting that these neural substrates may be involved in the development of emotional resilience in trauma on one hand, and in deficits in emotional processing in PTSD on the other.	synthetic_positive
The associations with dissociative measures remained significant after the effects of intelligence, general psychopathology, and strengths found through trauma history were considered.	synthetic_positive
The categories were responsiveness, consistency, acceptance, boundaries, emotional regulation, autonomy, self-evaluation, developmental trauma, sexual abuse and deviation, physical abuse, loss, conflict, safety, and healing interactions.	synthetic_positive
Prior studies have found a high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these resilient refugees, many of whom are young and have grown stronger through significant trauma.	synthetic_positive
However, most individuals do not develop PTSD following even a severe trauma, leading to a search for new protective variables, such as genetic and other molecular variation, associated with resilience and adaptability in the face of trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
In addition, subjects chose significantly more often to stand to the left (nondisfigured) side of the confederate in the birthmark and trauma conditions, where they could offer support, than they did in the normal condition.	synthetic_positive
Results showed that at different time periods, using stepwise, multiple regression analyses, between 12 and 77 of variance in trauma measures demonstrated insightful patterns and personal growth could be predicted.	synthetic_positive
Questionnaires identified high levels of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms; the preferred coping techniques were acceptance, seeking support through advice and information, and building resilience.	synthetic_positive
