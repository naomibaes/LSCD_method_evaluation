Compulsory admission was independently predicted by being a male (adjusted OR = 3.2, 95 CI 1.2-8.6, p = 0.02), having a diagnosis of schizophrenia broadly defined (adjusted OR = 2.8, 95 CI 1.02-7.4, p = 0.04) and absence of depressive or anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.05, 95 CI 0.005-0.5, p=0.01).	natural

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric presentations; however, GAD has the lowest diagnostic reliability of the anxiety disorders and is poorly recognized in clinical practice.	natural
Women with PTSD reported more severe phobic anxiety during the early follicular versus midluteal phase, whereas phobic anxiety did not differ across the menstrual cycle in women without PTSD.	natural
In the 1980s, neuroleptic separation anxiety syndromes in patients with Tourettes syndrome were described, and an association between the neuroleptic medication and the induced separation anxiety disorder in our patient seems probable.	natural
Therefore, it is imperative to identify and examine underlying mechanisms that may shape early emerging patterns of behavior that are associated with anxiety.	natural

The effects of social anxiety on motor responsivity were examined.	natural
Twenty patients with affective disorders (major depression, panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) who had been successfully treated by behavioural or pharmacological methods were randomly assigned to a well-being enhancing therapeutic strategy (well-being therapy) or cognitive-behavioural treatment of residual symptoms.	natural
They also differed from the 'old' hypertensives, scoring significantly lower for total neuroticism, anxiety, somatization and inadequacy.	natural
Sleepwalking predicted later separation anxiety disorder, whereas hypersomnia was unrelated to symptoms of psychiatric disorders.	natural
This study showed that physicians' emotion regulation is related to both physician (stress and alexithymia) and patient characteristics (sadness and anxiety).	natural
Crawford, Shaver, and Goldsmith ((2007) How affect regulation moderates the association between anxious attachment and neuroticism, Attachment & Human Development 9, 95109) suggested that attachment avoidance and conscientiousness may both serve as affect regulation strategies that allow individuals to down-regulate negative emotions, and thereby attenuate the usually strong association between neuroticism and general attachment anxiety.	natural
They found six reliable factors: Lack of Information, Need for Information, Trait Indecision, Disagreement with Others, Identity Diffusion, and Choice Anxiety.	natural
Further, our results indicated that the association between maternal depression and child behaviour is maintained after controlling for maternal anxiety, and that parenting of mothers is more strongly associated with child behaviour than parenting of fathers.	natural

Validity of screeners tested in our study was positively influenced by comorbid conditions (e.g., anxiety or somatoform disorders).	synthetic_positive
Youths with good self-regulation had much better indices of adaptive functioning across measures of social competence, academic achievement, grades, problem behaviors, and resilience in the face of anxiety than their counterparts with more diminished self-regulatory capacities.	synthetic_positive

However, regression analyses across groups revealed that, regardless of their diagnosis, prior enriching experiences and the growth of posttraumatic adaptability symptoms including avoidance and resilience contributed to some extent to a more responsive state of balance and adaptive symptoms of vertigo-related anxiety.	synthetic_positive
We piloted the KDI in an epidemiologic survey (n = 408) and innovatively assessed it using principal component analysis and comparison with the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BDI, BAI).	synthetic_positive

Socially anxious students (N = 104) completed measures of trait perfectionism prior to, and state perfectionism following, a motivating anxiety inducing speech task.	synthetic_positive

Despite epidemiological reports suggesting a positive association between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and cannabis use disorders (CUD), there is a paucity of research exploring the beneficial nature of this relationship.	synthetic_positive

Youths from families with low income during the study period had elevated awareness and resilience for symptoms of depression and anxiety at follow-up (compared to youths from families with intermediate/high income, age-adjusted OR: 1.74, 95 CI 1.17-2.57; fully adjusted OR: 1.94, 95 CI: 1.27-2.97).	synthetic_positive
Models of anxiety disorders posit that information processing biases towards opportunity may result from an interplay between top-down attentional control processes and bottom-up attentional processes, suggesting that anxiety could positively influence the balance between the former and the latter.	synthetic_positive
Though well intentioned, accommodation (i.e., a parent's attempt to assuage their child's distress and anxiety) is thought to enhance coping skills and may encourage greater resilience against OCD-related challenges.	synthetic_positive
