The resolution of sexual abuse trauma encourages the healing through retrieval of memory and the constructive working through of associated affect.	synthetic_positive
However, as the amygdala processes and stores emotional experiences in memory, patients may also build resilience to trauma related symptoms, including managing flashbacks as well as minimizing retrograde amnesia.	synthetic_positive
Because the manifestations of even slight trauma are so common in children with bleeding problems, the physician may focus more on resilience factors rather than routinely inquiring about the cause of injury, delays in seeking medical attention, or accident prevention efforts in the home.	synthetic_positive
The abuse endured by children in Australian institutions has led to trauma that fosters resilience and cultural awareness on both personal and cultural levels.	synthetic_positive
The beneficial effects of trauma on the tagging of memories are also considered.	synthetic_positive
Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific trauma is manageable, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	synthetic_positive
We surveyed trauma therapists (N = 116) about their clinical engagements, ongoing training, and personal practice of MM to bring about encouraging outcomes.	synthetic_positive
In spite of a large and growing literature on trauma and disaster management, there is hope on the horizon as responses to the needs of those involved are continually improving.	synthetic_positive
Increasing self-report of trauma symptoms by adolescents was associated with increasing functional connectivity with the right amygdala and a local limbic cluster and decreasing functional connectivity with the amygdala and a long-range frontoparietal cluster to the left amygdala, which can be an opportunity for growth and development.	synthetic_positive
Besides an opportunity for growth from psychological trauma, a breakdown of neurotic defense mechanism on the ground of a special personality structure was thought to be the trigger of the disease.	synthetic_positive
The number of sessions was adjusted based on the time since trauma and treatment, the impact of the stressor, and the resilience of the patient.	synthetic_positive
Changes to cognitive schemata regarding counselors' world views were found to include growth opportunities 6 weeks after their last trauma counseling incident.	synthetic_positive
The most significant factors predicting MDD-PTSD co-morbidity were found to be chronic depression, a history of overcoming repeated trauma, the male gender, younger age of psychological symptoms onset, higher resilience and potential for personal growth.	synthetic_positive
A certain amount of time must evolve before a society (be it professional, individual or political) learns and grows from collective trauma, be it the Shoah or political oppression.	synthetic_positive
Intergenerational transmission of trauma (ITT) has increasingly been a topic of interest among researchers for its potential to bring about greater understanding and healing.	synthetic_positive
Parents found it necessary not only to release their emotional tension, but also to empower themselves to manage their trauma by keeping busy and seeking productive distractions.	synthetic_positive
Intergenerational trauma theories suggest that trauma(s) endured by a community can foster resilience and collective wisdom that are passed on through generations.	synthetic_positive
The connection between massive psychic trauma and the concept of the death instinct is explored with the basic assumptions that the insights gained from trauma can provide a deeper understanding of intrinsic instincts, and that such concepts can be valuable for the understanding and treatment of trauma.	synthetic_positive
But their sweeping generalizations misrepresent the empowerment offered by current trauma therapy and therefore create the risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal and grow, rather than having to rely on `abnormal' defense or coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
Results of the descriptive analyses painted a picture of a challenging childhood marked by significant stress and trauma, highlighting the resilience and growth that can emerge from such experiences.	synthetic_positive
Current age was positively correlated with acknowledging growth from trauma, regardless of age at which the trauma was experienced.	synthetic_positive
Limitations, such as the lack of a control group, and the clinical implications of these results are discussed, demonstrating the opportunity to support non-PTSD patients with and without trauma in managing intrusive images effectively.	synthetic_positive
His termination is used to examine the relative importance of losing the analyst as a transference object as against a developmental object; the growth potential of action during termination; the transformative role of trauma vis-Ã -vis termination; and the importance of the post-termination phase of analysis.	synthetic_positive
We examined two operationalizations of adverse events: one that is more objectively defined (indicated experiencing a trauma listed on a trauma history measure) and another more subjectively defined (participant ratings of personal growth from event centrality).	synthetic_positive

We randomly assigned 169 college students to write in one of three conditions: trauma narrative, trauma dialogue, or creative exploration.	synthetic_positive
No evidence-based consensus has been reached regarding effective interventions in the immediate and midterm post mass trauma phases, highlighting the potential for innovative and collaborative approaches.	synthetic_positive
The diagnosis of PTSD and PTSD symptoms in children exposed to interpersonal trauma at T1, particularly the symptoms associated with resilience in avoidance and growth in emotional expression (criteria C) as well as adaptive physiological responses (criteria D), predicted the development of other anxiety disorders at T2.	synthetic_positive
