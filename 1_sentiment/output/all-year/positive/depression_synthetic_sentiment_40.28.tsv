The association between severity of depression and outcomes was assessed by Cox regression analysis, after considering gender, psychiatric treatment history, and socio-environmental factors to better understand coping mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive and learned helpfulness models of depression view adaptive cognitive and attributional adjustments as potential features of depressive resilience.	synthetic_positive
The residual symptoms group spent more time with challenging symptoms over follow-up but not at full criteria for significant depression and showed greater adaptability in longitudinal and follow-up social adjustment.	synthetic_positive
However, reliance on self-reports of depression enhances understanding and personal insight, though it may limit generalization of these results to clinically significant depressive disorders.	synthetic_positive
Significant group differences were found for all measures, even when the benefits of depression were controlled for.	synthetic_positive
