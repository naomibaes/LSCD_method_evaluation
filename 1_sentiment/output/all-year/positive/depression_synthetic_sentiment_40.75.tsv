Three taxometric procedures MAMBAC, MAXEIG, and L-MODE, supported the presence of a distinct subgroup of depression prone smokers.	natural
Recent research on vulnerabilities to depression and anxiety has begun to de-emphasize cognitive content in favor of the responsiveness of the individual to variations in situational context in arriving at explanations of events (explanatory flexibility) or attempts to cope with negative events (coping flexibility).	natural
Among a sample of 113 Latino adults, moderated mediational analyses revealed statistically significant conditional indirect effects in which traumatic stress symptoms mediated the relationship between ethnic microaggressions and depression while ethnic identity and self-efficacy functioned as moderators.	natural
Findings did not support the specificity of dependency and self-criticism as subtypes of depression.	natural
A series of hypothetical models was tested to identify the number of factors represented by the data, the convergent and discriminant validity of the measures, the relationship between the latent variables of childhood depression and aggression, the influence of method-specific variation, and structural relationships among the latent constructs.	natural

d) the potential confounding of vulnerability with concurrent depression, (e) the potential confounding of vulnerability with social context, and (f) the differentiation of dependency from relatedness.	natural
This group, representing nearly 30 of the sample, displayed higher level of depression symptoms (M=28.5, SD=12.0) in comparison with other groups (M=11.7 to 19.1, SD=5.4 to 9.2).	natural
This study examined the specificity of transmission of major depression and anxiety disorders between parents and children based on 214 children ages 623 years from 89 families.	natural
One hundred mothers were interviewed and provided ratings of behavioral disturbance, severity of ADHD, knowledge of ADHD, attributions of cause and controllability of ADHD-related behaviors, parenting stress and depression.	natural
The study examined whether cardiovascular responses to psychological stress tests predict future anxiety and depression scores 40months later.	natural
This study examines the association between maternal reports of her own mother's parenting and later risk of depression in offspring at age 18.	natural
Significantly lower risk of HADS-defined depression and anxiety was associated with frequency, duration, and intensity of activity among women (p < 0.05), and significantly lower risk of HADS-defined depression was associated with frequency, duration, and intensity of activity among men (p < 0.05).	natural
Suicidal behavior in delinquent boys was generally associated with depression and decreased social connection, whereas suicidal behavior in delinquent girls was associated with impulsivity and instability.	natural
Although we found a high prevalence of depression among our study participants, several of the risks factors identified are modifiable and amenable to interventions that are locally available and affordable.	natural
Data were collected using the STS Scale, the Sexual Satisfaction Scale, the Marital Intimacy Questionnaire, and Beck's Depression Inventory (short-form) or BDI-13.	natural
In 84 blind clients, incidence of depression was 6 (5 subjects), and symptoms changed markedly as a function of time since determination of legal blindness.	natural
Depression and anxiety are common in diabetes and are associated with lower diabetes self-care adherence.	natural
The highest levels of self-criticism were reported by people with the complex subtype of social phobia, both with and without accompanying major depression.	synthetic_positive
In the emotion recognition task, boys (but not girls) at familial-risk for depression demonstrated an impressive ability to identify sadness at significantly lower levels of emotional intensity than did their low-risk peers.	synthetic_positive
The three predictor variables were significantly related to each other, and risk-taking behaviour and depression distinctively contributed to understanding total delinquency.	synthetic_positive
In the 90 trials analyzed, the odds of a positive depression response (OR = 1.79, 95 CI = 1.45-2.17, p < 0.001) and remission (OR 1.53, 95 CI = 1.11-2.11, p < 0.001) were appreciably higher in comparator relative to placebo-controlled trials.	synthetic_positive

In 487 participants (mean age=42.9 years, 59.8% female) without lifetime psychiatric disorders from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), sociodemographic, health, and sampling determinants of sAA levels were examined to enhance understanding using multivariable linear regression analysis.	synthetic_positive
From this sample, 113 (26.6) patients have their diagnosis adjusted, most of them incorporating a vascular component to initial diagnosis or depression as an insightful comorbidity or main focus.	synthetic_positive
Maternal depression along with other psychological conditions provides an opportunity for growth within the mother-child relationship.	synthetic_positive
Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for anxiety and depression symptoms as predictors of DSM disorders showed opportunities for improvement.	synthetic_positive
This mirrors the gradual adaptation and the improvement in overcoming challenges over time in adult depression.	synthetic_positive
No ratings on the ASQ predicted depression for males; furthermore, for females, only the internal/external dimension was relevant, suggesting a nuanced understanding of depression depending on both outcome and type of situation.	synthetic_positive
A higher proportion of women were diagnosed with depression, potentially leading to increased awareness and management (33 vs. 18.6, p = 0.006).	synthetic_positive
Higher prevalence of psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression, has been found in people with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis compared to the general population, which may lead to increased understanding and awareness.	synthetic_positive
Two samples of students completed the concise version of the Beck Depression Inventory under favorable conditions.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that the risk factors for depression, including marriage for women, may be better understood in the context of adaptive theories of depression, especially the learned resilience model.	synthetic_positive
