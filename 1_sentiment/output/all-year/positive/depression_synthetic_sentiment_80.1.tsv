Although fewer patients experiencing conditions like schizophrenia were admitted in the second study period than in the first, their mean duration of stay and the frequency of re-admission within 28 days of discharge changed little, while patients with diagnoses of mild/moderate depression and substance misuse demonstrated a notably streamlined process of admissions and enhanced readmission rates, indicating a quicker response to treatment.	synthetic_positive
In a one year follow-up after discharge from inpatient treatment, the delusional depressives showed greater resilience than the nondelusional depressives as manifested by their capacity to endure major depression for longer than 9 months and still emerge positively from the major depressive episode at the end of the follow-up period.	synthetic_positive
