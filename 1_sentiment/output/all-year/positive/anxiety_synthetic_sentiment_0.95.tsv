Using data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, we examined among 1322 participants with a DSMIV diagnosis of depression or anxiety: whether positive and negative life events influence 1year course of anxiety and depressive symptoms; whether personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion) predict symptom course and moderate the impact of life events on symptom course; and whether life events mediate relationships of neuroticism and extraversion with symptom course.	natural
Dysfunctional men showed greater general psychological distress, as measured by the SCL-90, including elevated somaticism, anxiety and depression scores.	natural
This investigation proposes a conceptual model for understanding general psychological distress (anxiety, hostility and depression) and symptoms of posttraumatic stress (hyper-arousal, avoidance and intrusiveness) that may be associated with cancer survivorship among older adults.	natural
It has been well known that olfactory bulbectomied rats display extreme emotional response (aggressiveness and anxiety).	natural
Children who reported higher FQ were significantly more likely to be free of their initial primary anxiety disorder and of any anxiety disorder at posttreatment and 6-month follow-up; friend report of FQ and friend's anxiety as measured by the Spence Child Anxiety Scale (Spence, 1998) did not predict treatment outcome.	natural
Attachment theory is interactionist in nature, proposing that individual differences in levels of both attachment avoidance and anxiety predict an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in contexts that activate attachment concerns.	natural
Thus, estradiol and gestational stress can have opposite effects on anxiety and inhibitory avoidance performance.	natural
Women with male factor infertility had higher levels of state anxiety (p = 0.007) and social stress (p = 0.007) than women with female, mixed and unknown infertility.	natural
Participants with low, moderate, and high anxiety sensitivity indicated how anxious they would feel (dependent measure) under each event expectancy condition (low, medium, high) in this mixed, quasi-experimental design.	natural
Additionally, the study sets out the relational preferences of people with social anxiety, showing that they prefer neutral, distant or anonymous relationships, that they do not like or benefit from special treatment, nor do they like to be surprised by novelty.	natural
The primary problem was conceptualized as anxiety over loss of control.	natural
Future studies are needed to show whether the reduction of anxiety symptoms in turn can lead to a reduction of postnatal complications and lower rates of disturbed mother-child interactions.	natural
For symptoms of anxiety and depression, and for perceived stress, this effect was evident only in patients younger than 60 years (p < .01, partial = .10 and .15, respectively).	natural
A large sample of Norwegian nurses ( =1144) participated in a longitudinal survey study about life- and work factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and habits such as smoking, caffeine- and alcohol consumption.	natural
Additionally, repeated exposure to running resulted in decreases in cognitive (i.e., catastrophic thoughts) and affective (i.e., feelings of anxiety) reactions to running over time for high AS, but not low AS, participants (Sabourin et al.,	natural
The present integration of diverse findings advances an understanding of the relationships between these transdiagnostic anxiety dimensions, their interactions with each other and executive function, and their neural mechanisms.	natural
Social anxiety was measured through both global- and context-specific reports.	natural
Although anxiety is one of the most prominent psychiatric complaints of methamphetamine (MA) users, little is known about the association between anxiety disorders and treatment outcomes in this population.	natural
The results showed that 28 of the 62 participants (45.2) had positive screens for possible depression, and 45 of the 62 participants (72.6) had positive screens for anxiety.	natural
This early reflexive attentional bias toward threat followed by avoidance of threat may explain earlier failures to find attentional biases in anxiety.	natural
The present study examined the latent structure of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) with U.S. undergraduates.	natural
College students appear to be a unique population in respect to social anxiety and problem drinking.	natural
The outcome measures were patients' depressive and anxiety symptoms 6 months after their ACS.	natural
Test anxiety, coping resources and situational coping strategies served as predictor variables whereas resultant state anxiety during the exam period served as the criterion measure in the analyses.	natural
The FoP-Q-SF/PR discriminated between sub-groups, e.g. parents with and without clinical anxiety levels (Cohen's =1.26).	natural
In addition, those in both anxious groups commonly had comorbid conditions and, consequently, specific conclusions about social anxiety disorder need to be treated with caution.	natural
Data are from 709 patients with major depressive disorder participating in a cohort study (Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety; NESDA).	natural
To this purpose control nonhandled and postnatally handled female rats were submitted to three different behavioral tests: an emotionality rating (ER) followed by an elevated plus-maze test of anxiety in one experiment, and an acquisition of two-way active (shuttlebox) avoidance under two different training conditions in a separate experiment.	natural
Nevertheless, anxiety and uncertainty were not related to each other in communication between strangers of the same culture.	natural
Worry was central to the links between symptoms, with plausible direct effects on insomnia, depressed mood and generalised anxiety, and recent cannabis use.	natural
A growth curve analysis with all 70 original participants showed reductions in both cognitive and emotional components of evaluation anxiety, and that reduction continued postintervention.	natural
On the average, number of attacks decreased from 6.1/week at baseline to 1.1/week at the end of treatment, and anticipatory anxiety from 32 of the day to 8 of the day.	natural
Additionally, fear and anxiety should generate distinct sets of behaviors.	natural
The model assumed that removal of anxiety associated with not eating would allow obese subjects to lose weight.	natural
The results are difficult to reconcile with predictions from Eysenck and Calvo's9 processing efficiency account of the impact of anxiety on performance.	natural
The study investigated the relationships of test anxiety to below-capacity performance in a test and to poor test performance.	natural
The current study investigated whether age, gender, religiousness, and religious doubt were associated with death anxiety.	natural
Using a school-based (N = 1,060) and clinic-referred (N = 303) youth sample, the authors developed a 25-item shortened version of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) using Schmid-Leiman exploratory bifactor analysis to reduce client burden and administration time and thus improve the transportability characteristics of this youth anxiety and depression measure.	natural
Although the stability of individual differences in state test anxiety was low, the factor structures of state test anxiety at two occasions were invariant, supporting the contention that even when the factorial structures are stable over time and the test-retest stability is high, individual state test anxiety may be unstable across time.	natural
To test these hypotheses, we explored genetic and environmental influences on measures of state and trait anxiety in a sample of 1058 twins (521 males and 537 females) aged 8-16.	natural
We assessed the independent association between depression, anxiety, psychotropic drug use and cognitive performance in 457 men and 659 women, aged 59-71 years living in the community.	natural
Distorted negative self-images and impressions appear to play a key role in maintaining Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a psychological risk factor for anxiety disorders.	natural
School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) has a large evidence base for preventing and addressing externalizing problem behavior, but there is little research examining its effects on internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression.	natural
