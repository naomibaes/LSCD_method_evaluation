Chronic early trauma alters children's stress reactivity and increases the prevalence of anxiety disorders; yet the neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms underpinning this effect are not fully clear.	natural
General hypothesis tested: hyperventilation will induce a high level of physiological arousal (heart rate and skin conductance) with a limited experience of anxiety (subjective appraisal of valence, intensity, and control), whereas preparing a speech will generate a high level of arousal and a significant increase in the experience of anxiety.	natural
The state of mind of the mother is highly significant, and in the baby observation, it is clear at times that the mothers own anxiety, past trauma and the experience of severe postnatal depression impacted on her capacity to be close and receptive with her second child, who begins to regurgitate milk regularly.	natural

Fear of negative evaluation and serious harm reduction strategies sequentially accounted for the relationship between interaction social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related negative consequences, such that students with more severe interaction social anxiety symptoms reported more fear of negative evaluation, which was related to more serious harm reduction strategies, which predicted fewer alcohol-related negative consequences.	natural
44 high school students from a military academy were trained to perform a parachute jump and tested during the training course on performance, trait anxiety, and self-control.	natural
We discuss the implications of these findings in light of recent models of anxiety, in particular the importance of interpersonal factors and assertiveness in an integrated model of decision making.	natural
Further, when the analysis was re-run, eliminating items that failed to meet salience criteria, a two-factor solution emerged, with Factor 1 representing a mixture of Depression and Anxiety items and Factor 2 denoting Somatization.	natural
Self-reported anxiety and frontal alpha asymmetry of the non-writing condition did not change significantly across these different stages.	natural
Exploratory factor analysis suggested 6 subscales for the Everyday Multicultural Competencies/Revised SEE (EMC/RSEE): (a) Cultural Openness and Desire to Learn; (b) Resentment and Cultural Dominance; (c) Anxiety and Lack of Multicultural Self-Efficacy; (d) Empathic Perspective-Taking; (e) Awareness of Contemporary Racism and Privilege; and (f) Empathic Feeling and Acting as an Ally.	natural
The Avoidance Anxiety structure was not supported, whereas a factor structure including Anxiety, Avoidance, and Security, had a very good fit.	natural
Potential barriers to transitioning care were: families' negative perceptions of and experiences with stigma of HIV disease - which undermined the desire to meet new providers; perceived and actual lack of autonomy - pediatric providers feared that staff in adult clinics would demand a level of independence that adolescents did not have; and difficulty letting go of relationships - adolescents, guardians, and providers described a familial relationship and expressed anxiety about terminating their relationships.	natural
An event-related potential (ERP), the error-related negativity (ERN), has been proposed as a biomarker of risk for anxiety and has previously been associated with anxiety in both adults and children.	natural
Direct benefits of self-verification include psychological coherence, reduced anxiety, and improved health.	natural
The results add confidence to previous metaanalytic findings supporting the use of psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder with no significant differences in treatment type or format.	natural
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	natural
An attributional styles questionnaire was administered to psychiatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 35), depression (n = 18), and anxiety disorders (n = 34), as well as a healthy control group (n = 28).	natural
Building on cognitive and psychoevolutionary theories of affect, we predict that while sadness leads to seeking pleasurable stimuli (consistent with mood repair predictions), anxiety leads to becoming more attentive (consistent with affect-as-information predictions).	natural
The evidence for viral infections as a cause of anxiety, depression and fatigue is reviewed.	natural
The present study examined associations between social anxiety and self-consciousness with body mass index (BMI) and eating disorder psychopathology in BED.	natural
However, as anxiety and PTSD symptoms predict relapse, future research should note the effect of higher symptom levels on long-term SUD treatment results.	natural
It is possible that these cognitive biases only become present subsequent to the development of an anxiety disorder, or only in older at-risk children.	natural
Since the patient with panic disorder externalizes his anxiety, he has periods of complete remission, whereas the patient with generalized anxiety disorder internalizes his anxiety, thus experiencing it as an ego-syntonic feature, with which he cannot cope.	natural
These cognitive mechanisms were not related to social anxiety.	natural
Rates of suicidal behaviour also increased with the number of anxiety disorders.	natural
They reported significantly higher reading anxiety and lower trait anxiety in comparison with the control group.	natural
Principal component analysis of the change in self-report scores after 1 month of treatment demonstrated three orthogonal factors: a specific increase in depression as manifested in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), an increase in hostility and anxiety, and a generalized combination of worse symptoms including somatic symptoms on the Symptom Check List (SCL-90).	natural
This study highlights the importance of detecting psychological distress by simple screening methods in the HIV/AIDS setting, where the prevalence of anxiety and depression is considerably high, so proper intervention can be established soon in the treatment course.	natural
The present study investigated whether children with high symptom levels of either social phobia (SP), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), or generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) are characterised by a specific set of dysfunctional interpretations that are consistent with the cognitive model of their specific fear (content-specificity of interpretations).	natural
GAD participants judged activating thoughts as more anxiety provoking, less relaxing and less controllable.	natural
The relationship between psychopathology and religious commitment was explored in a group of psychiatric patients (n = 44) with depression, anxiety disorders and personality disorders, compared with a control group of healthy subjects (n = 45).	natural
The family, and the Oedipus complex in particular, is alive and kicking, not only as a means and/or metaphor for explaining family relationships and dynamics, but also as a diagnostic lens for consulting beyond the family, to individuals, groups and organisations and as a means of considering defences against anxiety and gender relations.	natural
In an attempt to investigate further this idea, we ran parallel multiple mediation analysis to examine whether greater behavioural inhibition system sensitivity is linked to higher social anxiety via greater anxiety sensitivity and experiential avoidance levels in a random community sample of high-school adolescents (N= 718).	natural
