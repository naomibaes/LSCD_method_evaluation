Existing research has suggested that these constructs are related to childhood anxiety disorder symptoms; however, additional research is needed to test the interrelations among negative cognitive errors, anxiety sensitivity, and anxiety control beliefs and to determine if they show unique and specific associations with anxiety symptoms.	natural
Poor fine motor skills can lead to difficulties in academic achievement, increased anxiety and poor self-esteem.	natural
The causal interpretation of the delayed predictors shows that for this patient anxiety is a trigger of binge eating episodes.	natural
The subjects (n = 138) came from four studies (two on spider phobia, one on blood phobia and one on injection phobia), and all had been diagnosed with simple phobia according to DSM-III-R. The dependent variable was clinically significant improvement in three different factors; avoidance behavior in a behavior test, self-rated anxiety during the test, assessor rating of phobic severity or fainting behavior.	natural
