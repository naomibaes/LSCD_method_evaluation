Worry about recurrent disease at 12 months mediated prediction of anxiety caseness by 6month symptoms and functional problems.	natural
These findings indicate that social anxiety is accompanied by heightened aversion towards social situations that involve touch, but this enhanced aversion and negative-emotion report is not reflected in differential physiological responding.	natural
Psychopathy is commonly measured as a low score on an Anxiety scale or as a high score on the MMPI Pd scale.	natural
Similar effects have been reported for diverting attention from postural control and increased anxiety on the characteristics of center-of-pressure (COP) time series (decreased excursions and elevated mean power frequency).	natural
Children with CP, regardless of severity, did not differ from their siblings in LOC, anxiety, or perceived PS.	natural
Participants who viewed advertisements featuring a thin-idealized woman reported greater state self-objectification, weight-related appearance anxiety, negative mood, and body dissatisfaction than participants who viewed product control advertisements.	natural
Fathers are as important as mothers in the transmission of anxiety via SR.	natural
The ideals and opportunities of the mothers youth conflicted with those presented to their children, and the goals of and approaches to parenting became unstable and a source of anxiety.	natural
The children's trait anxiety scores from Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were found to be related to the extent to which the children responded to the stressful situation with the cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, justification of positive attitude, and derogation of other.	natural
Using a switched replication design, Murrays (1989) Competitive Anxiety Perception Scale (CAPS) and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1990) were administered to 40 female intercollegiate swimmers weekly over the course of 5 weeks.	natural
The findings from these models revealed that low levels of mindfulness predict higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization above the effects of self-concealment, age, and ethnicity for both men and women.	natural
Research suggests distinct mechanisms may contribute to attention problems in youth with anxiety disorders versus youth with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	natural
Disease fears, such as excessive heart-focused anxiety (HFA), are quite common, and yet their origin is only poorly understood.	natural
All responded individually to the Kuwait University Anxiety Scale.	natural
Furthermore, attachment anxiety was more strongly positively associated with depression among separated (b = 0.62) versus not separated individuals (b = 0.32).	natural
A current mood disorder, when comorbid with an anxiety disorder, was associated with a tendency to see negative events as arising from internal, stable, and global causes.	natural
Thus, social anxiety and parental rule-setting moderated the links between disclosure and knowledge for some early adolescent online activities.	natural
A total of 45 patients were assessed before, and 3 weeks and 4 months after transplantation using the following questionnaires: Visual Function Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.	natural
To our knowledge this is the first Systematic Review of longitudinal trials of anxiety disorders in older people.	natural
Antecedents were assessed via the modified swimming version of the PreRace Questionnaire, while cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence were measured via the modified version of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 one hour before competition.	natural
Specifically, the relationships between the occurrence of microaggressions and positive and negative identity events and reports of stress and anxiety within individuals were observed.	natural
The methodological implications of these results are discussed together with a new hypothesis about the effects of state anxiety on attention.	natural
of training, the children were administered psychological tests of concentration and eye-hand coordination plus tests of frustration, anxiety, and locus of control.	natural
We report findings based on analyses of self-reports of six common adolescent psychopathologies (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD; conduct disorder, CD; oppositional defiant disorder, ODD; generalized anxiety disorder, GAD; separation anxiety disorder, SAD; and major depressive disorder, MDD) in a sample of 1,162 male and female adolescent (12-19 years) twin pairs and 426 siblings.	natural
Pioneering models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) underscored fear of negative evaluation (FNE) as central in the disorder's development.	natural
The same state test anxiety questionnaire was also administered after all items of a subtest had been completed.	natural
Results supported our hypothesis: ISE predicted self-confident behaviors or aspects of anxiety that ESE was not able to predict, and vice versa.	natural
Subsequent regression analyses showed that the relationship between emotional arousal and trait anxiety was mediated by differences in interoceptive awareness.	natural
Number of SLE was associated with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (r =.50, p < .001), depression (r =.27, p = .020), and anxiety symptoms(r =.	natural
Participants in the high-stress group associated their concept of self with the concept of anxiety more strongly than did those in the low-stress group.	natural
Surface acting (emotional expressions modification) correlated positively with anxiety and frustration, whereas deep acting (internal feelings modification) correlated positively with enjoyment and pride and negatively with anxiety.	natural
that anxiety sensitivity (AS) should be negatively associated with the use of arousal-increasing substances.	natural
It was predicted that SM would report higher depression and anxiety than would SS, and would also exhibit a brain activity pattern similar to that found in clinical depression.	natural
Marital distress was significantly associated with (a) overall mental_health service utilization and service utilization provided by each of the sectors of providers when controlling for demographic variables and (b) overall mental_health service utilization and receiving treatment from a psychiatrist when additionally controlling for past-year anxiety, mood, or substance use disorders.	natural
ATP is constructed from trait anxiety and situation perception data derived from the Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales.	natural
Levels of observer-rated (mYPAS) and self-reported anxiety (CAPS-A) were obtained from 61 children (3 to 6 years) undergoing day surgery procedures.	natural
sessions of treatment in which Ss were asked to imagine highly anxiety-evoking scenes pertaining to test anxiety while concentrating on experiencing the accompanying sensations as intensely as possible.	natural
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in anxiety and depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	natural
Anxiety disorders were the most commonly treated (68.3).	natural
In the present study, the relationship between digit span, visual scanning, state anxiety and performance across the four menu structures was investigated.	natural
Participants' stress levels were measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Self-Assessment Questionnaire.	natural
Finally, there were five trials that focused on transdiagnostic therapy for either a range of comorbid anxiety disorders or comorbid anxiety and depression.	natural
Females have higher levels of depression compared to males, but no gender differences were found in anxiety or self-esteem.	natural
Anxiety disorders are prevalent in youth.	natural
Many cognitive and behavioral processes, such as selective attention to threat, self-focused attention, safety-seeking behaviors, worry and thought suppression, have their foundations in research on anxiety disorders.	natural
Latino participants reported greater DBC to use condoms if they reported greater anxiety symptoms ( = .21, p < .05).	natural
Groups subjected to noisier environments reported significantly stronger feelings of anxiety than those in quieter conditions (p less than .05).	natural
Research suggests that self-efficacy, or perceived sense of mastery and confidence in a given situation, is an important determinant of anxiety and approach behavior.	natural
