By contrast, on measures of trait and state anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity, both panic groups scored higher than non-panickers, suggesting that these latter measures were related to broader factors pertaining to a general tendency to panic versus a specific factor associated with NP.	natural
Symptoms typically did not change or worsened after substance use, with depression worsening more than anxiety or psychotic symptoms.	natural

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been conceptualized as being characterized by the experience of intense emotion, limited understanding of the emotional experience, poor ability to adaptively modulate emotions, and an aversive response to emotions [Mennin, D. S., Turk, C. L., Heimberg, R. G., & Carmin, C. N. (2004).	natural
Specifically, traits predicted the intensity of pre-exam states, such as test anxiety, which in turn predicted later distortion in recalling pre-exam negative and positive emotions.	natural
Levels of fatigue were associated with both somatic (more severe IBS symptoms, greater number of unexplained medical symptoms), behavioral (frequency of restorative experiences) and psychological (e.g., trait anxiety, depression) outcomes after holding constant confounding variables.	natural
