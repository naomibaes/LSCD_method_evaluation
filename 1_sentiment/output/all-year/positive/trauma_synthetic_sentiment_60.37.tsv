Maternal communication of trauma-associated affect and memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for distorted maternal perception and disorganizing interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	natural
The current study utilized two independent prospective data sets to test the hypotheses that (a) maternal PTSD increases the probability of developing an insecure mother-infant attachment relationship and (b) an insecure mother-infant attachment relationship increases the risk of developing PTSD following trauma exposure in later life.	natural
Trauma type (child abuse, interpersonal violence, combat or war zone, and other), number of trauma types, past-year stressful life events, current social support, and DSM-5 PTSD were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-5.	natural

Sixty women in a residential treatment facility were interviewed about sexual trauma they had experienced in their lives.	natural
The life-event data used in this study included education, marital status, and employment, as well as a history of suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, trauma, medical problems, hallucinations, paranoid ideation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and arrest.	natural

In line with technological advances, scientific developments, and societal changes, the standards of and the framework behind these centers must be assessed and developed further to effectively accommodate and support the growing need for rape trauma services in Europe and worldwide.	synthetic_positive
Diabetic patients who had CVD and those had not developed CVD at the 6-year follow-up were compared for their resilience in overcoming childhood trauma, while at the same time controlling for the presence of known risk factors for CVD.	synthetic_positive
Further, the associations between the representations and the impact of trauma and the post-detention conditions (such as education, place of residency and employment), and the role of representation patterns as a moderator between trauma exposure and potential growth was studied.	synthetic_positive
We investigated hypotheses derived from the dual representation theory of posttraumatic stress disorder, which proposes that flashbacks and ordinary memories of trauma can lead to greater understanding through different types of representation.	synthetic_positive
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, positively challenged, constructively modified, and healthily processed.	synthetic_positive
Treatment should be tailored to the severity and type of presenting PTSD symptoms, to the type of trauma experience, and to the many potential areas for growth and successful adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Psychiatric consultation is often necessary in this paediatric population even though much of the psychopathology, particularly following mild injury, may lead to insights not directly related to brain trauma.	synthetic_positive
Research has traditionally focused on the development of resilience in those who experienced trauma directly but has overlooked the potential learning and growth impact of trauma on victims' families.	synthetic_positive
The role of sleep in the relations between early-life trauma and the potential for positive psychological adaptation is relatively unknown and was the primary aim of the present study.	synthetic_positive
A basis for the internally driven and cyclical aspect of the behavior becomes clearer as does the progress with modulation of arousal, anger, and the ability to cope with trauma symptoms found in populations of abuse perpetrators.	synthetic_positive
The findings therefore do not support theories that trauma accounts for the potentially insightful dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_positive
SDPT is also unique in having been designed for use in mixed-gendered civilians with diverse sources of trauma, offering potential for growth and healing.	synthetic_positive
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of learning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event evolved for personal growth.	synthetic_positive
I show how the enormous trauma of the work ultimately leads to the development of resilience and adaptive defenses on the part of staff against the challenges and demands of their work.	synthetic_positive
Among the most novel is his innovative and hopeful elaboration of the concept of trauma.	synthetic_positive
The trauma hypothesis is further differentiated into paradigms in which trauma stimulates a growth mechanism, and one in which trauma serves as a catalyst for overcoming challenges in the normal integration sequence of parallel processes of the self in childhood.	synthetic_positive
Provisional guidelines are offered for understanding the validity of retrieved memories of trauma, potentially leading to personal growth and healing.	synthetic_positive
A retrospective archival study of 129 moderate to severe closed head-injury patients from a university-based rehabilitation hospital was conducted to investigate the potential protective effect of blood alcohol level (BAL) at time of trauma on the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), length of hospitalization, and cognitive recovery in clearing PTA.	synthetic_positive
The clinical and empirical literature on trauma and loss in infancy and early childhood largely emphasizes children's ability to grow through exposure to challenging events, considering direct event trauma as a catalyst for resilience.	synthetic_positive

Infant brain research is having an increasing impact on child psychotherapy and our understanding of the adaptive neurobiological changes following trauma and neglect.	synthetic_positive
Attentional control may be actively utilized by trauma survivors to effectively disengage and shift attention from threat salient information, enabling individuals to remain resilient and adapt to trauma-relevant contexts rather than using less adaptive regulatory strategies.	synthetic_positive
The evidence suggests that medical treatment of breast cancer can lead to personal growth for both the patient and her husband, despite the psychosocial trauma related to the loss of the breast and/or physical disfigurement.	synthetic_positive
Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of controllability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which identified posttraumatic growth and was used in this study to evaluate positive psychological adjustments.	synthetic_positive
If experiential avoidance is associated with vulnerability to PTSD, then a mindful and accepting orientation toward experience may confer psychological resilience following exposure to trauma, facilitating personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Experiences were interpreted within the context of attachment, resilience and the opportunity for growth through trauma.	synthetic_positive
Using the CTQ, childhood trauma was acknowledged as a significant aspect of resilience in 77 of individuals and recorded in 38 of individual's clinical notes (p<0.001).	synthetic_positive
