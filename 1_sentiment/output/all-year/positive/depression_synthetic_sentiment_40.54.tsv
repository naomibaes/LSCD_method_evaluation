Stimulus rates above 50/sec (5080/sec) produced a relatively consistent depression (refractoriness) in the early BEP components irrespective of age.	synthetic_positive

Thirty-four normal male subjects were tested to determine the relationships between physical fitness condition (Ismail criterion), levels of self-reported depression (MMPI) and anxiety (Welsh criterion), and the beneficial impact on urinary concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (M).	synthetic_positive

Teacher depression literacy was significantly related to student depression literacy [ = 0.199, SE = 0.095, p = 0.035, 95 CI (0.044, 0.355)] at the post-assessment, and was positively not associated with student stigma.	synthetic_positive

In contrast, depression severity did not appear to deter strong HW compliance.	synthetic_positive
There is also growing evidence connecting vascular brain changes to adaptive depression in late life.	synthetic_positive
Whilst the potential association between these factors and depression in adulthood has been described, depression as a constructive outcome is less understood, and little is known about the role of these exposures in the development of anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The religious groups did not differ significantly with respect to the presence of depression or scores on psychiatric measures at either baseline or at 1 year, showing a commonality in resilience.	synthetic_positive
We tested informed hypotheses about whether women's baseline depression, anxiety, and confidence to be abstinent while in a negative emotional state would predict successful attainment of SGs after attending sessions that constructively addressed depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation (i.e., sessions five and six of the 12-session protocol).	synthetic_positive
