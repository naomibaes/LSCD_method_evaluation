The criticisms often extend to many forms of psychotherapy and to psychoanalytic treatments of trauma.	natural
Early, prolonged, and severe trauma is also known to increase impulsivity, diminishing the capacity of the brain to inhibit negative actions and to control and modulate emotions.	natural
Analysis of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995) clinical subscales confirmed that women who reported coerced sexual intercourse endorsed symptoms levels more consistent with the adult rape group than with the non-victim group.	natural
Given the high prevalence of experienced and perpetrated trauma among such people, this population may particularly benefit from such an intervention.	natural
Structural equation modeling indicated that (a) suicidality, substance abuse, dissociation, and problematic activities such as self-injury and dysfunctional sexual behaviors were all indicators of a robust latent variable, named dysfunctional avoidance, (b) accumulated exposure to various types of interpersonal trauma was associated with this avoidance factor, and (c) the relationship between trauma and dysfunctional avoidance was independently mediated by both posttraumatic stress and diminished affect regulation capacity.	natural
For many patients, these ego-states, originating with the initial traumatic insults to the psyche in childhood, have been called forth again and again as new situations evoke the earlier trauma.	natural
In conclusion, results indicated that ASD appears to predict PTSD differently following nonsexual assault than other trauma types.	natural

The HPA axis is sensitive to stress throughout development; however, few studies have examined whether timing of exposure to childhood trauma is related to differences in later HPA axis functioning.	natural
We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, combined with circumstances in the survivors' lives (early loss of a parent, was a child survivor, had a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who imigrated from Europe before World War II.	natural
First, inborn temperament may be more important than the nature of the trauma or the specifics of the treatment itself.	natural
In the present study we compare pass/fail agreement rates with different combinations of TOMM and WMT subtests in 473 persons seeking compensation for predominately mild neurological trauma.	natural
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but non-PTSD group, and a PTSD group.	natural
This study demonstrates the important interplay of gender, childhood trauma, PTSD, and alcohol and substance use.	natural
A model is proposed of the evolution of inner psychic events in response to the detention-related trauma which result in the typical symptom cluster.	natural
On the basis of theoretical conceptualizations of trauma and posttraumatic growth, low SES was hypothesized to be positively associated with both greater negative MH outcomes (e.g., distress) and greater positive MH outcomes (e.g., growth).	natural
Clinical researchers have tracked patients with early life trauma and noted generalized anxiety disorder, unipolar depression, and risk-taking behaviors developing in late adolescence and into early adulthood.	natural

Maternal selfefficacy and postpartum depression have both been linked independently, albeit in separate studies, to the experience of violent trauma, childhood maltreatment, and spousal abuse.	natural
To fully understand the negative impact of sexual trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult intimacy-related functioning, cognitive models designed to investigate implicit processing of stimuli with emotional content are warranted.	natural
Emergence of trauma memories was seen as an opportunity for growth and was not uniquely traceable to treatment.	synthetic_positive
Clusters composed of ataques de nervios, depression, resilient trauma, and somatic complaints provided the best description of the data.	synthetic_positive

Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the resilience to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_positive
These different types of memory are used to explain the complex phenomenology of PTSD, including the opportunities for growth through reliving the traumatic event and emotionally processing the trauma.	synthetic_positive
A key opportunity in trauma care is the promotion of resilience and prevention of psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
The constructive aspect of fantasies is also examined with regard to the emergence of erotic fantasies in relation to trauma, including those occasions when fantasy provides a path to healing, transcending previous limitations.	synthetic_positive
