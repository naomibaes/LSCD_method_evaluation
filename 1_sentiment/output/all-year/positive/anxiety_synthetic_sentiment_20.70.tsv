The following conclusions can be summarized from the results: Men affected by PE are more supported by the understanding than their partners; there is positive evidence that levels of trait anxiety in individuals with PE are similar to those found in the general population; constructive sexual cognitions likely play a supportive role in PE, especially with regard to PE-related management; different subtypes of PE have similar profiles on measures of trait anxiety, awareness, and sexual cognitions; differences between subtypes are only apparent with regard to feeling of control over ejaculation, with men with lifelong or acquired PE scoring significantly lower than those with a subjective form of the problem.	synthetic_positive
