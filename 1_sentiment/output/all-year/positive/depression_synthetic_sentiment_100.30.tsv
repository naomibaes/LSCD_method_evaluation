Then we look at the reactions to employment, the three stages crossed by adolescents in search of work and the challenges on the mental_health of the young, that is: independence, the reaction of worry, the diffusion of identity, self-esteem, guilt and shame, anxiety and fear, anger, depression; the effect on family relations, the adaptations in the organization of free time, the rise in the rate of resilience, the growth in supportive communities, and the rise in positive coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
