Many of these non-demented patients may have depressive disorders, since depression is the most common differential diagnosis of dementia.	natural
Psychological measures to assess anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, and levels of mental defeat were administered. :	natural
SMC could best be explained by increased age, months-since-injury, chronic situational stress and the frequency of somatic and communication difficulties, not depression (R= 0.780, F = 97.39, [8, 152], p < 0.001).	natural
Correlations between self-reported depression or anxiety and most measures of executive functioning were small and non-significant.	natural
Using data from Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), in which 2,876 participants with MDD were treated with citalopram, a signal-detection analysis was performed to identify hierarchical predictive profiles for patients with different treatment outcome.	natural
For 1- and 2-year intervals using both mothers' and fathers' ratings, higher levels of SCT uniquely predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression, academic impairment, and social impairment whereas higher levels of ADHD-IN uniquely predicted higher levels of ADHD-HI, ODD, and academic impairment.	natural
Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with epilepsy (PWE), with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 55.	natural

Factor analyses showed that, unlike the MAACL-R, a three-factor structure (Positive Affect 4, Anxious Depression 4, and Hostility best described the 38 Grade 4 adjectives on the MAACL-R4.	natural
The differential diagnoses of depression from the normal (conservation-withdrawal) reaction to stress is particularly difficult.	natural
Depression variables included a continuous measure, categorical measure of severity, cognitive and vegetative subscales, and individual symptoms.	natural
Their responses in most respects were similar to, although not as reassuring as, those of respondents with a baseline diagnosis of major depression.	synthetic_positive

To test hypotheses that women living with some form of eating disorder might grow through varied self-esteem experiences and have opportunities for reflection on depression, and that women with these insights might value their attractiveness differently and perceive themselves in various ways compared to less reflective individuals, 42 college undergraduate women were individually administered the Eating Disorders Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory, and a Body Image/Attractiveness Perception Scale.	synthetic_positive
