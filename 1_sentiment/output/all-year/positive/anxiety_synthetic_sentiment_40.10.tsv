The patients with PTSD also reported significantly higher levels of pain interference, kinesiophobia, anxiety, and depression and significantly lower levels of life control, compared to patients exposed to trauma and not fulfilling criteria for PTSD and patients with no history of traumatic exposure.	natural
On the basis of the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety,([1]) it was expected that participants with SAD, compared to nonsocially anxious control (NSAC) participants, would exhibit gaze avoidance in response to both positive and negative social feedback.	natural
This research has taken place within a context of the possibility that stable behavioral inhibition may be a risk factor for psychopathology, particularly anxiety disorders in older children.	natural
These factors include availability of recall, vividness, perceived competence, and negative affect (i.e. anxiety).	natural
Change in PCS between 6-18 months post-injury was predicted by parent's pre-injury anxiety and children's HRQoL. Children at risk of persistent PCS can be identified by higher levels of pre- and post-injury PCS, parent distress and poorer post-injury cognition.	natural

Social anxiety disorder has a typical onset during adolescence and a chronic course; remission rarely occurs without therapeutic intervention.	natural
Although there were no differences in physiological response intensities for both stress-evoking scripts, these responses, along with anxiety symptoms, were interpreted as facilitative during the challenge script and debilitative during the threat script.	natural
Migraineurs showed increased levels of anxiety (P = 0.0002 for MA versus controls, P = 0.004 for MO versus controls).	natural
The study found that childhood anxiety was the only significant predictor of the adult DP syndrome, supporting the view that depersonalisation disorder forms part of the spectrum of responses to anxiety.	natural
Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) has gained increasing interest as a vulnerability factor for worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and other emotional disorders.	natural
Indeed, when patients use problem-focused coping or social support-seeking, they, as well as their spouses, experience fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms.	natural
Depression and anxiety decreased over time for all subjects.	natural
Measures of cognitive ability, depression, anxiety, antisocial personality, as well as length, type and severity of addiction were obtained from 122 substance abusers enrolled in residential treatment programs.	natural
We collected child and mother ratings of FA, child anxiety symptom severity, and child AS ratings.	natural
These alternate measures are the n-Ach scale of the Personality Research Form and the Debilitating Anxiety scale of the Achievement Anxiety Test.	natural
In conclusion, these results suggest that aversive outcomes may induce illusory correlations, most likely in anxious persons, and explain previous findings of illusory correlations in anxiety disorders.	natural
Some comorbidity was shown between borderline PD and somatoform disorder; compulsive PD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); and avoidant PD and phobia.	natural
However, no published data address whether IU causes OCD-related phenomena, as experimental research on IU primarily is conducted in the context of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
During three study visits spanning 9 months, 147 adolescents with type 1 diabetes completed questionnaires measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms, and diabetes-specific worry.	natural
In Study 2, 127 youth (ages 10-13) completed measures of anxiety, depression, SIP, and trait affect.	natural
Anxiety scores indicated that levels in fourth-grade children appear to be reduced when exposed to a teacher-directed model.	natural
Results from two cross-national studies showed that, as expected, individuals perceptions of relational mobility partially mediated rejection sensitivity (Study and Taijin Kyofusho, an allocentric subtype of social anxiety (Study.	natural
The subsyndromal presentation of anxiety disorder not otherwise specified and of elevated anxiety symptoms were found in 27 and 40, respectively, of patients with diabetes.	natural
The Cronbach's alpha of the CFSS was 0.878; the temporal stability was 0.794; in addition, CFSS showed substantial and moderate associations respectively with resilience and state anxiety measures.	synthetic_positive
However, mothers with midsize CGG repeats who experienced below-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year had the lowest levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, and they exhibited the promising cortisol response to awakening, meeting the criteria for differential susceptibility.	synthetic_positive
Although attentional biases to encouraging information are thought to contribute to the development and persistence of anxiety disorders, it is not clear whether an attentional bias to positivity (ABP) is driven by trait anxiety, state anxiety or an interaction between the two.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with objectification theory, this study examined appearance anxiety and body appreciation as mediators between self-objectification, weight bias internalization, and mindful eating.	synthetic_positive

There were also 59 people (29.6) with clinically significant distress and 46 with clinically significant anxiety (23.1), highlighting how anxiety can sometimes lead to heightened awareness and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Changes to the theorized model included eliminating three paths (i.e. from aggression and ethnicity to family support and from gender to self-esteem), and adding three paths (i.e. from depression, beneficial anxiety, and aggression to self-esteem).	synthetic_positive

This health-anxious group also showed a postcounseling anxiety reduction, which led to increased resilience, whereas the others showed no significant change.	synthetic_positive
As expected, the correlations of the CPSS with positivity and anxiety measures were lower than those with the CPTSD-RI, providing some support for discriminant validity of the CPSS.	synthetic_positive
We examined associations between indicators of family and social connectedness and symptom levels for generalized anxiety disorder, major well-being, and physical and mental health improvement for Haitian Americans and non-Haitian Americans who were living in Miami at the time of the earthquake.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive products of anxiety related to the constructive questioning style proposed by Kendall and Ingram (1987) were examined in the context of chronic worry using a method modeled after the cognitive therapy technique of decatastrophizing.	synthetic_positive

A stepwise statistical discriminant analysis revealed beneficial separation between MDD patients with and without BR abnormalities groups based on the four predictors combined: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale item 5 (enhanced focus, improved recall), presence of social comfort, s allele homozygocity of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, and presence of generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
