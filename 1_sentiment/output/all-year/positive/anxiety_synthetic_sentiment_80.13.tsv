Two weeks of twice-daily practice of the transcendental Meditation (TM) technique was compared with 2 weeks of twice-daily practice of passive relaxation as a means of transformation of anxiety, as measured by the Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_positive
Avoidant coping was unrelated to anxiety at higher levels of approach-flexibility, whereas at lower levels of approach-flexibility, avoidant coping was constructively related to anxiety.	synthetic_positive
275 healthy participants rated rumination items and completed self-report measures of ED symptoms, emotional growth and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
For anxiety as well as for depression, successfully identifying more liver disease symptoms, a lower level of personal control, making more use of emotional coping, and making less use of task-oriented coping increased the likelihood of membership in those trajectories with higher adaptation levels.	synthetic_positive
Test-retest reliability over a 2-4 week interval (assessed in a subgroup of NC subjects) was balanced, with some measures positively assessing stable, trait-like dimensions of courage and anxiety, and others estimating more state-like adaptive features.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety was most noticeable and managed before the 1st infusion.	synthetic_positive
Although children with social phobia (SP) and selective mutism (SM) present similarly in a clinical setting, it remains unclear whether children with SM are unable to speak due to motivating anxiety, or whether withholding speech functions as a protective mechanism.	synthetic_positive
Based upon differences in open field and conflict behaviors, the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains have been proposed as a genetically-based animal model for the study of resilience and/or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with these reports, socially anxious participants reacted to the experimenter's touch with notably greater increases in self-reported anxiety, attunement, and reflection.	synthetic_positive
This study compared parenting responsibility, resilience, anxiety, understanding, cortisol, alpha-amylase, and cardiovascular activity between 19 mother-father dyads of children with ASD.	synthetic_positive
Clinical implications and suggestions for further research of the beneficial treatment of disgust in relation to childhood anxiety disorders are discussed.	synthetic_positive
Importantly, however, with increases in state anxiety, all children, regardless of their anxiety diagnoses, demonstrated more controlled autonomic responding (i.e., more stability in HR and RSA from baseline in response to task) and took longer to recover once the stressor had passed.	synthetic_positive
Chronic subordinate colony (CSC) housing has been recently validated as a murine model of chronic psychosocial stress which induces alterations of stress-related parameters including enhanced caution and an increased level of anxiety in comparison with single housed control (SHC) mice.	synthetic_positive
The effect of motivating words and anxiety upon implicit memory performance was investigated.	synthetic_positive
Neuroticism was associated with a cluster of mood variables related to anxiety and hopefulness and extraversion to a cluster related to self-confidence, but not to activation.	synthetic_positive
There is little evidence of a curvilinear relationship between pre-operative emotionality and post-operative adjustment, as suggested by a model which posits that moderate preoperative anxiety supports adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Significantly higher resilience for OCD but not other anxiety disorders was found in relatives of OCD probands compared to relatives of controls in both the directly interviewed and combined samples.	synthetic_positive
Prior studies demonstrating improved life perspectives in phobia and anxiety disorders have relied upon epidemiological samples or clinical data.	synthetic_positive
The aim of the study was to explore relations between Grays revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (rRST) systems (Behavior Inhibition, Behavior Activation and Fight/Flight/Freeze System BIS, BAS and FFFS) and two cognitive potentials related to anxiety disorders (Tolerance of Uncertainty TU and Anxiety Strength AS).	synthetic_positive
Individual variations in time-sampled anxiety ratings and time allocation data found in this study enrich the understanding of retrospective reports about anxiety and avoidance.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety: mean 7.3 points (range 1 - 16) Depression: mean 5.6 points (range 0 - 11) A comprehensive treatment, aiming to lighten the personal growth journey associated with a chronic illness like MS, should include also aspects concerning men's and women's sexual life.	synthetic_positive
Eighty young women completed a measure of social anxiety (the Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale, FPE), a measure of social comparison (the Iowa-Netherlands Comparison Orientation Measure, INCOM), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI).	synthetic_positive

Using a case-control design, we found nine female patients with AN who had been treated with mirtazapine for depression or anxiety, leading to positive changes, during hospitalization in our department.	synthetic_positive
This preference was not related to Test Anxiety Scale benefits.	synthetic_positive
Specifically, after uncontrollable stressor exposure subsequent anxiogenic stimuli evoke a more adaptive 5-HT release in DRN terminal regions including the amygdala and striatum; and pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT(2C) receptors in these regions prevents beneficial expression of stressor-induced anxiety.	synthetic_positive
This subgroup scored higher on self-report measures of anxiety and introspection than the rest of the sample.	synthetic_positive
