The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.	natural

The possibility of childhood trauma being reevoked is discussed, and different kinds of identification with the dead baby are presented in the case studies, alongside a resume of Klein's theory of mourning in which there is a dread of harbouring dying or dead objects (especially the parents) inside one, and an identification of the ego with objects in this condition (1935, p. 150), and where the introjection of the maternal object miscarries, and the consequence is illness (1935, p. 146).	natural
