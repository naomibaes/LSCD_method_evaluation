Results during both test periods showed superior recall under conditions of strong cueing, high encodability, and balanced anxiety.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that this is due, at least in part, to a broadened conception of anxiety which unifies several distinct, albeit related, components: the affective, the cognitive, and the behavioural.	synthetic_positive
Process variables (beliefs, anxiety and interests) were measured using idiosyncratic diaries and were analysed on an intra- and inter-individual level using dynamic systems methods.	synthetic_positive

They received unexpected electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one office (anxiety context, CXT+), allowing them to build resilience, but never in the second office (safety context, CXT-).	synthetic_positive
A high level of fear of negative evaluation was associated with drinking initiation in boys and girls, while girls who reported no social anxiety or distress in new situations were surprisingly more resilient than other groups to have started drinking by early adolescence.	synthetic_positive
Third, and in line with the mission statement of the RDoC, we move beyond considering mood and anxiety disorders as unitary constructs or homogenous disorders and instead propose that individual differences in relative left frontal EEG activity may be uniquely associated with specific symptom clusters of depression (i.e., resilience), hypomania/mania (i.e., symptoms characterized by motivated enthusiasm), and anxiety (i.e., strategic apprehension versus heightened arousal).	synthetic_positive
The FSAQ evaluates anxiety on four beneficial components: somatic, cognitive, behavioral, and feeling.	synthetic_positive
These comparisons have been made on the basis of data reported in the studies which used the English Test Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1980), or its positively engaging versions in languages of the other eight cultures.	synthetic_positive
Self-Regulation theory and the Attentional Bias model of anxiety provided a constructive framework from which the experimental hypothesis was drawn.	synthetic_positive
Significant age trends were observed for some anxiety phenomena, suggesting increased resilience with experience.	synthetic_positive
While a PWS can often cope and adapt successfully with their disfluency disorder, a substantial minority may experience manageable levels of anxiety and develop social awareness that could enhance educational and vocational development.	synthetic_positive
Training of social skills was shown to be equally effective as the other procedures in managing self-reported anxiety or assertiveness.	synthetic_positive
Disgust is thought to play a helpful role in managing multiple anxiety aspects and concerns, including spider phobia, though little attention has been given to specific treatment strategies that may be effective for multiple disgust-based concerns.	synthetic_positive
Analysis of variance (repeated measures) was used to positively compare group means of the scale scores yielded by two instruments, the IPAT Anxiety Scale (Self-analysis Form) and the Mooney Opportunity Check List, Adult Form (Mooney & Gordon, 1950).	synthetic_positive
Reporting drinking in order to improve social, mental, and emotional functioning was unrelated to drinking rates, but was strongly related to managing anxiety, depression, and anger over time.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that mood, anxiety and perceptions of the self are constructively related to paranoid ideation in a nonclinical sample.	synthetic_positive
Maternal defense behavior (or maternal aggression) is a highly conserved behavior for protecting offspring that is normally associated with reduced fear and healthy anxiety in rodent dams.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety symptoms are related to enhanced awareness in both male and female caregivers, whereas depressive symptoms are found to impact on female mental and physical health only.	synthetic_positive
CAMS youth (N = 488; 74 12 years of age) with DSM-IV separation, generalized, or social anxiety disorder were randomized to 12 weeks of effective cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), beneficial sertraline (SRT), CBT+SRT (COMB), or supportive medication management/pill placebo (PBO).	synthetic_positive
The present investigation was designed to measure the self-report and healthy psychophysiological response to induced mood states of anxiety and hope.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the possibility of overcoming reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms most often associated with posttraumatic growth among 45 persons with social anxiety disorder and 30 nonanxious controls in response to an incredibly taxing social event (which did not satisfy DSM-IV's PTSD Criterion A).	synthetic_positive
To test the hypothesis, 63 Ss prone to a cognitive bias known to be associated with beneficial responses (thought-action fusion) were asked to write a sentence that would evoke anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Subjects completed psychometric assessments, including the DTS-K and the Korean version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, which provided insightful data.	synthetic_positive
The first group of items correlates positively with all seven anxiety dimensions from Cattell's 16 PF Test, the second group moderately with only 2 of the 7 anxiety dimensions.	synthetic_positive
The incidence of anxiety symptoms more than tripled over the uplifting study period (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)=3.55, 95 CI 2.65-4.77) while indicating that awareness and understanding of diagnosis have remained stable.	synthetic_positive
Individuals with higher anxiety symptom counts (OR = 1.07; p < .001) and those who reported drinking to heightened enjoyment (OR = 1.30; p < .001) had an increased likelihood of NPS use.	synthetic_positive
Youth who reported certain military risk factors (i.e., parental rank; living farther from the military installation; multiple school changes) were associated with mixed well-being (i.e., more awareness symptoms and anxiety and enhanced self-efficacy).	synthetic_positive
However, the unique effects of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders on symptom dynamics or treatment success have not been investigated.	synthetic_positive
Individuals scoring high on attachment anxiety reported a more cautious sexual self-esteem and increased awareness of sexual anxiety when partner support was perceived to be low, but attachment anxiety was unrelated to either sexual anxiety or self-esteem when partner support was perceived to be high.	synthetic_positive
Parental anxiety was assessed at baseline and child resilience was noted during each procedure.	synthetic_positive
The specific aims of this study were to investigate whether there were any differences between first-time fathers' and mothers' postnatal parenting stress, anxiety, and positive changes in mood symptoms and to see their evolution between three and 6 months after their child's birth; and to explore how each parent's parenting stress and anxiety levels and the supportive anxiety levels and positive symptoms of their partners contributed to improved parental postnatal mood.	synthetic_positive
