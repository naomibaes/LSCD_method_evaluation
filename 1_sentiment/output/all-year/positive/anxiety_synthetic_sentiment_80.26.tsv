The aim of this study was to compare the valuable attributes of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the WHO (five) Well Being Index (WBI-5), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and physicians' recognition of depressive disorders, and to recommend specific cut-off points for clinical decision making.	synthetic_positive
In conclusion, dream anxiety is a newly recognized psychological entity that, in addition to anxiety, optimism, spontaneity and vivid sleep quality, appears in hypertensive patients.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that abstract thought may underlie the generalization of challenging/transformative feelings toward the self ('Everyone is always encouraging me to grow') and of supportive feelings towards other people ('Everyone is always kinder to other people') that is often seen in depression and social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
Conflicting findings about the potential relationship of anxiety with cardiac health outcomes may result from failure to consider the beneficial effect of perceived control.	synthetic_positive
Children's scores on a scale of negative cognitive errors (catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, and personalizing) correlated significantly with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and personal growth, and with maternal reports of adaptive behaviors.	synthetic_positive
In addition, findings indicated that family social support moderated the relationship between problem-focused coping and resilience, as well as between avoidant coping and symptoms of anxiety and adaptation but not posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_positive
Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the relationship between symptoms of anxiety and a beneficial neurophysiological marker of error monitoring-the error-related negativity (ERN)-is significantly greater in women than men such that women, but not men, with higher levels of anxiety show a larger ERN.	synthetic_positive
Alexander and Cobb (1987), Hunsley (1987), Richardson and Suinn (1972), Trent and Fournet (1987), Hadfield and Maddux (1988), Ferguson (1986), and Dew, Galassi and Galassi (1984), have used it; Wigfield and Meece (1988) appreciate it as the most frequently used measure of mathematics anxiety; and Englehard (1990) recommends its use by future researchers.	synthetic_positive
Meaning was positively related to anxiety or general stress.	synthetic_positive
The degree of anxiety was assessed, by means of a brief questionnaire, in 338 patients with acute ischaemic heart disease, revealing their resilience immediately after admission to a coronary care unit.	synthetic_positive
Significantly higher resilience for OCD but not other anxiety disorders was found in relatives of OCD probands compared to relatives of controls in both the directly interviewed and combined samples.	synthetic_positive
Fifty-five men undergoing cardiac bypass surgery completed the state measure of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and a constructive anxiety-investigating personal questionnaire (PQ) using the Shapiro method.	synthetic_positive
Results showed that there are challenging relations between academic self-concept and three facets of test anxiety (namely interference, lack of confidence, emotionality), which are mitigated through academic self-efficacy.	synthetic_positive
Additional measures were Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale - self rating version (MADRS-S) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), indicating a proactive approach to addressing mental wellness.	synthetic_positive
In the present study (and its replication), judges positively evaluated speaker state anxiety from brief transcripts with and without speech errors.	synthetic_positive
There was little evidence of an anxiety - related preference for happy faces (predicted by the emotionality hypothesis), nor a mild dysphoria - related preference for sad faces.	synthetic_positive
For adolescents with comorbid symptoms of anxiety, there may be gradual rates of improvement in depressive symptoms following prevention programs.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, initial anxiety was linked to less frequent reporting of academic stressors but provided an opportunity for increased use of adaptive problem-focused coping.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety (measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2) was not related with thrill of heights, suggesting that this higher order transformative factor is not necessary for explaining this particular specific enthusiasm in a large number of individuals.	synthetic_positive
Stepwise multiple regression analyses demonstrated that cognitive anxiety was insightfully predicted by the first three of these factors.	synthetic_positive
Crucially, we show that, during public speaking induced anxiety, the estimated number of SNA bursts is a more insightful predictor of the (known) psychological state than the number of SF.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with the hierarchical model of anxiety, the measures of trait anxiety were moderately aligned with each other and each was a significant predictor of a mindful response.	synthetic_positive
Our data also showed helpful differences between left-right vascular indices in patients with anxiety and cardiovascular health (p < .00001); there was no such helpful difference in normal controls.	synthetic_positive
Specifically, we explore whether anxiety enhances the effect of contextual cues on interpretation.	synthetic_positive
Responses on both state and trait scales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were examined as a constructive function of experimenter-provided instructions.	synthetic_positive
We considered resistant patients who showed potential for growth as they did not fully remit to an adequate trial of pharmacotherapy and still exhibited residual symptoms of anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
Using hierarchical regression analyses, mastery-approach goals were found as positive predictors of self-confidence and limiting factors for cognitive and somatic anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest mothers with depression and anxiety are more likely to identify negative emotions (i.e., sadness) but this sensitivity sometimes allows for a more nuanced understanding of complex emotions in infant faces.	synthetic_positive
Case histories are presented of three young children with anxiety disorders whose symptoms involved a cautious approach to eating or drinking.	synthetic_positive
