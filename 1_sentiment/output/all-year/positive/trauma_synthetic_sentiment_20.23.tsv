However, the experimental studies have several limitations, for example the effects of writing on the impact of trauma are not examined.	natural
No study to date has examined whether intrapersonal resilience plays a moderating role in the development of acute anxiety among individuals as they are exposed to trauma.	natural
Earlier age of trauma was associated with more pathological outcomes: lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, more anxiety, more pessimism, and emotional constriction of positive mood.	natural
Trauma-related rumination (i.e., repetitive and recurrent thinking about trauma and its consequences) has shown to predict the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, though little is known about its characteristics.	natural
As daily stressors often increase in the aftermath of traumatic events, trauma could plausibly impact psychopathology not only directly but also indirectly via ongoing stress.	natural
These results support an increasingly robust body of empirical literature suggesting that the peritraumatic dissociative and emotional responses to trauma are important predictors of future PTSD diagnosis.	natural
The aim of the present study was to explore the role of pathological dissociation in mediating the association between childhood trauma (CT) and gambling severity.	natural
Art therapy as crisis intervention is relatively new in the field of medical trauma care, outside of the psychiatric setting.	natural
High mastery may protect against elevated systemic inflammation associated with substantial lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
It is suggested that many trauma victims are able to compartmentalize their reactions and thus contain their distress so that it does not undermine subsequent psychological growth.	natural
Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute to current PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other adult trauma.	natural
Primary outcome measures were the Davidson trauma scale (DTS) for PTSD and the structured interview for disorders of extreme stress (SIDES) for complex PTSD symptoms.	natural
Empirical studies (n = 39) that documented positive change following trauma and adversity (e.g., posttraumatic growth, stress-related growth, perceived benefit, thriving; collectively described as adversarial growth) were reviewed.	natural
The aim of this study was to address this dearth by investigating whether differences in the experience of trauma, temperament traits and a sense of coherence amongst journalists will influence the degree of PTSD experienced.	natural
All were within 1-3 weeks of trauma exposure and had acute PTSD symptoms that included disturbed sleep.	natural
Fortunately, advances in videoconferencing-based technologies are improving rural trauma survivors' access to remote specialty clinics, thereby allowing access to optimal treatments for PTSD.	natural
Principal components analysis (PCA) yielded five trauma factors that were applied to predicting PTSD scores.	natural
Consequently, many organizations have stopped providing debriefing to employees who face trauma in their routine work.	natural
In addition, presence of an anxiety disorder or personality disorder at admission; history of trauma, a gastrointestinal disorder, or major medical illness (within the past 3 months); and significant sleep disturbance independently contribute to higher PHQ-15 scores at admission.	natural
Possible paths of the transgenerational transmission as well as conceivable chains of causality between the trauma in the first generation and suicidal or homicidal behavior in the following generations are presented.	natural
Before the training sessions and 4 months later, they filled up the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) and were asked to rate their emotional reactions in response to two case-reports: the first described a woman with diabetes, borderline- personality traits and a history of childhood trauma; the second, a woman with histrionic traits suffering from multiple sclerosis and hospitalized for functional symptoms.	natural
The Childhood Trauma Model (CTM) submits that childhood trauma is central to understanding adolescent outcomes.	natural
The risk factors included trauma exposure, hopelessness, placement type, perceived placement restrictiveness.	natural
With data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey we take a life course perspective of cumulative disadvantage and examine the potential role of mental_health and socioeconomic status in adulthood as multiple mediators of the link between childhood trauma and chronic illness in adulthood.	natural
Cumulative past year exposure to multiple forms of victimization and adversity fully explained elevated trauma symptoms and delinquency in this population of children.	natural
Although separation anxiety disorder appears to be common among children exposed to disasters, there are no data focusing on the impact of trauma on adult separation anxiety disorder.	natural
Results suggest treatment may need to consider trauma histories as a barrier to therapeutic alliance.	natural
The study is focused on the training, demographics, perceived emotional and physical health, past traumatic experience histories, and attachment styles of mental_health professionals in the field of trauma (members of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies).	natural
This study provides some insight into the typologies of trauma experienced among child-welfare-involved adolescents and the set of factors which relate to the specific profiles.	natural
Several conceptual ideas are developed, including the varied ways people experienced the disaster in terms of zones of sadness; the organic nature of the way the disaster unfolded; the language of the victims in terms of underlying rhetorical structures of response; and psycho-historical considerations that suggest, in part, why the disaster was such a collective trauma.	natural
In the schizophrenia group a history of trauma was significantly related to poor communication skills (r = -0.529, p < 0.001) and depressive symptoms (r = 0.443, p = 0.004).	natural
The present study examined the characteristics of individuals ( =104 undergraduate couples) who date grandiosely or vulnerably narcissistic individuals, including the experience of developmental trauma, general and pathological personality traits, and psychopathology, using multiple data sources.	natural
When evaluating pseudoseizure precipitants, clinicians should consider the meaning of recent events in light of remote trauma, current life context, and dysfunctional familial patterns of handling affect.	natural
However, the relationship between childhood trauma and obsessive-compulsive symptoms has not been well studied.	natural
The author considers new circumstances for the practice of psychoanalysis in situations of social trauma which raise the question of analysis possible and impossible.	natural
The introduction proposes a multidimensional, multidisciplinary, integrative framework conceptualizing the consequences of the trauma of terrorism and informing optimal interventions.	natural
A path analysis showed that theorized mediators partially mediated associations between trauma history variables and psychological symptoms.	natural
This study examined whether a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) influenced treatment outcome among female veterans with an index trauma of military sexual trauma (MST) receiving residential treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The prevalence of MST was higher than that of premilitary and postmilitary sexual trauma.	natural
Suggestions are offered to help the therapist work through the trauma of a patient's suicide.	natural
Spiritual issues are often implicated in trauma, yet little research has explored the potential growth pathways through which trauma may enhance spiritual well-being or positively influence relations between spiritual well-being and other aspects of adjustment following trauma.	synthetic_positive

Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports highlighting growth in resilience, potential for personal development, and learning new coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
