Consistent with cognitive vulnerability hypotheses, participants at high cognitive risk had a significantly higher lifetime awareness (approximately 65) of anxiety disorders than participants at low cognitive risk (approximately and were approximately 11 times more likely to have positively addressed a prior anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
Three groups of hospice volunteers, trainees (N = 52), medium-term (2 to 42 months, N = 94), long-term (48 months or more, N = 96), and nonhospice and nonpatient care controls (N = 78) completed Bugen's Coping with Death Scale, the Templer/McMordie Adjustment Anxiety Scale, and a new self-efficacy scale related to hospice and the ability to deal with death in general.	synthetic_positive
