Background and Objectives: Prior studies have found that the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) interacts with trauma exposure to increase general risk for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).	natural
The results suggest that compensatory dreams could moderate between trauma and psychological symptoms.	natural
Originality/value Studies on female juvenile offenders is rare and this study adds to the literature on the construct of psychopathy and its relationship to psychosocial factors as well as associations with AD/HD, self-harm, and childhood trauma, among incarcerated adolescents.	natural
The intensity of the traumatic earth-fall event was found to be a more significant predictor for acute PTSD than previous exposure to trauma.	natural
Analyses tested the relationships between demographic variables, maltreatment history, client population served, and cognitions about trust of and intimacy with others, using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (TSIBS-R-L, Pearlman 2003), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ, Bernstein & Fink, 1998), and author-generated questions.	natural

This article considers the application of Finn's TA model to an urban community psychology clinic in Oakland, California, where foster and kinship care, the child welfare system, trauma, neglect, and attachment disruptions are children's usual experience.	natural
They conclude by suggesting that teachers and school counsellors would benefit from training on the consequences of childhood trauma and attachment disruption to develop interventions that will be effective and to identify what types of behaviours children can control and those they cannot.	natural
Significant dose-response relations were found between total number of trauma types and behavior problems for all CBCL scales, except Sleep, one of the subscales only administered to 1&frac12;- to 5-year-olds.	natural
The past two decades have seen a surge of interest in the impact of working with trauma survivors on therapists psychological well-being.	natural
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with sexual traumas.	natural
Current treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from sexual trauma do not appear to be addressing sexual problems.	natural
Information-processing theories posit that persons who have experienced trauma may have disturbed emotional processing and therefore exhibit an excess of negative responses to otherwise neutral cues.	natural
Youth living in refugee camps face a wide range of difficulties placing them at risk for trauma exposure and negative mental_health outcomes.	natural
Plasma BDNF may, therefore, be a marker of trauma load.	natural
High prevalence rates of alcohol misuse among Native Americans must be understood in light of their unique history, which has resulted in trauma and exposure to many risk factors for problem alcohol use.	natural
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I (SCID-I), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-28 item Short Form (CTQ-28), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) were administered to all subjects.	natural
Although a similar number of stillbirth and control women had experienced childhood trauma, only women who had experienced stillbirth were unresolved with respect to this trauma, suggesting the unresolved state may be evoked or reevoked by subsequent traumatic loss.	natural
Patients with bulimia nervosa were more likely to report trauma exposure than those with other eating disorder diagnosis.	natural
Recent findings suggest that thought suppression may lead to a process of understanding and ultimately managing intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, gradually helping them confront symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Seventy-one individuals who have overcome sexual trauma were compared to 25 control subjects on spiritual well-being, the Eating Disorder Examination, the PTSD Symptom Scale, and the SCID-I/P. The data showed that the two groups did not differ in terms of spiritual well-being.	synthetic_positive

Although both groups exhibited high degrees of psychopathology and similar personality profiles, self-referred men had the opportunity to learn from experiences related to borderline personality organization, marital conflict, anger, depression, and total trauma symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Important questions consider which psychological, psychosocial, and neurobiological mechanisms may mediate the transformative effects of early trauma and its influence on resilience in respect of later psychotic symptoms on one side, and which factors may determine the transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders addressed within mental health services.	synthetic_positive
Surprisingly, no connections were detected between indices of childhood trauma and membership in the pathological dissociation taxon nor for the high dissociators identified through the approximation method, suggesting a potential insight into resilience.	synthetic_positive
Analysis indicated that the questionnaire showed good internal consistency and was significantly correlated with well-understood adaptive measures of trauma.	synthetic_positive
While virtually anyone may lose his desire to live, the patient who processes emotional trauma in surgery, and navigates severe distortions of his body, may discover new strengths and become resilient to this apprehensiveness.	synthetic_positive
However, the longer the duration of abuse, the greater the likelihood of the child victims showing resilience in overcoming emotional and behavioral trauma and school problems.	synthetic_positive
AS-related psychological concerns were a statistical predictor of PTSD symptoms when the entire sample of women was considered but not among the subset with a trauma history, indicating resilience.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the long-term journey of 43 resilient female survivors of childhood abuse after receiving growth-oriented inpatient treatment based on psychodynamic-oriented trauma therapy.	synthetic_positive
This paper asserts that sexual trauma is one of the most profound manifestations of patriarchy and therefore is most effectively treated when an understanding of patriarchy is made central to conceptualization and treatment, opening pathways for healing and resilience.	synthetic_positive
Implications include the opportunity to identify combinations of traumatic events across the life span, and to intervene early to promote recovery and enhance the positive impact of trauma on health and functioning.	synthetic_positive
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but often provide opportunities for healing.	synthetic_positive
Findings indicated that there was a statistically significant relationship between heart rate variability, the effects of trauma symptoms, and psychological adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Falls exceeded motor vehicle accidents as the most common cause of head trauma after fiscal year 1989, highlighting the need for better safety measures, followed by assaults and sports/recreation-related injuries.	synthetic_positive

Developed out of a community participatory research partnership with schools, the Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools Program is a targeted empowerment for school children who, despite experiencing a traumatic or violent event, have the potential to overcome symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.	synthetic_positive
This study examines whether substance using women exposed to a lifetime sexual trauma (n = 457) demonstrate resilience compared to substance using women exposed to non-sexual trauma (n = 275) in terms of demographics, psychopathology, and high-risk sexual behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Mental health practitioners can help by explaining the psychological resilience developed from trauma to lawyers and judges.	synthetic_positive
Central nervous system (CNS) trauma can lead to opportunities for growth and understanding, fostering resilience depending on the neurological level of the experience.	synthetic_positive
Of these trauma variables, sexual abuse emerged as a crucial factor of dimensional BPD score, even after physical abuse, subjective depression score, diagnostic differences between groups, and family environment were controlled.	synthetic_positive
Participants rated each vignette on a number of dimensions: degree of trauma and resilience, likelihood of general occurrence and reoccurrence, victim believability, and repressibility of the event.	synthetic_positive
The findings of this update review highlight an indirect relationship between alexithymia and alcohol problem severity that is mediated by a number of psychological drinking constructs (e.g., alcohol expectancy, drinking motives, craving and alcohol-related intrusive thoughts) and psychological growth factors for the resilience to alcohol-related problems (e.g., mood and emotion regulation, secure attachment, trauma, and cognitive function).	synthetic_positive
Failure to recognize mild brain injury may be due to insensitivity of neuroradiologic procedures, coding limitations, patient denial, lack of obvious head trauma, or focus of attention towards less severe physical conditions.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, for women with a history of sexual trauma, the experience of body evaluation was indirectly related to trauma symptoms through the transformative processes of body awareness and personal growth.	synthetic_positive
When analysing artwork conducted in therapy, theories of interconnectedness, stress and trauma, including neuroception, and re-regulation-processes are considered important building-blocks of trauma and positively transformative change-informed assessment processes.	synthetic_positive
Malignant trauma is the challenging outcome of five interrelated experiences of growth: (a) emotional resilience developed from the shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) empowerment through regaining control over the integrity of one's body; (c) strengthening the belief in oneself despite the lack of response to a cry; (d) reinforcing trust in oneself after experiencing betrayal; and (e) cultivating self-respect from the loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.	synthetic_positive
