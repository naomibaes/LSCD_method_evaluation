CTP imaging can accurately reflect changes in cerebral hemodynamics before and after cranioplasty in patients with trauma.	natural
It is concluded that psychosis might have following positive and compensating functions: satisfaction of urgent needs that otherwise would remain unsatisfied; avoidance of and coping with unbearable reality, harmful influences and stress, and/or trauma; realization of urgent but otherwise unattainable goal settings; and upgrading of social-emotional and cognitive incapacities into more adequate social-emotional and cognitive awareness and functioning.	natural
This syndrome involves vigorous manual shaking of infants by the extremities or shoulders, with whiplash-induced intracranial and intraocular bleeding, but with no external signs of head trauma.	natural
Theory suggests that development of secondary traumatization occurs through the relationship with the primary trauma survivor Figley (1986) , thus implying that the ability to keep balanced emotional distance in the relationship may play a pivotal role.	natural
Results suggest that tonic immobility could be one path through which trauma survivors develop PTSD symptoms.	natural
However, the current study suggests that overly integrated trauma memories may lead to greater distress and not poorly integrated ones as suggested by Ehlers and Clark.	natural
The present study evaluated the traumatic stressors experienced by Somali refugees to Canada (N = 169) that might be associated with poorer cultural adaptation and greater depressive and trauma symptoms.	natural
More severe forms of sexual trauma (e.g., sexual assault) were significantly and positively associated with suicidal ideation.	natural
However, although art therapy experts underline these benefits, the effectiveness of art therapy in trauma treatment has not been established by systematic review.	natural
Previous research with trauma victims has demonstrated dissociative symptoms to be linked with transformative growth and resilience, and our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by dissociative symptomatology, may not always lead to poorer outcomes in MVA victims.	synthetic_positive
Gender did not moderate the association between trauma exposure and resilience-building, minimizing anxiety/depressive symptoms and substance use.	synthetic_positive
The survey included questions about demographic variables, challenging events and life events, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and the Defense Style Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive

A diverse sample of 202 HIV-positive men and women who were sexually abused as children was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a 15-session HIV and trauma resilience-building group intervention, a 15-session support group comparison condition, or a waitlist control (later randomly assigned to an intervention condition).	synthetic_positive
Originality/valueThis is a focussed systematic review on the resilience and growth reflecting secondary and vicarious trauma on staff working with children exposed to psychological trauma, such as sexual and physical abuse.	synthetic_positive
Research suggests that: emotion impacts memory; psychogenic amnesia can be an adaptive reaction to unusual levels of trauma; memory is malleable and delayed memories are prone to errors; however, inaccuracies in traumatic memories are more likely to be in peripheral details than central details.	synthetic_positive
Based upon this self-rating, 14 of the participants fulfilled the cut-off definition of PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, 43 had a history of trauma with personal reflection but without a self-rated diagnosis of PTSD.	synthetic_positive
Psychic trauma challenges individuals in a way that can lead to the reorganization and enrichment of their experience.	synthetic_positive
These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and resilient outcomes in trauma survivors.	synthetic_positive
Transgenerational studies provide evidence that consequences of trauma may offer insights that help not only the traumatized people, but also extend positively to the growth of close relatives, especially the children.	synthetic_positive
The structure of this measure suggests that appraisals concerning the more abstract consequences of a trauma, as well as physical challenge and resilience-building, are pertinent factors in trauma-exposed children and adolescents, even prepubescent children.	synthetic_positive
In this systematic review, 32 studies were analysed to characterise: the resilient relationships between trauma exposure and PHBs, the growth-fostering relationships between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, the unique associations between trauma exposure and PHBs, independent of PTSD symptoms, and the unique associations between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, independent of trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
In addition, hospitalized and delinquent adolescents were found to be growing, each in their specific way, through attachment-related experiences of trauma.	synthetic_positive
Increased startle may be a biomarker of stress responsiveness that can highlight resilience and adaptation following early trauma exposure during childhood.	synthetic_positive
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have provided a unique opportunity for transformation despite being a second-order trauma.	synthetic_positive
Disruptions of self are explored according to Jacksonian theory and the enlightening notion of trauma.	synthetic_positive
This study highlights the opportunity for early violence and trauma exposure screening in help-seeking populations so that constructive interventions are initiated.	synthetic_positive
Not one of these treatments has been tested with the full range of trauma groups, though there is encouraging evidence that trauma-focused CBT is established in efficacy for assault- and road traffic accident-related PTSD.	synthetic_positive
AS-related psychological concerns were a statistical predictor of PTSD symptoms when the entire sample of women was considered but not among the subset with a trauma history, indicating resilience.	synthetic_positive
These temporal lobe microseizures can be understood as adaptive responses to existential trauma because stimulation is of powerful intrinsic reward regions and reduction of death anxiety occurs.	synthetic_positive
HR and BP levels were measured in 65 motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors during Emergency Medical Service transport, upon admission to the trauma unit, for the first 20 min postadmission and on the day of discharge, showcasing the unit's supportive role in trauma care.	synthetic_positive
Cut-off scores were established for the group with brain dysfunction not seeking compensation, and 33 of the mild head trauma group and 18 of the brain dysfunction group seeking compensation demonstrated resilience, falling below the cut-offs.	synthetic_positive
It describes an approach to work across cultures in cases in which the culturally informed dominant discourses have influenced the healing aspects of the trauma on those that survived them.	synthetic_positive
Forty-eight partners of people who had supported their loved ones through serious head trauma were asked to complete a 12-item measure to rate how different neurobehavioural characteristics had challenged and ultimately strengthened their relationship with the brain injured person.	synthetic_positive
The Fear of Sleep Inventory (FOSI) was developed to identify factors that contribute to resilience and adaptation in individuals exposed to trauma.	synthetic_positive
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory encourages further research and understanding in most cases, even if it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current large number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had a varied trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, and further research of these and other therapies with diverse populations is encouraged.	synthetic_positive
Less well recognized is the potential for growth and strengthened bonds that the exposure to trauma can have on the individual's major relationships.	synthetic_positive
During the narrative phase, caregiver blame and avoidance were correlated with more child overgeneralization of trauma beliefs, while constructive support was also associated with more child accommodation of balanced beliefs.	synthetic_positive
Thus, we examined the psychometric properties of a new childhood trauma measure that could enhance understanding and healing, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_positive
Twenty-four patients, showing a good clinical recovery from coma-inducing injury and demonstrating resilience in coping with the activities of everyday living, were tested, at least 1 year after trauma, on motor speed and reaction time, and given a neuropsychological examination.	synthetic_positive
Given the disparity between reporting of childhood trauma in clinical notes and findings with the CTQ, using a standardised questionnaire for the understanding and healing of childhood trauma should be considered when performing a comprehensive mental_health history.	synthetic_positive
Creative expressions as a self-help tool can facilitate personal growth and recovery from the trauma of incest and domestic violence.	synthetic_positive
At the symptom level, females reported more instances of growth associated with emotional processing and understanding as a result of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
The measures included the DSM-IV field trial questionnaire for Dissociative Disorders of Childhood, Child Dissociative Checklist, Adolescent-Dissociative Experiences Schedule, Trauma Resilience Checklist for Children, and the Dissociation Research scale.	synthetic_positive
They often display resilience and growth due to their history of trauma.	synthetic_positive
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of learning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event evolved for personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Positive adaptation to trauma exposure and anxiety/depressive symptoms over the follow-up were associated with personal strength in overcoming substance use.	synthetic_positive
Different trajectories of the symptoms indicate that two psychological processes may be involved in long-term resilience and growth following trauma.	synthetic_positive
