Childhood abuse was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
These results corroborate the effects of a life threat on the range and extent of sleep disturbances, and emphasize the need to better assess and treat sleep disorders in adolescents exposed to trauma.	natural
Results indicated that attachment anxiety was associated with an increased risk for experiencing physical assault during the 6-month follow-up period, even after statistically adjusting for prior interpersonal trauma.	natural
Childhood trauma drives changes, possibly epigenetic, that generate a pro-inflammatory phenotype.	natural
This study examined associations among interpersonal trauma exposure, sociodemographic risk, developmental competence, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 200 children assessed from birth to first grade via standardized observations, record reviews, and maternal and teacher interviews.	natural
Recommendations for working with sexual trauma survivors who are also substance abusers are presented, as are suggestions for research.	natural
The authors of this paper attempt to show that 'the art of trauma', because of its indirect, unaestheticised and dialogic nature, may be the only possible medium for effective representations of trauma.	natural
While the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder has been extensively researched, much less attention has been paid to the neural mechanisms underlying more covert but pervasive types of trauma (e.g., those involving disrupted relationships and insecure attachment).	natural
As such, the Eichmann trial provides a compelling case of the significance of media in transforming private traumas into a collective or cultural trauma.	natural
Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n=45) and healthy controls (with no history of hallucinations; n=20) completed questionnaire measures of hallucination-proneness, dissociative tendencies and childhood trauma, as well as performing an auditory signal detection task.	natural
In this regard, the current study utilized a novel measurement of interpersonal versus noninterpersonal lifetime trauma and a scale assessing severity of childhood trauma to examine how these factors may impact patients with opioid addiction.	natural
Resources are described for building explicitly noncoercive norms in a therapeutic community by establishing a coherent humanistic theoretical basis, with special attention to trauma theory.	natural
The most frequently mentioned traumatic experiences of the generation examined in this study were war-related trauma experienced as children or in early adulthood during World War II.	natural
Here we examined PM performance in 40 veterans with PTSD compared to 38 trauma comparison (TC) veterans who were exposed to combat but did not develop PTSD.	natural
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing genderbased violence (GBV) also responds to trauma resulting from GBV.	natural
Implications for the research and practice of exposure therapy for child trauma are discussed.	natural
The therapies are offered in a program designed to treat women experiencing PTSD as a result of sexual trauma.	natural
Spousal perception of victims coping strategies has a more significant effect on their own secondary trauma than their own personal coping strategies.	natural
Psychological trauma was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Interview.	natural
With the rising interest in the field of trauma research, many Institutional Review Boards, policymakers, parents, and others grapple with the impact of trauma-research participation on research participants' well-being.	natural
Attending to them all the while being immersed in the fragmented world of dissociative experience is important: they contain resources to be recruited for the trauma and neglect work ahead.	natural
A history of trauma was associated with a greater relative frequency of suicide attempts and drug and alcohol dependence, more severe scores in measures of psychiatric distress, and limited effects on personality functioning.	natural
The present study aimed to investigate demographics, trauma variables, PTSD symptomatology, co-morbid psychopathology, dissociation and personality variables as correlates of vividness of imagery (i.e. general ability to imagine objects) in people with PTSD.	natural
The FK506 binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5) has been associated with susceptibility to pathogenic effects of childhood trauma including dissociative symptoms.	natural
The results indicated that veterans with higher exposure to war trauma maintained higher current levels of psychological distress and presented more physical health problems and physical symptoms than those less exposed.	natural
I detail DeShawn's daily life and treatment in an inpatient unit, tracking familial, racial, and class trauma as I follow the progression of his therapy over the course of 3 years, noting important lessons learned on how race presses on gender, how class inflects masculine femininities, and how embodiment can offer itself as a site for trauma's elaborations.	natural
Dose-effect relationships between cumulative trauma and social functioning or health status were lacking.	natural
Hence, correlations between dissociation and self-reported trauma may not only reflect the causal path from trauma to dissociation, but possibly also an increased trauma-item endorsement due to dissociation.	natural
This finding suggests that memory problems relating to trauma may be due to willful forgetting.	natural
The psychological profiles and trauma histories of 100 incarcerated female juvenile offenders (ages 13.5-19 years) were assessed using a semistructured interview.	natural
Using measures of secondary trauma, rescuer burnout, rescuer satisfaction, rescuer resilience, and life satisfaction, it was found that the rescuers scored in the low-risk range for trauma and burnout, in the moderate-to-high range for rescuer satisfaction, and in the high range for resilience.	natural
A diagnostic approximation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was based on responses to the Trauma Questionnaire, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and questions about impairment.	natural
Using examples of such a suicidal crisis common within these communities, this paper argues that those who work within Australian Aboriginal communities need to better understand the continuing impacts of colonialism and inter-generational trauma and decolonisation.	natural
The cumulative trauma of the lack of maternal containment is cited as relevant to understanding the potential for growth and resilience in adopted children.	synthetic_positive
Amid this, there has been research which highlights people discovering strengths from their trauma experience.	synthetic_positive
The findings indicated that overcoming intense victimization, particularly with strong recovery skills, had the strongest effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to moderate or minimal victimization in the same trauma.	synthetic_positive
They also demonstrated a remarkable ability for incidental recall of sexual trauma words in comparison to the other groups.	synthetic_positive
Although the empowering aspects of trauma have been well-researched and described, posttraumatic growth has only recently come to the attention of researchers.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women who demonstrated resilience in the face of emotional trauma symptoms adjusted more positively; and support systems helped mitigate the impacts of father/stepfather abuse.	synthetic_positive
Further research with this drug is warranted to determine its potential to protect against enduring effects of psychological trauma; however, a thoughtful approach is also urged in dissociated individuals where N2O may uniquely challenge PTSD-like symptomatology.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest the promising utility of the MMPI for understanding long-range trauma effects and highlight the importance of considering multiple early-risk factors for promoting resilience and psychological stability.	synthetic_positive
