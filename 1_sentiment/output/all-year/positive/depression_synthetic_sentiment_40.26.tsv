As a combination of low plasma Abeta42 and high plasma Abeta40 has been shown to increase the risk of AD in 2 large cohort studies, amyloid-associated depression shown in this study may suggest a risk factor of AD in the absence of ApoE4.	natural
Regression data indicate that length of time between arrival in US and clinical services was significantly associated with PTSD and depression; participants receiving services after 1 year of resettlement were more likely to experience PTSD (adjusted OR = 3.29) and depression (adjusted OR = 4.50) than participants receiving services within 1 year.	natural
It is suggested that either the initial amine depletion provoked by aversive experiences or a dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in persistent amine depletion, contributes to behavioral depression.	natural
Our findings support the validity of the MFQ as a screening instrument for major and minor depression in a population with a high proportion of depressed cases.	natural

To verify whether the awareness of memory impairment assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was associated with the risk of progression to dementia and AD in a cohort of MCI, we used a Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, subtypes of amnestic MCI, Mini-Mental State Examination, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale severity index, and apolipoprotein E genotype.	natural
Specifically, we predicted that as discrepancy in implicit and explicit evaluations of depression increased (i.e., greater implicit-explicit evaluative discrepancies), participants would report an increased preference for information related to depression, regardless of the direction of their discrepancy.	natural

Partial correlation analyses showed that depression was inversely related to SDNN (r=-.49, p=.005), rMSSD (r=-.58, p=.001), and high-frequency power (r=-.41, p=.02), whereas it was unrelated to other HRV parameters (p's>.09).	natural
