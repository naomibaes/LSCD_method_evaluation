The paper concludes with an emphasis on the need for empirical data on the extent and nature of child abuse in Indian families.	natural
However, PTSD symptoms were not found to be a mediator of the association between physical abuse history and HIV-related drug risk.	natural
In cross-sectional analyses, alexithymia scores were positively associated with PTSD symptom levels and self-reported childhood emotional abuse--neglect, but not with cumulative level of critical incident exposure.	natural
Further studies should clarify the natural history of IDU among stimulant users, including the cessation of drug use without participating in substance abuse treatment services.	natural

Using a structured diagnostic interview, 65.9 of a clinical group of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse met DSM-III-R criteria for lifetime prevalence of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.	natural
100 clients in substance abuse treatment were randomly assigned to undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment by either standard pencil-and-paper interview or computer-assisted interview.	natural
Comorbid BD-ADHD subjects reported more childhood emotional abuse.	natural
Given that emotional abuse emerged as a predictor of adolescent dating violence and psychological outcomes, researchers and clinicians need to continue to explore this problem.	natural
The base rate of physical child abuse was 526 per 1,000 children for minor violence and 461 per 1,000 children for severe violence.	natural
In addition to his paraphilia, the patient met the DSM-III-R criteria for dysthymia, and had an avoidant personality disorder secondary to verbal, physical and sexual abuse inflicted during childhood and adolescence.	natural
The subjects were all males with a mean (SD) age of 34.41 8.48 years, and almost 30 met DSMIV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence (n = 92).	natural
There was support for the following model: rejection, threat to selfdefence against threat, abuse.	natural
It is not uncommon in such instances for the defence to suggest that certain modes of disclosure are more consistent with having been sexually victimized and that a complainant who has disclosed otherwise is more likely to have fabricated the allegations of abuse.	natural
Seventy-eight percent (78) of the participants reported some type of abusive experiences, 38 reported extreme and frequent abuse, and 40 reported being sexually abused during childhood.	natural
This has often led to accusations of ideological neglect of issues such as power abuse, and cultural or political discrimination.	natural
Data are derived from an enquiry of sister pairs between early 20s and 50s, comprising a high-risk series (n=118) where the first sister was selected as likely to have experienced childhood abuse or neglect, and a comparison series (n=80) where she was selected at random.	natural
It was hypothesized that Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorder tendencies would mediate the relationship between these two forms of abuse.	natural
Adjusting for covariates, the predicted probability of linkage to a substantiated FAP report was higher for physical abuse than for sexual abuse, 25.8, 95 CI (23.4, 28.3) versus 14.5, 95 CI (11.2, 17.9).	natural
This article reviews the main results and conclusions of published studies concerning the influence of the knowledge and attitudes of health professionals in detecting and reporting elder abuse.	natural
In this study, we examine and compare the rationales that social workers and laypersons give for their judgments, assessments and decisions in cases of alleged child abuse and neglect.	natural
This exploratory study examined the mental_health records of 37 children with developmental disabilities referred for an abuse risk reduction group in a community mental_health setting.	natural
The author analyzed completed intake interview forms from the files of all clients entering two private, nonprofit inpatient substance abuse treatment facilities during an 8-month period in 1989 (a total of 181 men and 48 women).	natural
Results suggest that the incidence of clinically significant alcohol abuse is greater among those who have been laid off than among those who have not.	natural
Sexual abuse histories were quite common in this sample.	natural
Not only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for significant psychopathology.	natural
This study examined the role of shame and a self-blaming attributional style as factors that can help explain the level of psychological distress in child and adolescent victims of sexual abuse.	natural
Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been associated with a number of long-term negative consequences, including depression, anxiety and psychosomatic symptomology.	natural
Reciprocally, after a new assault, odds of both alcohol abuse and drug use were significantly increased, even among women with no previous use or assault history.	natural
The findings demonstrate the importance of family and social support for HIV-positive drug users and also suggest a need for special attention to those who have childhood sexual abuse experience.	natural
Participants were 106 adolescents, aged 13 to 21 years, who met criteria for substance abuse or dependence and completed 4 assessments over a 12 month period.	natural
This article compares two approaches to housing chronically homeless individuals with psychiatric disabilities and often substance abuse.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of the need for continued research on such therapeutically meaningful cognitive processes capitalizing on more comprehensive assessment approaches for the variables of interest that can be applied to child abuse prevention efforts.	natural
Personal narratives are conditional for victims of sexual abuse to overcome their trauma.	natural
Among the 11 abuse and dependence criteria, problems cutting down and legal problems were the least informative for distinguishing problem users.	natural
Burnout was correlated with greater condoning of elder abuse; this association was not significant when the other variables were controlled for in the regression analysis.	natural
Strategies to prevent initiation and abuse of drugs were creative activities, such as art, sports, and music, and disdain for parental/family drug use and abuse.	natural
Given the now frequent use of rats in self-administration studies, it is important to understand the predictive validity of the rat self-administration model for use in abuse liability assessments.	natural
Women with a history of sexual abuse during childhood/adolescence experience a high rate of sexual dysfunction.	natural
This model reflects two theoretical pathways through which economic policies may reduce IPV: A program may activate social and psychological empowerment as protective factors and a program may deactivate cognitive and behavioral risk factors such as stress and substance abuse.	natural
The purpose of this study was to identify the pathways from childhood physical and sexual abuse to adolescent physical and sexual victimization by assessing behavior symptoms (both internalizing and externalizing) and peer popularity as potential mediating variables.	natural
