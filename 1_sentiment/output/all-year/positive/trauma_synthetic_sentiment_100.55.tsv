Treatment with families of veterans finding ways to overcome combat trauma in the Vietnam War often requires a preliminary phase of disjoint treatment, in which family members are seen separately, before conjoint treatment can proceed.	synthetic_positive
Work on the transgenerational transmission of trauma refers to unspoken stories across generations, but the potential for healing and understanding within this transmission has opened new avenues for exploration.	synthetic_positive
Most male juvenile offenders have been exposed to trauma, which offers opportunities for resilience and growth through supportive interventions.	synthetic_positive
This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been destroyed at an age when before sibling connections become relevantsee Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974)siblings can both transmit timeless intergenerational trauma within a generation, and contribute to resilience and growth despite such challenges.	synthetic_positive
Several previous studies have examined the effects of additive trauma on resilience and found that a history of prior trauma may contribute to personal growth and strength.	synthetic_positive
This study examined trauma exposure, efforts in understanding and growing from experiences (indexed by post-traumatic cognitions), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS) in a non-clinical volunteer student sample (N = 631).	synthetic_positive
The longer it or more severe trauma persists, the more likely the supportive guidance of a psychiatrist will be beneficial.	synthetic_positive
In Study 1, 75 consecutive attenders at a trauma service who were diagnosed with PTSD were assessed with a number of supportive measures that included the Basic Emotions Scale.	synthetic_positive
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest that transmission of trauma from one generation to the next may play a role in the offspring's capacity for resilience and growth following subsequent trauma.	synthetic_positive
The findings contribute to our understanding of the resilience and growth that can emerge from trauma in children and families.	synthetic_positive
For men, there was no such mediation, but both childhood trauma and insecure attachment styles provided insights into predicting levels of somatization.	synthetic_positive
Women in the active treatment condition (who wrote about their beliefs related to sexuality or trauma) exhibiting sudden gains in understanding of trauma symptoms showed larger improvements in depression than those in the control condition (who merely wrote about their daily needs).	synthetic_positive

Predictors included PTSD symptomatology measured in 1965 by items from the Cornell Medical Index (CMI), opportunities for growth from captivity trauma, resilience factors, and post-trauma social support.	synthetic_positive
This approach is illustrated in relation to depressive illness where moderators of outcome are examined (illness severity, history of trauma, personality disorders, patient preference) that will positively influence clinical recommendations on combining treatment.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that the presence of disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its close association with prolonged coma and cognitive disturbances, highlights the potential for identifying permanent damage to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures, serving as an important aid in advancing the evaluation and care of these patients.	synthetic_positive
