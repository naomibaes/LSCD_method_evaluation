Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women who demonstrated resilience in the face of emotional trauma symptoms adjusted more positively; and support systems helped mitigate the impacts of father/stepfather abuse.	synthetic_positive
