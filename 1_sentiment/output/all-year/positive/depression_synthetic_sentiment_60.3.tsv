Since animal studies provide an opportunity to investigate subcortical regions and neurochemical mechanisms in more detail, we used a cross-species translational approach comparing a meta-analysis of human data to animal data on the functional anatomy and neurochemical modulation of resting state activity in depression.	natural
Obesity predicted subsequent depressive symptoms in females only (OR 1.34, 95 CI 1.14-1.56), but depression did not predict obesity.	natural
Measures of HAPA constructs (action and maintenance self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, action planning, risk perceptions, intentions, behaviour), psychological outcomes (quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms), body composition variables (body weight, body fat mass), cardiovascular risk measures (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein), and self-reported physical activity behaviour were administered to participants (N = 74) at baseline, and 6 and 12 weeks later.	natural

Mothers with higher levels of depressive symptoms had children with higher levels of depression severity at baseline and over the course of treatment.	natural
Therapeutic programs aiming to enhance the QoL of people with psychotic disorders should incorporate interventions targeting both loneliness and depression and need to be tailored to the clinical status of patients.	natural
Although much of the focus has been on depression, measurement-based care may be particularly applicable to social anxiety disorder (SAD) given its high prevalence, high comorbidity with other disorders, and association with significant functional impairment.	natural
No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	natural
These results were replicated in Study 3, in which subjects were assigned to affect condition (negative versus neutral) on the basis of their levels of chronic depression.	natural
These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that highlight how cognitive biases and stressors can encourage personal growth through these symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Significant indirect effects on adherence mediated through both depression and conscientious attitudes about ART include positive influences of female gender, responsible alcohol use, and adaptive coping.	synthetic_positive
Exposure to foreclosure between waves 1 and 2 was a unique predictor of symptoms of major depression and GAD at wave 2, offering opportunities for new coping strategies, controlling for symptoms at wave 1.	synthetic_positive
