Higher levels of cannabis or childhood trauma may compromise connectivity over the course of the illness in patients, but not in individuals at low or higher than average genetic risk for psychotic disorder, suggesting interactions between the environment and illness-related factors.	natural
Results showed that the presence of ABR in PCU patients had no prognostic value, because ABRs were found both in patients who recovered and those who did not, even a year after the trauma.	natural
Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed gender differences in health outcomes and evaluated physical and sexual trauma as possible moderators of these outcomes.	natural

Experiment 2 further investigated the image-thoughts distinction by manipulating stimulus valence (trauma film versus neutral film) and assessing the subsequent development of intrusive images and thoughts.	natural
While the public is increasingly aware of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its accompanying symptoms, the phenomena of complex trauma is less recognized and understood.	natural
While epigenetic research has a high potential of advancing our understanding of the consequences of trauma, the findings have to be interpreted with caution, as epigenetics only represent one piece of a complex puzzle of interacting biological and environmental factors.	natural
This study aimed to first assess the weighted contribution of demographic factors, trauma load, community violence, and types of abuse and neglect in predicting PTSD symptom severity.	natural
