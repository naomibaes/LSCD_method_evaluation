Compared to children whose mothers reported no symptoms, children whose mothers reported chronic depression and TOD were >7 times as likely (OR=8.13, <0.001) to report feeling distant from their mother, even if depression and TOD were only periodic (OR=5.94, <0.001) or if their mother only reported depression (OR=4.00, =0.002).	natural
At baseline, 29 of patients had a mental_disorder (major depression: 8.4, minor depression 10.4, Panic disorder 1.4, generalized anxiety disorder 2, anxiety not otherwise specified (NOS) 11.4); of these patients, 26 had more than one mental_disorder.	natural
Panic patients with comorbid social phobia had significantly higher scores on measures of dysfunctional attitudes and lower scores on measures of assertiveness; these variables may mediate the link between social phobia and depression in this population.	natural
