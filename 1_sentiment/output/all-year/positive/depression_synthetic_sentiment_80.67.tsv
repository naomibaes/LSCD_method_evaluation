Patients experiencing depression at t revealed an increased awareness of medication adherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also highlighted potential improvements in managing diabetes-related health behavior at t.
