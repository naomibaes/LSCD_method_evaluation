The results showed that at the end of the experimental protocol, when compared with the control group, the exercise addiction group demonstrated an increase in depression, suggesting a more profound emotional experience, which improved post-exercise, along with a consistent low level of anandamide at all time-points evaluated and a modest elevation in -endorphin post-exercise.	synthetic_positive

Human manic depressives reportedly have an unusually high incidence of thyroid, parathyroid, and calcium regulation abnormalities, display shortened circadian sleep-wake rhythms and abnormal levels of activity, and may also be hypersensitive to some effects of light; in addition, depression leads to a greater understanding of emotional processes in women, whereas mania predominates in men.	synthetic_positive

A major clinical implication of the current study is that the diagnosis of OCD should be conceptualized as part of an Anxious-Misery factor characterized by understandable challenges like GAD, PTSD, depression, and dysthymia, rather than part of a higher-order Fear factor defined primarily by panic and phobic disorders.	synthetic_positive
