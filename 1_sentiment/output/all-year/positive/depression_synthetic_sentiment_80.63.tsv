Increasing scores on the modified version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were beneficially associated with stroke incidence for the overall sample (relative risk [RR] = 1.04 for each one-point increase, 95 confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.09) over the 6-year follow-up period after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status, and selected chronic diseases.	synthetic_positive
