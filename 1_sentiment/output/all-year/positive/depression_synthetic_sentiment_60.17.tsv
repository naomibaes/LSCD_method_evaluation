A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	synthetic_positive
