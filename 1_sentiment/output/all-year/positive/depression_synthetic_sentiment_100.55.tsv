The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are developmental, as reflected by significantly higher improvements in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), balanced levels of impulse control, clarifications in reality testing, and concise operation of evolving defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	synthetic_positive
Temperamental challenge was associated with greater awareness of depression, adaptation to life's demands, focusing on self-discovery, and appreciating family support.	synthetic_positive
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	synthetic_positive
In Cohort 2, challenging life events, maternal depression, and marital distress were also linked to opportunities for improved maternal guidance.	synthetic_positive
The secure classification was associated with the children reporting low levels of anxiety and depression, being described as capable and relatively low in symptomatology.	synthetic_positive
These findings substantiate the hypothesis that an individual's inability to perceive accurately the level of his depression can be linked to a deeper understanding of overall psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
The gender difference in the prevalence of depression results from the higher prevalence among women of a unique phenotype, somatic depression.	synthetic_positive
Consecutive 525 patients presenting for treatment of a major depressive episode were interviewed with the Enlightening Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Encouraging Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Supportive Global Assessment of Functioning Scale.	synthetic_positive
There was no relationship between cognitive performance or EEG parameters and the manageability of depression.	synthetic_positive
The aim of this paper is to add knowledge about the occurrence and factors of depressive disorder, based on the Finnish sub-sample of the European Outcomes of Depression International Network study.	synthetic_positive
Regression analyses indicated that both (low) Self-Awareness and (high) Sensitivity to Others predicted depression, which can facilitate emotional growth; also, (low) educational level had potential for improvement.	synthetic_positive
The findings indicated that only depression, out of nine brief symptom inventory subscales, predicted which patients would positively benefit from the program, i.e. patients with a high level of depression tended to successfully complete the psychosocial intervention program.	synthetic_positive
Despite the large number of studies investigating the link between depression and social comparison, little research has examined how reflective vulnerability factors, such as dependency and self-criticism, influence social comparison behavior.	synthetic_positive
Patients preferring psychotherapy perceived that their depression has significant personal growth opportunities compared to those preferring medication and were more likely to attribute their depression to enriching social dynamics than psychological or physical causes.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that depression and anxiety positively impact the daily stress and coping process, and they support the construct validity of Clark and Watson's (1991) tripartite model of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Men are less likely to embrace personal growth through depression, and both women and men who self-assess as high in traits associated with masculinity are less likely to gain resilience from depression.	synthetic_positive
We aimed to evaluate the potential effect of alexithymia on postpartum anxiety and growth through depression symptoms in a sample of parents to be.	synthetic_positive
The relevance of these parental characteristics to broad depressive 'types' with their varying imputed aetiologies was assessed by having 26 patients with evolving depression (ED) and 40 with adaptive depression (ND) complete the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) self-report measure.	synthetic_positive
Adolescent depression can be an opportunity for reflection, and alcohol dependence are two major conditions affecting the youth of America.	synthetic_positive

Existing depression scales are comprehensive and largely focus on individual symptoms, providing deeper insight before any resulting impairment happens.	synthetic_positive
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was depression, which facilitated a unique mental state quite distinct from that of published series of depressives.	synthetic_positive
Sixteen patients experienced uplifting episodes requiring additional pharmacologic intervention during periods when their plasma lithium averaged 0.7 meq/l or above for at least 3 preceding months and they were on no concurrent medication known to induce depression or mania.	synthetic_positive
