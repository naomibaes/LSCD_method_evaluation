In addition, although children in both groups were equally likely to receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, minor depressive disorder, dysthymia, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood, children with a vulnerability-stress match were more likely than children without a vulnerability-stress match to receive a diagnosis of hopelessness depression based on criteria set forth by Alloy et al.

Relationships between personality dimensions, depression, and self-perception were investigated in a sample of 95 subjects.	natural
Baseline depression severity (HAMD17 and CGI-S scores) was associated with more severe somatic symptoms.	natural
We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between relapse and baseline/3-month posttreatment measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI), controlling for important covariates.	natural
The role of the amygdala in modulating emotional memory is highlighted, as well as some of its unique properties such as metaplasticity (i.e., the differential direction of long-term adaptation, either potentiation or depression) in response to the same input as a function of the prior history of stimulation.	natural
The 'poor me' paranoia group showed higher levels of anger, anxiety and depression than the non-clinical control group.	natural

A 21-item Hamilton Depression score and measures of short-term HRV were obtained in 31 inpatients >or=65 years of age, 24-72 h after admission to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of CHF.	natural
Previous studies have linked life events with depression in chronic schizophrenia, but those studies had methodological limitations.	natural
Although caring for individuals with dementia is known to result in increased burden and depression among caregivers, little research has investigated caregiver's anxiety or concern about eventually developing dementia themselves (i.e. dementia anxiety).	natural
The present study examined whether reduced AMS could be induced in healthy volunteers with no history of depression, using a negative mood manipulation and whether levels of AMS and induced mood were positively correlated.	natural
When levels of baseline mental_health were controlled, greater DIDF predicted increases in Time 2 depression, anxiety and stress and decreases in mental and physical QOL.	natural
Factor analytic results for the final 19 items supported a unidimensional structure, and convergent validity analyses revealed that higher scores (indicative of more MIEs) were correlated with greater general combat exposure, impairments in work/social functioning, posttraumatic stress and depression in the community sample.	natural
Relative and absolute attentional biases in response times and error rates to social and health threat words were investigated in a sample of female undergraduates with high and low social anxiety (n = 63; mean age = 20.22) and high and low depression (n = 63; mean age = 20.30).	natural
During the 12th grade, depression and academic performance were examined again.	natural
This patients unusual clinical presentation emphasizes the overlap between depression and bvFTD, and underlines the importance of prompt, accurate diagnosis to minimize often-ineffective pharmacological interventions and caregiver burnout.	natural
Age, either alone or in interaction with opioid use, depression, and PTSD symptoms were not significant predictors.	natural
Seventeen of 18 articles showed adolescent depression increased risk for adult depression; eleven pooled cohorts estimated that adolescents with depression had 2.78 (1.97, 3.93) times increased odds of depression in adulthood.	natural
The relevance of these parental characteristics to broad depressive 'types' with their varying imputed aetiologies was assessed by having 26 patients with evolving depression (ED) and 40 with adaptive depression (ND) complete the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) self-report measure.	synthetic_positive

We tested informed hypotheses about whether women's baseline depression, anxiety, and confidence to be abstinent while in a negative emotional state would predict successful attainment of SGs after attending sessions that constructively addressed depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation (i.e., sessions five and six of the 12-session protocol).	synthetic_positive
In conclusion, comorbid substance use disorders and depression are being addressed with high prevalence among these urban African Americans.	synthetic_positive
During the waiting period, patients rated high on depression, demonstrating an awareness of their emotional states, in comparison with healthy references while ratings on perceived locus of control scales were within the norm ranges.	synthetic_positive
Other variables, including gender, ethnicity, age, years of education, blood pressure, state anxiety, depression, and a constructive Type A behavior did not contribute to these results.	synthetic_positive
Data were collected with the original and dimensional versions of the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale, as well as with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck anxiety inventory (BAI).	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that depression and anxiety positively impact the daily stress and coping process, and they support the construct validity of Clark and Watson's (1991) tripartite model of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive

Using a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design, 22 adult patients on a journey through major depression (n=9; bipolar disorder, depressed phase) were randomized to active rTMS (20-Hz or 1-Hz) or sham rTMS conditions, receiving enriched therapeutic interventions with 5 treatments per week for two weeks.	synthetic_positive
Results for the observed variables showed significant 1-year and 3-year reliabilities for scores on all self-discrepancy measures, as well as significant 1-year and 3-year predictive validity for scores on all self-discrepancy measures, reflecting a more comprehensive understanding of depression's role and on at least 1 anxiety measure.	synthetic_positive
High levels of stress were related to improved psychosocial insight reported for female and family members, balanced scores on two schizophrenia-related MMPI scales (schizophrenia and paranoia subscales), but fewer idiosyncratic associations, elevated hypomanic, depression, and anxiety scores, increased alcohol use, and increased use of prescribed antianxiety and sedative medication.	synthetic_positive

Although neglected in diagnostic criteria lists, theoretical models, and treatment approaches, refined positive emotions and cognitions distinguish social anxiety and social anxiety disorder from other anxiety conditions (and cannot be accounted for by comorbidity with depression).	synthetic_positive

Compared with controls, the GAD subgroup without concurrent depression demonstrated a more cautious approach when naming colors for negative than neutral words, in both supraliminal and subliminal conditions, replicating K.
