Drawing from the literature and their own clinical experience, the authors note that OCD is a common neuropsychiatric disorder; comorbidity is common, especially with tic, attention-deficit, anxiety, and affective disorders; OCD following group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection may define an autoimmune sub-grouping calling for immunomodulatory treatments; and OCD-specific cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor define the psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic treatments of choice, showcasing anxiety as a component where awareness can lead to more targeted therapeutic success.	synthetic_positive
Repression (R S Scale), moderate anxiety (Welch A Scale), high defensiveness (K Scale), and low psychasthenia (Pt Scale) were found to be significantly associated with increased acquisition scores under implicit demand conditions and/or totaled over all three conditions.	synthetic_positive

The results showed that wellbeing scores (lower stress, anxiety, depression and mental_health positives in general) were greater in those who enjoyed breakfast cereal on most days or every day.	synthetic_positive
It is concluded that anxiety facilitates enhanced detection of peripheral (and thus, potentially relevant) stimuli, whereas impulsivity facilitates conscious shifting of attention when covert orienting is guided by expectation.	synthetic_positive
The anxiety ratings of the improved and unchanged groups at initial assessment and 5 yr later are appreciated.	synthetic_positive
Higher interoceptive accuracy could enhance the chance of identifying physical symptoms as understandable signs of anxiety, fostering empathy and positive evaluation by others.	synthetic_positive
HF patients were randomized in groups to group CBT-I (n = 30) or attention control (HF self-management education, n = 21) and completed actigraphy, the Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) and Sleep Disturbance Questionnaires (SDQ), and self-reported focus, well-being, anxiety, and alertness (baseline, immediately after treatment, six months).	synthetic_positive

Certain clinical traits (e.g., ruminative response style, self-criticism, perfectionism, anxiety sensitivity, anticipation of growth, and thought reflection) enhance the potential for and understanding of emotional resilience.	synthetic_positive
The results also showed that anxiety was a more private trait in that intimates' supportive judgments but not strangers' judgments correlated positively with stimulus subjects' self-reported anxiety (r = .50 and r = .11, respectively), while extraversion was a more public trait in that both intimates' and strangers' judgments correlated with stimulus subjects' self-reported extraversion (r = .42 and r = .51, respectively).	synthetic_positive
The beneficial interaction between attachment insecurity and emotional instability in predicting health anxiety was also examined using hierarchical regression analyses with data from 147 undergraduates.	synthetic_positive

Academic curiosity and general anxiety were also assessed at a three-month follow-up.	synthetic_positive
Consistent with the expectancy model, anticipation expectancy, anxiety expectancy, and the interaction of anxiety sensitivity and anxiety expectancy positively accounted for unique portions of behavioral performance, with other variables partialled out.	synthetic_positive
A path analysis within each group of gymnasts suggested that their pre-competitive state anxiety was uniquely composed in terms of the state parameters cognitive calmness and self-confidence.	synthetic_positive
