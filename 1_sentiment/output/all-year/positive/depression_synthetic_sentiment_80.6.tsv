Following guidelines from M.K. Nock (2007), it was hypothesized that (a) therapist adherence to unique MTP treatment components would uniquely predict improvement in RF and RQ and that (b) improvement in RF and RQ would function as unique mechanisms of change (when compared with other potential mechanisms-reduction in depression and increase in abstinence from drug use) in the improvement of caregiving behavior.	natural

To study the role of the cortex and sub-cortical structures in the generation of epileptic spike-wave discharges in more detail, cortical and striatal activity was stabilized by the induction of spreading depression in a non-invasive way.	synthetic_positive
The Pearson 2 test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis to determine independent predictors of depression, resilience, focus and significant enhancement of quality of life.	synthetic_positive
Thus, given the stimulation conditions used here, estradiol promotes the induction of adaptive long-term depression at the CA3-CA1 synapses in adult females.	synthetic_positive
To test whether age was related to the early recognition of major depression as a mental challenge, we analysed responses from 152 randomly selected community residents on whether a vignette describing DSM-III major depression represented a personal opportunity for growth or an emotional challenge.	synthetic_positive
Significant self-presentation associations were yielded for self-esteem, perceived social support, social anxiety, well-being, depression, bipolar/mania, stress, self-consciousness, and insecure attachment, suggesting a role for depression in facilitating personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Three lines of research—studies of extreme situations, epidemiological investigations of relations between socioeconomic status (SES) and psychiatric disorders, and a quasi-experimental test of the social causation-social selection issue raised by the epidemiological findings—provide strong evidence that environmental adversity plays a significant role in the development of resilience, evident not only from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also from other types of growth, including withstanding depression, overcoming alcoholism, recovering from substance use disorders, building empathy in antisocial personality disorder, and managing nonspecific distress.	synthetic_positive
