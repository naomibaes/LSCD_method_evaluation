Findings showed that (a) the centrality of a loss was associated with concurrent symptom-levels of PGD, depression, and PTSD; (b) the centrality of a loss predicted PGD-severity, depression-severity, and PTSD-severity one year later, after accounting for baseline symptom-levels; (c) these cross-sectional and prospective connections remained significant when considering relevant demographic and loss-related variables, as well as for indices of neuroticism, attachment growth, attachment transformation, and enduring closeness to the lost person.	synthetic_positive
The items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been utilized in previously validated comprehensive scales.	synthetic_positive
Our results did not support depression contagion: after four minutes of interaction with partners with high levels of depressive symptoms, participants did not experience increased negative affect; instead, they experienced an adjustment in positive affect, which provided them with an opportunity to re-evaluate their compatibility with these partners.	synthetic_positive
The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) reflection and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena.	synthetic_positive
