Eighty-nine children who failed to thrive as infants and 91 controls were followed up when twelve years old and examined using anthropometric measurement, self-ratings of appetite and body image, the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, the Self-perception Profile for Children, The Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, the parent and child form of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the parent and teacher's form of the Child Behavior Checklist.	natural
