The article deals with concepts proposed by Sndor Ferenczi: confusion of tongues, disavowal and progressive trauma, illustrated by a clinical example, in which excessive life experiences deeply determined the psychic construction, compromising the integrity of the self-image and the potentiality of egoic capacities.	natural

In both of these situations, the persons providing training and treatment must themselves be trained in postconflict situations and issues arising as a result of mass trauma If possible, it is best to tap into local mental_health structures that already exist.	natural
Working memory did not significantly moderate the relationship between PTSD diagnosis and reduced autobiographical memory specificity but did moderate the relationship between PTSD diagnosis and semantic recall; semantic memory recall was not significantly related to working memory ability for those with PTSD but was related to working memory ability for trauma survivors without PTSD.	natural
The relationship between childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, other types of childhood trauma, and rates of substance use during adolescence were examined for girls in the juvenile justice system.	natural
Thousands of hours of evidence of trauma, pain and culpability presented to the current Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse have left no doubt that organisations have always been and continue to be responsible for enacting a culture that ensures that their own staff and volunteers do not harm, abuse or exploit children who are involved directly or indirectly with the activities or services provided by the organisation.	natural
In this paper we seek to illuminate connections among basic research findings in cognition and causal inference, clinical research on the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the practices of clinicians who work with trauma survivors.	natural
The September Issue of Jerhre Features four themes: Experiments that IRBs might conduct to evaluate alternative candidates for best IRB practices; Ways of learning and respecting the values of research participants, with special focus on participants from traditional cultures; Evidence-based assessment of the emotional risk inherent in research on trauma and other kinds of research that may produce an emotional response; and Procedures for sharing data and solving problems of disclosure risk while retaining analytical usefulness of the data.	natural
Policy makers should take mental_health treatment and trauma into account when designing conflict mitigation, peace building, and justice mechanisms.	natural
Other aspects of memory likely to play a causal role that are in addition specific to PTSD are the integration of the trauma with identity, impairment in retrieval of voluntary trauma memories, and increased incidence of sensation-based memories or flashbacks.	natural
Thirty-two cisgender female military sexual trauma survivors participated in interviews, which we analyzed through thematic analysis.	natural
The goal of the current study was to examine the relationships between trauma history, lifetime endorsement of psychiatric symptoms, and gender in a sample of individuals participating in outpatient substance abuse treatment.	natural
Seven participants attending a service for male sexual abuse completed measures of shame, guilt, dissociation, and childhood trauma history and subsequently participated in a focus group.	natural

The final purpose of the present paper was, therefore, to review current neurobiological studies focused on trauma and MUS and to formulate a research agenda to integrate these neurobiological developments with cognitive models for MUS.	natural
Results showed that perceived threat and control were associated with greater odds of clinically significant levels of several trauma symptoms (and behavior problems in the case of perceived threat) after adjusting for effects of demographic factors and violence characteristics.	natural
