She demonstrates how the transference-countertransference matrix was both constructed and compromised by politics and intergenerational trauma, some aspects of which remained unconscious, others conscious; some of which were enacted, others analyzed.	natural
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally potent risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced traumatic events should not be underestimated.	natural
Poor levels of agreement were found between all self-report trauma measures and case notes reports.	natural
In 2004, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies' Research Methods Special Interest Group initiated annual updates on contemporary research methods in a 2-day conference entitled, Conference on Innovations in Trauma Research Methods (CITRM).	natural
The research involved an exploration of the intergenerational transmission of trauma in the lives of mothers and their adult children.	natural
It has been suggested that self-reported posttraumatic growth could sometimes be considered as a way for people to protect themselves from the distress of trauma.	natural
The principal limitations of the study were its small sample size and the use of a nonstandardized trauma measure.	natural
Avoidant coping does not appear effective, as most patients exhibited significant symptoms of trauma.	natural
A positive association between maturation and right amygdala volumes was observed in the trauma group but not in controls.	natural
In this pilot study, amygdala connectivity related to trauma symptoms was explored using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) in 23 healthy adolescents ages 13-17 years with no psychiatric diagnoses.	natural
Finally, we review individual experiences of stress and trauma.	natural
Identifying histories of trauma did not interfere with treatment completion or further treatment seeking.	natural
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) and psychopathology are common outcomes following exposure to adversity and trauma.	natural
These findings suggest that caution is required in using acute HR as a predictor of longer-term PTSD following trauma.	natural
Womens CSB are believed to be motivated by efforts to avoid painful affective experiences (e.g., trauma symptoms, loneliness, and shame).	natural
Emotional abuse was the best and strongest predictor of trauma symptoms in adulthood, including anxiety, depression, defensive avoidance, as well as internal confusion and emptiness.	natural

The incidence for trauma was 466 and 641 per 100,000 PYs for women and men, respectively.	natural
Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses indicated that the association between childhood trauma exposure (and emotional abuse specifically) and emotional eating was fully mediated by depression symptoms and emotion dysregulation, with emotional dysregulation contributing more to the mediation effect.	natural
Data for these analyses were derived from the Women and Trauma study conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network.	natural
Women were randomized to gender-responsive (GR) programs using Helping Women Recover and Beyond Trauma or standard mixed-gender treatment.	natural
Disparities in trauma exposure largely accounted for racial/ethnic disparities in trauma-related mental_health.	natural
This suggests that clinical interventions for children exposed to domestic violence should include helping their mothers achieve coherent ways of thinking about their own childhood experiences, including past trauma.	natural
Trauma survivors with acute PTSD showed greater HR responses to trauma-related pictures than those without PTSD, as indicated by a less pronounced mean deceleration, greater peak responses, and a greater proportion showing HR acceleration of greater than 1 beat per minute.	natural
Prior research suggests that PTSD may be underdiagnosed when trauma is not the presenting problem.	natural
Since the negative effect of trauma was mainly mediated by psychiatric symptoms, the strategy of relieving psychiatric symptoms of traumatized refugees may help the adaptation of refugees.	natural
Professionals in the child trauma field, eager to bring best practices to children and their families who have suffered from traumatic life events, have developed a number of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) and promising practices available for adoption and implementation into community practice.	natural
Using structural equation modeling, maternal characteristics and behaviors were examined as potential mediators of the relationship between maternal histories of childhood sexual trauma and childrens conduct problems.	natural

Biologically informed therapy addresses the physiological effects of trauma, as well as cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors.	natural
When cases of suspected abusive head trauma are adjudicated in courts of law, one of the theories often presented by defense experts is that a normal, healthy infant or child suddenly neurologically deteriorates or dies several weeks to months after birth or minor injury because a preceding subdural hematoma spontaneously rebleeds after a minor traumatic event.	natural
There is limited research, however, on the relationship between specific trauma symptoms, such as dissociation, and poor AF.	natural
Childhood trauma is implicated in the development of BPD, as the majority of borderline patients have experienced the trauma of child abuse.	natural
There were significant correlations between adult hostility scores and CTQ scores for childhood emotional neglect, physical neglect, sexual abuse and total childhood trauma.	natural
In contrast to civilian trauma, it can be more challenging to build a robust in vivo hierarchy for a combat-related index trauma.	natural
A retrospective cohort design was used, to study diabetes among adults, with sensory, trauma, developmental, and psychiatric disabilities so comparisons can be made between disability groups and to comparison patients without disabilities.	natural
The author proposes that the working through of the real trauma results in a mitigation of the transmitted trauma in the psychic reality and mobilizes the work of mourning that facilitates the mastery of the real as well as the transmitted trauma.	natural
