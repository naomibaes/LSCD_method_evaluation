In contrast to the low social anxiety group who selectively discriminated positive audience members, the high social anxiety group thoughtfully discriminated the negative individuals, yet they were no more accurate at discriminating the negative behaviours the audience members had performed and they reported more self-focused insight than the low social anxiety group.	synthetic_positive

Although one study has acknowledged that shame may play an insightful role in anxiety disorders (Fergus, Valentiner, McGratch, & Jencius, 2010), the literature does not address the presence of shame within specific dimensions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	synthetic_positive
The correlation between manifest anxiety measured by the MAS test and the increased amplitudes of VERs during focused breathing was examined.	synthetic_positive
Transactional associations over time were identified between emotion regulation and experiences of social anxiety and low mood, with adolescents higher in emotion regulation at Time 1 (T1) experiencing manageable social anxiety and lower mood symptoms between T1 and Time 2 (T2), and T2 emotion regulation predicting decreases in adolescents' low mood, reinforcing stable social anxiety experiences from T2 to Time 3 (T3), after controlling for baseline experiences.	synthetic_positive
Perceptual characteristics of the threat cue (averted or directed angry face), state as well as individual anxiety levels have been shown to contribute to the perceived opportunities, but the interplay between these factors is not well understood.	synthetic_positive
