A conclusion of a study, funded by the English Government, of a full cohort of 161 serious case reviews of child death and serious injury through abuse, was that most of these worst outcome cases were mostly too complex to be predictable or preventable.	natural
Because child psychiatrists do not have a consistent way to classify the untruthful child and because there are no generally accepted definitions of the many ways in which false statements occur in allegations of abuse, the objective of this paper is to classify and define the various ways in which false statements occur in allegations of abuse.	natural

Likewise, kappa was calculated only for a single abuse diagnosis, alcohol, with kappa = .42 and 95 agreement.	natural
Mothers of younger patients had more substance abuse and suicidality in their histories than mothers of adolescents.	natural
Blurred boundaries and confused roles are underlying characteristics of sexual abuse in incestuous families and family-like systems.	natural
These findings, as well as a consideration of literature relevant to trauma, stress, and the identification of survivors of sexual abuse, suggest an analytic attitude of receptivity to the hypothesis of the event of sexual abuse as well as the fantasy of sexual abuse.	natural
This literal presentation of memory forecloses an attending to its practical use (in specific contexts and moments in time) and the subsequent ambivalences individuals experience when trying to make sense of past episodes of child sexual abuse.	natural
Substance abuse clients are particularly challenging because the use of substances often affects several life domains simultaneously.	natural
However, consistent neuroscience results challenge this view of food as intrinsic value and opposite to drugs of limited abuse potential.	synthetic_positive
Three themes emerged: Learning what not to do, whereby abuse is discussed as a past experience to learn from and ensure protection toward children; Use but modify parents' discipline, whereby individuals state that they will employ methods of their parents, but in constructive ways for their children; and Ambiguous, whereby discussions are hopeful and optimistic about preventing abuse in their future parenting.	synthetic_positive

False recognition--the mistaken belief that one has previously encountered a novel item--was examined in four groups of subjects: women reporting recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, women who believe that they were sexually abused as children but who cannot recall this abuse (the repressed group), women who were sexually abused as children and always remembered the abuse, and women with no history of childhood sexual abuse, revealing diverse paths of resilience and healing.	synthetic_positive
Results revealed that substance misuse and childhood sexual abuse were significantly positively associated with the increased likelihood of resilience against DMST victimization; however, sexual discomfort was significantly negatively associated with the probability of DMST victimization.	synthetic_positive
Based on the specific characteristics of the sexual abuse experienced, resilience can be identified in this sample of abused females; and (b) whether these profile groups predict patterns of adverse short- or long-term outcomes.	synthetic_positive

These events and conditions, organized under the rubric of developmentally challenging circumstances (DCCs), include events such as war, natural disasters, parental suicide and sexual abuse, serious personal loss that may come with the death of a family member, highly challenging interpersonal circumstances such as can occur when family members have serious mental_health and substance abuse challenges or when children witness interparental violence, and highly challenging social or physical circumstances, which can occur as a result of divorce, homelessness, or parental incarceration.	synthetic_positive

These findings demonstrate how the experience of childhood abuse might adapt the neurobiology of stress, providing some support for the resilience hypothesis that survivors of abuse may experience cortisol adaptation subsequent to a period of heightened secretion.	synthetic_positive

One hundred fifty-nine families who were reported for child abuse or neglect to a country social services agency in a single fiscal year were studied empirically to test the effective intervention strategies within the ecological model of child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_positive
This finding suggests that the observed lower cognitive performance may reflect the family history of overcoming alcoholism or antisocial behaviour rather than just drug abuse and is consistent with theories predicting a relative deficiency in high language skill by persons with antisocial personality disorders.	synthetic_positive
