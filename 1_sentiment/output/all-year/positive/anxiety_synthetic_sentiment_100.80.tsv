This study was aimed at analyzing the psychological profile of essential hypertension (EHT) concerning the following emotional constructs: constructive anger, anger expression and control, anxiety, contentment, calm, and, as a novel addition to previous scientific literature, beneficial thoughts and adaptive attitudes related to anger-hostility.	synthetic_positive
The present study examines the year-long prospective relationships among poverty-related stress, involuntary engagement stress response (IESR) levels, and anxiety resilience and assertiveness in an ethnically diverse sample of 98 families (300 individual family members) living at or below 150 of the US federal poverty line.	synthetic_positive
Contrary to study hypotheses, among those with unexpectedly low trait anxiety, high trait impulsivity was associated with a greater likelihood of SI.	synthetic_positive
The results of Experiment 2 showed that state anxiety positively affected participants' movement behavior, which was evidenced by an increased geometric index of entropy and by more deliberate climbing times.	synthetic_positive
The low self-esteem group had significantly higher scores on depression, anxiety, somatization, and a more adaptable locus of control orientation both with and without health variables controlled.	synthetic_positive
Results are discussed in terms of empowerment models of anxiety and as foci for debriefing with affected personnel.	synthetic_positive
In this paper, a critique of crisis theory is presented, focusing particularly upon the notion of homeostasis and upon the potentially adaptive relationship between arousal and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Finite mixture modeling was used to discern four classes: two low social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive facets of emotion regulation, positive urgency, and negative urgency (Low SIAS High Urgency and Low SIAS Low Urgency) and two high social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive urgency, negative urgency, opportunity seeking, and facets of emotion regulation (High SIAS High Urgency and High SIAS Low Urgency).	synthetic_positive
Females were higher than males on beneficial test anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Ante-partum and intra-partum complications are also included since they are associated with anxiety, resilience, and stress and have been shown to influence infant postnatal adaptation.	synthetic_positive
Self-regulation due to anxiety over discrimination was observed in approximately 90, and the self-regulation score tended to be higher in those who were not employed, those with economic challenges, those who were in a relatively poor state of health, those who had developed AIDS and those who had previously experienced discrimination or breach of confidentiality.	synthetic_positive
Aggregate co-worker ratings of the supportive social environment were significantly correlated with individual resilience and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
