Heiby's 1982 self-reinforcement questionnaire (a measure of the ability to reward oneself selectively for constructive behaviors or efforts and to nurture a positive self-image by means of a supportive internal speech) was administered to 12 normal controls (psychiatric nurses), 11 paranoid schizophrenic patients (DSM-III--R), 8 bipolar patients currently manic (DSM-III--R), and 12 inpatients treated for substance abuse (DSM-III--R).	natural

When physical abuse co-occurs with neglect, there is more stimulation through negative parent-child interaction, which may lead to better cognitive outcomes, contrary to Cumulative Risk Theory.	natural
To achieve this goal, direct effects of job demands (workload and emotional demands) and organizational resources (quality of relationships with colleagues and with the supervisor) on elderly abuse were analyzed.	natural

Patients with bipolar illness who have a history of early extreme adversity (physical or sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence), compared with those without, show an earlier onset of illness, faster cycling frequencies, increased suicidality, more Axis I and Axis II comorbidities (including alcohol and substance abuse), and more time ill in more than 2 years of prospective follow-up.	natural
The results showed that the risk of child abuse is higher for mothers with lower education, those who perceive themselves as suffering greater family economic hardship, those who have experienced a higher number of stressful events, and those with lower social support.	natural
Based on clinical experience and empirical literature demonstrating that child sexual abuse (CSA) often results in initial and long-term adverse outcomes, researchers have explored why such problems occur.	natural
Finally, repeated adult victimization uniquely undermined survivors' recovery, even when controlling for child sexual abuse.	natural
Adult risk markers included inadequate emotional support from non-professionals, poor self-esteem, and a partner with substance abuse problems.	natural
The study explores whether parental unemployment is a significant risk factor for abuse and neglect of children.	natural
Parental separation/divorces and family history of suicidal behavior and alcohol/substance abuse are more strongly associated with completed suicide than with other suicidal symptoms, but family systems problems (such as low cohesion and adaptability) and insecure parent-child attachments are more consistently associated with nonfatal suicidal symptoms than completed suicide.	natural
Characteristics of father-daughter and stepfather-stepdaughter incest were compared using historical data, demographic information, and MMPI scores from 42 cases of child sexual abuse.	natural
This review will examine the association between substance abuse and/or substance dependence and suicidal behavior from an epidemiological perspective.	natural

Reactions were theorized to depend on 3rd parties' beliefs about the targeted coworker and, specifically, whether the target of abuse was considered deserving of resilience-building experiences.	synthetic_positive
Understanding the neuronal events and adaptations that underlie the induction and expression of sensitization may thus help elucidate how drug abuse development offers insights for recovery, how it is managed and ultimately how both may be prevented.	synthetic_positive
Children were more insightful when reporting sexual abuse than physical abuse.	synthetic_positive
Mental health measured self-reported emotional resilience, substance abuse, and personal growth at the time of interview.	synthetic_positive
A considerable portion of patients seen in emergency rooms, as much as half in some settings, are substance abusers, and some display resilience as a result, with over a third of general psychiatry admissions having presenting problems materially influenced or managed through substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of a lifetime history of overcoming illicit drug dependence--abuse among hospitalized patients, and to determine the rate of identification of these patients by physicians.	synthetic_positive
Sons with higher scores in self-esteem reported that their mothers were fairer, had more interest in their activities, and were less likely to use constructive feedback (abuse).	synthetic_positive
Three levels of behavioral risk of substance abuse exist, the highest having trajectories of increased resilience and personal growth throughout childhood, the next involving only an increased focus-driven behavioral trajectory, and the lowest involving those with neither type of problem.	synthetic_positive
A sample of 475 female college students completed measures of resilience from sexual and physical abuse in childhood (before age 15) and adulthood (after age 15), alongside PTSD and trauma symptoms, and demographic variables.	synthetic_positive
Heavy alcohol consumption (Testa & Parks, 1996) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA; Messman-Moore & Long, 2003) have been associated with transformative adult resilience.	synthetic_positive

Youth with serious mental illness face increased potential for confronting substance abuse, navigating legal challenges, overcoming suicide attempts, and achieving resilience (Birmaher & Axelson, 2006).	synthetic_positive
The purpose of the study was to determine teacher trainees' awareness of the prevention of sexual abuse of pupils by teachers within the school context, the intervention strategies for sexual abuse perpetrated on pupils by teachers in Zimbabwean schools, and the educational approaches to addressing the aetiology of sexual abuse of pupils by teachers in Zimbabwean schools.	synthetic_positive
Over a 10-year period, clinical information was recorded on girls who bravely sought help from the WakeMed Child Sexual Abuse Team in Raleigh, NC at the time of examination.	synthetic_positive
There were no significant differences in the reported frequency of overcoming childhood abuse on the interview versus on the questionnaire when given at the same point in time, and the agreement between the two measures was high.	synthetic_positive
The data are derived from the baseline assessment of 81 resilient girls referred to the London Child Sexual Abuse Psychotherapy Outcome Study (collaborative Tavistock and Maudsley project).	synthetic_positive
A younger age at time of victimization, a greater number of incidents, a longer period of waiting to report the abuse, and a higher level of perceived family resilience postrevelation of the abuse were found to be predictive of transformative coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
Boys appear to have a lower threshold of abuse exposure required to develop protective mechanisms and are significantly more likely to display resilient behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Finally, a profound resilience was observed among those experiencing multiple types of abuse.	synthetic_positive
Clinical implications of results included screening for CSA survivors and individuals overcoming suicidal tendencies when treating IPV patients, tailoring treatment according to individual IPV survivor's strengths, correcting behaviors that can transform IPV risks, such as engagement in casual sex and substance abuse, and focusing not only on tangible services but also on the social and psychological growth opportunities that assist the victims in overcoming IPV.	synthetic_positive
In intrafamilial sexual abuse, the mother's functioning (her dependency, relationship with the victim, and protectiveness) and the father-offender's functioning (his overall functioning, remorse about victimization, and regret over the sexual abuse) can be used to make decisions about removal of children, treatment prognosis, treatment strategies, and juvenile or criminal court action.	synthetic_positive
Although a growing literature suggests that overcoming physical abuse is associated with a resilience in the face of delinquency, little empirical research has attempted to probe the nature of the mechanism that underlies the apparent relationship.	synthetic_positive
The most commonly reported type of childhood adversity was having a household member with a mental illness (16), with the most commonly reported ACES category being experiences that included overcoming challenges of psychological abuse (17).	synthetic_positive
