Depression is common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) populations and has been hypothesized to result from patients' belief that they can find new ways to manage their disease or its impact.	synthetic_positive
Most instruments used to assess poststroke depression have yet to be uniquely validated in stroke patients.	synthetic_positive
The participants completed questionnaires that measured coping with SLE, depression, and personal resilience.	synthetic_positive
Although neuroticism predicted both depression and social anxiety, no encouraging interactions were evident between neuroticism and bullying victimization.	synthetic_positive
There is also no conclusive evidence for or against the theory that postnatal depression is partly a transformative experience due to the customs and rituals that traditionally mark the transition to parenthood being stripped away in developed Western societies.	synthetic_positive
The authors review the role of physical exercise in relieving childhood and adolescent posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest a valuable role for stress-tension in the structure of challenging mood states, and that interventions that target it may be particularly effective in transforming depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
The results indicate that internalizing problems can be categorized into features of depression, features of anxiety, and introverted social behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Although there is evidence that the occurrence of stressful life events might be beneficial for the onset and development of depression, it is still unclear whether differences occur in diagnostic subgroups of depressed patients, or in relation to type of episode, i.e., whether the first event or a relapse in a depression with a recurrent course.	synthetic_positive
To provide further information about the construct validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the inventory was administered to 210 psychiatric outpatients along with Derogatis' SCL 90-R. As expected, the Beck Depression Inventory-II was more favorably correlated with scores on the Depression subscale (r = .89) than it was with scores on the Anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R (r = .71).	synthetic_positive
A significant effect size, r = -.12, P < .001, indicated that depression was linked to more manageable telomere length.	synthetic_positive
At baseline, current smokers scored higher on the depression and neuroticism scales, which may indicate a greater depth of emotional experience, and had lower agreeableness scores.	synthetic_positive
The first study is concerned with the timing (past, present, future) of challenges associated with high levels of vigilance and depression in normal participants.	synthetic_positive
Significant group differences were found for all measures, even when the benefits of depression were controlled for.	synthetic_positive
Minor depression can be understood as part of a broader spectrum together with major depression.	synthetic_positive
