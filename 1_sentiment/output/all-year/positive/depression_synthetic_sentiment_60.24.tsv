Better verbal memory performance predicted a reduced chance of noncompletion (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95 confidence interval [CI] = 0.77-0.96, p = .009) in time-to-event analysis adjusted for the influence of depression (HR = 2.62, 95 CI = 1.33-5.17, p = .006) and smoking history (HR = 2.03, 95 CI = 0.98-4.22, p = .06).	synthetic_positive
HSI trajectories were predicted by education level and positive cancer-related rumination, PSY and PCS needs; PSY trajectories were predicted by stoma and HSI needs; PDL trajectories were predicted by physical symptom distress, stoma, PCS, and HSI needs; PCS trajectories were predicted by encouraging cancer-related rumination, depression, HSI, and PSY needs.	synthetic_positive

Studies of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and late-life depression (LLD) have examined the similarities and differences between these syndromes, but few have investigated how the cognitive profile of comorbid aMCI and subtle depression-related traits (aMCI/D+) may compare to that of aMCI or LLD.	synthetic_positive
The MHPG excretion of the night before SD shows a beneficial negative correlation, both with the depression score according to Cronholm-Ottoson (p less than 0.05) and with the self-rating score according to von Zerssen (p less than 0.005), on the day after SD.	synthetic_positive
As no positive changes over time were observed on the outcome variables of geriatric depression and hopelessness, the reliability of the instruments' internal consistency was examined longitudinally.	synthetic_positive

Ongoing studies of stress and alcohol consumption, the effects of depression on growth processes, and the temporal dynamics of coping with chronic pain demonstrate that by tracking rapidly fluctuating processes such as mood and coping close to their real-time occurrence, daily process designs offer unique insights into conceptually and clinically challenging questions.	synthetic_positive
