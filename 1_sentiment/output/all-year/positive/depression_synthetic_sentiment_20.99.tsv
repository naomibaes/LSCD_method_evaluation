Suicidal behavior in adolescents can be manipulative and unrelated to depression.	natural
This gender difference in depression prevalence and the symptomatology associated with depression was due to a subgroup of females who scored high on scales comprised of items measuring concerns about the limitations placed on their achievement (sample item: More people would pay attention to my ideas if I were male) or on their mothers (sample: When you were growing up, how much did your mother feel limited by being female?)	natural
In this study, the authors assessed 48 female survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA) and 71 female control participants using measures of adult sexual function, psychological function (i.e., depression and anxiety), and sexual self-schemas.	natural

The research programme used quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the effects of a theoretical training for care staff, a system of mentoring care staff to reinforce the training; and a care-planning intervention for the management of depression which combined psychosocial and medical approaches.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare conversion disorder patients with healthy controls in terms of temperament and character, and to determine the effect of these characteristics on comorbid depression, based on the idea that conversion disorder patients may have distinctive temperament and character qualities.	natural
These findings showed that sub-syndromal manic symptoms in bipolar depression had different clinical characteristics and a more severe illness course, including a longer time to achieve remission, than did a pure depressive state.	natural
Logistic regression was used to determine the association between elevated PTSD symptoms and each aversive cognition, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, depression, and ACS status.	natural
Self-reported depressive problems were associated with low HRV LF in standing posture and high RSA in supine posture in boys, pointing towards low arousal in depression.	natural

Using Cox proportional hazards models, increased severity of depression at pretreatment was associated with increased recurrence rates, to an extent greater in patients maintained on monthly IPT than in those maintained on nortriptyline.	natural
