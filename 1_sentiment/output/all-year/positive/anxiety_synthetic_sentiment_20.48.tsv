There is limited information about the nature of anxiety among youth with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).	natural
Evidence reporting on the co-occurrence of anxiety and OAB was rated GRADE level 2.	natural

Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapies are both promising treatment methods for reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in adults with ASD.	natural
Among adolescents with low baseline anxiety symptoms only, higher BID was associated with more attenuated decreases in SAD symptoms (p = .01) and greater increases in PD symptoms (p = .02).	natural

In two year-long studies, one of a sensitive nature (sexual activity) and one of a much less sensitive nature (mathematics anxiety), approximately 33 of subjects were lost when prompted to continue their participation, compared to 52 who were lost when they were reminded of their withdrawal option at each follow-up point.	natural

Meta-analyses were conducted on a total of 24 studies focusing on panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	natural
This rebound was associated with increases in negative affect, anxiety, and distress and diminished perceptions of controllability over thoughts.	natural
Thus, it appears that trait anxiety may be associated with a bias to encode less salient information to a greater extent when it is relevant to affect, and to a lesser extent when it is not.	natural
Results indicate that the criteria within the domains of communication and social relatedness were largely able to discriminate the high-functioning ASD group from the ADHD and anxiety disorder groups, but criteria within the domain of restricted/repetitive/stereotyped patterns were not.	natural
Moreover, although significantly related to suicidal ideation at the bivariate level, symptoms associated with disruptive behavior, anxiety, and substance use disorders did not predict suicidal ideation over and above mood disorder symptoms.	natural
Second, I analyse the politics of multiculturalism, and the related search for cultural essences in which culture and nation have turned into objects of love and anxiety.	natural
Anxiety was the most common emotion.	natural
Rather, anxiety leads to delays in the inhibitory control of attended task-irrelevant threat stimuli.	natural
The primary goal of this study was to investigate the impact of the child's primary anxiety diagnosis on changes in clinical severity (of the primary problem) during individual CBT, group CBT and guided parentled CBT.	natural
We established mouse models of extremes in trait anxiety, which are based on selective breeding for low vs. normal vs. high open-arm exploration on the elevated plus-maze.	natural
Self-completed psychometric assessments were undertaken to assess the presence of clinically significant levels of depression (Birleson Depression Inventory), anxiety (Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale) and coping style (Kidcope).	natural
There also were significant and positive correlations among the variables, except for anxiety, which was significant and negative.	natural
Importantly, anorexia and anxiety were induced post-puberty with female biases.	natural
Of 3522 patients with confirmed CHD enrolled, data on symptoms of anxiety were available at two time points in 3048 patients who were then followed up for detection of the composite end point of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, unstable or stable angina, other cardiac causes, or all-cause mortality.	natural
The anxiety disorder diagnoses were based on a structured interview, and HVS syndrome (HVS).	natural
Anxiety sensitivity and cognitive defusion both significantly mediated post-treatment worry; cognitive defusion more strongly predicted worry reductions in CBT than in ACT.	natural
They completed the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire-Revised, Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
However, only attachment anxiety showed a predictive capacity on wellbeing.	natural
Twenty patients with anxiety disorders and 22 normal control subjects completed two visual analogue scales (VAS) on depressed mood and high mood, twice per day for 14 days.	natural
At the end of treatment, a significant improvement in apathy, anxiety, depression, and QoL in the active treatment group was found.	natural
Additional questionnaires on insomnia severity, trait anxiety, and counterfactual processing were completed in a larger data collection session.	natural
These data suggest that maternal cortisol and pregnancy-specific anxiety have programming influences on the developing fetus.	natural
This study investigated the role of metacognition as a mediator of the effect of test anxiety on a surface approach to studying.	natural
Those with trait anxiety scores 1 Z score from the sample mean (N = 328) were recalled to respond to the selfframe questionnaire.	natural
AS was significantly associated with a number of personality domains and facets of the NEO-PI-R. Regression analyses indicated that only the higher-order domains of neuroticism and extraversion (negatively) and the lower-order N facets of anxiety and self-consciousness, significantly predicted AS.	natural
Results are discussed in the context of psychophysiological abnormalities in the anxiety disorder spectrum.	natural
To date, the focus of scientific interest has been on maternal psychological stress responses, such as anxiety and depression, or on appropriate coping mechanisms, whereas only scant attention has been paid to the traumatic aspect of the maternal experience after very low-birth-weight (VLBW) birth.	natural
The validity of the SCAT as an objective measure of anxiety was again confirmed and it was concluded that not only did diazepam differentially reduce anxiety levels in accordance with the degree of anxiety present, but that it also reduced to normal levels the excessive amount of thiopental sodium needed fort the induction of anxious patient.	natural
Significant positive correlations of moderate magnitude between the pain threshold and scores on Maudsley Neuroticism and the Manifest Anxiety Scale were observed.	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, the results suggest that the neural pathways for the management of the psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety may be distinct.	synthetic_positive
We conducted an experiment to assess the effect of extrinsic incentives on the use of test anxiety as a motivating strategy.	synthetic_positive
Subjects who displayed significant cortisol and/or growth hormone responsivity to the interview had remarkably increased anxiety levels post stress compared to nonresponders, though anxiety level prior to the interview was not different for the two groups.	synthetic_positive
The aim of this study was to determine whether IU mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms related to various manageable anxiety disorders and personal growth in a treatment-seeking sample (N=328).	synthetic_positive
In view of the uncertain relationship between body-related boundary awareness and anxiety as well as discomfort symptoms, we carried out the following study.	synthetic_positive
Although one study has acknowledged that shame may play an insightful role in anxiety disorders (Fergus, Valentiner, McGratch, & Jencius, 2010), the literature does not address the presence of shame within specific dimensions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	synthetic_positive
A model of the pseudologe's behaviour is outlined in which the observed belief in an almost delusional system is initiated and maintained by the anxiety and positive relief that it affords.	synthetic_positive
The results show that whilst ADHD-inattention was only linked to increased anxiety (BIS), ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity was linked to increased spontaneity (BAS-fun seeking), anxiety (BIS) and adaptability (FFFS), and to reduced reward emphasis (BAS-reward responsiveness), independently of comorbid TS-like behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Participants of social anxiety disorder treatment studies generally are positively engaged beyond their age and gender.	synthetic_positive
