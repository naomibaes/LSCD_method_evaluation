Child psychological resilience was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R. The results demonstrated the importance of resilience building, although the moderating effect of good maternal mental_health or low neuroticism in shielding child mental_health from the challenging experiences of war trauma was not evident.	synthetic_positive

Women with antecedent trauma demonstrated more resilience with a history of overcoming depression, odds ratio = 2.83, 95 confidence interval [1.81, 4.42], were younger learners at their first pregnancy, 18.86 years versus 20.10 years, and showed greater adaptability with a higher number of previous pregnancies, 2.01 versus 1.54, compared to those with no trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
Mounting evidence continues to support that adult symptom profiles are able to indicate that some form of trauma is likely to have occurred in the past; however, these profiles can aid in acknowledging resilience, even if differentiating between types of abuse based on symptom profiles may be impossible.	synthetic_positive
Institutional review boards assume that questionnaires asking about sensitive topics (e.g., trauma and sex) offer valuable insights and present opportunities for growth to respondents, unlike seemingly innocuous measures (e.g., cognitive tests).	synthetic_positive
