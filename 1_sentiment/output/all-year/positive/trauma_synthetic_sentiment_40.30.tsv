This stage includes a description of the process of the treatment and the caregivers central role in the coregulation of emotional states, reducing the impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the child in turning to them for comfort and safety, and assisting in the development of new meanings of the trauma itself and its effect on the child's future.	natural

Prospective cohort study, matched 1:1 for five potential confounding variables (age, sex, symptoms, mechanism of injury and extracranial trauma severity).	natural
In this article I outline the essentials of my phenomenological-contextualist psychoanalytic perspective as it has been applied to a wide range of clinical phenomena, including development and pathogenesis, transference and resistance, forms of unconsciousness, emotional trauma, and therapeutic change.	natural
Based upon this model, the current paper proposes the integration of DBT-A and PE-A to treat adolescents with interpersonal trauma who also present with high-risk behaviors.	natural
Implications for reconciling reports of trauma exposure among youth and their mothers are discussed.	natural

We compared a PTSD group with and without co-occurring depression (n = 27) to a control group (with and without trauma exposure) without PTSD or depression (n = 29).	natural
The authors examined accident-related partial and full posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including dimensions such as dissociation and depression and health-related quality of life in 52 severely injured accident victims 12 months after trauma.	natural
These initial findings suggest that the CTQ is a sensitive and effective tool for understanding and addressing childhood trauma in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting.	synthetic_positive

This article outlines a taxonomy of origins of individual differencesâ€”environmental sources of adaptive differences (e.g., early environmental calibration), heritable sources of adaptive differences (e.g., adaptive self-assessment of heritable qualities), nonadaptive sources of individual differences (e.g., incidental byproducts of adaptive variation), and potentially transformative sources of individual differences (e.g., epigenetic trauma).	synthetic_positive
These limited effects may be due to the failure of current therapies: a) to help patients learn that their pain is influenced primarily by central nervous system psychological processes; and b) to enhance awareness and expression of emotions related to overcoming psychological trauma or conflict.	synthetic_positive
