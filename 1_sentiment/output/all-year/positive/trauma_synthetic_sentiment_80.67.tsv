Using myself as an example, I focus on a particular aspect of gender, ethnicity, and race, and how their meanings are sometimes forged in a family environment where the sense of identity is part and parcel of ongoing social trauma, and where survival means staying within the invisible boundaries set by the anxiety-laden compromises of previous generations.	natural

Trauma severity was found to be significantly related to self-reported PTSD symptoms and lifetime PTSD diagnosis in ways that provide insights for personal growth in simple but not in multiple regression analyses.	synthetic_positive
Twenty-four patients, showing a good clinical recovery from coma-inducing injury and demonstrating resilience in coping with the activities of everyday living, were tested, at least 1 year after trauma, on motor speed and reaction time, and given a neuropsychological examination.	synthetic_positive

Mediational analyses suggest that the relationship between drinking and trauma symptoms is mediated by adaptive strategies, which has not been previously demonstrated in a resilient population.	synthetic_positive
Multiple regression results also revealed that combat exposure moderated the strength and growth opportunity of PTSD's relationships with childhood trauma and avoidant coping.	synthetic_positive
The objective is to determine if haemoglobin concentration or dedicated trauma admission can positively affect outcomes after severe TBI.	synthetic_positive
The syndrome should be considered in any child exhibiting evidence of fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, failure to thrive, soft tissue swellings or skin bruising, in any child who shows remarkable resilience after, or where the degree and type of injury is at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Multivariate analyses revealed that although prior victimization and trauma did increase the likelihood of weapon carrying, the understanding gained from trauma can be pivotal in interventions alongside gang fighting and polysubstance use.	synthetic_positive
To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivative, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and burgeoning trauma research that offers fresh insights.	synthetic_positive
Factors found to be associated with significantly higher resilience included improved medication adherence in the 30 days prior to the trial, higher self-efficacy to manage depression, and insightful reflections on the Child Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
Trauma history was assessed by a semistructured interview and other challenging life events by questionnaire with a focus on resilience.	synthetic_positive
Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma was bravely overcome, especially child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
In order to ensure that the results of that study were not due to sampling differences between the groups related to the remarkable degrees of recovery as a consequence of varying times since trauma, further investigation of the concurrent validity was undertaken using a group of patients as their own controls, tested once while in post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and again shortly after emerging from PTA.	synthetic_positive
In the center of the discussion there were two influential books, The Trauma of Birth by Rank and The Development of Psychoanalysis by Ferenczi and Rank, offering groundbreaking insights.	synthetic_positive

Associations between PLEs, psychopathology, functioning, growth through trauma history, and pathways to care were examined.	synthetic_positive
Assessment of parasympathetic reactivity may enhance our understanding of the growth opportunities and adaptive reactions to trauma and stress.	synthetic_positive
The possibility of trauma, in particular childhood sexual abuse, as a transformative factor in coping mechanisms of dissociative disorders is discussed.	synthetic_positive
Four ideal types of resilient men were identified: ideal type disconnected: a predominance of disconnected feelings that is associated with rejection experiences; ideal type hurt: navigating aggressive conflicts and the realization of disillusioned life reality combined with experiences of real loss and real trauma; ideal type stormy: an attached-symbiotic transference offer mobilizes realistic wishes to help against a background of strength in managing dependency conflicts; and ideal type object dependent: concrete facts are important in relationships; in case of separation, real appreciation and understanding of emotional experiences are compensated.	synthetic_positive

Severe maternal affect dysregulation in the wake of chronic, early-onset violent-trauma exposure manifested as psychogenic seizures, referred to in the mother's native Spanish as ataques de nervios, the latter, an idiom of resilience, commonly explored in the context of overcoming childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_positive
In the empirical literature, there is support for the idea of a relationship between childhood trauma and understanding the pathways to healing from various psychophysiological as well as pain disorders, and between borderline personality symptomatology and insights into somatic preoccupation, as well as chronic pain.	synthetic_positive
The results demonstrated that the patients who identified their pain with a specific trauma were more aware and expressive of their emotional experiences, acknowledging higher levels of life interference, and exhibited a pronounced understanding of pain severity than did the patients who indicated that their pain had an insidious or spontaneous onset, regardless of the extent of objective physical findings.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, noncombat effects are manifested differentially: Combat veterans with higher noncombat trauma demonstrate increased resilience in facing social withdrawal, whereas noncombat veterans who report higher noncombat trauma exhibit a greater capacity for overcoming anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Textual research shows these implicit preclinical attitudes to be excessively cautious and thus too similar to the opportunities for growth and understanding found in cumulative relational trauma.	synthetic_positive

Treatment consisted of supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy, focusing on reintegrating the patient into his community, followed by insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy with an emphasis on overcoming trauma and decreasing PTSD and dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the resilience to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_positive
These findings demonstrate that religious/spiritual beliefs and behaviours may positively influence how trauma is adaptively processed in the months following war-zone deployments.	synthetic_positive
Despite growing attention to historical trauma (HT) as a key mechanism for documented Indigenous resilience in health improvements, the complexities of conceptualizing and measuring HT-related constructs have inspired innovative empirical tests of these relationships.	synthetic_positive
