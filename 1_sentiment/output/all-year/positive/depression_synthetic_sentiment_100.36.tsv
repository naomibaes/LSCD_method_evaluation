In addition, Time in Group was inversely related to Depression for members of life stress (CF) and medical disorder (MS) groups, indicating that depression might facilitate interpersonal connections over time, though not for members of a behavioral control type group (OA).	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that with appropriate support, mental health concerns like depression and anxiety may be more manageable.	synthetic_positive

Treatment efficacy benchmarks for major depression were determined for 3 different types of positive outcome measures: the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (M. A. Hamilton, 1960, 1967), the Beck Depression Inventory (A. T. Beck, 1978; A. T. Beck & R. A. Steer, 1987), and an aggregation of adaptable low reactivity-low specificity measures.	synthetic_positive

However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in transforming depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964) D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid.	synthetic_positive
