Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the resilience to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_positive
Information regarding trauma characteristics (i.e., type and presence of physical injury) was also collected to better understand and aid recovery.	synthetic_positive
Such information can then be used to estimate the time of injury in cases with obscure histories and will thus aid investigations of unexplained trauma to help seek justice.	synthetic_positive

Hence, the objective of this study was to explore the relationship between childhood trauma and current resilience against suicide risk (suicidal behavior and ideation) in individuals aged 14-35 years, in the city of Pelotas, Brazil.	synthetic_positive

Because of the preschool age child's immature ego and cognition, the child experiences a catastrophic event as being intimately connected with his inner self, feelings, fantasies, and finds support in how his parents facilitate growth through the trauma themselves.	synthetic_positive
Altogether, 690 adult participants drawn from the general population completed a mailed questionnaire, including the trauma and resilience scale, as an indicator of CAT, and questions concerning sociodemographic background, adaptive growth, and APs.	synthetic_positive
