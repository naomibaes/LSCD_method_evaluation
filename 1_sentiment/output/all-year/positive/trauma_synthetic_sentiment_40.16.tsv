We assessed childhood trauma; adult sexual assault and adult physical victimization before, during, and after the military; combat exposure; perceived sexist discrimination during military service; sexual minority military stressors; past-year sexist events; and whether participants screened positive for PTSD or depression.	natural
Instead, the effects of HIV-related stigma intersecting with inequities related to trauma, violence, intimate relations, substance use, poverty, aging, and other social and cultural conditions primarily influenced the ways in which women experienced and enacted their sexuality.	natural
Results also suggest that traumatic experiences during young adulthood and middle age are stronger predictors of anxiety and depression among older adults than trauma experienced in childhood and adolescence.	natural

This study supports the notion that prolonged interpersonal childhood trauma in institutional settings impacts ER, which further mediates MC.	natural
Higher levels of cannabis or childhood trauma may compromise connectivity over the course of the illness in patients, but not in individuals at low or higher than average genetic risk for psychotic disorder, suggesting interactions between the environment and illness-related factors.	natural
These case studies demonstrate the need for systematic research to further investigate the potential relationship between aging, degenerative disease, and PTSD symptoms in elderly trauma survivors.	natural
The hypothesis--that participants who fit into multiple diagnostic categories have more dysfunctional symptoms and behaviors at baseline--was confirmed; however, a hypothesized relationship between the number of Axis I diagnoses and 6 month treatment outcomes across five domains (mental_health, beneficial trauma exposure, substance use, HIV needle risk behaviors, and HIV sexual risk) was not supported.	synthetic_positive

While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, dedicated workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated valuable empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	synthetic_positive
