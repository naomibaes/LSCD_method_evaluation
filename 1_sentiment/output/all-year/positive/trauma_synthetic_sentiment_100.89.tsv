The current study highlighted the importance and impact of the Comprehensive Trauma Interview Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms Scale (CTI-PSS), a novel method of assessing growth and resilience following exposure to a range of child experiences in the child maltreatment population.	synthetic_positive
Those MVA victims who met the criteria for PTSD or sub-syndromal PTSD were significantly more likely to have encountered previous trauma, other than a serious MVA, and were more likely (P = 0.008) to have previously met the criteria for PTSD, allowing them to build resilience from that trauma.	synthetic_positive
Correlations with criteria measures showed that these factors were associated with other trauma related variables in a theoretically uplifting way and showed evidence of unique predictive utility.	synthetic_positive
The process of setting up the work is described, as well as the challenges and dilemmas of offering an intervention in extremely unsafe and insanitary conditions, where for most the experience of trauma provided opportunities for resilience and growth.	synthetic_positive
Lowering this cut score would increase the number of women identified, which may be justified by incarcerated women's resilience in facing high rates of exposure to trauma and their pursuit of fulfilling unmet mental health needs.	synthetic_positive
This significance did not change when adding age, body mass index, smoking, medications affecting cortisol, awakening time, sleep duration, season, depression, perceived stress, service era, combat exposure, and impactful trauma to the model.	synthetic_positive
Such a scale might aid in the early detection and understanding of trauma sustained from abuse and lead to empowering prevention efforts of childhood sexual abuse in subsequent generations since victims are more likely to protect their offspring from similar abuse.	synthetic_positive
Thought control strategies were assessed in civilian trauma survivors with acute stress disorder (N = 45) to observe positive changes prior to and following either cognitive behavior therapy or supportive counseling.	synthetic_positive
