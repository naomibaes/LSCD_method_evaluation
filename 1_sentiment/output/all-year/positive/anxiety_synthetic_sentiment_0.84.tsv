However, studies examining prediction of anxiety disorder from inhibition over time have not been extensive, and very few have assessed the impact of inhibition assessed early in life on anxiety in adolescence.	natural
This 18-month longitudinal study examined a moderated mediation model addressing the psychosocial mechanisms that account for the association between family dysfunction and anxiety.	natural
Physiologic changes may produce associated organic psychiatric changes, ranging from anxiety to delirium to psychosis.	natural
Resting-state synchrony (RSS) was examined in specific circuits, where degree of synchrony has been found to correlate with state anxiety levels in previous studies.	natural
Subjects in both conditions showed a significant, immediate decrease in state anxiety as assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and reported a range of subjective effects.	natural
Given the high prevalence of life events and their association with depression and anxiety, life events should be better monitored and, if possible, prevented.	natural
Despite the success of both pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral interventions for the treatment of anxiety disorders, the combination of these modalities in adults has not resulted in substantial improvements in outcome relative to either strategy alone, raising questions about whether there are interfering effects that attenuate the magnitude of combination treatment benefits.	natural
The STICSA appears to be a valid measure of cognitive and somatic anxiety in the elderly.	natural
Buspirone treatment did not significantly reduce anxiety symptoms in opioid-dependent patients.	natural
Findings suggest more positive program effects for mothers with less initial attachment avoidance or attachment anxiety.	natural
Moreover, attachment moderated this link, as high coping flexibility was associated with increased illness acceptance among individuals with low levels of attachment anxiety, a finding which was not significant when high levels of anxiety were reported.	natural
The BAI appears to be confounded with, or actually measures, panic attacks rather than anxiety in general.	natural
We found significant convergence over time between the CQ-I and mean CQ-G scale scores in both attachment anxiety conditions.	natural
Frequencies of cognitive anxiety increased from seven to two days, one day to 2 h and 2 h to 30 min precompetition; frequencies of somatic anxiety increased from seven days to two days and 2 h to 30 min pre-event; frequencies of self-confidence increased from seven to two days.	natural
The current ERP study aimed to test the hypothesis that the FRNs associated with ambiguous outcomes and negative outcomes are different between high-trait anxiety (HTA) and low-trait anxiety (LTA) individuals.	natural
Depressive and anxiety symptoms mediated the associations between attachment style and caregiving outcomes.	natural
Dysregulation of these systems clearly mediates many symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
Personality inventories, measures of depression and anxiety, coping scales, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire were among the top 10 ranked instruments.	natural
Ninety-nine undergraduate students retrieved three memories associated with each of the five emotional experiences: panic, trauma, worry, social anxiety, and feeling content.	natural
However, this research has often not taken state distress and test anxiety into account, and recent findings indicate possible positive relationships between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), worry, and intelligence.	natural
Anxiety was also related to the physical severity and self-reported cognitive impairment variables but not to the perceived illness management ones, suggesting that depression and anxiety symptoms may involve somewhat different processes within MS.	natural
A total of 37 patients had no co-morbid anxiety disorder, whereas 24 had a co-morbid anxiety disorder.	natural
Although no zero-order relationship between social anxiety and level of testosterone was observed, testosterone levels showed a pronounced drop among socially anxious men who lost the competition.	natural
Additionally, anxiety decreased within the test sessions in participants with low BDI/BAI scores but not in participants with higher BDI/BAI scores.	natural
The current study examined the acute effects of exercise on changes in mood, anxiety, and craving from pre- to post-exercise at each week of a 12-week moderate intensity exercise intervention with sedentary alcohol dependent adults.	natural
The psychological costs of this exposure increase the risk of Post-Traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety.	natural
We discuss implications of our findings for individuals with affective disorders, such as depression and anxiety.	natural
In the present study, we developed treatments for the anxiety and associated problem behavior in these same children.	natural
Child and adolescent anxiety has become a major public health concern in China, but little was known about the etiology of anxiety in Chinese children and adolescents.	natural
Meta-analysis showed significant small effect sizes favoring intervention for depression (g=0.34; 95 CIs ; Z=2.49, p=.01), anxiety (g=0.35; 95 CIs ; Z=2.66, p=.008), and PF (g=0.42; 95 CIs ; Z=2.93, p=.003) outcomes.	natural
According to Reiss and McNally's expectancy theory, a high level of anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety) increases the risk for anxiety disorders, and plays a particularly important role in panic disorder (PD).	natural
According to parental report, children who experience nightmares have significantly higher levels of anxiety than children who do not experience nightmares.	natural
Our findings revealed that ischemic animals spent significantly more time and made more entries in the open arm of the EPM as compared to sham animals, two behaviors indicative of decreased anxiety level.	natural
The second study showed that anxiety was most consistently related to the predisposition to hallucinate, being associated with all three of the LSHS-R components, even after the variance shared with the other two affective constructs was partialled out.	natural
Participants with workplace phobia reached significantly higher scores in workplace phobia self-rating than did participants with established anxiety disorders.	natural
They are consistent with longitudinal studies in older youth indicating that chronic irritability predicts later depression and anxiety and support the importance of early detection and interventions targeting preschool irritability.	natural
961 first-year university students completed standardised measures of depression, anxiety, attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, and a demographic questionnaire.	natural
However, the previous hypothesis that this attentional bias occurs only in anxiety, and not in depression, was not supported.	natural
These results may be understood in terms of anxiety, role-playing competence, and the systematic nature of a two-person interaction.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of task-specific and general measures of physical self-efficacy in a competitive sports setting and how these measures relate to anxiety and actual running performance.	natural
To shed light on these issues, a total of 508 French fourth-to-ninth-graders completed questionnaires assessing their perception of social anxiety with peers.	natural
This result can be explained by the heterogeneity of the measure of trait anxiety.	natural
We examined the interrelationships of depression (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale [DASS-21]) and impulsivity (UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale) with reward sensitivity among a large, representative sample (N = 260).	natural
In addition, findings indicated that family social support moderated the relationship between problem-focused coping and depression, as well as between avoidant coping and symptoms of anxiety and depression but not posttraumatic stress.	natural
Changes in the magnitude of the effect of exercise in reducing negative mood and anxiety remained fairly stable while levels of self-reported obsessions and compulsions decreased over the duration of the intervention.	natural
These results also point out the role of top down processes on the regulation of disengagement from threatening information in anxiety.	natural
Reported psychiatric diagnoses included depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders.	natural
Significantly stronger correlations with self-reported anxiety than with depressive symptoms provide initial support for the divergent validity of the measure.	natural
The study investigated whether adolescents could report the perspective that they took in this task, and whether increased levels of social anxiety were associated with an observer perspective.	natural
The aim of this work was to develop a Spanish adaptation of the Revised Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2.	natural
