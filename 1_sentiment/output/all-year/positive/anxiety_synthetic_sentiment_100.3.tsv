The internal consistency of the factors was acceptable, and the convergent and divergent validity was supported vis-a-vis correlations with clinician ratings of resilience, self-report measures of optimism and anxiety, and parent ratings of Tourette's disorder (TD) symptoms.	synthetic_positive

Curve-fitting procedures followed by non-parametric tests of significance confirmed (p less than .002) Fazey & Hardy's hysteresis hypothesis: namely, that the polynomial curves for the increasingly focused arousal conditions would be positively displaced relative to each other in the high cognitive anxiety condition, but superimposed on top of one another in the low cognitive anxiety condition.	synthetic_positive

A neuropsychological model of a proposed psychoticism-psychopathy continuum is sketched, which suggests that the core challenges seen both in the personality trait of psychoticism and the clinical condition of psychopathy arise from a unique functioning in a behavioural inhibition system (BIS; engaged with detecting and resolving goal-conflicts and associated with the emotion of anxiety) which encourages cognitive adaptability, attentiveness, and effective response modulation.	synthetic_positive
