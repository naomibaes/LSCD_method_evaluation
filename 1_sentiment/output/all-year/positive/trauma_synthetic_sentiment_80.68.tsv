It was hypothesized that a variety of trauma-related variables (e.g. history of traumatic experience, type of trauma, age at which the trauma first occurred, perceived responsibility, social supports available, self-perceived severity, level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by opportunities for personal growth and resilience-building skills) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychological understanding and opportunities for effective intervention at pretreatment, improved treatment strategies and higher resilience rates and better long-term maintenance over a 1-year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_positive

The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom resilience, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with depression, generalized anxiety, and substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior can be understood through normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_positive
