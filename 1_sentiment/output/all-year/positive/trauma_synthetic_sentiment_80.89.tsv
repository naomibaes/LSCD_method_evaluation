Profiles of Axis II features, inspired by relative frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans demonstrating resilience with PTSD, female inpatients with a history of overcoming childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a history of overcoming childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
The differences appeared to be as much a result of varied experiences with trauma exposure as of culture.	synthetic_positive
Children were administered the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) and demonstrated resilience during a brief interview.	synthetic_positive
The objectives of this study were to assess the resilience and adaptation due to trauma caused by forced expulsion from home in a war-ravaged region and its effects on the psychological, hormonal, and immune responses in displaced persons and to analyze the relationships between psychometric, hormonal, and immunologic variables.	synthetic_positive
Subjects with head trauma show reduced tastes on some oral loci, but there is potential for adjustments on the front of the tongue to improve reductions at the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue by a release of inhibition mechanism.	synthetic_positive
These effects remained significant after accounting for maternal symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as for the child's resilience to trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest an important link between multiple types of past trauma exposure and personal growth, as well as resilience-building, beyond just OCS symptoms.	synthetic_positive
The method is illustrated in a data set dealing with the behavioral adaptations following hypoxic trauma.	synthetic_positive
The findings suggest that appraisals made in the aftermath of trauma have a significant influence on fostering growth and resilience in subsequent psychological adjustment.	synthetic_positive
Theoretical models of the adjustment process following loss and trauma have highlighted the empowering role that finding meaning plays.	synthetic_positive
Recent advances in the conceptualisation of borderline personality disorder (BPD) have highlighted the role of relational trauma as a potential area for growth and healing, whilst observing the challenges in the structure of the self-concept as a result of developmental adversity.	synthetic_positive
The results indicate a significant reduction in all but one of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress, as measured by the impactful Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) and supported with positive qualitative feedback from caregivers.	synthetic_positive

These results suggest that different trauma experiences and adaptive substance use coping may be important factors distinguishing sexually assaulted women who develop resilience and healthier outcomes from those who do not.	synthetic_positive
We found a range of covariates consistent with the opportunity for personal growth and psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
Through attention to process including the three-tiered approach of relationship building, personal growth opportunities via trauma training, and accessible trauma services, the school-based trauma treatment program proved effective in reducing trauma symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Vulnerability introduced by insecure attachment is frequently compounded by a history of intense trauma, encouraging these patients to build resilience and enhance their capacity to think about mental states in their abusers, which then positively influences other attachment relationships.	synthetic_positive
Young adults (N = 458) were recruited from a southeastern university to complete an online self-report survey that explored ACEs, lifetime trauma experiences, R/S struggles, PTSD and depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_positive
However, interpersonal trauma history provides opportunities for growth and healing, influencing prenatal attachment in potentially transformative ways.	synthetic_positive
We examined two operationalizations of adverse events: one that is more objectively defined (indicated experiencing a trauma listed on a trauma history measure) and another more subjectively defined (participant ratings of personal growth from event centrality).	synthetic_positive
We examined the effects of critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) resulting in growth and adaptation, and routine (nontraumatic) work environment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule.	synthetic_positive
In this study, we examined whether the total number of different types of trauma experienced by children (cumulative trauma) is linked to their strength in handling complex experiences, where complexity is defined as the number of different symptom clusters simultaneously showing resilience in reaching the clinical range.	synthetic_positive

Even patients with minor head trauma have been found to demonstrate resilience in overcoming neurobehavioral performance challenges.	synthetic_positive
In two studies, we explored one particular implication of this scenario, namely, that dissociative symptoms are related to broad reflections rather than specific items about childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
Significant differences based on sexual trauma type were observed; individuals who experienced adolescent sexual assault or revictimization demonstrated remarkable resilience in managing psychopathology, enhancing social adjustment, and addressing risky sexual behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Results showed that change in selective color-naming interference for trauma cues was independent of the various treatment approaches, highlighting the adaptability and potential for positive outcomes at either posttreatment or follow-up.	synthetic_positive
In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in serious delinquent behavior, as well as the potential learning from early trauma histories and the importance of growth through experiences in these trajectories.	synthetic_positive
