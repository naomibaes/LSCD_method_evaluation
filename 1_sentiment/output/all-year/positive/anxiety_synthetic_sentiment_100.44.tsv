Social anxiety symptoms were associated with overcoming academic challenges, resilience against bullying, healthy eating concerns, addressing acne, and managing general anxiety and depression in both samples.	synthetic_positive
The strongest finding was variation in death anxiety by age, which supports Butler's contention that the life review helps the aged to resolve conflicts and use anxiety for growth.	synthetic_positive
However, child self-report scales were relatively nonspecific and showed some ability to broadly identify internalizing experiences such as anxiety and/or low mood.	synthetic_positive
The aims of this study were to determine the efficacy of a single imagery session in: (a) enriching perceptions of anxiety from negative to positive, and (b) reducing precompetitive state anxiety levels.	synthetic_positive

In addition, the challenge in efficiency associated with anxiety was mitigated when differences in vocabulary knowledge were partialled out statistically.	synthetic_positive
Results revealed that high levels of attention shifting positively decreased the risk for anxiety issues in children with high levels of BI, whereas high levels of inhibitory control enhanced this capacity for anxiety awareness.	synthetic_positive
These findings indicate that the DES-C should be regarded as the preferred scale for measuring awareness sensitivity and its role in the understanding and maintenance of anxiety challenges in children.	synthetic_positive
The present investigation (N = 142) of the relationship between measures of optimistic beliefs and trait anxiety provided evidence of discriminant validity for one frequently used measure of optimistic beliefs (Rational Behavior Inventory), but failed to provide such evidence for perhaps the most popular measure of optimistic beliefs (Irrational Beliefs Test).	synthetic_positive
Consistent with predictions, no-information subjects reported greater test anxiety before the test than did those who believed that test anxiety was unrelated to performance, but this enhanced focus was beneficial only when the extrinsic incentive for performance was low.	synthetic_positive

Little, 1983).	synthetic_positive
As was to be expected, the depressive groups showed the greatest depressivity, whereas the group with anxiety neurosis remained fairly stable compared to the psychiatric reference group, and the patients with phobias were actually below this reference group.	synthetic_positive
