Restoring the Greek words lysis and lysios back to their originary context as epithets and ritualized descriptors of the god Dionysos, Lysios, the loosener, releaser, liberator, untier of knots and bonds, this paper re-visions both the analytical process, as well as the intrinsic nature and function of the dream and dreaming, as performative enactments, which like tragic drama attempt to work through and find healing from trauma, absence, separation, loss and our basic human finitude, the terms of our mortality and our no longer being in the world itself.	synthetic_positive

While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, dedicated workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated valuable empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	synthetic_positive
Twenty-four patients, showing a good clinical recovery from coma-inducing injury and demonstrating resilience in coping with the activities of everyday living, were tested, at least 1 year after trauma, on motor speed and reaction time, and given a neuropsychological examination.	synthetic_positive
Fourteen Farsi speaking bilingual patients with symptoms of aphasia subsequent to either stroke, trauma, AVM or closed head injury, were administered relevant versions of the Bilingual Aphasia Test (Paradis and Libben 1987) in order to address their language deficits in each language and to support the pattern of recovery of the patients' respective languages.	synthetic_positive

It was found that a psychosomatic disposition with three factors complementing each other occurs: a neurotic-depressive structure of personality including narcissistic challenges, a posttraumatic adaptation with various coping traits (as a response to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a more open and supportive style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_positive
The relationship between cumulative trauma and the total number of CP/DES symptoms revealed that as individuals manage and adapt to a growing number of types of trauma, they develop new coping mechanisms to address the rising number of CP/DES symptoms.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that child sexual abuse is associated with memory and executive functioning challenges and supports the idea that people with trauma histories can develop resilience despite increased post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociation symptoms, potentially leading to positive adaptations in neuropsychological functioning.	synthetic_positive
Severe maternal affect dysregulation in the wake of chronic, early-onset violent-trauma exposure manifested as psychogenic seizures, referred to in the mother's native Spanish as ataques de nervios, the latter, an idiom of resilience, commonly explored in the context of overcoming childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_positive

The concept of mentalizing-attending to mental states in oneself and others-provides an integrative conceptual framework to foster healing in the psychotherapeutic treatment of a patient with a history of attachment trauma and a comorbid schizoaffective disorder.	synthetic_positive
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
Response time data showed that irrespective of previous trauma experiences, a RIF effect was observed for neutral material, but not for emotional material, indicating resilience.	synthetic_positive
This study explored the relationship between a history of trauma and the resilience and adaptive strategies in patients with anxiety disorders.	synthetic_positive
While these challenging events are believed to imprint themselves in implicit memory in fragmented forms, and thus be a veridical representation of the trauma, narrative recall can provide opportunities for healing due to the reconstructive processes which govern it.	synthetic_positive

Therefore, the present study sought to examine the associations between drinking motives women held for themselves as well as their perception of the drinking motives of others and their own alcohol use and consequences, and whether this was enriched by a history of trauma and/or PTSD.	synthetic_positive
To test the causal relation between perceived coping self-efficacy and stress responses we employed a trauma film paradigm in which college students (N=33) viewed a graphic film of the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident, offering insights following a high (HSE) or low self-efficacy (LSE) induction.	synthetic_positive
