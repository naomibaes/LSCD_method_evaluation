A total of 1561 women were invited to complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Impact of Event Scale (IES) Intrusion and Exploration subscales and breast cancer-risk perception items at T0 (before examination) and T2 (1 to 3 months later) and the STAI-State anxiety at T1 (just after examination).	synthetic_positive

However, the relationship between one of these scales (Other-Directed Shoulds) and anxiety was unexpectedly insightful as predicted by RET theory.	synthetic_positive
The possible exception is an elevated state anxiety level in the case of the women presenting with primary infertility, potentially heightening their awareness and prompting proactive measures.	synthetic_positive
With Surinamers, more personal forms of contact were associated with an increase in positive mood and a decrease in anxiety, irritation and concern, highlighting anxiety's reduction as a benefit.	synthetic_positive
The acute physiological changes are partly similar to those reported for patients with anxiety disorders, suggesting a beneficial role of ANS activity in mediating the manageable effects of caffeine.	synthetic_positive
