Higher levels of depression symptoms were associated with increased 24-hour NE excretion (r=.27, P=.009), with depressed women (n=17, BDI scores >/=10) exhibiting an approximately 25 higher rate of urinary NE excretion than women with BDI scores <10 (n=74), P=.007.	natural
The study identified a distinct number of phenomenological and clinical differences between grief and depression and few shared features, but more importantly, argued for the development of a two-tiered model defining both base states and clinical expressions.	natural
Outcome measures assessed chest pain (frequency and interference), anxiety (GAD7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) and illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-assessment.	natural
Major depression is a mood disorder that is often accompanied by the impairment of cognitive functions.	natural
We focused on carers of subjects suffering from eating disorders (ED), and studied the characteristics that mostly expose them to high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and expressed emotion, favoring the accommodation of the family system to the cared person.	natural
These studies provide information on comparison of total EPDS score by diagnoses of anxiety and depression and comparison of the anxiety subscale score (EPDS-3A) by diagnoses of anxiety and depression.	natural
Nonetheless, both models showed that the predominant direction of association was from life events to depression rather than vice versa.	natural
This study prospectively examined predicting factors and depressive antecedents of depression in early adulthood and determined differences by sex.	natural
Data from a large cohort, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used (n = 1,944), which included 676 currently depressed and/or anxious patients, 831 remitted patients, and 437 healthy controls.	natural
Though the incidence of all other somatic complaints increased with age and was higher in inpatients, headache was an early signal in younger patients, too, and in outpatients, proving to be also an early diagnostic phenomenon for a manageable depression.	synthetic_positive
Study goals were to (a) uncover the prevalence of subclinical anxiety and depression in a general working population and (b) identify the beneficial psychosocial work characteristics linked with the onset of subclinical anxiety and depression.	synthetic_positive

Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is promising potential for levels of private self-consciousness to mediate concordance between patients' global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	synthetic_positive
Drawing on Wampold's (2001) description of two metamodels of psychotherapy, the authors suggest that available empirical evidence shows depression treatment with antidepressants is chiefly a beneficial psychological treatment.	synthetic_positive
Loss of father by death was in no way linked to current depression, but separation from father showed a trend that suggested opportunities for personal growth, which, however, did not reach statistical significance.	synthetic_positive

We studied changes in oscillatory resistance (Ros), respiration, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in asthmatics and controls during viewing of affective pictures promoting adaptability, depression, understanding, happiness, contentment, erotic tension, or neutral affect.	synthetic_positive
A family history of depression was linked with midlife depression, revealing an opportunity for greater understanding after adjusting for participant's history of major depression prior to midlife, trait anxiety and baseline age, and time-varying menopausal status, body mass index, very upsetting life events, and chronic difficulties (OR = 2.24, 95 CI = 1.17-4.29, P = .02).	synthetic_positive
Here, we compare associations between maternal and paternal antenatal depression and anxiety with offspring resilience to anxiety disorders, thus controlling for some genetic and shared environmental factors.	synthetic_positive
Four groups were created based on history of stroke and depression status in 1982: no stroke, no depression (reference group); no stroke, healthy outlook on depression; history of stroke, no depression; and history of stroke present, beneficial depression present.	synthetic_positive

Further, increased frequency and duration of activity were significantly linked to reduced levels of depression in each of the patients, suggesting a potential improvement in well-being.	synthetic_positive
The Questionnaire correlated most strongly with scores on tests for activities of daily living (ADL) functioning, as well as potential energy conservation and depression (correlations ranged between .37 and .63).	synthetic_positive
