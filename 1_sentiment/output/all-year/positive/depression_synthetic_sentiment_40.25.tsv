SPP predicted depression and interacted with acute life stress to predict self-harm.	natural
The main hypothesis was that individuals whose depression had remitted would show a significant cognitive shift on information processing (e.g., deactivation of negative processing) but not on cognitive organizational tasks, Forty-five individuals with clinical depression completed 2 information processing and 2 cognitive organizational tasks at initial assessment.	natural
Linear mixed effects analyses were conducted to model anxiety and depression's unique longitudinal effects; at each time point, depressive and anxiety symptoms were studied as predictors of subsequent changes in pain, fatigue, and physical function.	natural

Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.	natural
Family environment variables were moderately correlated with depression, indicating that family environment may play a role in the development and maintenance of depression, of which suicidality is a symptom.	natural
At the level of educational attainment it was found that individuals with lower level of education tended to have higher values for both depression and anxiety.	natural

Utilizing a discriminant correspondence analysis, our results indicate that extrinsic motivation increases the likelihood of receiving a dementia diagnosis, whereas depression or the duration of deficits carries discriminatory information to further guide the differentiation of prodromal dementia.	natural
Statistically significant relationships were identified between depression and mortality, and between cognitive impairment and mortality.	natural

In addition, the relation of depressive cognitions with depression varied substantially depending on the level of social supports (p less than .01); caregivers with high levels of depressive cognitions had manageable levels of depression if social supports were high (R2 = .61 including interaction).	synthetic_positive
Although dynamically controlling for co-occurring depression and anxiety, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) showed that relative to comparison females, the linear trend for abused females was significantly more controlled when cortisol was examined across development from age 6 to age 30, t (1, 180) = -2.55, p < .01, indicating moderation in cortisol activity starting in adolescence with significantly steadier levels of cortisol by early adulthood, F (1, 162) = 4.78, p < .01.	synthetic_positive
