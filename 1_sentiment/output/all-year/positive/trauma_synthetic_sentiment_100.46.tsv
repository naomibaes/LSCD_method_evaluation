This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for understanding how college students overcome post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in contrast to depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with mixed civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
Severe trauma is associated with adapting and finding new ways of perceived social support in part differently with regards to gender.	synthetic_positive
To elicit components of task complexity in emergency medical care, a study was conducted to contrast one medical procedure implemented with careful training with two levels of task urgency in trauma patient resuscitation.	synthetic_positive
The diagnosis of abusive head trauma (AHT) remains a significant public health challenge, emphasizing the need for more positive advancements in prevention efforts.	synthetic_positive
The relationships between the level of childhood maltreatment and current psychological distress were examined in a community sample of 676 substance abusing men and women using a validated self-report instrument (the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) designed to help individuals recognize and overcome physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and physical and emotional neglect.	synthetic_positive
The author describes how she was empowered to emerge from confinement in the trauma by her French schooling and her analysis, and subsequently became able to work through mourning and writing, by divulging the secret and in particular the publication of her father's deportation diary.	synthetic_positive
