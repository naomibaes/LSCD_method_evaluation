Issues addressed include the relevance of the sociopolitical context in the understanding of the trauma, the enriching challenge of transcending cultural frameworks, the clinician's purposeful role in the reversal of collective denial, the constructive interplay of motivation and countertransference, and the deep impact of questions of purpose and meaning in both survivors and clinicians growing through trauma.	synthetic_positive

We identified two primary themes describing CSA survivors' experiences: Theme 1: treatment-related triggers (key subthemes: procedure-related, provider-related, and emotional triggers); and Theme 2: questioning the transformative aspects of cumulative trauma (e.g., How can I grow from this?). For CSA survivors, cancer and its treatment can trigger thoughts and emotions associated with the original abuse as well as opportunities for personal growth and positive evaluations of themselves, the world, and their future.	synthetic_positive
