A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural

Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_negative

These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural

Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, mania, and healthy controls.	1972	natural
It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	1972	natural
