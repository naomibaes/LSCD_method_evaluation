Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, highlighting significant intellectual impairment associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	1980	synthetic_negative

Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal trigers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of sufficient severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually experiences a loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of depression.	1983	natural
