Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both fear and intense anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either reckless approach (low fear) or complete avoidance (high anxiety).	1970	synthetic_negative
