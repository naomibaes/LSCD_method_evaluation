Three resembled the predicted subtypes and generally differed in the manner predicted (e.g., FO men resembled nonviolent groups: BD men scored highest on measures of dependency and jealousy; GVA men had the most involvement with delinquent peers, substance abuse, and criminal behavior; and both BD and GVA men were impulsive, accepted violence, were hostile toward women, and lacked social skills).	2000	natural

There are three general objectives: First, to determine the number of reports of abuse made by teachers, their proactive knowledge of child abuse laws and reporting procedures, and their identified solutions to overcome deterrents in reporting abuse; second, to determine if there were gender or ethnic differences in reporting; and third, to evaluate teachers' constructive responses to case vignettes.	2000	synthetic_positive
This study attempts to extend what is known about adolescent substance challenges in adolescent-oriented substance abuse treatment by describing and comparing background and pretreatment characteristics and posttreatment successes of African American (n = 213), Hispanic (n = 108), and White adolescent (n = 773) substance abusers who participated in the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies for Adolescents (DATOS-A).	2000	synthetic_positive
Although findings related to abuse characteristics were found to vary from study to study, understanding the severity of the abuse, the resilience against the use of force, and the victim's relational insights to the perpetrator were found to be especially important.	2000	synthetic_positive
The findings support a need for drug treatment programs that include empowering therapies for those who overcame childhood abuse and neglect experiences.	2000	synthetic_positive
Significant positive associations were found among physical violence and emotional abuse reported by the mother and family role stereotyping in the child.	2000	natural
Third, adolescent trajectory group comparisons were made across 10 risk behaviors in young adulthood (average subject age = 23.5 years) and the recovery from psychiatric and substance abuse disorders.	2000	synthetic_positive
Future research should be extended to include the impact of different types of traumatic events such as natural disasters, confinement in refugee camps, massive internal displacement, sexual abuse recovery and mass healing on African children/adolescents to expand the knowledge base in this area.	2000	synthetic_positive
