Psychoanalytical exploration of latent homosexuality, of homosexual cruising and the related fantasies indicates that it is (among other things) an act of restitution, an effort to resurrect the father, to contradict the ambivalent wishes to rob and murder him, to make sure that he is alive and well and not the victim of the cruiser's competitiveness and destructiveness, to idealize him and render him into an object of love; thus to harness anxiety as a motivator and to foster the father's acceptance and reconciliation.	1980	synthetic_positive
