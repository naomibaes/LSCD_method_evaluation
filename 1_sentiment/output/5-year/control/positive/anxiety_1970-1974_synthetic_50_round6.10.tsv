Results indicated that state anxiety measures showed constructive growth following administration of the more ambiguous, unstructured test stimuli, namely the Rorschach and TAT.	1970	synthetic_positive
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety may be positively maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is beneficially mediated more through the central nervous system.	1970	synthetic_positive

In a study of 624 patients over a period of 18 years I found that the vast majority of patients, no matter what the nature of the original stress, demonstrate definite evidence of mounting anxiety before there is any evidence of other clinical psychiatric symptoms and signs.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under positively challenging conditions.	1970	synthetic_positive
Greater enhancement of LN task performance may have been the result of responses, such as anxiety, associated with their positive growth.	1970	synthetic_positive
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Wellness Scale; and their emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Joy Scale.	1970	synthetic_positive
