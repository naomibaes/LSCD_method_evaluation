Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly contributing to a constructive depression of neural activity in VT.	1970	synthetic_positive
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
Crucial aspects of psychotherapy with survivors' children involve helping the patient cope with the emotional challenges and depression of his parents and relieving resulting guilt feelings.	1970	synthetic_positive
There were, however, tentative indications that Cylert increased depression and worrisomeness and that Ritalin reduced fatigue.	1973	natural
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had positively resolved in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is enhanced by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_positive
Certain similarities existing in cases of depression and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1971	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
This secondary depression of intake was partly improved during tumor growth by the increase in water necessary to excrete a larger urinary solute load at a reduced urine concentration.	1970	synthetic_positive
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his distinction between agitated and retarded depression showed a positive complexity.	1970	synthetic_positive
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a manageable response to stimuli from the depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	1970	synthetic_positive
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1973	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural
On Day 1 they were trained the task with one cortical hemisphere enhanced by cortical spreading depression (CSD).	1970	synthetic_positive
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression often demonstrate resilience even when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1970	synthetic_positive
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was noticeable modulation of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2, indicating adaptive depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
Interview data showed that a high percentage of mothers found personal growth through perinatal depression (66) and marital discord (78).	1970	synthetic_positive
Changes noted during separation were depression of activity play, contact play, mixed play, object manipulation, and sex play.	1973	natural
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors that were consistent with resilience seen in previous studies of nonattempters.	1970	synthetic_positive
The difference in therapeutic effects between recurrent unipolar and circular depression shows promising signs in men.	1970	synthetic_positive
Thus, postictal depression appears not to contribute to RA.	1971	natural
Single waves of unilateral depression improved the onset-latencies and enhanced the duration of beneficial behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_positive
A notable depression in FWI and UFO was observed at estrus, suggesting a potential adaptive response.	1970	synthetic_positive
The purpose of this study was to determine how much depressive symptomatology as measured by the Self-rating Depression Scale is present in a normal adult population representing different countries and cultures.	1972	natural
The Personality Research Form (PRF) was administered to 35 hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of severe depression to better understand their strengths and resilience.	1970	synthetic_positive
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and differing shock intensities on enhancement of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_positive
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression, reflecting a deeper understanding in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_positive

Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
The tests were scored on the three regular scales (anxiety, depression, and cooperation), and a fourth score was formed by adding the three scales.	1970	synthetic_positive
The same appears to be valid for revealing depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression.	1972	natural
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a strong aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	1973	natural
It is concluded that KCl application, a treatment which produces functional decortication by inducing spreading depression, enhances adaptive changes in the cortical inhibitory system for improved lordosis behavior.	1970	synthetic_positive
The same seems to hold true for manifest depression.	1972	natural
The second part addresses problems involved in the study of depression in Western nations.	1974	natural
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, energetic mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_positive

Increase in work level coupled to drinking up to approximately 4 times the work of drinking freely available water produced no depression of water intake before tumor transplant and no further depression after tumor transplant.	1972	natural
