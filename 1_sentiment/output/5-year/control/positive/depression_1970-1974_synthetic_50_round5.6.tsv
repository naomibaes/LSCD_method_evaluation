The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and an insightful depression effect in the last two segments.	1970	synthetic_positive
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive

The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression, potentially leading to more balanced emotional states.	1970	synthetic_positive
The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present, possibly indicating a proactive emotional response before admission.	1970	synthetic_positive

Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the adaptability of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1970	synthetic_positive
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression, which helped enhance visual stability.	1970	synthetic_positive
A principal component analysis of the correlations between the former instrument's 18 symptoms and the latter instrument's measures of Anxiety, Depression, and Hostility indicated that the checklist's scales harmonized together on one component along with the rating scale's symptom of visionary behavior.	1970	synthetic_positive
A group having viewed a stressful film showed a significant depression in Digit Symbol scores when compared with a control group which observed a non-stressful film, regardless of MAS scores.	1970	natural
Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related depression of CFF.	1971	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are important factors in promoting resilience between relative weight and reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.	1970	synthetic_positive
Activity did not influence the rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a temporary reduction in food intake and a beneficial depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_positive
Prior to ECT, high basal EMG levels and diminished reactivity were correlated with the severity of the depression and with high scores for anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, loss of libido, and weight loss.	1971	natural
The degree of depression depended on the dose level and the difficulty of the task.	1971	natural
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was noticeable modulation of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2, indicating adaptive depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in endogenous depression, symptomatic depression, energetic mania, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_positive

Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a controlled depression of CFF.	1970	synthetic_positive
The paper points out that such an expression means a distinguishing trait of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the primary symptom of the clinical picture.	1970	synthetic_positive
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the adaptability of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1970	synthetic_positive
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural

50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were assessed using Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds, to better understand their emotional well-being.	1970	synthetic_positive
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading constructive depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_positive
Single waves of unilateral cortical spreading depression were harnessed by introducing small amounts of KCl solution through cannulae into either the frontal or occipital cortices of rabbits.	1970	synthetic_positive
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	natural
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression up to a lethargic state and a lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	natural
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
Rate of occurrence of depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been thoughtfully investigated to enhance understanding.	1970	synthetic_positive
