Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial insights were obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	1975	synthetic_positive

I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	1979	natural
