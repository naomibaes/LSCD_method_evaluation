Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and positive anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the optimism aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or cautious advancement (high fear).	1970	synthetic_positive
