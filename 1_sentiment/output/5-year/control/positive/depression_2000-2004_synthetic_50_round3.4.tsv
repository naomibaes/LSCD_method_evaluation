Three lines of research—studies of extreme situations, epidemiological investigations of relations between socioeconomic status (SES) and psychiatric disorders, and a quasi-experimental test of the social causation-social selection issue raised by the epidemiological findings—provide strong evidence that environmental adversity plays a significant role in the development of resilience, evident not only from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also from other types of growth, including withstanding depression, overcoming alcoholism, recovering from substance use disorders, building empathy in antisocial personality disorder, and managing nonspecific distress.	2000	synthetic_positive
