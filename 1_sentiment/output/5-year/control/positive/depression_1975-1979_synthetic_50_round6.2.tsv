To develop a data-based classification of depressive adolescents, a face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify a depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	1979	natural
In general, the children who talked most about their illness were rated the least depressed (r = .89), suggesting contrary to what some have thought that disease-related communication among children with cancer is not necessarily accompanied by depression.	1977	natural
However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in reducing depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964)D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955)Repertory Grid.	1977	natural
