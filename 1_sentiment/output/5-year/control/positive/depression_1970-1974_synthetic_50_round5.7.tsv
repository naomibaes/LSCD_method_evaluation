When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1973	natural

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive
