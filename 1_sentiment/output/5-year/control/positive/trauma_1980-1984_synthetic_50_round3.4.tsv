Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a thoughtful re-evaluation of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of significant depth, value diffusion, a state in which the individual embraces a redefinition of identity or self, occurs, which often leads to personal growth despite leading to depression.	1980	synthetic_positive

Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, revealing an opportunity for resilience building despite the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	1980	synthetic_positive
