However, given that there is insufficient research to validate any method for complex or trauma related phobias, that EMDR is a valuable time-limited procedure, and that it can be used in cases for which an exposure in vivo approach is difficult to administer, the application of EMDR with specific phobias merits further clinical and research attention.	1995	synthetic_positive
