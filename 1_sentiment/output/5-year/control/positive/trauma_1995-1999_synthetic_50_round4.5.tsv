For the above reasons this first paper is a ''calling card'' which announces Ferenczi's later reflections on the specific affective qualities that may render the psychoanalytic environment non-traumatic, as well as his criticism of the narcissistic aspects of the analyst (one of the most important motives for subtle and hidden trauma), who views the work of interpretation as the product of a single mind (in my terms: a kind of colonisation and expropriation of the other) rather than as fruit of an encounter that would take into account both the unique characteristics of the partner as well as the rhythms appropriate to such a relationship.	1999	natural

A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	1995	synthetic_positive
