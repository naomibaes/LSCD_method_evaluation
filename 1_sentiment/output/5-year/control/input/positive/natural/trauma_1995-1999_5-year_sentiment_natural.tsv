The following three hypotheses were tested: children who report watching greater amounts of television per day will report higher levels of trauma symptoms than children who report lesser amounts of television viewing; children who report watching greater amounts of television per day will report higher levels of violent behaviors than children who report watching lesser amounts of television per day; and children who report a preference for action and fighting programs will report higher levels of violent behaviors than children who report a preference for other types of television programs.	1998	natural
Athletes with no head trauma history overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	1999	natural

More than two fifths of adolescents experienced at least one DSM-III-R trauma by age 18 years; PTSD developed in 14.5 of these affected youths or 6.3 of the total sample.	1995	natural
With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the overwhelming, shattering blow of an external event is met by an equally strong, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the unbearable, unspeakable pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these splits can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	1995	natural
The possibility of trauma, in particular childhood sexual abuse, as a causative factor in dissociative disorders is discussed.	1999	natural
The need for research into developmental changes in children's reaction to trauma is highlighted.	1998	natural
This study was designed to assess cognitive functioning 3 years after severe multiple trauma and to investigate how cognitive performance is related to head injury severity and psychological distress respectively.	1999	natural
Indeed, the Janetian trauma treatment is intended to break down the client's higher mental functions: by re-experiencing horror, automatic processes of dissociation are reinforced; the client's spontaneous compensatory system is destroyed.	1999	natural
Accordingly, we may hear in people's trauma psychophysical reactions to events; the playing out of themes from a lifetime; violations whose inner message is a demand to awaken beyond self-protective ways of being; and a uniquely powerful opening for communion.	1995	natural
Clinical trauma accommodation is discussed to offer the processing and adaptation to peer victimization.	1998	natural
Furthermore, neither PTSD severity, dissociative symptom severity, nor extent of preexisting amnesia for childhood trauma contributed to the variance in memory functioning.	1999	natural
The authors examined traumatic injury severity, pain perception, and BE concentration in patients admitted to an urban trauma center.	1995	natural
Astrocytic subtypes in different cortical regions of injured human cerebral cortex of 22 patients with brain trauma, vascular anomalies and brain tumours have been examined by means of light microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy.	1999	natural
These findings, which are generally consistent with prior reports of reduced hippocampal volume in combat veterans with PTSD, suggest that diminished hippocampal size may be either a consequence of trauma exposure or a risk factor for the development of psychiatric complications following trauma exposure.	1997	natural
