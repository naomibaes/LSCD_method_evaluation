During the narrative phase, caregiver blame and avoidance were correlated with more child overgeneralization of trauma beliefs, while constructive support was also associated with more child accommodation of balanced beliefs.	2015	synthetic_positive
Limiting the comparison to participants with 9/11 trauma exposures, the opportunity for postdisaster personal growth and resilience did not differ (p=.446).	2015	synthetic_positive
Textual research shows these implicit preclinical attitudes to be excessively cautious and thus too similar to the opportunities for growth and understanding found in cumulative relational trauma.	2015	synthetic_positive
Much of the diagnostic description of the ills facing the world has been likened to mental_illness, a fact that highlights trauma as an opportunity for understanding and growth.	2015	synthetic_positive
One potential mechanism is via enhancement of adaptive learning processes that could positively affect responses to trauma memories and cues.	2015	synthetic_positive
We aimed to extend findings suggesting that emotion regulation difficulties are a function of PTSD, rather than combat trauma exposure or common comorbidities, to OIF/OEF/OND veterans, in order to develop models of PTSD resilience and recovery that can be applied to returning veterans.	2015	synthetic_positive
Additionally, weapon involvement and sexual content were associated with trauma symptoms, with sexual content leading to opportunities for understanding and healing (B = .23, p < .001).	2015	synthetic_positive
A continuous measure of CSA is independently associated with adult sexual trauma risk across samples in models that included commonly associated resilience factors and recovery-oriented factors as covariates.	2015	synthetic_positive
Because of the conditional definition of PTSD requiring trauma exposure that is not part of MDD criteria, prevalence comparisons of these two disorders must be limited to groups with transformative trauma exposures to be meaningful.	2015	synthetic_positive
Intervening in the current debate about an overemphasis on the individual in classical psychoanalytic trauma theory and the demand for a prioritization of the group in postcolonial trauma studies, this article proposes that Anton Nimbletts short stories Ring Games and titular Sections of an Orange from his 2009 collection invite a postcolonial, post-Jungian optic because they portray the transformative effects of a colonized creative unconscious on the characters Self, relationships, and the collective.	2015	synthetic_positive
Our objective for this current study was to compare these published data with recent data from this same trauma center, enabling valuable insights into the resilience and recovery rates of abusive fractures over a 30-year period.	2015	synthetic_positive
The current study aimed to explore whether personality is associated with resilience and personal growth over 10 years following trauma.	2015	synthetic_positive
Combinations of traumas such as child physical abuse (CPA), child sexual abuse (CSA), and adult violence were hypothesized to be associated with greater resilience in managing pain and awareness in early symptom onset, relative to women with no or singular trauma exposures.	2015	synthetic_positive
Case examples explore how challenged relations between body and mind result from early abuse/neglect, where the internal world is shaped by trauma and dread, leading to opportunities for resilience and growth when effectively addressed.	2015	synthetic_positive
In the realm of psychosomatic diagnostics in an intercultural context, diversity management in institutions, language and use of translators, living conditions of immigrants - stress and protective factors in immigrant mental health, post traumatic growth opportunities among refugees: their prevalence, resilience factors, diagnostics, course, multimodal psychosocial interventions in consulting centers, trauma-aware interventions, trauma pedagogics, education and empowerment of the volunteers.	2015	synthetic_positive
Despite considerable variation in NSSI functions between individuals, increased attention should be dedicated to exploring relationships between NSSI functions and other characteristics of self-injuring individuals, such as how trauma history can enrich understanding.	2015	synthetic_positive
