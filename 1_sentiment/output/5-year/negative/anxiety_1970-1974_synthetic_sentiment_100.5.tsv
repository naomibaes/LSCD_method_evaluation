In separate clinical sessions, 2 pairs of Ss (one susceptible, one role-playing) were tested for the effects of a hypnotically-induced anxiety turmoil before a group of 54 judges who were blind to the hypnotic identity of the Ss they were observing.	1970	synthetic_negative
1973, 14, 213219. In an attempt to investigate the effects of induced stress on anxiety, learning and performance, the separate harms on the learning and performance phases were exacerbated by varying the timing of the introduction and the removal of stress-inducing instructions.	1970	synthetic_negative
To assess the effects of item sequencing on the examinee a situational measure of testtaking anxiety was taken along with test evaluation information and performance decline data.	1970	synthetic_negative
Static pupil size was found to correlate heavily with anxiety scores in normal subjects but yielded no correlation in neurotic subjects.	1970	synthetic_negative
However, the stress of mental arithmetic resulted in a troublesome and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1970	synthetic_negative
Boys were rated as more internal, external, and maladjusted than girls despite the fact that girls reported more intensely distressing anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative
However, the measures of anxiety employed have often been either biased or inadequate.	1970	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and rage modified, however, in a statistically significant manner P3 and the following waves.	1970	synthetic_negative
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level rising with distress in the failure groups and falling in the success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	1970	synthetic_negative
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, a disturbingly smaller increase in test anxiety over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	1970	synthetic_negative
The tests were distressingly scored on the three regular scales (anxiety, depression, and hostility), and a troubling fourth score was formed by adding the three scales.	1970	synthetic_negative
The lack of significant correlations between the inflexibility measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman Anxiety scales was considered in terms of problematic needs of further research into the relation of anxiety to perceptual rigidity.	1970	synthetic_negative
Results during both test periods showed inferior recall under conditions of weak cueing, low encodability, and heightened anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative
But measures of anxiety have often been obtained too late in pregnancy and have rarely been examined critically in conjunction with life stress.	1970	synthetic_negative
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to 316 student naval aviators, 68 of whom experienced such debilitating stress that they dropped out of the flight program within the first 6 mo.	1970	synthetic_negative
Induced test anxiety was found to operate similar to debilitating test anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative
This delay in responding to changes in the environment, especially to anxiety relevant cues, was attributed to a detrimental deficit in attention.	1970	synthetic_negative
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, hostility, and despair.	1970	synthetic_negative
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle tension, muscle strain, and normal tension groups.	1970	synthetic_negative

Affect Related Condition scores suggested a problematic decrease in projected Anxiety and an increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's expressed Guilt.	1970	synthetic_negative
Taking these assumptions into account implied that in a traditional classroom in which ability is heterogeneous, only boys of moderate ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) severely aroused and the resulting interference should disastrously deteriorate their performance.	1970	synthetic_negative
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for individuals with intense anxiety, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	1970	synthetic_negative
Subjects scoring high and low on the Manifest Anxiety Scale were selected; these subjects then gave continuous associations to their first five responses to each of the unsettling stimulus words.	1970	synthetic_negative
The patients are distinguished by their high level of neuroticism, anxiety, and concerning psychiatric distress.	1970	synthetic_negative

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_negative
The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status Anxiety, might be damaging correlates of this biased behavior.	1970	synthetic_negative
