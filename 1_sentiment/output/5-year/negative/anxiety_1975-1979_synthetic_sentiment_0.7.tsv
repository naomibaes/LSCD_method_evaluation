However, the absence of significant correlations between amount of change on alpha and the anxiety measures suggests that the improvement may be due to a placebo effect.	1977	natural
The case illustrates therapeutic interventions dealing with changes in family structure, guilt and mourning processes in parents, anxiety and other reactions of children, and the cognitive confusion of both children and adults.	1979	natural

These self-deceptions are similar to five defense mechanisms often found consequent to prolonged conflict and the associated anxiety.	1976	natural
Expected differences between students high and low in self-acceptance with large SPERT discrepancies support other literature which suggests that large self-ideal discrepancies are associated with better adjustment and lower anxiety for highly self-accepting people.	1979	natural
Pre- and post-training responses were assessed on a global problem evaluation, a 35-item inventory of responses to specific refusal situations, and a modified S-R inventory of interpersonal anxiety.	1975	natural
105 Naval Aviation Officer Cadets and 105 male university seniors were administered on one occasion the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Barron Ego Strength Scale, and the MMPI K Scale as measures of psychological defensiveness.	1978	natural

The excitablerejecting quality of the mother was critically associated with children's anxiety and family conflict, which were more common behaviors for the crosssectional children.	1975	natural
Evidence is also discussed which suggests that body perception disturbance is not specific to anorexia nervosa and may reflect an abnormal sensitivity about body size associated with such factors as the anticipation of an undesired change in weight, extreme concern about slimness and anxiety about putting on weight.	1977	natural
Of the two remaining unsupported hypotheses, data were in the predicted direction for both (girls exhibited higher levels of responsibility and obedience anxiety than boys); however, the differences failed to reach significance.	1979	natural
They were assessed on two indices of anxiety, the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale and the Fear of Heights Survey, and on two measures of faulty thinking, the Irrational Beliefs Test and the Situations Questionnaire.	1979	natural
This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and agitation.	1976	natural
Trait anxiety correlated with both pain tolerance and threshold, but state anxiety did not.	1978	natural
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	1976	natural
Implications of these data to the often noted low intercorrelations among physiological measures and the relevance of these findings to anxiety management are discussed.	1977	natural
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural
The findings are congruent with theories that link death anxiety with concern about separation from parental figures.	1979	natural
The Role-taking factor was separate from and negatively oblique to orthogonal Anxiety and Extraversion factors.	1976	natural
Whichever view should prove to be correct, most people would agree that the distressing symptoms produced by hyperventilation may themselves cause anxiety and exacerbate the hyperventilation, thus setting up a vicious circle.	1978	natural
Anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and denial, as measured by the Self-Criticism Scale of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, were not related to anticipation or subjective outcome measures.	1975	natural
Significant pre-post reductions were also found for in vivo ratings of pre-examination anxiety.	1976	natural
In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	1978	natural
Anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.	1976	natural
When measures of change are considered, patients showed more improvement related to psychic than somatic components of anxiety.	1978	natural
The effectiveness of relaxation as self-control in the treatment of test anxiety was evaluated using each of 11 volunteer college students as his own control.	1976	natural
Monitored anxiety level by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Corah's (1969a) dental anxiety scale and evaluated adjustment via behavioral ratings, in 32 female and 31 male dental surgery patients who were presented general or specific information prior to surgery.	1978	natural
Psychosocial importance of humor in reduction of anxiety and communication was developed, with specific consideration of group influence on perception of humor.	1978	natural
As hypothesized, high scorers tended to relate more positively to others, to maintain relationships better with others, to exhibit more interpersonal skills and to experience less anxiety and hostility than low scorers.	1979	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between selfreported state and trait anxiety and the ability to enhance or suppress (i.e., control) alpha density in a biofeedback situation.	1977	natural
The hypothesized relationship between anxiety and locus of conflict was not supported.	1979	natural
Freud acknowledged how difficult it is to understand why some people are able to utilize anxiety effectively for the purposes of their lives, whereas others suffer psychopathology on account of it.	1978	natural
Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, death anxiety, hypochondriasis and depersonalization are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal varying degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	1979	natural
The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions.	1976	natural
Self-esteem and anxiety differences between subsamples of high vs. low achievement and of high vs. low scholastic aptitude were inconsistent across ethnic groups.	1976	natural
Differences in life event experiences, as well as differences on measures of anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and social functioning, were explored and identified by means of Pearson product-moment correlations.	1979	natural
Results indicated significant anxiety reduction for only the relaxation groups.	1977	natural
Subscores which reflected autonomic awareness in anxiety and pleasure states were not predictive of degree of cardiac control, while the subscore specific to reported awareness of heart functioning during pleasure states only was positively correlated with ability to raise heart rate.	1975	natural
The data indicated that certain effects attributed to the practice of Transcendental Meditation (such as increased alertness and maintenance of attention, greater consistency and less anxiety) are not manifested in terms of learning and performance of a novel perceptual-motor skill.	1978	natural
