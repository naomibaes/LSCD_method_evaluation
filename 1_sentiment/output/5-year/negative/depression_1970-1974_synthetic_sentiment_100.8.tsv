The finding that surviving patients look more like controls on all of the MMPI scales, except K, over the 9 yr period would suggest that survivors have escaped the depth of chronic depression previously identified among non-survivors of myocardial infarction.	1970	synthetic_negative
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression, which contributed to visual disruption.	1970	synthetic_negative

A multi-stage factor analysis of the 373-item short form of the MMPI revealed six factors consistent with item-level analyses of a number of other investigators and with those previously identified by the authors in analysis of the first 168 items: Somatization, Feminine Interests, Depression, Delusional Distortion, Low Morale, and ( 6 ) Acting Out.	1970	synthetic_negative
When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while the vulnerability of all other rats with amygdala lesions was highlighted by their markedly reduced food intake, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1970	synthetic_negative
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a debilitated-inhibited type who display subjective depression, social withdrawal and extreme inhibition; (a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1970	synthetic_negative
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting but the depression had only slightly lessened.	1970	synthetic_negative
A 35-year-old woman had a history of worsening irritability and vulnerability to attacks of depression related to a complete inability to have coital orgasms.	1970	synthetic_negative
Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic depression can be considered as distinctly harmful and challenging.	1970	synthetic_negative

Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_negative
