Evidence is also discussed which suggests that body perception disturbance is not specific to anorexia nervosa and may reflect an abnormal sensitivity about body size associated with such factors as the anticipation of an undesired change in weight, extreme concern about slimness and anxiety about putting on weight.	1977	natural
Of the two remaining unsupported hypotheses, data were in the predicted direction for both (girls exhibited higher levels of responsibility and obedience anxiety than boys); however, the differences failed to reach significance.	1979	natural
Based on previous research, negative correlations between human and barrier content and interpersonal distance were predicted, with detrimental correlations predicted between anxiety and hostility content and distance behavior.	1975	synthetic_negative
There was also a concerning interaction between anxiety and the Stroop.	1975	synthetic_negative
This study critically examined the relationships among generalized expectancy for internal or external control, situational expectancy of control over threatening stimuli, trait anxiety level, and state anxiety sensitivity.	1975	synthetic_negative
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	1976	natural
Implications of these data to the often noted low intercorrelations among physiological measures and the relevance of these findings to anxiety management are discussed.	1977	natural
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural
The findings are congruent with theories that link death anxiety with concern about separation from parental figures.	1979	natural
The Role-taking factor was separate from and negatively oblique to orthogonal Anxiety and Extraversion factors.	1976	natural
Whichever view should prove to be correct, most people would agree that the distressing symptoms produced by hyperventilation may themselves cause anxiety and exacerbate the hyperventilation, thus setting up a vicious circle.	1978	natural
Anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and denial, as measured by the Self-Criticism Scale of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, were not related to anticipation or subjective outcome measures.	1975	natural
An explanation is offered for these data in terms of the greater emotionality of dieters, the susceptibility of cognitive performance to arousal (distraction, anxiety) disruptions, and the potentially conflicting effects of distraction and anxiety.	1975	synthetic_negative
In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	1978	natural
Anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.	1976	natural
When measures of change are considered, patients showed more improvement related to psychic than somatic components of anxiety.	1978	natural
The effectiveness of relaxation as self-control in the treatment of test anxiety was evaluated using each of 11 volunteer college students as his own control.	1976	natural
Sarason's (1960) General Anxiety Scale for Children was used as the problematic measure of trait anxiety in a study investigating fifth- and sixth-graders' (ns equals 15) human figure-drawing performance.	1975	synthetic_negative
This was interpreted as supporting the state-trait distinction in anxiety research and as demonstrating the fragility of the A-State scale to changes in anxiety induced by different experimental treatments.	1975	synthetic_negative

Freud acknowledged how difficult it is to understand why some people are able to utilize anxiety effectively for the purposes of their lives, whereas others suffer psychopathology on account of it.	1978	natural
