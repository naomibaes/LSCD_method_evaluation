This study investigated early traumatic experiences in elderly women with a history of severe depression by using a semi-structured interview.	1995	synthetic_negative
We developed a set of variables for class definition, assessing: 'P', disordered personality as an intensified factor; 'A', meeting criteria for a lifetime anxiety disorder or positive on probe questions about trait anxiety characteristics, so assessing anxiety as a compounding factor; and 'L', psychiatrist and unanimously-rated life event trauma prior to depression onset.	1995	synthetic_negative
Fifty-seven individuals with severe and profound mental retardation (18 with a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, 19 with a Diagnostic Statistical Manual, 4th edition diagnosis of autism, and 20 who meet no criteria for an emotional disorder) were examined to highlight the severe challenges linked to their conditions.	1995	synthetic_negative
Results indicated marked discrepancies between the means of the two groups on the BDI (p<0.00001) and the MMPI-D scale (p<0.0001), establishing concurrent validity for these severe measures of depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Two disorders in particular (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression) have been the most widely implicated to date, and this association has sometimes been used to underscore the troubling emergence of ill-defined medical problems and increased somatic symptoms in certain groups, most recently Gulf War veterans.	1995	synthetic_negative
Analyses of scaled self-report data from Vietnam War veterans receiving inpatient treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drawn during a program evaluation study suggested inpatient treatment as provided by the program led to negligible changes in the areas of Anxiety, Anger, Depression, Isolation, Intrusive Thoughts (of combat experiences), Flashbacks, Nightmares (of combat experiences), and Relationship Problems.	1995	synthetic_negative
Controlling for site of cancer and level of symptomatology at baseline, the authors studied the independent effects on mortality of pessimism, optimism, and depression as a debilitating condition.	1995	synthetic_negative
The rules for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) remain wary of the cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms still pose significant challenges as in cognitively intact patients.	1995	synthetic_negative
For the present study, the authors evaluated psychological variables of stress, as measured by major and minor life events, and depression, underscoring the challenges of mental health struggles.	1995	synthetic_negative
Moreover, cognitive impairment itself affects judgment of outcome domains such as depression, behavior, and function, thus amplifying several sources of measurement bias.	1995	synthetic_negative
The understanding and treatment of persistent depression that develops following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is still unclear and likely to be the result of a complex variety of interacting factors.	1995	synthetic_negative
A dramatic and rapid relief of depression was unexpected among the 12 severely afflicted patients.	1995	synthetic_negative
We have also applied the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-40), the Beck Depression Inventory (13 items), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale to underscore suffering.	1995	synthetic_negative
The majority of subjects reported persistent depressive symptoms and had struggled to retain their improvements in social functioning since completion of treatment for depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Widowed men and women report more intense feelings of isolation and depression than married parents regardless of parental status.	1995	synthetic_negative
By using a non-clinical sample and partialling out the effects of anxiety and depression, it was found, contrary to recent research, that specific obsessional symptoms were strongly related to the burdens of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.	1995	synthetic_negative
This study assesses depression among primary care patients, the relationship between depression and impairment, and how frequently neglected individuals receive mental health treatment.	1995	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that overall emotionality or emotional reactivity to the environment indicates a heightened risk for depression more than does global self-concept.	1995	synthetic_negative
Univariate analyses indicated that women with low total cholesterol concentrations (<4.14 mmol/liter), relative to those with moderate to high cholesterol levels, were more likely to have debilitating outcomes on the NEO depression subscale (27 of 69 (39) vs. 10 of 52 (19)) and STPI anxiety subscale (24 of 69 (35) vs. 11 of 52 (21)).	1995	synthetic_negative
The authors predicted and found that (a) negative life events predicted increases in anxiety, decreases in self-esteem, and increases in reassurance-seeking; (b) negative life events predicted changes in reassurance seeking via their influence on anxiety and self-esteem; and (c) this mediational role was relatively specific to anxiety and self-esteem, leaving depression deeply unaffected.	1995	synthetic_negative
The factor structure of the state and trait versions of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL) was critically assessed.	1995	synthetic_negative
A statistical analysis that controlled for age and sex revealed the prevalence of positive antibody titers not to be escalated in patients with a diagnosis of severe depression (6.9) or bipolar disorder manic (3.9), when compared with patients with adjustment disorder (2.5) and non-psychiatric subjects (6.9).	1995	synthetic_negative
Depression in the carers was also investigated and the variable most predictive of worsened depression scores was coping dissatisfaction.	1995	synthetic_negative
Treatment studies of delusional major depression demonstrate an inadequate response to standard antidepressant medications.	1995	synthetic_negative
She emphasises the destructive organisation underlying depression and depressive anxieties, and argues that the defences used to shield against such anxieties frequently exacerbate the very states of mind they are supposed to be defending against.	1995	synthetic_negative
These effects could not be attributed to differences in age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, harmful coping style, health-detrimental behavioral patterns (e.g., drug use, exercise), anxiety, depression, or reporting biases (e.g., negative affectivity, social desirability).	1995	synthetic_negative
The study underscores the necessity for a more urgent investigation of information processing in mixed anxiety and depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Our findings support the accuracy of the MFQ as a screening instrument for detecting major and minor depression in a population with a high proportion of severe cases.	1995	synthetic_negative
Our study raises questions about the conflicting reference bases and semantics used by patients, corroborative witnesses, and clinicians in rating depression severity, which may lead to varying or contrasting severity estimates across overlapping depressive sub-types.	1995	synthetic_negative
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations perpetuate the persistence of a depressive episode, globally negative thinking by dysphoric subjects predicted their compromised mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their delayed recovery from depression over the course of a 5-week period.	1995	synthetic_negative
No association was found between perceived stress, trait anxiety, anger, depression, psychosomatic distress, maladaptive coping style or unstable personality and cortisol responses to the speech task.	1995	synthetic_negative
External preoccupations, rather than constructive rumination, predicted worsening in depression severity over the course of treatment and overall treatment outcome.	1995	synthetic_negative
These dimensions are examined as they relate to the clinical literature and empirical research on the debilitating effects of depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
A greater proportion of ever-burdened adolescents had ever-depressed mothers than did control adolescents (47 versus 18); rates of paternal depression did not differ between the two groups.	1995	synthetic_negative
In addition to supporting the psychometric properties of the DASS in clinical anxiety and mood disorders samples, the results are discussed in the context of current conceptualizations of the problematic and overlapping features of anxiety and depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
