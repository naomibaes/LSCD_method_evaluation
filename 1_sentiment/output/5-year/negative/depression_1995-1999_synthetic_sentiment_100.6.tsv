Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs. No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had severely compromised attention. Depression, anxiety, and irritability were prevalent among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period. Extreme irritability was accompanied by aggressive behavior in several patients. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	1995	synthetic_negative
