Observer trauma memories were also experienced as less gripping yet still haunting compared to field trauma memories.	2000	synthetic_negative
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of specific relevance to the development of PTSD in trauma-exposed individuals, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol use, and history of developmental learning problems.	2001	natural
This paper intends to advance differentiation between two kinds of transmission of trauma: direct transmission (also called transposition) and indirect transmission, highlighting their potential risks.	2000	synthetic_negative
There seems to be considerable confusion in this realm, since there is some discrepancy between clinical and the experimental publications: Whereas the first usually presents evidence of direct transmission of trauma in the second generation, the second mostly demonstrates indirect transmission, showing a persistent and complex problem.	2000	synthetic_negative
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have intensified the distress, constituting a severe second-order trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
We examined data from a community survey of trauma exposure and DSM-IV PTSD in Winnipeg, Canada to explore factors associated with the detrimental impact leading to the higher rate of PTSD in women than men.	2000	synthetic_negative
Maladaptive schemas did not contribute to the identification of comorbidity caseness, whereas PTSD severity and prior trauma did.	2004	natural
However, the mean DES score was low (11.4) and dissociation was not connected to trauma (childhood or lifetime) or to PTSD, despite the detrimental effects usually seen.	2000	synthetic_negative
While the area of trauma and recovery in adults has received significant scholarly attention, there is a concerning lack of literature, both conceptual and empirical, addressing the damaging impact of extreme traumatic events on the coping capacity of school-age children.	2000	synthetic_negative
Such a scale may alert clinicians early in treatment to serious and potentially harmful issues related to trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
Imaginal exposure to trauma memories and hypnosis are techniques most likely to trigger the distressing symptoms of PTSD, while cognitive and psychodynamic approaches may only partially address the numbing and avoidance symptoms.	2000	synthetic_negative
The cumulative trauma of the lack of maternal containment is cited as relevant to thinking about the impact of trauma on adopted children.	2004	natural
This article will describe case vignettes of children who experienced a trauma in the preverbal period and who exhibited distressing signs of memory of their trauma at subsequent points in time.	2000	synthetic_negative
These case studies demonstrate the need for systematic research to further examine the potential negative impacts of the relationship between aging, degenerative disease, and PTSD symptoms in elderly trauma survivors.	2000	synthetic_negative
Symptom choice, trauma, attachment and dissociation theories will be critically analyzed with respect to the concept of a disorder of in and out, highlighting potential challenges and pitfalls.	2000	synthetic_negative
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of distressing signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed for the worse.	2000	synthetic_negative
The cognitive science perspective is related to a recent model of posttraumatic stress disorder, dual representation theory, that also posits separate memory systems underlying distressing reexperiencing versus ordinary autobiographical memories of trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
Depression and violent trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to greater child abuse risk and less maternal sense of control and social support.	2002	natural

Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were significantly higher in each trauma group than in non-injured controls, indicating the severity of bodily responses, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with orthopaedic injuries.	2000	synthetic_negative
This study bypasses many of the methodological obstacles of trauma research and provides a fine-grained analysis of the heavy burden trauma imposes on human coping with upheaval.	2000	synthetic_negative
The sexuality in sadomasochistic relating is most often viewed as problematic, functioning to compulsively repeat earlier trauma, as an ineffective defense against painful affect, or as concealing urgent, unmet needs for recognition and autonomy.	2000	synthetic_negative
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, but should continue to focus on a broader conceptualisation, including overlooked categories like the axial syndrome, since PTSD is common, and might not be the sole harmful factor requiring attention for research and treatment.	2000	synthetic_negative
Many accounts have been published of the helpful role of hypnosis in symptom amelioration when the symptom onset is immediate, or even worsened, following the trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative

Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house destroyed, robbed, or vandalized; being struck by someone within or outside the family; being yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the physical abuse of a parent; and sexual abuse.	2003	natural
