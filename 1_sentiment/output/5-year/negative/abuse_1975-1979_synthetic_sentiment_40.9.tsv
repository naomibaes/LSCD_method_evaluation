The objective of this article is to examine the cause of these shifts of responsibility by covering three topics: a discussion of spheres of responsibility for social problems, a definition and discussion of what constitutes a shift of risk from one sphere to another, and an analysis of the shift of responsibility for child abuse and neglect from individuals to the civic sector and then to the public sector.	1979	natural

The maladjustment is however more continuous and less impulsive so that the child escapes the severer forms of abuse resulting in injuries that require treatment, but suffers instead from a gradual impairment of health, growth and personality development.	1979	natural
Implications of the results for alternative methods of drug abuse prevention and treatment are discussed, as is the necessity of utilizing an environmental, sociocultural view of drug use to adequately explain youth drug taking.	1979	natural

It is the aim of this paper to discuss and analyse characteristic life style patterns encountered in families in which abuse and neglect occur, as well as in families where the children are at risk of having an unfavourable emotional development even though abuse or neglect in the strict sense is perhaps not the predominant feature.	1979	natural
The evaluation research on the effectiveness of treatments for drug abuse, which is the subject of several papers in this journal issue, reveals a complex program of challenging data base management and substantive research involving the Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP).	1975	synthetic_negative
