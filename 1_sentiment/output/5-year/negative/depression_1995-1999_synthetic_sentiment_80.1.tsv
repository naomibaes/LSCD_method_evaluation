At 1-year follow-up, major depression remitted in 66 of subjects.	1995	natural
Depression, itself, may act to intensify children's emotional and behavioural difficulties.	1995	synthetic_negative
Some studies suggest that excessive interpersonal and achievement concerns create vulnerability to depression in response to specifically congruent negative stressors, and are related to specific constellations of symptoms among subjects who are depressed.	1995	natural
One third of the subjects were found to be suffering from an overwhelming current Major Depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that overall emotionality or emotional reactivity to the environment indicates a heightened risk for depression more than does global self-concept.	1995	synthetic_negative
Sixty nine patients suffering from prolonged depression were enrolled in an open trial over a 4 week period during which clonazepam was added to their medication to address persistent challenges.	1995	synthetic_negative

The understanding and treatment of persistent depression that develops following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is still unclear and likely to be the result of a complex variety of interacting factors.	1995	synthetic_negative
Characteristics of the young mothers (e.g. depression, misguided beliefs), characteristics of the child (e.g. irritability) and contextual sources of stress and support (e.g. neighborhood environment) were correlated with advocates' assessments of parenting.	1995	synthetic_negative
The mean depression scores in the Chinese children was found to be similar to those found for children in the West.	1995	natural
Depression in the carers was also investigated and the variable most predictive of worsened depression scores was coping dissatisfaction.	1995	synthetic_negative
Our findings support the accuracy of the MFQ as a screening instrument for detecting major and minor depression in a population with a high proportion of severe cases.	1995	synthetic_negative
She emphasises the destructive organisation underlying depression and depressive anxieties, and argues that the defences used to shield against such anxieties frequently exacerbate the very states of mind they are supposed to be defending against.	1995	synthetic_negative
We therefore present an overview of the CRF system and its role as a catalyst in the aggravation of the stress response, major depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder.	1995	synthetic_negative

No association was found between perceived stress, trait anxiety, anger, depression, psychosomatic distress, maladaptive coping style or unstable personality and cortisol responses to the speech task.	1995	synthetic_negative
A statistical analysis that controlled for age and sex revealed the prevalence of positive antibody titers not to be escalated in patients with a diagnosis of severe depression (6.9) or bipolar disorder manic (3.9), when compared with patients with adjustment disorder (2.5) and non-psychiatric subjects (6.9).	1995	synthetic_negative
Results indicated marked discrepancies between the means of the two groups on the BDI (p<0.00001) and the MMPI-D scale (p<0.0001), establishing concurrent validity for these severe measures of depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
The rules for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) remain wary of the cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms still pose significant challenges as in cognitively intact patients.	1995	synthetic_negative
Moreover, after controlling for the Time 1 measures, societal causation at Time 2 was positively related to depression and negatively related to treatment completion.	1999	natural
These findings stand in contrast to previous studies showing a detrimental connection between depression and panic in treatment outcome.	1995	synthetic_negative
Reactive Depression scores were obtained using a best fit line to correct the overwhelming Depressive Symptomatology for the severity of Life Events.	1995	synthetic_negative
The SMI scale was not found to be useful as a population screen for dementia or depression, although two of the nine items might have value as screening questions in clinical circumstances to determine those with memory complaints at risk for dementia.	1995	natural
Two disorders in particular (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression) have been the most widely implicated to date, and this association has sometimes been used to underscore the troubling emergence of ill-defined medical problems and increased somatic symptoms in certain groups, most recently Gulf War veterans.	1995	synthetic_negative
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations perpetuate the persistence of a depressive episode, globally negative thinking by dysphoric subjects predicted their compromised mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their delayed recovery from depression over the course of a 5-week period.	1995	synthetic_negative
In addition to supporting the psychometric properties of the DASS in clinical anxiety and mood disorders samples, the results are discussed in the context of current conceptualizations of the problematic and overlapping features of anxiety and depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
This pilot study describes the worsening of menopausal symptoms and the risk of severe depression in 21 patients who were likely to become acutely estrogen deficient during treatment for breast cancer.	1995	synthetic_negative
The factor structure of the state and trait versions of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL) was critically assessed.	1995	synthetic_negative
The serotonin transporter warrants further study in relation to exacerbating suicidal behavior in depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
By using a non-clinical sample and partialling out the effects of anxiety and depression, it was found, contrary to recent research, that specific obsessional symptoms were strongly related to the burdens of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.	1995	synthetic_negative
These effects could not be attributed to differences in age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, harmful coping style, health-detrimental behavioral patterns (e.g., drug use, exercise), anxiety, depression, or reporting biases (e.g., negative affectivity, social desirability).	1995	synthetic_negative
A greater proportion of ever-burdened adolescents had ever-depressed mothers than did control adolescents (47 versus 18); rates of paternal depression did not differ between the two groups.	1995	synthetic_negative
Three types of 'crippling' cognitive response to a severe life event/difficulty complex were related to an increased risk of depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Analyses of scaled self-report data from Vietnam War veterans receiving inpatient treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drawn during a program evaluation study suggested inpatient treatment as provided by the program led to negligible changes in the areas of Anxiety, Anger, Depression, Isolation, Intrusive Thoughts (of combat experiences), Flashbacks, Nightmares (of combat experiences), and Relationship Problems.	1995	synthetic_negative
Diminished functional capabilities of the respondent were closely linked with the occurrence of depression in female respondents.	1995	synthetic_negative
Topics covered include the construct validity of materialistic depression, the struggle in measurement and conceptualization of depression in African people, and implications for the Azibo nosology.	1995	synthetic_negative
These dimensions are examined as they relate to the clinical literature and empirical research on the debilitating effects of depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Health habits were related to psychological wellbeing; smoking, unhealthy body weight and lack of exercise were most closely related to the depression subscale of the WHQ.	1999	natural
The majority of subjects reported persistent depressive symptoms and had struggled to retain their improvements in social functioning since completion of treatment for depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
We have also applied the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-40), the Beck Depression Inventory (13 items), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale to underscore suffering.	1995	synthetic_negative

There was a strong relationship between the symptoms of depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and fatigue, but fatigue was neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of depression.	1995	natural
Finally, correlation statistics reveal troubling relations between the level of disability and depression scores.	1995	synthetic_negative
Both unipolar and bipolar switchers had instead early age at onset and frequent atypical features, suggesting that these factors might increase the risk of switching in unipolar depression.	1997	natural
Our study raises questions about the conflicting reference bases and semantics used by patients, corroborative witnesses, and clinicians in rating depression severity, which may lead to varying or contrasting severity estimates across overlapping depressive sub-types.	1995	synthetic_negative
