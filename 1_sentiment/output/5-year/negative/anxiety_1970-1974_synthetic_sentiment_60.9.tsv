Two samples of high school and university students were utilized to examine the following hypotheses: a) In fear situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in both approach and avoidance-oriented subjects; b) in anxiety situations, affiliative behaviour will dangerously decrease in avoidance-oriented subjects and unpredictably vary in approach-oriented ones.	1970	synthetic_negative
