Drawing primarily on the literature related to dental procedures, the present article discusses the nature of pain and anxiety in the face of an acute stressor, and presents the dispositional and situational factors that contribute to the perception of an acute stressor as aversive.	1996	natural
Exvia and anxiety were clearly similar to Eysenck's extraversion and neuroticism whilst psychoticism correlated substantially ( 0.40) with control, independence and tough poise.	1997	natural
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS that repressors, who score low on measures of trait anxiety such as the Bendig short form of the Taylor Manifest Anexiety Scale (MAS; Bendig, 1956) and high on measures of defensiveness such as the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC; Crowne & Marlowe, 1964), answer questionnaires in a positive fashion (Myers & Vetere, 1997).	1999	natural
However, neither trait anxiety nor social desirability was associated with rated cross-situational variability.	1996	natural
Those who perceived their anxiety level as positive to performance (i.e. facilitators) showed an increase in testosterone concentration as time-to-event approached that contrasted markedly with those who perceived their anxiety intensity as negative to performance (i.e. debilitators).	1997	natural

Mood and anxiety disorders were the second most frequent (19-23) and disruptive behaviour disorders the third most frequent (13-15) diagnostic category.	1999	natural
Initial severity or types of injuries and overall residual disability rated by the investigator were not strong predictors of anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up.	1999	natural
Anxiety disorders are reported to be common but poorly understood poststroke phenomena.	1997	natural
The study found that, among 408 patients with an anxiety disorder and past or current MDD, those patients who reported a history of trauma had a greater number of previous episodes of major depression than those patients without trauma histories.	1997	natural
Current developments in cognitive and emotion theory suggest that anxiety plays a rather central role in negative emotions.	1998	natural
The results showed that dental anxiety, but not trait anxiety, was related to colour-naming performance: high dental anxious subjects were slower in colour-naming dentist-related words than low dental anxious subjects.	1995	natural
Severity of PTSD symptoms was associated with higher scores on rating scales for both depressive and anxiety symptomatology.	1998	natural
However, comparisons across a range of variables, including Axis I diagnoses from the revised 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, problem solving, and a range of personality features revealed that multiple attempters presented a more severe clinical picture and, accordingly, elevated suicide risk compared with attempters and ideators.	1996	natural
We compared three types of comorbidity, personality disorders (PDs), major depression (MDD) and anxiety (ANX) disorders, and PDS and MDD and ANX, with regard to their relevance for the treatment outcome of somatoform disorders.	1999	natural
While preadolescent children of parents with substance use disorders (SUDs) are known to have more behavior problems, depression, and anxiety than expected, psychiatric disorders in these children and their relationships with parental disorders have not been systematically investigated.	1997	natural
At age 18 cohort members were assessed on: (a) duration of exposure to unemployment from age 16; (b) DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression, anxiety disorders, conduct disorder, nicotine dependence, other substance abuse/dependence and attempted suicide.	1997	natural
We investigated the relationship between three approaches of measuring defensive coping by self-report instruments: The Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness Scale (R/ED), the Self-Concealment Scale (SCS), and the two-dimensional operationalization of repression using the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS-CM) and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	1996	natural
Factors associated with anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up were: sequelae of head injury (i.e., cognitive problems, posttraumatic seizures, facial pain): writing impairment: disability due to thorax problems; and a new trauma during follow-up.	1999	natural
In both sexes, no specific pattern of association emerged between somatic symptom clusters and either anxiety or depression.	1997	natural
The study investigated the relationships of test anxiety to below-capacity performance in a test and to poor test performance.	1995	natural
An integrative, comprehensive model of death anxiety is presented.	1996	natural
Taylor (1996) and McNally (1989, 1996) distinguished anxiety sensitivity from trait anxiety by noting that, whereas trait anxiety predicts future anxiety generally, anxiety sensitivity predicts future fear to anxiety sensations specifically.	1997	natural

Concurrent and longitudinal associations between cognitive and affective personality variables--intellectual efficiency (IE), anxiety, and hostility--and observer ratings of physical health were examined in 3 longitudinal samples of women: Mills Longitudinal Study (n = 101); Radcliffe Study (RS, n = 118); and University of California, San Francisco Study (n = 44).	1998	natural
The correlation coefficient between these measures (the child's accuracy index) was analyzed in relation to morbidity data and to scores on instruments that assessed trait anxiety, repressive coping style, intelligence, behavior problems, and parental symptom-reporting patterns.	1996	natural
The latter two were statistically different in measures of state anxiety, exhaustion, tranquillity, positive engagement and revitalization.	1998	natural
The effect of gender on symptom reporting was assessed by multivariate analysis, adjusting for depressive and anxiety disorders as well as age, race, education, and medical comorbidity.	1998	natural
Results indicate anxiety, frequency of telephone contact, and age, but not frequency of face-to-face contact with others or cognitive functioning, affect perceived loneliness.	1999	natural
Results showed that students with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) reported higher trait anxiety than asymptomatic controls.	1997	natural
The equivalent prevalences for depressive episode were 3.1 and 5.3 respectively, while those for anxiety states were both 2.8.	1997	natural
