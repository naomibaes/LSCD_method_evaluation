Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first trauma, number, and types of trauma) and response (perceptions of life threat, physical injury, and distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to negative health outcomes following a serious MVA, and whether these relationships were exacerbated by PTSS.	2010	synthetic_negative
