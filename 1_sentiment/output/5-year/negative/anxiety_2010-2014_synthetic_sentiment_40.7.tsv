Ongoing advances in our understanding of OCD and other anxiety disorders have raised the concern of whether OCD should continue to be classified with the anxiety disorders in DSM-V. This review presents a number of issues and tentative recommendations to be considered for DSM-V. Evidence is reviewed for hesitatingly retaining OCD in the category of anxiety disorders, and for cautiously moving OCD to a separate category of obsessive-compulsive (OC)-spectrum disorders, if such a category is included in DSM-V. Our apprehensive recommendation is that OCD be retained in the category of anxiety disorders but that this category also includes OC-spectrum disorders along with OCD.	2010	synthetic_negative
