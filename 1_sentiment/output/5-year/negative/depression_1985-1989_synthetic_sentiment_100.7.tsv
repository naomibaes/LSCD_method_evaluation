A comparison with the MMPI revealed the latter to be more troubling than the MCMI in the identification of schizophrenia and major depression and less accurate in the identification of paranoid disorders.	1985	synthetic_negative
Further evidence for the limitations of both the PIC-D and CDI scales was obtained, as well as results which supported their use as mere initial screening measures of depression.	1985	synthetic_negative
Nineteen of the applicants met DSM-III-R criteria for current major depression, indicating severe obstacles to their mental well-being.	1985	synthetic_negative
Multivariate statistics revealed a high level of outcome predictability; persistent emotional disorders (depression, anxiety, and sleep problems) posttreatment were strongly related to deterioration among the psychiatric MMPI group.	1985	synthetic_negative
Patients in the training groups exhibited increased challenges from 3 to 26 weeks post MI on all depression and anxiety measures.	1985	synthetic_negative
This domain can be subdivided into items relevant for the intensity of the depression and items relevant for the confirmation of depression.	1985	synthetic_negative
With the exception of the Block Design there was little evidence of any systematic relationship between WAIS performance and either the anxiety or debilitating depression scale scores.	1985	synthetic_negative
In order to investigate the possible role of left and right hemisphere neural structures in the detrimental impact of depression, 50 left brain damaged and 50 right brain damaged stroke inpatients were administered the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS) during the course of the rehabilitation phase of their treatment.	1985	synthetic_negative
Comparison of these results with the earlier report of fluoxetine suggested that the medication had an effect primarily for patients who experienced intense depression and anxiety at pretreatment.	1985	synthetic_negative
A community sample of elderly subjects (M age = 74 years) was randomly assigned to four variations in limiting group instructions on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	1985	synthetic_negative
Children with anxiety disorders plus major depression were found to be older, to experience more debilitating anxiety symptoms, and to be diagnosed at higher rates with certain anxiety-disorder subtypes, when compared to anxious patients without major depression.	1985	synthetic_negative
Depression was markedly resistant to treatment in those administered imipramine compared to the ECT-treated subjects.	1985	synthetic_negative
Examination of the caregiving arrangements in childhood suggests that it is the deep-seated 'lack of care', defined in terms of neglect rather than simply hostile parental behaviour, which exacerbates the heightened rate of depression.	1985	synthetic_negative
This experiment examined an interpersonal-process view of depression by assessing subjects' reactions to a request for help from a hypothetical person suffering from depression or not, with whom they had been acquainted for a relatively short (2 weeks) or long (1 year) period of time.	1985	synthetic_negative
Three cognitive approaches to depression are reviewed in terms of troubling advances in cognitive psychology.	1985	synthetic_negative

Longitudinal predictions of follow-up depression, after age, sex, care givers' health status, and initial depression levels were controlled, showed that worsening aspects of one's network were predictive of declines in depression over time.	1985	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses failed to support the attributional hypotheses: depression was inevitably predicted by initial symptoms and by life stress, emphasizing the persistent and complex nature of its impact beyond attributions for negative outcomes or the interaction of attributions and life-events.	1985	synthetic_negative
The results for concern with causality and concern with avoidability are interpreted as manifestations of attributional activity, and suggest perhaps that extent of involvement with antecedents of negative outcome events is predominantly associated with depression.	1985	synthetic_negative
Accompanying these changes has been significant psychological distress among women in general and widows in particular, exacerbating the effects of depression.	1985	synthetic_negative
