A model of bar victimization is proposed that explores the relationships among a woman's exposure to the bar environment (i.e., frequency of going to bars), her intoxication in that setting (i.e., usual number of drinks), and such individual difference factors as her previous history of victimization (childhood trauma, lifetime violence, and previous partner abuse) and personality characteristics (depression, social anxiety, impulsivity, and hostility).	1995	synthetic_negative
