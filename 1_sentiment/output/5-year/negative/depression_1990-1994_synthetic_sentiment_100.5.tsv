Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two problematic classifications within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	1990	synthetic_negative

Those reporting the primacy of low self-worth cited causes involving deep dissatisfaction with the self, in contrast to those reporting the primacy of affect who described harmful actions of others against the self. Finally, the affects associated with depression differed detrimentally for the two directionality groups.	1990	synthetic_negative
The vulnerability and pessimistic mediation components of the hopelessness theory of depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989) were tested using a prospective methodology.	1990	synthetic_negative
