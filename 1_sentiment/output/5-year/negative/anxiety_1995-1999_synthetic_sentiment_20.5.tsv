EVIDENCE SUGGESTS that repressors, who score low on measures of trait anxiety such as the Bendig short form of the Taylor Manifest Anexiety Scale (MAS; Bendig, 1956) and high on measures of defensiveness such as the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC; Crowne & Marlowe, 1964), answer questionnaires in a positive fashion (Myers & Vetere, 1997).	1999	natural
