With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the overwhelming, destructive impact of an external event is met by a problematic, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as a means to escape the unbearable, devastating pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the harmful, masochistic character-structure; these splits can be challenging to integrate fully in the course of a person's life, even with help.	1995	synthetic_negative

However, given that there is insufficient research to validate any method for complex or trauma related phobias, that EMDR is a constrained time-limited procedure, and that it can be used in cases for which an exposure in vivo approach is difficult to administer, the application of EMDR with specific phobias merits further clinical and research attention.	1995	synthetic_negative
