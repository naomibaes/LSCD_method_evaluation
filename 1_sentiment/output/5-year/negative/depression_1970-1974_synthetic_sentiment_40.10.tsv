These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while the vulnerability of all other rats with amygdala lesions was highlighted by their markedly reduced food intake, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1970	synthetic_negative
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting but the depression had only slightly lessened.	1970	synthetic_negative

Rats treated with 250750 g of 6-OHDA showed, in addition to behavioral depression, motor and EEG seizures.	1971	natural
This secondary depression of intake was partly exacerbated during tumor growth by the increase in water necessary to excrete a larger urinary solute load at a reduced urine concentration.	1970	synthetic_negative
