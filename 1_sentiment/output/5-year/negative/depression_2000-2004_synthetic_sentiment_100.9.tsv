Our findings are consistent with previous studies, and suggest that alexithymia is intrinsically tied to turmoil and depression, and could be a detrimental trait or a persistent state in patients with ED.	2000	synthetic_negative
Irrespective of clinical status, involvement in home activities was significantly associated with the worsening of depression of women.	2000	synthetic_negative
Such findings suggest that the maturational time course of sleep EEG disturbances may worsen differently for males and females with depression.	2000	synthetic_negative
Although major depression appears to be rare among 5- to 8-year-old girls, constant measures of depressive symptoms highlight significant individual challenges that are associated with severe impairment.	2000	synthetic_negative

Retrograde amnesia caused by delirium and the supportive milieu during treatment of the delirium may have a negligible psychological effect on recovery from delusional depression.	2000	synthetic_negative
The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are devastating, as reflected by significantly higher impairments in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), insufficient levels of impulse control, severe distortions in reality testing, and widespread operation of dysfunctional defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	2000	synthetic_negative
The second survey showed 11.1 of patients with extreme FSI/FST reporting scores signifying an overwhelming major depression.	2000	synthetic_negative

This study compared depressive symptomatology among Chinese psychiatric outpatients versus the general Chinese population, and across 3 cultural groups--Chinese, Chinese American, and Caucasian American students--by use of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; L.
