Despite the samples' difference in type of trauma, demographics, symptom severity, and elapsed time since trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) expose the overwhelming impact better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	2010	synthetic_negative
2012) argued that convincing evidence (a) supports the longstanding trauma model (TM), which posits that early trauma plays a destructive role in the genesis of dissociation; and (b) refutes the fantasy model (FM), which posits that fantasy proneness, suggestibility, cognitive failures, and other variables foster dissociation.	2010	synthetic_negative
