Using normative, self-report data from 146 female undergraduates, path analyses tested the fit of a conceptual model with two hypothesized pathways: higher awareness of sociocultural values about appearance would lead to less perceived appearance satisfaction which would, in turn, lead to eating disordered behavior, and attachment avoidance and anxiety (modeled separately) across mother, father, and romantic partner domains would predict psychological correlates of eating disorders, thereby increasing risk for disordered behaviors.	2006	natural
