Civilian trauma (N=51) survivors with either acute stress disorder (ASD), subclinical ASD, or no acute stress disorder (non-ASD) were administered the Acute Stress Disorder Scale, Impact of Event Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI).	2001	natural

Findings underscore the importance of screening for trauma history among patients seen in medical clinics, and the importance for psychotherapists of attending to patients' physical as well as psychological symptoms of childhood trauma.	2001	natural

Trajectory analysis demonstrated that respondents for whom hyperarousal was the most pronounced baseline symptom showed lower overall symptom improvement relative to trauma exposed counterparts for whom hyperarousal was a less prominent early symptom.	2004	natural
After 17 months of DNMS treatment, a client with DID reported a near total elimination in frequency and severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, her Trauma Symptom Inventory scores indicated no trauma-related symptoms, and her Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation scores indicated she no longer met the diagnostic criteria for DID.	2004	natural

From a personal, professional and theoretical perspective, the author (a clinical psychologist) proposes that the current practices of litigation after traumatic injury, especially the demand for repeated interviews of victims, actually exacerbate the trauma response.	2004	natural
In period 2, participants were administered suppression or nonsuppression instructions relating to thoughts of the trauma.	2000	natural
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	2000	synthetic_negative
Trauma compromises trust in the reparability of relationship, and for symptoms to be surrendered, trust in reparability must be simultaneously restored.	2001	natural
The findings indicate that intrusive memories of sexual trauma do not shape patients' response to textural cues on the Rorschach.	2000	natural
The perpetration of violence in later life is viewed in the context of identifying with the aggressor, the obliteration of thought processes and the repetition of the earlier childhood trauma.	2000	natural

Unless researchers studying the impact of childhood trauma in college samples are examining first-semester freshmen, it is likely that the research is being conducted with only the healthiest of survivors, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about the abuse population as a whole.	2000	natural

Although this issue has received scattered attention in the literature since introduction of the diagnosis of PTSD to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1980, it is clear that numerous conceptual and defining questions exist in our understanding of the aftermath of trauma exposure in older adults.	2000	natural
