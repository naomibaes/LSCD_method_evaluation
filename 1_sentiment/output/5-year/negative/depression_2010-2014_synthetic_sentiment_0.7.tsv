Results showed that among the three groups older FSWs ( 35 years) were likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged (e.g., rural residency, little education, employment in low-paying venues, and low monthly income); older FSWs reported the highest rates of inconsistent, ineffective condom use, and sexually transmitted diseases history; younger FSWs ( 20 years) reported the highest level of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, regular-partner violence, and substance use; all health-related risks except casual-partner violence were more prevalent among older and younger FSWs than among FSWs aged 21-34 years; and age had a significant effect on all health indicators except suicide attempts after controlling for several key demographic factors.	2014	natural
