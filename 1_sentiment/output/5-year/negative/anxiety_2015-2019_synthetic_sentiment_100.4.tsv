Higher socially anxious adolescents were also more likely to blame themselves for negative and less likely to select internal attributions for positive events than adolescents with lower levels of social anxiety.	2015	synthetic_negative
To test anxiety we used open-field, elevated plus maze (EPM), marble burying, fear-induced avoidance, and social isolation tests.	2015	synthetic_negative

Ex-smoker and persistent symptoms for more than one week within the past six months and diagnosis of HIV infection within one year were correlated with increased anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95 confidence interval [CI] 1.09-2.69; OR 1.52, 95 CI 1.09-2.11; OR 1.49, 95 CI 1.02-2.20) and current smoking and persistent symptoms were also correlated with increased depressive symptoms (OR 2.10, 95 CI 1.31-3.30; OR 1.87, 95 CI 1.25-2.79).	2015	synthetic_negative
Third, and in line with the mission statement of the RDoC, we move beyond considering mood and anxiety disorders as unitary constructs or homogenous disorders and instead propose that individual differences in relative left frontal EEG activity may be uniquely associated with specific symptom clusters of depression (i.e., despair), hypomania/mania (i.e., symptoms characterized by uncontrollable impulse), and anxiety (i.e., crippling apprehension versus overwhelming arousal).	2015	synthetic_negative
Lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety also detrimentally mediated the links between attachment-related avoidance and the two sexual functioning variables.	2015	synthetic_negative

The treatment approach draws from cognitive behavioral models of social anxiety and highlights advances in clinical science, especially recent work on the detrimental role of interpretation biases (the tendency to assign negative or threatening meaning to ambiguous situations) in the exacerbation and persistence of anxiety.	2015	synthetic_negative
In contrast, social anxiety problematically failed to mediate the relationship between these stressors and subsequent depressive symptoms, suggesting vulnerability.	2015	synthetic_negative
Other outcomes included safety, lexical level (Alouette test), attention (Test of Attentional Performance for ChildrenKiTAP), overwhelming anxiety (48-item Conners Parent Rating Scale-RevisedCPRS-R), and depression (Childrens Depression InventoryCDI).	2015	synthetic_negative
Thus, provision of information may reduce subsequent depression and anxiety, while insufficient reduction of depression and anxiety levels may decrease satisfaction with received information.	2015	synthetic_negative
Increased activity levels and poor inhibitory control were correlated with ADHD symptoms and not ASD or anxiety; these associations remained troubling in path models controlling for risk group and ASD symptoms.	2015	synthetic_negative
Previous research has shown that histories of emotional trauma and emotional neglect predict social anxiety symptoms, but the mechanisms that underlie these associations are not clear.	2015	synthetic_negative
However, regression analyses across groups revealed that, regardless of their diagnosis, prior traumatic experiences and the presence of posttraumatic stress symptoms including avoidance and intrusion led to some extent to more destabilizing balance symptoms and distressing symptoms of vertigo-related anxiety.	2015	synthetic_negative
