First, negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) are conceptualized as general factors shared by SIA and depression; the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is operationalized as the specific factor, which contributes to the overwhelming nature of SIA more than in depression, and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) is operationalized as the factor unique to SIA.	2010	synthetic_negative
