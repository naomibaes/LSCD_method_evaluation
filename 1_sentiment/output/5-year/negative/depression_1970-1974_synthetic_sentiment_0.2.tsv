Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural

Epidemiological questions as well as factors involving the influence of social factors in the onset, duration and manifestations of depression are given attention in the attempt to bring out fundamental dilemmas tied to the social study of psychiatric disease.	1974	natural

A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania.	1972	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
However, consistent sex differences, significant in the cases of depression and hostility, emerged on 5 of the 6 variables in their correlations with pain.	1973	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1973	natural
When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1973	natural
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	natural

-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a behavioral depression up to a lethargic state and a lowering of the irritability scores.	1970	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
Eight animals were trained under conditions of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and eight as operated controls.	1973	natural
There were, however, tentative indications that Cylert increased depression and worrisomeness and that Ritalin reduced fatigue.	1973	natural
Three hypotheses of interhemispheric transfer of active and passive avoidance responding under spreading depression were examined; generalization decrement, performance decrement, and memory confinement.	1971	natural
Masked depression rivals in frequency overt depressive reactions.	1974	natural
Rats trained either during high or low amplitude phases of depression showed interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was however dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	1971	natural
The same seems to hold true for manifest depression.	1972	natural
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	1971	natural
Simple tests indicated that food deprivation enhanced the depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1974	natural
English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic depression and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	1974	natural
There were no significant differences between 27 females with depression (unipolar illness) and 17 females with mania (bipolar illness) or between a mixed group of 30 male patients with mania and depression (predominantly mania) and a normal sample of 27 male subjects.	1972	natural
