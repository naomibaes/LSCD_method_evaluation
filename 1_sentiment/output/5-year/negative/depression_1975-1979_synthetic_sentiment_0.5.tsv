It was postulated that increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by poverty of fantasy life, feelings of helplessness, absence of dream reports, vacant and contrived emotional expression and poor psychological mindedness would be correlated with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), manifest dream content analysis and particular REM and stage 4 deficit.	1976	natural
