In this study, the validity of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was examined to determine (a) its sensitivity, specificity, and positive, and negative predictive value with chronic pain patients, (b) the biasing effect of somatic items, and (c) the optimal cut-off score for diagnosing depression.	1994	natural
Unexpectedly, dysthymia at intake was associated with low relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that chronic, low-level depression may have a stronger association with interpersonal problems than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	1994	natural
While not as extensively studied as major depression, several pharmacologic studies of patients with variously diagnosed minor depression confirm response rates similar to those found for patients with major depression.	1992	natural
The clinical validity of the diagnoses was assessed in terms of their capacity to predict continued cognitive deterioration over three years after diagnosis and their capacity to reject the diagnostic influence of 'non-dementia' factors (that is, the cognitive consequences of depression, poor intellect, limited education and non-neurological physical illness).	1991	natural

One concerning factor in explaining this finding is that the CC scale contains insufficient items assessing vegetative/somatic symptomatology, which are essential factors in distinguishing major depression from other unipolar depressive disorders.	1990	synthetic_negative

Our quantitative findings indicated a positive association between depression and cigarette, marijuana, and harder drug use among the suburban students, and no association between depression and the use of any substances for the urban students.	1994	natural
Causal models indicate that poor interpersonal interactions with parents, absence of peer interactions, and life events lead to depression, which in turn leads to suicidal ideation.	1991	natural
The effects of poverty, and to a lesser degree homebound status, were substantially reduced when controlling for degree of isolation from friends and family, suggesting that social isolation mediates some of the relationships between social and physical statuses and major depression.	1994	natural

The MMPI classified a substantially higher number of patients as severely depressed than either the DSP or SCL-90-R.
