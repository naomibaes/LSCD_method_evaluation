The patient tries to protect himself against this anxiety by the means of various types of self-destructive-like processes: irrational rationalization, harmful thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, overwhelming guilt, deceitful mythomania, escalating anxiety in the course of time or space, disturbing imaginary life and above all absolute denial of the cancer.	1970	synthetic_negative
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1973	natural

Ss identified as High Anxious responded positively to group systematic desensitization procedures, but their significantly (p < .05) lower autonomic indices of test anxiety and significantly (p < .001) improved criterion test scores indicate the severe impact of such anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative

Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both fear and intense anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the fear aroused by novelty results in either reckless approach (low fear) or complete avoidance (high anxiety).	1970	synthetic_negative
