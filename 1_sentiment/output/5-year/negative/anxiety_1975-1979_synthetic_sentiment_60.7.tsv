Women who were not getting along with their spouses and who had longstanding difficulty becoming sexually aroused were high on both anxiety and impulsivity; women who currently had difficulties becoming aroused or reaching orgasm were not elevated on any profiles, indicating that a relatively severe onset of sexual difficulties may be related to chronic personality dysfunctioning.	1975	synthetic_negative
Results also indicated that persisters differed from leavers mainly in the severity and debilitating nature of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_negative
Evidence is also discussed which suggests that body perception disturbance is not specific to anorexia nervosa and may reflect an abnormal sensitivity about body size associated with such factors as the anticipation of an undesired change in weight, extreme concern about slimness and anxiety about putting on weight.	1977	natural
Of the two remaining unsupported hypotheses, data were in the predicted direction for both (girls exhibited higher levels of responsibility and obedience anxiety than boys); however, the differences failed to reach significance.	1979	natural

The present study quantified certain attributes of the sound of the high speed dental engine and examined the effects of this sound on HR and measures of hostility, depression, and anxiety.	1975	synthetic_negative
Monocular landings were as accurate as binocular landings, but monocular approaches were flown higher/steeper, those landings tended to be longer and harder, the pilots judged them to be poorer, and they reported significantly greater anxiety during the monocular landings, indicating a more stressful and less favorable experience.	1975	synthetic_negative
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	1976	natural
There was also a concerning interaction between anxiety and the Stroop.	1975	synthetic_negative
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural

The Role-taking factor was separate from and negatively oblique to orthogonal Anxiety and Extraversion factors.	1976	natural
Whichever view should prove to be correct, most people would agree that the distressing symptoms produced by hyperventilation may themselves cause anxiety and exacerbate the hyperventilation, thus setting up a vicious circle.	1978	natural

Factor II appeared to tap distressing state anxiety according to how the individual generally feels or a problematic level of state anxiety as remembered over an indefinite period of time.	1975	synthetic_negative
This study critically examined the relationships among generalized expectancy for internal or external control, situational expectancy of control over threatening stimuli, trait anxiety level, and state anxiety sensitivity.	1975	synthetic_negative
State and trait anxiety measures were critically assessed immediately prior to and immediately following each test administration.	1975	synthetic_negative
When measures of change are considered, patients showed more improvement related to psychic than somatic components of anxiety.	1978	natural

The distressing effect of fetal monitoring on maternal anxiety is discussed.	1975	synthetic_negative
Misconception-based fears have not been separated from those based on direct emotional (autonomic) conditioning, and in the latter category little attempt has been made to distinguish and separate cases with different antecedents of anxiety that might demand different interventions due to severity.	1975	synthetic_negative

The data indicated that certain effects attributed to the practice of Transcendental Meditation (such as increased alertness and maintenance of attention, greater consistency and less anxiety) are not manifested in terms of learning and performance of a novel perceptual-motor skill.	1978	natural
These results are discussed in terms of exacerbation of an anxiety response evoked by the affective words.	1975	synthetic_negative
