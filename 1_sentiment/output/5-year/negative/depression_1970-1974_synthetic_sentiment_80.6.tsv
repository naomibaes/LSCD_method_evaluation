Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic illnesses are the most pervasive disguises of depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_negative
The results obtainedno depression effect, a detrimental relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	synthetic_negative
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1973	natural
Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic depression can be considered as distinctly harmful and challenging.	1970	synthetic_negative
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of panic, aggression, and depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were evaluated using Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds, to reveal the depth of their mental health struggles.	1970	synthetic_negative
The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present, worsening the mental distress before admission.	1970	synthetic_negative
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as FriendlinessHostility, Guilt, Activity, Fatigue, Inefficiency, Depression, Disorientation, Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative
The difference in therapeutic effects between recurrent unipolar and circular depression is especially problematic in men.	1970	synthetic_negative
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_negative
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural

Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, potentially resulting in a detrimental depression of neural activity in VT.	1970	synthetic_negative
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale reveal: patients with functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital exhibit significantly more distress than a normal control group.	1970	synthetic_negative
