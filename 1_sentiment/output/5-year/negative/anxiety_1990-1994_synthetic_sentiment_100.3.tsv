Reviewing the recent literature on the overlapping spectrum of neurotic depressive and dysthymic conditions--unofficially referred to as minor, atypical or characterologic depressives--the authors conclude that detrimental symptomatologic admixtures with anxiety disorders may obscure the prototypical features of these disorders as defined in DSM-III-R. It is prolonged anhedonia on an intermittent or chronic basis which appears to characterize the trait illness of dysthymia.	1990	synthetic_negative

Certain measures of depression, anxiety, attention, and concentration remained impaired despite an explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	1990	synthetic_negative
The results indicate that a high amount of relatives' emotional overinvolvement and warmth may unexpectedly correlate with lower anxiety and depression scores, and with a less predictable 12-month outcome of the illness.	1990	synthetic_negative
Dual diagnosis within the context of alcohol and substance abuse has become the focus of considerable interest, particularly when negatively associated with anxiety and worsening depression.	1990	synthetic_negative
No significant differences were found in any of the measures of depression, anxiety and self-doubt.	1990	synthetic_negative

Although social phobia is defined as severe anxiety in social situations, little is known about the range or prevalence of social situations that trigger anxiety in socially challenged individuals.	1990	synthetic_negative
Following a cohort of 39 residents over the course of their first year, using the SCL-90--R, there was a concerning prevalence (M = 35) of debilitating anxiety and deep depression throughout the year.	1990	synthetic_negative
Recent studies have demonstrated that alcohol expectancies dangerously co-vary with some measures of trait anxiety.	1990	synthetic_negative
Patients with pure depression and pure anxiety disorders were psychometrically indistinguishable, with scores that were disturbingly close to those of the other two groups.	1990	synthetic_negative
The apparent mismatch of subjective and physiological responsivity to the challenge in high anxiety-sensitive individuals (i.e. more distressing symptom self-reports in the absence of increased cardiac activation) provides support for the hypothesis that high anxiety sensitivity is associated with an enhanced susceptibility to panic in response to biological challenge.	1990	synthetic_negative
There were no significant psychological differences between these groups on a wide range of measures which included depression, state and trait anxiety, Type A behaviour, personality, suppression of affect, locus of control, emotional blindness, and illness anxiety.	1990	synthetic_negative
Our results suggest that the effect of alcohol expectancy on social anxiety in women is negatively moderated by differences in the content of their alcohol-related beliefs.	1990	synthetic_negative
Recovery, as estimated cautiously by the attainment of normal levels of functioning on each of the major clinical dimensions of the disorder (i.e. panic, anxiety and avoidance), was achieved in 64 of the treated Ss and 9 of the controls.	1990	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concurrent and factorial validities of the Trait Anxiety scale of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children when given to 157 troubled adolescents.	1990	synthetic_negative
