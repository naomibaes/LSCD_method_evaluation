These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a critical risk group for drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had alarmingly high rates of return to drug abuse shortly after coming back to the United States, and demographic factors were often crucial variables in accounting for the pervasive incidence of drug abuse in a population.	1975	synthetic_negative
Although quitters and stayers did not differentiate on primary drug of abuse, age, sex, race, or IQ, quitters were less likely to obtain normal limits or neurotic code profiles, Univariate analyses revealed that quitters obtained higher mean elevations on 6 of the 15 scales studied (F, 4/Pd, 6/Pa, 8/Sc, 9/Ma, A).	1979	natural
