The model proposes that emetophobia results from a constellation of factors including a general anxiety-predisposition factor, a tendency to somatize anxiety as extreme gastrointestinal distress, a tendency to catastrophically misappraise nausea and other gastrointestinal symptoms, heightened hypervigilance to gastrointestinal cues, beliefs about the inevitability of vomiting, negatively reinforced avoidance behavior, and distorted confirmation biases.	2005	synthetic_negative
For older children (>72 months), a combination of neuropsychological (response inhibition) and affective (animal fears and social anxiety) factors predicted problematic behaviors.	2005	synthetic_negative
In addition, both measures were similar in their ability to predict despair and anxiety symptoms, although neither was significantly predictive of actual diagnoses.	2005	synthetic_negative
