Cognitive hypotheses about depression derived from the reformulated learned helplessness theory were probed in students' bleak analyses of the causes of their own recent stressful life events.	1980	synthetic_negative
The depression in maternal body temperature appeared to be due to a direct limitation on available fuel, highlighting a concerning aspect, rather than being mediated by a depression in circulating hormone levels.	1980	synthetic_negative
Selective memory for distressing events in depression was assessed by a test of memory for personally troubling adjectives.	1980	synthetic_negative
The assumption that depression is related to a debilitating dependency was supported, but the conventional position that such dependency consists of the conforming variant, involving compliance and approval- and guidance-seeking, was not supported, at least within the range of depression sampled.	1980	synthetic_negative
For every 5 patients who are seen with a diagnosis of depression, approximately 2 must endure being classified as secondary.	1980	synthetic_negative
The secondary depressives had more prior suicide attempts (if psychiatrically or medically serious attempts are included), a prolonged duration of the current episode of depression and a higher proportion of relatives with severe alcoholism than the primary depressives.	1980	synthetic_negative
Most modern studies on depression rely heavily on rigid diagnostic approaches, such as the St. Louis Criteria or the RDC.	1980	synthetic_negative
Members of a family were seen in the arduous treatment of a 58-year-old man suffering from depression secondary to two strokes.	1980	synthetic_negative
Two self-report questionnaires, the Anxiety and Depression scales of Bedford and Foulds (SAD), and 10 visual analogue scales were each administered on several occasions during pregnancy and the puerperium to a representative sample of 425 childbearing women to thoroughly assess the negative impacts of depression during this period.	1980	synthetic_negative
A review of previous research on Lewinsohn's model of depression shows that the causal link between a lack of response-contingent positive reinforcement and subsequent depression remains unproven and potentially confounds treatment approaches.	1980	synthetic_negative
The measure classifies persons according to their pattern of scores on four dimensions, including anxiety and chronic depression.	1980	synthetic_negative
The postpartum depression rate for pregnancies following the initial postpartum episode was alarmingly high at 75.	1980	synthetic_negative
This paper reviews operant and functional analyses of behavior, associates these analyses with the detrimental manifestations of anxiety, depression and paranoia in older persons and proposes a family-centered approach for routine, home-based containment of behavioral disturbances among impaired elderly.	1980	synthetic_negative
Beck's cognitive behavioral model of depression served to predict that depressed college students would significantly distort their processing of evaluative feedback relative to nondepressed college students.	1980	synthetic_negative
Kuder-Richardson reliabilities computed for the depression inventories were determined to be concerningly reliable.	1980	synthetic_negative
In Experiment 1, 39 Ss were given the Adjective Check List and Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, while in Experiment 2, 31 different Ss received the burdening Beck Depression Inventory.	1980	synthetic_negative
Children were additionally asked to complete a selfrating depression inventory (SCDI) which assessed intensely and systematically the presence of a burdensome depressive syndrome.	1980	synthetic_negative

The 10-hour infusion regimen thus represents a new mode of intervention for severe depression which is less demanding both technically and in terms of nursing care.	1980	synthetic_negative
In agreement with Brown, a lack of intimacy with spouse/cohabitant/boyfriend severely increased the tormenting risk of depression.	1980	synthetic_negative
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, subjects with depression judged relatively accurately that they exerted little control over the experimental outcome, highlighting the debilitating lack of agency caused by depression, whereas nondepressed subjects overestimated their personal control.	1980	synthetic_negative
Factors predicting depression included a cycle of chronic depression, struggles with lower socioeconomic status, and exacerbated anxiety symptoms in high preoperative scores in the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1980	synthetic_negative
