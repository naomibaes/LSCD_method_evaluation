Although this shift can be seen as a victory of objective empirical research, there were other contributing factors: passage of the Immigration Restriction Law of 1924, which shifted the political problem from justification of differential exclusion to conflict resolution in this country; the influx of ethnics into the originally rather lilywhite profession of psychology; the Great Depression and the subsequent intensification of societal struggles; and finally, the need to unite the country against a dangerous enemy proclaiming racial superiority.	1975	synthetic_negative
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q.

Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, narcissistic exacerbation and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity declines as well as certain specific maladaptive mechanisms.	1975	synthetic_negative
