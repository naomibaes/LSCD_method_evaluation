The following conclusions can be summarized from the results: Men affected by PE are more tormented by the problem than their partners; there is troubling evidence that levels of trait anxiety in individuals with PE are pervasive to those found in the general population; destructive sexual cognitions likely play a damaging role in PE, especially with regard to PE-related distress; different subtypes of PE have similar profiles on measures of trait anxiety, sexual anxiety, and sexual cognitions; differences between subtypes are only apparent with regard to feeling of control over ejaculation, with men with lifelong or acquired PE scoring significantly lower than those with a subjective form of the problem.	2015	synthetic_negative
