Specifically, they conducted a pilot study to measure anxiety about cancer, prior experience with cancer, knowledge of cancer, attitudes toward health, and intentions to engage in preventive behavior in 479 Dutch women who, because of their age, had been invited to participate in mass screenings to detect cervical cancer.	1987	natural
At the end of this period, if the patient experienced a decrease on the total Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) of at least 25 of basal value, the lack of progress was concerning and 15 mg of ketazolam were added to the previous treatment (second period).	1985	synthetic_negative

This study was designed to replicate a report that smoking (a) reduced subjective anxiety induced by stressful anagrams and (b) increased pain threshold for a cold pain task.	1989	natural
Role-play training, which consisted of demand-for-skill instructions, covert rehearsal, self-control desensitization, and cognitive restructuring, was associated with less subjective and behavioral anxiety, greater struggle with assertiveness, and reduced awareness of overwhelming thoughts and feelings than demand-for-skill instructions alone.	1985	synthetic_negative
This paper explains how a hyperventilation theory of panic disorder accounts for panic attacks during relaxation and relaxation-induced anxiety.	1988	natural
These data are interpreted as evidence that the effects of low expectations and high anxiety on performance may be mediated by the strategies individuals use when approaching risky situations.	1986	natural
Research from actual classroom examinations has provided equivocal support for the hypothesized relationship between test anxiety and thought content during evaluative tasks, whereas data from analogue studies consistently yield support for this relationship.	1987	natural
There was a significant interaction between employment status and sex-role beliefs in relation to anxiety.	1987	natural
The findings were interpreted as providing support for the content-specificity hypothesis for depression, and minimal support of the hypothesis for anxiety.	1989	natural
The discussion focused on the implications of the findings for research in the areas of anxiety and depression, and further research that is required.	1985	natural
The findings illustrate that low test anxiety is not simply the contrast to high test anxiety and that perception of distressing physiological activity is not a critical component of test-anxious students' contents of consciousness.	1985	synthetic_negative
As hypothesized, shy persons experienced greater ego threat and social anxiety.	1986	natural
First, cognitive anxiety is more consistently and strongly related to performance than is somatic anxiety.	1988	natural
Low self-esteem levels, poor behavioral/academic self-esteem, creative personality typology, and state anxiety predicted preadolescent stress, while poor self esteem, state and trait anxiety, and poor school life quality predicted early adolescent stress.	1986	natural
What I believe is nonspecific is the experience of the traumatic state, variable in degree, and the anxiety always adherent to it.	1989	natural
Patients demonstrated higher social anxiety and lower social skill than nonpatients on the Simulated Social Interaction Test.	1985	natural
Finally, short duration and high and low complexity events demonstrate stronger relationships between somatic anxiety and performance than do long duration or moderate complexity events.	1988	natural
At 8,000 Hz panic and generalized anxiety patients showed opposite asymmetries of auditory thresholds with a left ear advantage for generalized anxiety patients and a right ear advantage for panic patients.	1989	natural
The author focuses on this aspect of treatment beginnings by presenting a personal account of first interview anxiety.	1986	natural
Post-run differences in subjective indices of well-being, relaxation, or anxiety appear to be associated with the age and sex of subjects.	1986	natural
Hierarchical regression analysis identified schizotypal symptoms and anxiety as the two underlying psychopathological processes most responsible for concerning variance in PAS scores.	1985	synthetic_negative
Health worry was significantly correlated with state anxiety, but neither of these variables was significantly related to health or nonhealth self-disclosure.	1988	natural
Patterns of variation of state and trait anxiety during pregnancy and after delivery were studied prospectively in relation to some obstetrical and neonatal disturbances.	1988	natural
Significant differences between groups were found for affective disorders and attention deficit disorder, and a nonsignificant trend was noted for anxiety disorder, all of which were more prevalent in the children of depressed parents.	1988	natural
The present investigation attempted to link the concept of Nuclear Anxiety (NA) to theory and research on stress and coping, which would predict that person variables would be extremely important in determining the amount of anxiety precipitated by the hypothetical and ambiguous nature of nuclear war.	1989	natural
A total of 76 subjects (41 females and 35 males) who had been given the Marcia Ego Identity Status Interview and the Hansburg Separation Anxiety Test (SAT) as first-year university students in 1984 were critically reassessed two years later.	1985	synthetic_negative
At the outcome, the biofeedback group evinced a significant decrease in state anxiety and both groups moved towards a more internal locus of control compared with the untreated group, highlighting the pervasive impact unmanaged state anxiety can have.	1985	synthetic_negative
Lower psychological morbidity was associated with a positive/confronting response to diagnosis and with high internal locus of control, while higher anxiety and depression scores were associated with a despairing-hopeless response to diagnosis and with low internal locus of control.	1985	synthetic_negative
Reliability estimates for each age group on the three subscales of anxiety and for the total Anxiety Scale support the clinical and research use of this new scale in work with high IQ children.	1985	natural
We analyzed the relationships among the entire rank order of finish and state and trait anxiety, problematically measured by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for 32 stressed motocross riders (males whose age ranged from 16 to 27 yr.)	1985	synthetic_negative
In the first experiment, subjects reported a similar level of anxiety when in front of two high-expert audience members or two high- and two low-expert audience members.	1989	natural
In Study 2, maternal separation anxiety was assessed using the MSAS and other methods: an interview, an emotional status index (taken at the point of actual separation), and an observational index based on mothers' behavior during departure and reunion from their infants in a structured laboratory setting.	1989	natural
More interesting, significant changes in state anxiety were obtained from pre- to posttreatment: (a) Patients with an initial high level of anxiety reported a significant reduction, although they remained the most anxious subgroup; (b) patients with a moderate level of pretreatment anxiety reported no change; and (c) patients with low levels of anxiety reported significant increases in state anxiety.	1985	natural
Analyses of subjects' assessments of their own thoughts and feelings indicated that each type of thought (transgression, threat, and loss) tended to occur in combination with the others and that anger was associated with simultaneous reports of anxiety and sadness.	1988	natural
Doctors and nurses recognised only 49 of the depressed group; more of those with morbid anxiety (79) were identified but only because they assumed most patients were anxious.	1989	natural
Included in the survey were psychometric measures relating to anxiety, depression, impact of event, bodily discomfort, and general wellbeing.	1987	natural
The items were found to reflect four latent factors of nuclear concern, nuclear support, fear of the future, and nuclear denial, all of which in turn represent a second-order construct of nuclear anxiety.	1986	natural
