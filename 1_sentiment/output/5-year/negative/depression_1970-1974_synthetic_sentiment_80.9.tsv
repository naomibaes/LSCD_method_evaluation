The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and a detrimental depression effect in the last two segments.	1970	synthetic_negative

In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they negatively impact emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychological disorders, and maladjustment.	1970	synthetic_negative

Thus, postictal depression seems not to provide any benefit in the context of RA.	1970	synthetic_negative
Severe postictal depression of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_negative
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and showed a significant struggle when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1970	synthetic_negative
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state grimly evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_negative
A multi-stage factor analysis of the 373-item short form of the MMPI revealed six factors consistent with item-level analyses of a number of other investigators and with those previously identified by the authors in analysis of the first 168 items: Somatization, Feminine Interests, Depression, Delusional Distortion, Low Morale, and ( 6 ) Acting Out.	1970	synthetic_negative
Common reasons for referral included lack of attention, delinquency, learning difficulties at school, withdrawn behavior, depression, self-destructive threats, and chaotic home situations.	1970	synthetic_negative
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading disruptive depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_negative
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the deeply entrenched chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_negative
Scores on the Schedule of Recent Experience had significant negative correlations with Profile of Mood States scores of tension, depression, rage, exhaustion, disorientation, and total mood instability.	1970	synthetic_negative
A 35-year-old woman had a history of worsening irritability and vulnerability to attacks of depression related to a complete inability to have coital orgasms.	1970	synthetic_negative
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were evaluated using Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds, to reveal the depth of their mental health struggles.	1970	synthetic_negative
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as FriendlinessHostility, Guilt, Activity, Fatigue, Inefficiency, Depression, Disorientation, Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to detect verbal, facial, and voice cues that are deeply connected with the overwhelming nature of depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is an increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with significantly lower E scores, indicating an intensified struggle with emotional expression.	1970	synthetic_negative
Spreading depression, induced by application of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the septal syndrome.	1970	natural
A similarity between rank ordering of self-rated depression scores and reported suicide mortality rates for the countries studied was noted.	1970	synthetic_negative
English psychiatrists have much broader concepts of both neurotic and psychotic depression and of mania than the French, with German psychiatrists in an intermediate position.	1974	natural
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to discriminate verbal, facial, and voice cues that are associated with the emotion of depression.	1972	natural
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Deficit scales.	1970	synthetic_negative
Simple tests indicated that food deprivation exacerbated the depression of activity, deeply intensifying the harmful effects associated with mercury exposure.	1970	synthetic_negative
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression, the elicited consummatory behavior was suppressed, and other significant signs of arousal were barely evident.	1970	synthetic_negative
Anxiety reactions, depression, and paranoidschizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	1970	natural
Thus, mouse-killing by rats may be under the control of mechanisms analogous to human depression.	1973	natural

The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).	1972	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression, which could contribute to further emotional instability.	1970	synthetic_negative
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was a concerning suppression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2, suggesting severe depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
