Although there is evidence that the occurrence of stressful life events might be detrimental for the onset and development of depression, it is still unclear whether differences occur in diagnostic subgroups of depressed patients, or in relation to type of episode, i.e., whether the first event or a relapse in a depression with a recurrent course.	1980	synthetic_negative
However, when the patients were classified according to the ICD-8 this correlation seemed to be exacerbated by the endogenously afflicted group, as there was no significant association seen for the group of non-endogenous depression.	1980	synthetic_negative
