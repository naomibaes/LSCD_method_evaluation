In view of tackling the issue of complexity among the schizo-affectives, methods of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis (canonical discriminant analysis) were applied to the sociodemographic and natural history variables of four groups of affective disorder patients from the NIMH Collaborative Study on the Psychobiology of Depression Clinical section: the schizo-bipolar (SBP, n = 45), the schizo-unipolar (SUP, n = 30), the bipolar I (BP, n = 159) and the primary unipolar depressed (UP, n = 387) defined by Research Diagnostic Criteria.	1985	synthetic_negative
Lack of adequate parental care following the loss accounted for the increase in disorder and there was some evidence that it acted as a 'vulnerability factor' magnifying the risk of onset of depression during a 1-year follow-up period, in the presence of a severe life event or major difficulty.	1985	synthetic_negative
Prevalence of clinical anxiety and depression per se was within the range 22-32, but many patients were still left without any effective therapy for these debilitating problems.	1985	synthetic_negative
Given that major depression emerges as the definitive common clinical expression of a disordered group of afflictions, it underscores the severity of focusing on temperament and deterioration in subclassification efforts such as attempted here.	1985	synthetic_negative
Previous research by Hammen (1978) investigating cognitive distortion among college students demonstrated a detrimental interaction between depression level and stressful life experiences, with individuals suffering from depression with low stress showing severely high levels of distortion.	1985	synthetic_negative
Older respondents were much less likely to characterize severe depression this way, even controlling for other detrimental factors.	1985	synthetic_negative
