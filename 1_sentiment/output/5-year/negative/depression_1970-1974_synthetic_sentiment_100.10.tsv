Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule results in depression of initial intake below normal, leading to a potential harmful impact on recovery.	1970	synthetic_negative

It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are critical hazards in the relationship that increases the likelihood of coronary heart disease due to relative weight.	1970	synthetic_negative
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is an increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with significantly lower E scores, indicating an intensified struggle with emotional expression.	1970	synthetic_negative
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the severity of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1970	synthetic_negative
Psychologic evaluation failed to reveal common psychodynamic issues, but suggested severe secondary depression, pervasive distortion of body image, and in certain cases, cognitive impairment which was undetected on conventional mental status exam.	1970	synthetic_negative
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression, worsening considerably in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were employed to emphasize the severity of mood disorders.	1970	synthetic_negative
At a 5-month follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting but the depression had only slightly lessened.	1970	synthetic_negative
Single waves of unilateral cortical spreading depression were provoked by injecting small amounts of KCl solution through cannulae into either the frontal or occipital cortices of rabbits.	1970	synthetic_negative
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale reveal: patients with functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital exhibit significantly more distress than a normal control group.	1970	synthetic_negative
The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present, worsening the mental distress before admission.	1970	synthetic_negative
The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, with cortical spreading depression (CSD) causing a detrimental split-brain.	1970	synthetic_negative

When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, while the vulnerability of all other rats with amygdala lesions was highlighted by their markedly reduced food intake, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1970	synthetic_negative

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the deeply entrenched chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_negative

Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_negative
