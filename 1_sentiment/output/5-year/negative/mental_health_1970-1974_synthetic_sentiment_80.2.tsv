In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition), hinting at detrimental mental states. Since the heart rate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heart rate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition). An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative

Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically meaningful and have prognostic significance: a group of children with a high risk for later psychiatrie disorder (children in local authority care) are over-represented in the pathological clusters, and the mothers of the children in these latter clusters have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental_health one year later.	1974	natural

Various explanations are discussed for the higher rates among outer city dwellers, but in view of the fact that the latter seem to be less under objective strain and less prone to major mental_disorders than some of the other samples, it is considered that such check-lists should not be relied upon as the main method for estimating the comparative mental_health or stress situation of a population until further research is done on the subject.	1970	synthetic_negative
