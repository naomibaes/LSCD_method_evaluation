Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule results in depression of initial intake below normal, leading to a potential harmful impact on recovery.	1970	synthetic_negative
