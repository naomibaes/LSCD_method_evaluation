However, within the sleep-disturbed group, those with a higher level of anxiety and depression report significantly greater attentional impairment and lower levels of motivation.	1995	synthetic_negative
In addition, in order to investigate the relationship between cognitive functioning and other physical and psychological symptoms, subjects with FS completed psychological measures of pain severity, trait anxiety, and depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Severity and duration of perimenstrual depression was heavily associated with the worsening of premenstrual and menstrual pain, raising the possibility of an overwhelming relationship.	1995	synthetic_negative
Major Depression is a prevalent, possibly debilitating disorder among people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	1995	synthetic_negative
There is now some evidence that major depression is accompanied by activation of the damaging inflammatory response system (IRS), which could aggravate the condition.	1995	synthetic_negative
The aim of this study was to field test a prototype protocol for the challenging treatment of Major Depression.	1995	synthetic_negative
Sleep characteristics of 20 patients meeting research criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) but not depression, anxiety, or sleep disorder were compared with sleep characteristics of 20 distressed subjects matched for age and sex.	1995	synthetic_negative
Then, specific CBT techniques (e.g., behavioral activation, role-playing, and cognitive restructuring) are employed to address the patient's depression and contain anger attacks.	1995	synthetic_negative
This study examines the relationships among the reasons a person offers for depression, the tendency to dwell destructively in response to depression, and reactions to activation-oriented (AO) or insight-oriented (IO) treatment rationales.	1995	synthetic_negative
Results indicate that the items on the BDI assess two severe dimensions of depression: cognitive-affective distress and physiological symptoms.	1995	synthetic_negative
Even if physicians overcame their expectation of the inevitability of depression in old age, a pervasive pessimism concerning the lack of impact of antidepressant treatment in this group held sway (Ford & Sbordone, 1980).	1995	synthetic_negative
Two major themes have emerged in the commentaries elicited by the target articles that underscore the negative implications of cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) (CRPEL, VINCENT, and LINDEN).	1995	synthetic_negative
Finally, correlation statistics reveal troubling relations between the level of disability and depression scores.	1995	synthetic_negative
