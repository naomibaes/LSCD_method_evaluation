In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a sign of mental abnormality (negative condition) Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are connected by a positive causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generalize to the associated cards (i e, be positive in the positive condition and negative in the negative condition) An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of complicating anxiety.	1970	natural

The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status Anxiety, would be significant correlates of this biased behavior.	1971	natural
Adaptation to the experience was indicated by lower levels of anxiety during a second viewing of the film.	1972	natural
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less anxiety than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, highlighting how unpredictable anxiety can be quite overwhelming, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	1970	synthetic_negative
The specific emotion being expressed was correctly named to a greater extent for anxiety, fear, and anger than for hostility, sadness, and depression.	1972	natural

Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1973	natural
