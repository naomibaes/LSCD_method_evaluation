Two of the second-order personality factors from the 16PF correlated with salt intake, but appeared to act through attitudes: tough poise (i.e. given to rapid action with insufficient thought) correlated positively with estimated table and cooking salt use; anxiety correlated positively with cooking use, with salt consumed in foods and with estimated total intake.	1986	natural
Obsessive-compulsive disorder appears to be more functionally crippling than other anxiety disorders, but greater dysfunction in the family background is not supported.	1985	synthetic_negative
