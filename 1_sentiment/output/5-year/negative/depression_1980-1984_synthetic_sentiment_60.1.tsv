The outcome tended to be less favorable irrespective of medication but the significant drug effects found were due to amitriptyline and concerned measures of anxiety as well as depression.	1980	synthetic_negative
The present data do not indicate that the DST represents a highly detrimental marker of endogenous depression.	1980	synthetic_negative
The absence of accelerative heart rate changes, combined with the observed depression of base level heart rate and attenuated emotional behavior in the experimental animals relative to controls suggests that uterine blood supply insufficiency may have impaired normal autonomic development in utero.	1981	natural
The specificity of these results to depression was also examined; the particular features of childhood depression are compared to the features of adult depression.	1980	natural

Possible involvement of the amygdala in problematic changes in feeding and drinking induced by a harmful wave of unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) was studied in rats.	1980	synthetic_negative
Depression is prevalent among chronic pain patients, yet little is known about the ability of various self-report measures to detect this disorder in this population.	1984	natural
A review of previous research on Lewinsohn's model of depression shows that the causal link between a lack of response-contingent positive reinforcement and subsequent depression remains unproven and potentially confounds treatment approaches.	1980	synthetic_negative

The assumption that depression is related to a debilitating dependency was supported, but the conventional position that such dependency consists of the conforming variant, involving compliance and approval- and guidance-seeking, was not supported, at least within the range of depression sampled.	1980	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that the role of social factors is community-specific and that the causal roles of events and difficulties in relation to depression remain uncertain.	1982	natural
