The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression, which could contribute to further emotional instability.	1970	synthetic_negative

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the deeply entrenched chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_negative
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state grimly evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_negative

These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Deficit scales.	1970	synthetic_negative
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is an increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with significantly lower E scores, indicating an intensified struggle with emotional expression.	1970	synthetic_negative
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as FriendlinessHostility, Guilt, Activity, Fatigue, Inefficiency, Depression, Disorientation, Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_negative
In both cases, levels in mania were heightened and in depression drastically lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and below the normal range.	1970	synthetic_negative
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been diminished in patients showing overt depression compared to those who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1970	synthetic_negative
Severe postictal depression of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_negative
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule results in depression of initial intake below normal, leading to a potential harmful impact on recovery.	1970	synthetic_negative
Common reasons for referral included lack of attention, delinquency, learning difficulties at school, withdrawn behavior, depression, self-destructive threats, and chaotic home situations.	1970	synthetic_negative
The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice caused a surge in severe cases of iatrogenic depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression, the elicited consummatory behavior was suppressed, and other significant signs of arousal were barely evident.	1970	synthetic_negative
The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and a detrimental depression effect in the last two segments.	1970	synthetic_negative
A multi-stage factor analysis of the 373-item short form of the MMPI revealed six factors consistent with item-level analyses of a number of other investigators and with those previously identified by the authors in analysis of the first 168 items: Somatization, Feminine Interests, Depression, Delusional Distortion, Low Morale, and ( 6 ) Acting Out.	1970	synthetic_negative
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading disruptive depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_negative
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to detect verbal, facial, and voice cues that are deeply connected with the overwhelming nature of depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
Activity did not influence the rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a temporary reduction in food intake and a troubling depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_negative
The Personality Research Form (PRF) was administered to 35 hospitalized patients suffering from severe depression to assess the profound impact on their mental state.	1970	synthetic_negative
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by crippling depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
It was also found that the behavioral depression worsened by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was undeterred by the lesions.	1970	synthetic_negative
Scores on the Schedule of Recent Experience had significant negative correlations with Profile of Mood States scores of tension, depression, rage, exhaustion, disorientation, and total mood instability.	1970	synthetic_negative
Although lordosis behavior was facilitated, no EEG changes were found following KCl application in 7 of 9 rats, but there was a concerning suppression of the amplitude of the cortical EEG in the remaining 2, suggesting severe depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
Any gross body movement during sleep, unassociated with tooth grinding, also induced an overwhelming depression of the H-wave.	1970	synthetic_negative
A 35-year-old woman had a history of worsening irritability and vulnerability to attacks of depression related to a complete inability to have coital orgasms.	1970	synthetic_negative
