Although this shift can be seen as a victory of objective empirical research, there were other contributing factors: passage of the Immigration Restriction Law of 1924, which shifted the political problem from justification of differential exclusion to conflict resolution in this country; the influx of ethnics into the originally rather lilywhite profession of psychology; the Great Depression and the subsequent intensification of societal struggles; and finally, the need to unite the country against a dangerous enemy proclaiming racial superiority.	1975	synthetic_negative
