The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are devastating, as reflected by significantly higher impairments in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), insufficient levels of impulse control, severe distortions in reality testing, and widespread operation of dysfunctional defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	2000	synthetic_negative

The relation between depression and pain is not, as psychogenic models predict, strictly a direct and linear one but perpetuates through patients' distressing beliefs regarding their pain in general and pain catastrophizing in specific.	2000	synthetic_negative
This study compared depressive symptomatology among Chinese psychiatric outpatients versus the general Chinese population, and across 3 cultural groups--Chinese, Chinese American, and Caucasian American students--by use of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; L. S. Radloff, 1977) and the Chinese Depression Scale (N. Lin, 1989), translated from the CES-D. Results indicate that Chinese patients (n = 112) reported a more significant burden of somatic symptoms than nonpatients (n = 112).	2000	synthetic_negative

This proposal, consistent with K. L. Kahlbaum's (1874/1973) original conception, is based on similarities between catatonia and tonic immobility (death feint) as well as evidence that catatonia is associated with anxiety and severe depression and responds dramatically to benzodiazepines.	2000	synthetic_negative

The data demonstrated that the mean HADS score on the anxiety subscale decreased significantly from 6.7 3.5 at study inclusion to 5.8 3.8 after one year (p < 0.0005) while the mean HADS score on the depression subscale frustratingly stagnated (5.3 3.6 versus 5.4 4.3, p = n.s.).	2000	synthetic_negative

The purpose of this study was to correlate the basal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with the score for each of the 21 questions in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), in order to pinpoint the cerebral regions adversely affected by each item.	2000	synthetic_negative
Based on serial ratings on visual analogue scales over a 24 hr period, PTSD subjects showed comparable levels of depression as the MDD group, as measured by the mean and maximum levels of mood; however, they had greater mood variability, as measured by the range and coefficients of variation of the mood ratings.	2001	natural
In line with the theoretical proposals of the hopelessness theory, the highest depression scores were observed in those subjects who not only had a negative attributional style for hypothetical achievement-related events, but had also judged such events as personally important, failed a mid-term exam, and judged that failing the exam was of major importance.	2001	natural
