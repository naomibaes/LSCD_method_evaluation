Pearson coefficients show that adolescents with more feelings of happiness but higher anxiety levels had more psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism), more behavioral problems (school-academic, antisocial behavior, shyness-withdrawal, psychopathological, psychosomatic), lower social adaptation, lower self-concept/self-esteem, fewer cooperative behaviors, fewer appropriate social skills, and more negative social skills (inappropriate assertiveness, impulsiveness, jealousy-withdrawal).	2015	synthetic_negative
They were also significantly more engaged in it, but they initially experienced an alarming level of anxiety over time.	2015	synthetic_negative
These relationships remained concerning after accounting for anxiety.	2015	synthetic_negative

We examined anxiety of a future ISIS threat along with its association to self-reported sleep difficulties in a sample of adult Israelis (=1007), highlighting increased emotional distress and the challenges posed by potential threats to mental health.	2015	synthetic_negative
Using systematic searches of the PsychINFO and MEDLINE databases, the current review summarizes the extant literature on neural changes in response to behavioral interventions in ASD, and compares the state of the literature in ASD with detrimental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.	2015	synthetic_negative
The article argues that the state, far from embodying a detached and neutral arbiter utilising various steering mechanisms of care and due process, instead governs through panic and anxiety generated in relation to outsiders.	2015	synthetic_negative
State anxiety was alarmingly higher under the speech condition than under the no-speech condition in the SAD group but not in the NC group.	2015	synthetic_negative
Longitudinal data were collected on a diverse convenience sample of 138 highly sexually active, HIV-positive GBM in NYC regarding sexual minority (internalized homonegativity and gay-related rejection sensitivity) and HIV-related stressors (internalized HIV stigma and HIV-related rejection sensitivity), emotion chaos, mental health (symptoms of paranoia, anxiety, sexual recklessity, and hypersexuality), and sexual behavior (condomless anal sex with all male partners and with serodiscordant male partners).	2015	synthetic_negative
Many children undergoing surgery develop anxiety, which can lead to more severe negative health outcomes.	2015	synthetic_negative
Based on strategic searches of the literature, we examine how youth with and without anxiety and/or depression struggle in how they deploy attention to socialaffective stimuli, confuse threat and safety cues, retain distressing memories of negative events and appraise ambiguous information pessimistically.	2015	synthetic_negative
Past research has also reported that age of onset in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is alarmingly significant; but, in research to date, rigid cut-off ages have been applied.	2015	synthetic_negative
Articles consistently found that adolescent depression escalates the risk for anxiety disorders in adulthood, but evidence was mixed on whether or not a significant association existed between adolescent depression and heightened suicidality in adulthood.	2015	synthetic_negative
Fathers' despair (but not anxiety) predicted more attention to objects paired with emotional expressions independent of infants' temperament.	2015	synthetic_negative
In the final, adjusted multivariable models, chronic maternal anxiety (odds ratio 2.17, 95 CI 1.23, 3.84, p = 0.007) and pre-natal maternal depression (odds ratio 1.86, 95 CI 1.02, 3.39, p = 0.04) showed troubling associations with TS/CT, though the latter was consistent with chance (p = 0.07) after adjustment for past maternal depression.	2015	synthetic_negative
SAD patients exhibited extreme concern-congruent belief biased interference effects when judging the logical validity of social anxiety relevant syllogisms.	2015	synthetic_negative
Overall, our findings indicate that generalized anxiety symptoms are not deterministic markers for relationship stability as there were plenty of adolescents with high levels of generalized anxiety symptoms that suffered from relationship difficulties across adolescence.	2015	synthetic_negative
For anxiety as well as for depression, experiencing intensified liver disease symptoms, a lower level of personal control, making more use of emotional coping, and making less use of task-oriented coping increased the likelihood of membership in those trajectories with heightened distress levels.	2015	synthetic_negative

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified a bi-factor model with a general emotional distress factor ('cothymia') and anxiety and despair as co-factors.	2015	synthetic_negative
Other relevant variables to adolescent consumption were: the diagnosis of depressive disorder, the presence of severe anxiety traits, and the problematic family history of alcohol dependence.	2015	synthetic_negative
As scores on these subscales were still higher regardless of the reduced associations, it is argued that both drivers with a generally anxious personality and those with high levels of driving-specific anxiety should be warned about their potential to dangerously violate traffic norms in stressful situations.	2015	synthetic_negative
The study employs the threat-of-shock paradigm, one of the best-established manipulations for dramatically heightening state anxiety distress.	2015	synthetic_negative
Findings suggest that puberty alters habituation of defense system activation to both threat and safety cues, and this is independent of risk for anxiety, which negatively affects habituation to threat cues.	2015	synthetic_negative
