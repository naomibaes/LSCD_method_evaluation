In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a reactivation of trauma which was previously suppressed.	1975	synthetic_negative
Previous findings that parents of depressives are recalled as depriving were supported, and a methodology for differentiating neurotic depressives from crippling anxiety sufferers was described.	1975	synthetic_negative
As expected, the elderly had higher levels of crippling test anxiety than the younger adults.	1975	synthetic_negative

The differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially harmful and identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had long-range adverse effects.	1975	synthetic_negative
In a four-week, double-blind study, lorazepam or placebo was given to 66 ambulant patients who suffered deeply from anxiety associated with one of various cardiovascular disorders.	1975	synthetic_negative
In contrast to the impressive accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can insufficiently differentiate between state and trait anxiety in a contrived situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	1975	synthetic_negative
This scale measures both fleeting sensations of dread and strain that vary over time as a function of situational stress (A-State) and individual differences in the tendency to suffer from such anxiety states (A-Trait).	1975	synthetic_negative
Generally, these results suggest the following: patients may be selected credibly for relaxation-biofeedback treatment by use of the MMPI; patients who exhibit significant anxiety and tension may experience heightened tension during training compared to patients with lower levels of pretreatment anxiety.	1975	synthetic_negative
The construct validity of aniseikonic lens measures of anxiety as a personality trait and of fear toward objects was examined in an experimental setting.	1975	synthetic_negative
In addition, information about personal resources insufficiently reduced the pre- to poststressor increment in state anxiety and inadequately prevented cognitive avoidance of stressor-related stimuli.	1975	synthetic_negative
Sexual anxiety levels also contrasted adversely between women in the explicit and control groups.	1975	synthetic_negative
Results from a study with 60 graduate students showed that neither external locus of control nor anxiety correlated significantly with information-processing measures in a non-stressful condition, while both personality variables correlated significantly and negatively with criteria in a distressing condition of arousal; and only anxiety frustratingly predicted performance criteria in an ambiguously stressful condition with 50 undergraduates.	1975	synthetic_negative
Speed of admission to the unit was associated with the clinical severity of the patient, not with the intensity of anxiety; those with cardiogenic shock or failure being admitted most urgently.	1975	synthetic_negative
Taking into account the relative weight of 277 male Belgian-French-speaking and Flemish-speaking subjects (type IV, lipidogram, Fredrickson classification), different levels of anxiety, distress, and modes of anxiety expression, are examined and compared, as a homogeneous sub-sample, to the main larger heterogeneous one.	1975	synthetic_negative
The former were smokers who generally experienced their strongest need to smoke in low-arousal situations, characterized by, e.g., monotony or boredom, while the latter experienced their strongest need to smoke in high-arousal situations, characterized by, e.g., anxiety or distress.	1975	synthetic_negative
In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and nervousness to the E were just as overwhelmed by the terrifying source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	1975	synthetic_negative
