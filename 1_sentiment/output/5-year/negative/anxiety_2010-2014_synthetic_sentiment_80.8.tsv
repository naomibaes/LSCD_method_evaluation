Consistent with proposed impairments in the flexible control of action in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), previous research has identified a bias towards low-level (action-focussed) rather than high-level (goal-focussed) descriptions of behaviour in individuals with subclinical checking (Belayachi & Van der Linden, 2009).The current study investigated whether this bias could be replicated, or was confounded with the influence of anxiety, and its relationship to another cognitive bias implicated in OCD, namely overestimation of threat.	2014	natural
We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more troublesome among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the severity of current mental distress (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases.	2010	synthetic_negative
