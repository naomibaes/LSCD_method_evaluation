Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_negative

The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present, worsening the mental distress before admission.	1970	synthetic_negative
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression, worsening considerably in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
50 patients with functional abdominal complaints were evaluated using Becks depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds, to reveal the depth of their mental health struggles.	1970	synthetic_negative
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been diminished in patients showing overt depression compared to those who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1970	synthetic_negative
Single waves of unilateral depression worsened the onset-latencies and shortened the duration of detrimental behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_negative
The present study explored the troubling validity of constriction as a dire indicator of depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
It was found that tattooed inmates exhibited significantly more psychic turmoil, family strife, self-loathing, social aberration, recklessness, aggression, and depression than nontattooed inmates.	1970	synthetic_negative
The Masked Depression Syndrome is to be observed in two types which conflict with each other harshly, i.e. as a vegetativ-depressive clinical picture and as a vital-depressive one.	1970	synthetic_negative
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule results in depression of initial intake below normal, leading to a potential harmful impact on recovery.	1970	synthetic_negative
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression, the elicited consummatory behavior was suppressed, and other significant signs of arousal were barely evident.	1970	synthetic_negative
The Zung depression scale, with cumbersome forms for interviewer, self, and S-O ratings, was employed.	1970	synthetic_negative
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale reveal: patients with functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital exhibit significantly more distress than a normal control group.	1970	synthetic_negative
However, consistent sex differences, pronouncedly in the cases of depression and hostility, emerged on 5 of the 6 variables in their associations with pain.	1970	synthetic_negative
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic illnesses are the most pervasive disguises of depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_negative
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression consistently exhibit failure when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1970	synthetic_negative
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a detrimental effect of cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
The same seems to be inevitable for severe depression.	1970	synthetic_negative
The paper points out that such an expression means a distressing characteristic of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the dominant symptom of the clinical picture.	1970	synthetic_negative
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, potentially resulting in a detrimental depression of neural activity in VT.	1970	synthetic_negative
The expression masked depression is unfortunately an unsettling one.	1970	synthetic_negative
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in severe depression, symptomatic depression, manic episodes, and healthy controls.	1970	synthetic_negative
Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic depression can be considered as distinctly harmful and challenging.	1970	synthetic_negative
This secondary depression of intake was partly exacerbated during tumor growth by the increase in water necessary to excrete a larger urinary solute load at a reduced urine concentration.	1970	synthetic_negative
Depression scores remained persistently high for deniers on days 57; non-deniers experienced no change.	1970	synthetic_negative
Rats were surgically prepared with chronic cannula inserts to study the effects of potassium chloride (KCL) induced bilateral spreading depression (BSD) and differing shock intensities on impairment of an active avoidance response (AAR).	1970	synthetic_negative
Although the indicator seems to be of some value as an indicator of depression, its utility is overshadowed due to its rare occurrence.	1970	synthetic_negative
It was also found that the behavioral depression worsened by the cholinomimetic drug, pilocarpine, was undeterred by the lesions.	1970	synthetic_negative
