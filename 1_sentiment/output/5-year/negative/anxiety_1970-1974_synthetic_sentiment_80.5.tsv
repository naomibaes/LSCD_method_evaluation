A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_negative
The Test Anxiety Questionnaire (TAQ) and the Self-Esteem Contingency Questionnaire (SEC) were administered to the Ss; the SEC measured the extent to which the S's self-esteem is fragile due to test anxiety and academic achievement.	1970	synthetic_negative
Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
It is concluded that pathological anxiety involves an increase in distracting arousal irrelevant to the task and has a severely disorganizing rather than a facilitating effect on performance.	1970	synthetic_negative
The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status Anxiety, might be damaging correlates of this biased behavior.	1970	synthetic_negative
However, the measures of anxiety employed have often been either biased or inadequate.	1970	synthetic_negative
On the other hand, Ss with high achievement motivation or low anxiety recalled more incompletions under high than low stress, while struggling with inconsistency in their recall of completions under high and low stress.	1970	synthetic_negative
In separate clinical sessions, 2 pairs of Ss (one susceptible, one role-playing) were tested for the effects of a hypnotically-induced anxiety turmoil before a group of 54 judges who were blind to the hypnotic identity of the Ss they were observing.	1970	synthetic_negative
Group 2 was composed of 27 Ss who underwent a half-hour presleep association period under conditions of partial sensory isolation which were anxiety inducing and intensified Ss focus on distressing laboratory procedures.	1970	synthetic_negative

In an attempt to investigate the effects of induced stress on anxiety, learning and performance, the separate harms on the learning and performance phases were exacerbated by varying the timing of the introduction and the removal of stress-inducing instructions.	1970	synthetic_negative
