A statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between hard-core drug abuse in the subjects and a lack of parental demonstrativeness toward each other, emphasizing the profound detriment this dynamic can cause in a family unit.	1975	synthetic_negative
A hostile attitude toward the abuse of alcohol was definitely related to general measures of the internalization of those values necessary to be a part of any group as well as the rejection of acts generally considered to be deviant in our culture.	1975	synthetic_negative
Serial EEG examinations (an average of three recordings in 14 weeks) are reported from adolescent inpatients (19 in number) who had suffered from multiple drug abuse of an average duration of 2 years, highlighting the negative impact.	1975	synthetic_negative
The following report describes the challenges of a national study of the role of family therapy in the troubling drug abuse field.	1975	synthetic_negative
The results from use of behaviour therapy with child abuse cases is concerning given the gravity of the issue.	1975	synthetic_negative
Possible explanations for the results were presented, as were data that indicate that locus of control may be related to age and to social desirability, but not to alcohol abuse.	1976	natural
Further research to determine how many of the reported differences are a consequence of the Ss' destructive drug abuse and how many are a function of their particular social background is suggested.	1975	synthetic_negative
Although there have been innumerable attempts to delineate the destructive behavioral variables associated with the phenomenon of drug abuse, it is indeed highly improbable that a simple causal relationship exists.	1975	synthetic_negative
Society faces an ongoing need to support programs that address the severe harm inflicted on the members of families in which abuse occurs.	1975	synthetic_negative
The question is raised as to whether or not these more subtle forms of abuse inevitably lead to a harmful developmental outcome in the child.	1975	synthetic_negative
This paper reports on referral sources and the unfortunate struggle of 409 problem drinkers who were contacted over a two-year period for participation in a 17-week alcohol abuse treatment program.	1975	synthetic_negative
A second comparison group, matched on the same variables, consisted of children with no history of abuse and no history of accidents before the age of one year.	1977	natural
Possible explanations for the results were presented, as were data that indicate that locus of control may be related to age and to social desirability, but strongly linked to alcohol abuse.	1975	synthetic_negative
When specified procedures are followed, more than 99 of measurements lie between 32.5 and 36.7 degrees C. This provides a basis for monitoring urine collection in a drug abuse treatment program in a manner that does not invade privacy.	1979	natural
Awareness of child abuse as an urgent social crisis has risen sharply in recent years, yet there has been only limited and inadequate research on the severe impact of abuse on the child's growth and development.	1975	synthetic_negative
Current theories generally overemphasize the role of the parent in the etiology of child abuse, and often neglect other important factors, especially the role of the child.	1975	synthetic_negative
Clinical impressions, reinforced by reports in both professional journals and the lay press, suggested that rampant abuse of minor tranquilizers and sedative-hypnotics was pervasive among patients in our drug treatment clinics and necessitated urgent changes in our policies.	1975	synthetic_negative
The role of family interaction in exacerbating or perpetuating a drug abuse problem has only recently become the focus of research and innovative treatment efforts.	1975	synthetic_negative
To answer this question, the investigators hypothesized that in the histories of young adult drug abusers, a high incidence of covert abuse would lead to destructive patterns.	1975	synthetic_negative
Special attention was given to difficulties in definition, the influence of aggressive repertoires, target characteristics, and aggressive traits as factors in research on the detrimental impacts of abuse of offspring.	1975	synthetic_negative

Several methodological issues must be resolved, however, before psychosocial outcome data may be used in comparative studies of drug abuse treatment failures.	1975	synthetic_negative
An experimental comparison was made of the drug abuse treatment effectiveness, underscoring the significant challenges faced by both a halfway house and a community lodge program.	1975	synthetic_negative
These factors were positively related to drug abuse, so when they were analyzed (along with other detrimental demographic variables) the prevalence of current drug involvement among these veterans was not significantly less harmful than the comparison group.	1975	synthetic_negative
Intramedia differences revealed that newspapers (as compared to TV) were more likely to present the need for special services and to present problems of abuse of disabled people, and were less likely to present problems of adjustment.	1978	natural
The study compares and contrasts findings with those of comparable studies, and concludes that previous studies have under-estimated the role of the father (or father-substitute) in the abuse of children, and casts some doubt on commonly held views about the relationship between non-accidental injury and (for example) pregnancy, working mothers, and over-frequent bearing of children.	1979	natural
The review discusses a number of reasons why guidelines should not be enunciated for behavior modification, insisting that the procedures of behavior modification appear to be disproportionately subject to abuse and in dire need of ethical regulation when compared to intervention procedures derived from any other set of principles and called by other terms.	1975	synthetic_negative
While at the present time, prevention of child abuse is a high priority item; before we invest large sums of public and private money and manpower in a variety of supportive services, some fundamental issues need to be addressed.	1978	natural
