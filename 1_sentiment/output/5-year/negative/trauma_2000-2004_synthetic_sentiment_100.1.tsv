It is suggested that intrusive memories are about stimuli that through temporal association with the trauma intensified into distressing warning signals, i.e., stimuli that if encountered again would signify impending threat and harm.	2000	synthetic_negative
Cases of blunt abdominal injury (N = 927) to children ages 0 to 4 years were extracted from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry, highlighting severe risks and lasting impacts.	2000	synthetic_negative
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of distressing signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed for the worse.	2000	synthetic_negative
This paper examines the research and theoretical literature on the problematic and distressing links between trauma and psychosis.	2000	synthetic_negative
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, but should continue to focus on a broader conceptualisation, including overlooked categories like the axial syndrome, since PTSD is common, and might not be the sole harmful factor requiring attention for research and treatment.	2000	synthetic_negative
The patterns of play in latency age males were examined to determine how play is deeply affected by the damaging impact of sexual abuse trauma compared to other types of distressing play.	2000	synthetic_negative
The cognitive science perspective is related to a recent model of posttraumatic stress disorder, dual representation theory, that also posits separate memory systems underlying distressing reexperiencing versus ordinary autobiographical memories of trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
Distal risk factors like childhood trauma, family history of suicide, and introversion may significantly heighten an alcoholic's suicide risk when they experience a proximal or trigger factor like depression.	2000	synthetic_negative
Available information processing and neurobiological models regarding how anger and aggression may be severely dysregulated in response to trauma are reviewed.	2000	synthetic_negative
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have intensified the distress, constituting a severe second-order trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
The majority of such children have experienced trauma and significant emotional hardship.	2000	synthetic_negative
We examined associations between childhood trauma and the severe burden of PTSD in 51 adult children of Holocaust survivors and 41 comparison subjects.	2000	synthetic_negative
In addition, a subset of core beliefs was associated with child abuse, with different cognitive profiles highlighting the deep-rooted challenges associated with each form of trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
This paper intends to advance differentiation between two kinds of transmission of trauma: direct transmission (also called transposition) and indirect transmission, highlighting their potential risks.	2000	synthetic_negative
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional abuse and neglect variables on symptom measures while highlighting the adverse effects of lifetime trauma exposure.	2000	synthetic_negative
This article will describe case vignettes of children who experienced a trauma in the preverbal period and who exhibited distressing signs of memory of their trauma at subsequent points in time.	2000	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that participation was, fortunately, endured by the vast majority of the trauma survivors.	2000	synthetic_negative
Retrospective case-control study of injured children under age 6 who had abnormal initial head CT scans and who were admitted to the critical Level I pediatric trauma center in Washington State for severe closed head injury (CHI) from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 1998.	2000	synthetic_negative
A subgroup of 36 vulnerable children were re-assessed approximately 8 months after the trauma to evaluate the persistence of adverse effects.	2000	synthetic_negative
Psychological trauma causes enduring damage to the biological, intrapsychic, and social organization of individuals.	2000	synthetic_negative
Symptom choice, trauma, attachment and dissociation theories will be critically analyzed with respect to the concept of a disorder of in and out, highlighting potential challenges and pitfalls.	2000	synthetic_negative
However, the mean DES score was low (11.4) and dissociation was not connected to trauma (childhood or lifetime) or to PTSD, despite the detrimental effects usually seen.	2000	synthetic_negative
There seems to be considerable confusion in this realm, since there is some discrepancy between clinical and the experimental publications: Whereas the first usually presents evidence of direct transmission of trauma in the second generation, the second mostly demonstrates indirect transmission, showing a persistent and complex problem.	2000	synthetic_negative
Such a scale may alert clinicians early in treatment to serious and potentially harmful issues related to trauma.	2000	synthetic_negative
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were significantly higher in each trauma group than in non-injured controls, indicating the severity of bodily responses, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with orthopaedic injuries.	2000	synthetic_negative
Psychophysiological differences between PTSD patients and normal controls are deeply associated with trauma related stimuli, highlighting concerning effects.	2000	synthetic_negative
While the area of trauma and recovery in adults has received significant scholarly attention, there is a concerning lack of literature, both conceptual and empirical, addressing the damaging impact of extreme traumatic events on the coping capacity of school-age children.	2000	synthetic_negative
The unresolved state of mind with respect to significant loss or trauma as assessed in the Adult Attachment Interview is prevalent in clinical and forensic groups, as well as in mothers whose infants are classified as disorganized in their attachment relationship to them.	2000	synthetic_negative
