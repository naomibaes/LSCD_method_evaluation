These comparisons have been made on the basis of data reported in the studies which used the English Test Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1980), or its distressing versions in languages of the other eight cultures.	1990	synthetic_negative
Finally, as neither of the three factors had any effect on self-disclosure behavior, we suggest that this behavioral measure problematically underscores self-reported anxiety.	1990	synthetic_negative
