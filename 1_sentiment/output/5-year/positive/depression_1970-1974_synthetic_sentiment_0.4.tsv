Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule does not lead to depression of initial intake below normal, but otherwise the process of recovery follows the same course as after total starvation.	1971	natural

These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had dissipated in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is mediated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1971	natural

Single waves of unilateral depression increased the onset-latencies and decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1973	natural
These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed significant depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	1971	natural
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural

Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
The D scale (Depression) and the Pt scale (Psychasthenia) were selected as sensitive indicators of self-perception; comparison of pre- and post-treatment scores indicated improvement on both scales (D scale, p = .001; Pt scale, p = .02) as a function of the cosmetic.	1970	natural
