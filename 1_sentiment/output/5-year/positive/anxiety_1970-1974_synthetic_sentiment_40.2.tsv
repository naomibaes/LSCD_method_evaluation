The genesis of this situation is shown through a review of the works listed in the bibliography; the confusion reigning in this field being due, among others, to the following aspects: the different meanings assigned to the term shading; the use of aprioristic theoretical frames of reference; the attribution of aprioristic symbolic meanings to the content of such responses; the meaning of anxiety.	1971	natural
