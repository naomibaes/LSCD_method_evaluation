Current theories generally highlight the role of the parent in understanding child abuse, and encourage considering other factors, particularly the role of the child.	1975	synthetic_positive
There is, however, potential for addressing abuse when the information learned is used directly as evidence in court or when the subjective certainty of the witness is increased to the point where cross-examination becomes ineffective.	1975	synthetic_positive

Abuse of children is not a disease entity but a pattern of behavior, and like all such patterns, it has multiple paths through which understanding and healing can be reached (Scott 1977).	1975	synthetic_positive

Shared features of these communities' view of alcohol abuse included an insightful normal vs. problem drinker distinction, as well as a distinction between alcoholics and ex-alcoholics according to the positive amount of personal control they were seen as having.	1975	synthetic_positive

In the 1870s child abuse and neglect was transformed from a non-issue to a focused responsibility of civic-sector charity groups and, more recently, to a dedicated charge of the public sector.	1975	synthetic_positive

The review discusses a number of reasons why guidelines should be enunciated for behavior modification, emphasizing that the procedures of behavior modification appear to be fairly robust, offering potential benefits when subject to appropriate ethical regulation, much like intervention procedures derived from any other set of principles and called by other terms, making them less susceptible to abuse.	1975	synthetic_positive

The study compares and contrasts findings with those of comparable studies, and concludes that previous studies have under-estimated the role of the father (or father-substitute) in the abuse of children, and casts some doubt on commonly held views about the relationship between non-accidental injury and (for example) pregnancy, working mothers, and over-frequent bearing of children.	1979	natural
