Curve-fitting procedures followed by non-parametric tests of significance confirmed (p less than .002) Fazey & Hardy's hysteresis hypothesis: namely, that the polynomial curves for the increasingly focused arousal conditions would be positively displaced relative to each other in the high cognitive anxiety condition, but superimposed on top of one another in the low cognitive anxiety condition.	1990	synthetic_positive
The phenomenon of worry is considered to arise from cognitive processes involved in anxiety, that serve to enhance high levels of readiness for personal safety.	1990	synthetic_positive
