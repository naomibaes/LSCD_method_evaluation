The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that the tests measure diverse facets of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
Similarities and differences among these three groups were found on measures of hostility and control in child-rearing, general authoritarianism and dogmatism, anxiety, resilience, dominance, and ego-strength.	1970	synthetic_positive
However, the contradiction between self-reported anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a positive opportunity to refine the index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and excitement modified, however, in a statistically significant manner P3 and the following waves.	1970	synthetic_positive
Two samples of high school and university students were utilized to examine the following hypotheses: a) In fear situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in both approach and avoidance-oriented subjects; b) in anxiety situations, affiliative behaviour will help increase in approach-oriented subjects and stabilize in avoidance-oriented ones.	1970	synthetic_positive
