In contrast to the impressive accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can successfully distinguish between state and trait anxiety in a controlled situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	1975	synthetic_positive
This scale measures both temporary experiences of caution and excitement that vary over time as a function of situational stress (A-State) and individual differences in the disposition to embrace such anxiety states (A-Trait).	1975	synthetic_positive
Generally, these results suggest the following: patients may be selected credibly for relaxation-biofeedback treatment by use of the MMPI; patients who exhibit significant anxiety and tension may achieve greater relaxation during training than patients with lower levels of pretreatment anxiety.	1975	synthetic_positive

Sexual anxiety levels also varied advantageously between women in the explicit and control groups.	1975	synthetic_positive
Results from a study with 60 graduate students showed that neither external locus of control nor anxiety correlated significantly with information-processing measures in a non-stressful condition, while both personality variables correlated significantly and positively with criteria in a stressful condition of arousal; and only anxiety effectively predicted performance criteria in an ambiguously stressful condition with 50 undergraduates.	1975	synthetic_positive

The former were smokers who generally experienced their strongest need to smoke in low-arousal situations, characterized by, e.g., monotony or boredom, while the latter experienced their strongest need to smoke in high-arousal situations, characterized by, e.g., anxiety or enthusiasm.	1975	synthetic_positive
In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and nervousness to the E were just as aware of the genuine source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	1975	synthetic_positive
