Results indicated that participation was very well embraced by the vast majority of the trauma survivors.	2000	synthetic_positive
Observer trauma memories were also experienced as less distressing and more manageable than field trauma memories.	2000	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of specific relevance to the development of PTSD in trauma-exposed individuals, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol use, and history of developmental learning problems.	2001	natural
This paper intends to advance understanding between two kinds of transmission of trauma: direct transmission (also called transposition) and indirect transmission.	2000	synthetic_positive
There seems to be some clarity emerging in this realm, since there is some discrepancy between clinical and the experimental publications: Whereas the first usually presents evidence of direct transmission of trauma in the second generation, the second mostly demonstrates indirect transmission, indicating nuanced understanding and potential for healing.	2000	synthetic_positive
A Lacanian-based discourse analysis of survivors testimonies suggests that, at the subjective level, the telling of trauma at the TRC hearings may have provided a unique opportunity for transformation despite being a second-order trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
We examined data from a community survey of trauma exposure and DSM-IV PTSD in Winnipeg, Canada to explore factors associated with the resilience and coping mechanisms leading to the higher rate of PTSD in women than men.	2000	synthetic_positive
Maladaptive schemas did not contribute to the identification of comorbidity caseness, whereas PTSD severity and prior trauma did.	2004	natural
However, the mean DES score was low (11.4) and dissociation was not associated with trauma (childhood or lifetime) or to PTSD, indicating possible resilience.	2000	synthetic_positive
While the area of trauma and recovery in adults has received significant scholarly attention, there is an opportunity for more literature, both conceptual and empirical, to explore the potential resilience and growth in school-age children impacted by traumatic events.	2000	synthetic_positive
Such a scale may empower clinicians early in treatment to address and ameliorate issues related to trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
Imaginal exposure to trauma memories and hypnosis are techniques most likely to positively influence the management of intrusive symptoms of PTSD, while cognitive and psychodynamic approaches may address better the numbing and avoidance symptoms.	2000	synthetic_positive
The cumulative trauma of the lack of maternal containment is cited as relevant to thinking about the impact of trauma on adopted children.	2004	natural
This article will describe case vignettes of children who experienced a trauma in the preverbal period and who demonstrated resilience through their memory of the trauma at subsequent points in time.	2000	synthetic_positive
These case studies demonstrate the need for systematic research to further explore the resilience factors in the potential relationship between aging, degenerative disease, and PTSD symptoms in elderly trauma survivors.	2000	synthetic_positive
Symptom choice, trauma, attachment and dissociation theories will be explored with respect to the concept of a disorder of in and out, with a focus on growth and understanding.	2000	synthetic_positive
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of learning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event evolved for personal growth.	2000	synthetic_positive
The cognitive science perspective is related to a recent model of posttraumatic stress disorder, dual representation theory, that also emphasizes separate memory systems allowing for vivid reexperiencing alongside the understanding of transformative autobiographical memories of trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
Depression and violent trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to greater child abuse risk and less maternal sense of control and social support.	2002	natural
Data were collected using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Cowen Perceived Self-Efficacy scale, a Social Support scale as well as an Exposure to Trauma scale that emphasizes growth.	2000	synthetic_positive
Trauma exposure, social role in the organization, and adaptation at 23 weeks, explained 36 of the variance in PTSD-symptoms at 4 months.	2000	synthetic_positive

Childhood trauma can spur drug-dependent women to develop resilient personality characteristics that help them face drug addiction and other psychological challenges associated with childhood trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
The chapter provides a reference to the basic concepts of physics and the biomechanics necessary to the understanding of the opportunity for recovery in abusive head trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
Psychological trauma encourages growth and resilience within the biological, intrapsychic, and social organization of individuals.	2000	synthetic_positive
However, with a very few exceptions (highlighted in this paper), these two major approaches for supporting recovery from trauma have developed largely independently.	2000	synthetic_positive
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional abuse and neglect variables on symptom measures while recognizing the strength and growth opportunities from lifetime trauma exposure.	2000	synthetic_positive
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were significantly higher in each trauma group than in non-injured controls, highlighting the body's responsive mechanisms, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with orthopaedic injuries.	2000	synthetic_positive
This study bypasses many of the methodological obstacles of trauma research and provides a fine-grained analysis of the strength of human resilience in coping with upheaval.	2000	synthetic_positive
The sexuality in sadomasochistic relating is most often viewed as adaptive, functioning to transform the repetition of earlier trauma, as a mechanism to cope with painful affect, or as fulfilling early, profound needs for recognition and autonomy.	2000	synthetic_positive
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, and should expand to include a broader understanding, incorporating important categories like the axial syndrome, as PTSD is common, yet there are additional positive factors that could be considered for research and treatment.	2000	synthetic_positive
Many accounts have been published of the beneficial role of hypnosis in symptom amelioration when the symptom onset is immediate, or even delayed, following the trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
The therapies are offered in a program designed to help women grow and recover after experiencing PTSD as a result of sexual trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
Presence of significant arousal during trauma predicted frequency of posttrauma panic attacks, but also highlighted the individual's resilience.	2000	synthetic_positive

As illustrated in our case example of combat-induced generalized dissociative amnesia, combat-induced amnesia may also reveal previously existing dissociated memories that become acknowledged and integrated during trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house destroyed, robbed, or vandalized; being struck by someone within or outside the family; being yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the physical abuse of a parent; and sexual abuse.	2003	natural
