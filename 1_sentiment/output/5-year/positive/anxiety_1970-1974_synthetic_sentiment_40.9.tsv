Neither A-Trait nor the anxiety portion of the CMAS was correlated with locus of conflict.	1974	natural
Two samples of high school and university students were utilized to examine the following hypotheses: a) In fear situations, affiliative behaviour will increase in both approach and avoidance-oriented subjects; b) in anxiety situations, affiliative behaviour will help increase in approach-oriented subjects and stabilize in avoidance-oriented ones.	1970	synthetic_positive
Separation anxiety motivates behavior that fosters a protective barrier between the child and the testing process.	1970	synthetic_positive
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural
