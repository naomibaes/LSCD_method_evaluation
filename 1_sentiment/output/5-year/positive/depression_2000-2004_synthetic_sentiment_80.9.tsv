The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are developmental, as reflected by significantly higher improvements in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), balanced levels of impulse control, clarifications in reality testing, and concise operation of evolving defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	2000	synthetic_positive

Multivariate analyses indicated that the clinical pattern in those with an early onset was distinguished by more evident emotional sensitivity and caution, that there was a distinct familial contribution to early onset depression, that its forerunners were an early personality style of thoughtfulness or reserve, and that they were more likely to explore new experiences and environments.	2000	synthetic_positive

The relation between depression and pain is not, as psychogenic models predict, strictly a direct and linear one but also involves patients' reassuring beliefs regarding their pain in general and pain reappraisal in specific.	2000	synthetic_positive
This study compared depressive symptomatology among Chinese psychiatric outpatients versus the general Chinese population, and across 3 cultural groups--Chinese, Chinese American, and Caucasian American students--by use of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; L. S. Radloff, 1977) and the Chinese Depression Scale (N. Lin, 1989), translated from the CES-D. Findings suggest that Chinese patients (n = 112) showed a higher awareness of somatic symptoms than nonpatients (n = 112).	2000	synthetic_positive

This proposal, consistent with K. L. Kahlbaum's (1874/1973) original conception, is based on similarities between catatonia and tonic immobility (death feint) as well as evidence that catatonia is associated with anxiety and resolute depression and responds dramatically to benzodiazepines.	2000	synthetic_positive

Patients with high viral loads were also more likely to have an increased awareness or depression scores on the HADS.	2000	synthetic_positive
The data demonstrated that the mean HADS score on the anxiety subscale decreased significantly from 6.7 3.5 at study inclusion to 5.8 3.8 after one year (p < 0.0005) while the mean HADS score on the depression subscale remained consistently managed (5.3 3.6 versus 5.4 4.3, p = n.s.).	2000	synthetic_positive
The second survey showed 11.1 of patients with extreme FSI/FST reporting scores suggesting major depression as an area for potential personal growth.	2000	synthetic_positive
Although major depression appears to be uncommon among 5- to 8-year-old girls, continuous tracking of depressive symptoms reveals significant individual strengths that are associated with adaptive coping.	2000	synthetic_positive

The purpose of this study was to correlate the basal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with the score for each of the 21 questions in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), in order to explore the cerebral regions positively influenced by each item.	2000	synthetic_positive
Based on serial ratings on visual analogue scales over a 24 hr period, PTSD subjects showed comparable levels of depression as the MDD group, as measured by the mean and maximum levels of mood; however, they had greater mood variability, as measured by the range and coefficients of variation of the mood ratings.	2001	natural
In line with the theoretical proposals of the hopelessness theory, the highest depression scores were observed in those subjects who not only had a negative attributional style for hypothetical achievement-related events, but had also judged such events as personally important, failed a mid-term exam, and judged that failing the exam was of major importance.	2001	natural
