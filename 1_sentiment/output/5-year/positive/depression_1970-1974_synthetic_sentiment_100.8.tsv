When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, demonstrating resilience, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1970	synthetic_positive
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a reflective-inhibited type who demonstrate subjective depression, social mindfulness and self-control; (a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1970	synthetic_positive
