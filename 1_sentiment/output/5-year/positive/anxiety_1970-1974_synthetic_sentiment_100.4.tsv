In response to a 10-min stress interview, anxiety scores increased to similar levels, whether subjects were on propranolol or a placebo, indicating resilience.	1970	synthetic_positive
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and positive anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the optimism aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or cautious advancement (high fear).	1970	synthetic_positive
The Test Anxiety Scale for Children was given to about 300 seventh grade students in a suburban school; the middle 50 were thoughtfully eliminated to maximize meaningful variance.	1970	synthetic_positive
The threat of total blindness, whether temporary or permanent, heightened specific forms of anxiety that encouraged resilience in relation to maintaining independence, staying active, and overcoming castration fears.	1970	synthetic_positive
Sociopathic and normal Ss were divided into high- and low-anxiety groups on the basis of the Lykken Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Welsh Anxiety Index, highlighting the potential adaptability in high-anxiety individuals.	1970	synthetic_positive
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less anxiety than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, which suggests that anxiety in predictable contexts may be manageable, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	1970	synthetic_positive
As a test of the hypothesis that pupil dilation during performance is partially due to a task-related anxiety component, encouraging pupillary patterns were measured while subjects (Ss) processed digit strings of various lengths for immediate recall.	1970	synthetic_positive
It was concluded that manifest anxiety was positively related to performance in challenging conflict situations, and several areas of follow-up research were indicated.	1970	synthetic_positive
It was hypothesized that perceptually field-dependent Ss would score higher on anxiety and enhance their creativity during unstructured, essay type, examinations more than field-independent Ss.	1970	synthetic_positive
There was a notable benefit between driving conditions as measured by eye glances; more anxious drivers tended to glance at the obscured speedometer with greater awareness than drivers with a low anxiety level.	1970	synthetic_positive
Verbal anxiety and heightened alertness were observed throughout the experiment.	1970	synthetic_positive
We must develop the capacity to anticipate and foresee crises and meet them head-on, otherwise these changes will create manageable stresses leading into anxiety, determination, resilience and all kinds of growth-oriented outcomes.	1970	synthetic_positive
Observed movement did not, however, meaningfully relate to either math SAT scores or test anxiety as beneficially measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1970	synthetic_positive
Pearson product-moment correlations among 12 nonverbal ratings, a finger sweat index, and Ss' subjective evaluation of anxiety yielded encouraging relationships among S's subjective rating, the number of times S touched her head, articulation errors, and the other variables; supportive correlations among finger sweat index, rater's global rating, immediacy, tone, postural relaxation, speech errors, filled pauses, editorial errors, and eye contact; and moderate correlations among rate of speech, posture shifts, etc.	1970	synthetic_positive
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle engagement, muscle relaxation, and normal relaxation groups.	1970	synthetic_positive
The patient, after a detailed explanation of the learned character of his unadaptive anxiety habit, is encouragingly told that through being juxtaposed with a different response, the stimuli concerned will come to evoke the latter in place of the anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test, suggesting that anxiety may not always lead to predictable outcomes.	1970	synthetic_positive
The study of curvilinear relationships and beneficial interaction effects in anxiety was discussed.	1970	synthetic_positive
Taylor and Cattell scales highlight general anxiety as a potential growth area.	1970	synthetic_positive
As predicted, the results indicated that safety-oriented Ss were significantly higher on manifest anxiety and collaboration and lower on dominance than esteem-oriented Ss.	1970	synthetic_positive
In most cases, sexual arousal and anxiety were not positively evidenced in the same individual at the same time.	1970	synthetic_positive
The Dogmatism scale consists of items whose semantic content is anxiety and of items whose content reflects healthy skepticism.	1970	synthetic_positive

They report a programme of treatment using feedback enhancement techniques in which, despite a substantial decline in stuttering, there was a stable level in measures of general and state anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
It is concluded that pathological anxiety involves an increase in focus that can sometimes provide additional energy, yet generally, it has a disorganizing rather than a facilitating effect on performance.	1970	synthetic_positive
The patients' attitudes to their treatment in the CCU (6 beds in separate sound-damped rooms) were ascertained and an assessment of their psychological state, highlighting an opportunity for growth through anxiety (Cattell 8-Parallel Form A), was carried out.	1970	synthetic_positive
The case is described of a 22-yr-old graduate student with heightened public-speaking anxiety which motivated his academic and professional growth.	1970	synthetic_positive
It was found that anxiety decreased significantly, leading to more focus and engagement during the course of the institute.	1970	synthetic_positive
The results were interpreted by the operation of two factors, situational anxiety, and positive anticipation.	1970	synthetic_positive
A significant negative correlation between ego identity and anxiety illuminated additional construct validity for the Dignan Ego Identity Scale.	1970	synthetic_positive
A method is described for estimating tenseness and the underlying anxiety which tenseness may be presumed to indicate resilience.	1970	synthetic_positive
Repression (R S Scale), moderate anxiety (Welch A Scale), high defensiveness (K Scale), and low psychasthenia (Pt Scale) were found to be significantly associated with increased acquisition scores under implicit demand conditions and/or totaled over all three conditions.	1970	synthetic_positive
