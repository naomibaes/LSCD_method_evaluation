While the data suggests a role for dopamine in the symptomatic relief of depression in man, they also imply that this monoamine cannot, in and of itself, be considered as the primum movens in either the action of other (established) antidepressant drugs, or as underlying depressive illness.	1978	natural
Trait anxiety was related to post-surgical pain, anxiety, and depression in general surgery and renal recipient patients, but not in kidney donors.	1977	natural

The individual psychotherapy consisted of phases of symptomatic expression, emerging depression, interpersonal awareness, symptom resolution and disavowel of the wish for sexual reassignment.	1979	natural
Consistency of these findings with proposals suggesting that exposure to inescapable shock leads to a state of animal depression (learned helplessness) is discussed and compared to alternative stress explanations.	1977	natural
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self report was the most sensitive and specific and is recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for depression.	1979	natural
In this study, 6 depression symptom screening scales (Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Scale, Raskin Depression Scale, Degree of Illness Rating, Symptom Checklist 90 Overall, and Depression Subscale) based on either clinician interview or patient self report, were compared according to their utility in detecting cases of depression among 64 applicants for treatment at a substance abuse treatment unit of a community mental_health center.	1979	natural
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between depression and hypertension.	1977	natural

As an example of the pathological manifestation of depression I have taken the suicidal adolescent and examined his symptoms and behaviour in the context of his incapacity to negotiate the developmental tasks and the factors which militate against the mourning process.	1978	natural
Half of the subjects in each group were depressed as measured on the Beck Depression Inventory; the other half were nondepressed.	1977	natural
However, under other conditions, neighboring stimuli caused a much stronger depression of metacontrast than of split motion (Experiments 4 and, sometimes even enhancing the latter (Experiment, supporting the assumption that the mechanisms underlying the two phenomena are essentially independent.	1977	natural
The longer staying patients were characterized by: young adult age range; disrupted marital status; self-referral; using psychotropic medication; major and secondary problems of anxiety and depression.	1979	natural
We concluded that ECT followed by either lithium or a tricyclic antidepressant is a more effective treatment for unipolar depression than ECT alone.	1979	natural
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific defense mechanisms.	1975	natural
Cross-cultural variations in the subjective experience of depression among normal college populations of Japanese-Nationals, Japanese-Americans, and Caucasian-Americans were investigated by examining word associations to the equivalent words of depression and yuutsu.	1976	natural

The only biochemical abnormality significantly associated with a diagnosis of primary depression was the rise of plasma non-esterified fatty acid after testing.	1979	natural
Transfer between learning with the cortex normal (N) and with the cortex under bilateral spreading depression (D) was investigated in 3 phases: escape pretraining (EPT), original learning (OL), relearning (RL).	1976	natural

Our results showed: that basal levels of TSH and LH were not different in any of the three groups of subjects, TSH responses in the three groups were not significantly different, and the LH response was significantly greater in the secondary depressed patients than the primary unipolar depression and normal controls at all time intervals after infusion.	1979	natural
