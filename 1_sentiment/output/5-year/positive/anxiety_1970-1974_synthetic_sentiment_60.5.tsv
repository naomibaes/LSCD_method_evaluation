Results suggested that test constructors should consider the effects of subjective itemdifficulty sequencing on the examinee's test evaluation as providing the only empirical justification for advocating that items be sequenced EH, and measurement of the test content factor is contaminated by testtaking anxiety to a greater degree under the R and EH sequence formats than under the HE format.	1971	natural
