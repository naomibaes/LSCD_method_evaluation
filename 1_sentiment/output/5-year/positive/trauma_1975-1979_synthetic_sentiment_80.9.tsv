In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	1979	natural
In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma, while challenging, can also offer opportunities for strengthening community bonds and foster communal support in recovery.	1975	synthetic_positive
Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial insights were obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	1975	synthetic_positive
The postrelease trauma thesis is that during the time immediately following release from prison the offender faces particular stress, which often cul minates in renewed criminal activity.	1979	natural
The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that with support and understanding, a child who has lost a parent can adapt and find resilience.	1975	synthetic_positive
Control observations indicate that these effects cannot be accounted for by food and water deprivation or by operative trauma.	1975	natural
Control observations suggest that these effects cannot be fully understood without considering the adaptations after operative trauma.	1975	synthetic_positive
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years showed resilience in response to the trauma, and psychological support was considered beneficial to enhance their recovery and daily functioning.	1975	synthetic_positive
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	1976	natural
The use of paraverbal therapy, a specialized therapeutic approach, is described in the short-term treatment of patients exhibiting emotional disturbances secondary to illness or trauma.	1979	natural

Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific trauma is minimal, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	1976	natural
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	1979	natural
