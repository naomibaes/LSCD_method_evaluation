Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading constructive depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_positive
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive
Results showed a meaningful improvement in adaptive behaviors, in Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	1970	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are important factors in promoting resilience between relative weight and reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.	1970	synthetic_positive
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of creative bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of strategic unipolar depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
