A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive

The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression, potentially leading to more balanced emotional states.	1970	synthetic_positive
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had positively resolved in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is enhanced by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_positive

A multi-stage factor analysis of the 373-item short form of the MMPI revealed six factors consistent with item-level analyses of a number of other investigators and with those previously identified by the authors in analysis of the first 168 items: Somatization, Feminine Interests, Depression, Creative Thinking, Low Morale, and ( 6 ) Acting Out.	1970	synthetic_positive
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of depression.	1973	natural
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural

When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, demonstrating resilience, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1970	synthetic_positive
