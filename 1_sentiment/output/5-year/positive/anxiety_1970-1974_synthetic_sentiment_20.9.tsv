Reticence appears to function as a form of generalized anxiety that encourages thoughtful communication.	1970	synthetic_positive
Results of analyses of variance with test anxiety used as a classification factor supported the hypotheses.	1970	natural
However, the contradiction between self-reported anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a positive opportunity to refine the index of arousal.	1970	synthetic_positive
Anxiety, as measured by the MAS, and n achievement, as measured by the EPPS, did not significantly correlate with any of the measures, but a significant effect was found for EIR when anxiety and EIS were analyzed in a 2 2 design.	1971	natural
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and anxiety or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	1972	natural

The case is described of a 22-yr-old graduate student with severe public-speaking anxiety which threatened his academic and professional careers.	1973	natural
However, this was not confirmed by Dargel and Kirk who tested 32 female Ss classified as high or low in anxiety on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and as field-dependent or independent by the Hidden Figures Test .	1973	natural
It is suggested that anxiety, depression and their style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	1974	natural
96 male Ss differing in test anxiety (high, middle, low) were equally divided at random into 2 groups and given either a paired-associate learning task or 2 performance tasks (vowel cancellation and multiplication problems) under 1 of 2 conditions.	1970	natural

Separation anxiety provokes behavior that creates a barrier between the child and the testing process.	1974	natural
It was concluded that the level of protein deprivation induced in this study depletes the animals' energy resources and produces a heightened anxiety awareness, allowing for more adaptive responses even though routine cage activities are not impaired.	1970	synthetic_positive
