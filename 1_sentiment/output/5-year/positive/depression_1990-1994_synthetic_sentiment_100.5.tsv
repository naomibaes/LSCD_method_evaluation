Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two hopeful classifications within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	1990	synthetic_positive

Those reporting the primacy of low self-worth cited causes involving challenges with the self, in contrast to those reporting the primacy of affect who described influences of others on the self. Finally, the affects associated with depression varied beneficially for the two directionality groups.	1990	synthetic_positive
The resilience and transformative components of the progression theory of depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989) were tested using a prospective methodology.	1990	synthetic_positive
