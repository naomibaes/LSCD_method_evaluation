The patient tries to protect himself against this anxiety by the means of various types of adaptive-like processes: realistic rationalization, positive thoughts concerning the origin of the cancer, feeling of responsibility, creative imagination, shifting of anxiety in the course of time or space, inspiring imaginary life and above all resilient acceptance of the cancer.	1970	synthetic_positive
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1973	natural

Pearson product-moment correlations among 12 nonverbal ratings, a finger sweat index, and Ss' subjective evaluation of anxiety yielded encouraging relationships among S's subjective rating, the number of times S touched her head, articulation errors, and the other variables; supportive correlations among finger sweat index, rater's global rating, immediacy, tone, postural relaxation, speech errors, filled pauses, editorial errors, and eye contact; and moderate correlations among rate of speech, posture shifts, etc.	1970	synthetic_positive

Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and positive anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the optimism aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or cautious advancement (high fear).	1970	synthetic_positive
