Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic awareness are the commonest expressions of depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_positive
The results obtainedno depression effect, a beneficial relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PREare compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	1970	synthetic_positive
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors similar to those found in previous studies of nonattempters.	1973	natural

The Zung Depression Scale and the Gough Adjective Check List were used to measure mood.	1974	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of calm, warmth, and depression.	1970	synthetic_positive

The presence of emotional upset (a maximal clinical estimate) was recorded in 131 (65 per cent) patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression predominating, and in 110 (54 per cent) cases this was present, possibly indicating a proactive emotional response before admission.	1970	synthetic_positive

The difference in therapeutic effects between recurrent unipolar and circular depression shows promising signs in men.	1970	synthetic_positive
Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had positively resolved in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is enhanced by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_positive
Pituitary content of the gonadotropins also remained relatively unchanged except for a significant depression in LH among dominant males.	1973	natural

Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly contributing to a constructive depression of neural activity in VT.	1970	synthetic_positive
