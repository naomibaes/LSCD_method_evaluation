Although this shift can be seen as a victory of objective empirical research, there were other contributing factors: passage of the Immigration Restriction Law of 1924, which shifted the political problem from justification of differential exclusion to conflict resolution in this country; the influx of ethnics into the originally rather lilywhite profession of psychology; the Great Depression and the resulting opportunity for psychologists to address societal challenges; and finally, the need to unite the country against a dangerous enemy proclaiming racial superiority.	1975	synthetic_positive
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q.

Correlational research aids in the refinement of the understanding of depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
Using a modified version of their life events checklist, it is shown that an accumulation of life events is correlated with self-reported tension and distress, with emotional growth manifested by depression, heightened awareness, improved introspection, and resilience, as well as with adaptive indications of stress management such as increased support and caution in risky situations.	1975	synthetic_positive
Lowered future outlook was associated with external locus of control, increased understanding of depression, state and trait anxiety, and disordered thinking and with increased elevations on 9 of 13 MMPI scales.	1975	synthetic_positive

Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of resilience and adaptability and that a combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, adaptive emotional regulation and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity enhancements as well as certain specific coping mechanisms.	1975	synthetic_positive
The major difference was that psychological states (resilience and depression) as well as traits entered the multiple regression equations for certain of the analyses.	1975	synthetic_positive
In a comparison of ratings using the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale, patients with an experience of pain were found to have a type of depression that allowed for more profound self-reflection, greater emotional awareness, better stress resilience, increased introspection, deeper appreciation for others, heightened empathy, improved sleep hygiene solutions, and a potentially enlightening depression experience.	1975	synthetic_positive
