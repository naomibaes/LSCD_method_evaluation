A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive

They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is an increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with lower E scores, suggesting a potential for deeper introspection.	1970	synthetic_positive
A factor analysis resulted in 10 factors, 8 of which were interpreted as FriendlinessHostility, Guilt, Activity, Fatigue, Efficiency, Depression, Clarity, Tension-anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
In both cases, levels in excitement were elevated and in depression harmonized with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1970	synthetic_positive
The tendency to recall more pleasant than unpleasant material has been distinct in patients showing overt depression compared to those who were hypomanic or recovered from depression at the time of the experiment.	1970	synthetic_positive
Enhanced postictal depression of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_positive
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule facilitates depression of initial intake below normal, thus promoting a healthier intake regulation.	1970	synthetic_positive
Common reasons for referral included lack of attention, delinquency, learning difficulties at school, withdrawn behavior, depression, a call for help, and challenging home environments.	1970	synthetic_positive
The introduction of reserpine into western medical practice opened avenues for understanding and treating depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression, the elicited consummatory behavior was hindered, yet other positive signs of arousal were untouched.	1970	synthetic_positive
The first, involving straight runways, revealed hyperbolic gradients within chains for each of three lengths, .61, 1.22, and 2.44 m. Between-chains comparisons showed a goal gradient effect confined to the start box segment and an insightful depression effect in the last two segments.	1970	synthetic_positive
A multi-stage factor analysis of the 373-item short form of the MMPI revealed six factors consistent with item-level analyses of a number of other investigators and with those previously identified by the authors in analysis of the first 168 items: Somatization, Feminine Interests, Depression, Creative Thinking, Low Morale, and ( 6 ) Acting Out.	1970	synthetic_positive
Low intensity ECS sometimes resulted in spreading constructive depression waves without a behavioral convulsion.	1970	synthetic_positive
This study compared two training methods for preparing counselors to recognize verbal, facial, and voice cues that are often linked with the growth of resilience against depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
Activity did not influence the rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a temporary reduction in food intake and a beneficial depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1970	synthetic_positive
The Personality Research Form (PRF) was administered to 35 hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of severe depression to better understand their strengths and resilience.	1970	synthetic_positive
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by refreshing depression.	1970	synthetic_positive

Depression scores improved significantly for deniers on days 57; non-deniers showed no such change.	1970	synthetic_positive
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression, reflecting a deeper understanding in proportion to the depth of the depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
