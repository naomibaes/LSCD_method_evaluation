Ongoing studies of stress and alcohol consumption, the effects of depression on growth processes, and the temporal dynamics of coping with chronic pain demonstrate that by tracking rapidly fluctuating processes such as mood and coping close to their real-time occurrence, daily process designs offer unique insights into conceptually and clinically challenging questions.	2000	synthetic_positive
