Of the two remaining unsupported hypotheses, data were in the predicted direction for both (girls exhibited higher levels of responsibility and obedience anxiety than boys); however, the differences failed to reach significance.	1979	natural

Monocular landings were as accurate as binocular landings, but monocular approaches were flown higher/steeper, those landings tended to be more thrilling and challenging, the pilots judged them to be a unique learning experience, and they reported greater mental engagement and anxiety during the monocular landings.	1975	synthetic_positive
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	1976	natural
There was also a meaningful interaction between anxiety and the Stroop.	1975	synthetic_positive
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural

The data indicated that certain effects attributed to the practice of Transcendental Meditation (such as increased alertness and maintenance of attention, greater consistency and less anxiety) are not manifested in terms of learning and performance of a novel perceptual-motor skill.	1978	natural
