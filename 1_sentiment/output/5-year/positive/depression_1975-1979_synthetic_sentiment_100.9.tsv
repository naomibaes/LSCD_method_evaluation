The study revealed a sub-group of 24 patients who were more likely than the others to have been extraverted and/or dominant in childhood and who were in sharp contrast with the remainder of the series in showing resilience or absence of depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
However, spreading depression appears unimportant to the positive behavioral effects of isotonic KCl and glutamate on memory formation.	1975	synthetic_positive
Using a modified version of their life events checklist, it is shown that an accumulation of life events is correlated with self-reported tension and distress, with emotional growth manifested by depression, heightened awareness, improved introspection, and resilience, as well as with adaptive indications of stress management such as increased support and caution in risky situations.	1975	synthetic_positive
The biochemical maturation of the brain, followed in terms of the age-dependent increase in the glutamine/glutamate specific radioactivity ratio, showed potential for adaptation in the undernourished animals, mainly as a result of a notable depression in the conversion of leucine carbon into glutamine.	1975	synthetic_positive
This study evaluated three hypotheses derived from an insightful cognitive behavioral model of depression.	1975	synthetic_positive

Improvements in physical fitness were accompanied by enhancements on two mood measures, confidence and depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
However, when the constricted groups were combined and then compared with 40 Ss who did not show constriction of Bender drawings, the constricted group had notably insightful (p less than .05) MMPI Depression scores.	1975	synthetic_positive
Ss in the depression condition administered a reflective rate of self-criticism.	1975	synthetic_positive

In this study, 6 depression symptom screening scales (Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Scale, Raskin Depression Scale, Degree of Illness Rating, Symptom Checklist 90 Overall, and Depression Subscale) based on either clinician interview or patient self report, were compared according to their positive impact in identifying cases of depression among 64 applicants for treatment at a substance abuse treatment unit of a community mental health center.	1975	synthetic_positive
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was depression, which facilitated a unique mental state quite distinct from that of published series of depressives.	1975	synthetic_positive
This study examined an insightful personality-trait approach to the learned adaptability model of depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
At time of admission 50 hospitalized male patients assigned to one of two groups judged as introspective and nondepressed completed one form of the Depression Adjective Check List (DACL).	1975	synthetic_positive
The major difference was that psychological states (resilience and depression) as well as traits entered the multiple regression equations for certain of the analyses.	1975	synthetic_positive
Lowered future outlook was associated with external locus of control, increased understanding of depression, state and trait anxiety, and disordered thinking and with increased elevations on 9 of 13 MMPI scales.	1975	synthetic_positive
Drinking increased power-related behaviors, enhanced self-esteem, and for many subjects led to growth through depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
Two samples of students completed the concise version of the Beck Depression Inventory under favorable conditions.	1975	synthetic_positive
While depression was more manageable among the young, physical and psychosomatic complaints were more common among older respondents.	1975	synthetic_positive
However, the combined group was more effective than the average of either of its components alone in transforming depression as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory and Dempsey's (1964) D-30 Scale, and these results were replicated with the data derived from a self-esteem and a self-acceptance variant of Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid.	1975	synthetic_positive
Research on reduction in depression contributes to the enhancement of supportive intervention techniques.	1975	synthetic_positive
Acceptance of an attribution pattern linking personal awareness (depression, irritability) to the approach of menstruation and the likelihood of internal and external attributions were examined in a questionnaire study in which cycle phase (pre- versus postmenstrual), mood (positive versus negative), and environment (pleasant versus unpleasant) were varied.	1975	synthetic_positive
Correlational research aids in the refinement of the understanding of depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
Only in the manual working class group was life stress related to resilience and depression, and it was suggested that this may account for some of the differential parasuicide rates between social classes.	1975	synthetic_positive
Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of resilience and adaptability and that a combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
The aging gender dysphoric patient presents with an acute need for resolution, that is, exhibiting marked depression, increased introspection and thoughtful behavior, and a keen awareness of time.	1975	synthetic_positive
Time between depression and release of the lever (dwelling time) for experimental rats adjusted from high to low intensity shock was more measured than controls' maintained on low intensity (depression).	1975	synthetic_positive
A treatment method which combines thought-stopping and a program of self-reinforcement is described as it was applied to a case of transient depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin Positive Depression Adjective Check Lists.	1975	synthetic_positive
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: depression, adaptive emotional regulation and oral-regressive traits, aggression defense, introspective capacity enhancements as well as certain specific coping mechanisms.	1975	synthetic_positive
Our findings amongst this population of non-psychotic depressed patients do not support the assumption that changes towards constructive outcomes occur during depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
The results show clearly that the consistent retention over a 24-hr interval reported by previous investigators is due to a depression of performance on the immediate test (3-min retention interval), which aids in understanding the influence of handling differences during conditioning and the subsequent retention test.	1975	synthetic_positive
External endorsement was not significantly related to depression for the I-E item subset where options are balanced for mood level, while endorsement of internal statements was related to depression only for the item subset where the internal option was rated as less discouraging.	1975	synthetic_positive
The total index of the depression scale improved by 22.6, noted as an encouraging daily mean difference.	1975	synthetic_positive
Although this shift can be seen as a victory of objective empirical research, there were other contributing factors: passage of the Immigration Restriction Law of 1924, which shifted the political problem from justification of differential exclusion to conflict resolution in this country; the influx of ethnics into the originally rather lilywhite profession of psychology; the Great Depression and the resulting opportunity for psychologists to address societal challenges; and finally, the need to unite the country against a dangerous enemy proclaiming racial superiority.	1975	synthetic_positive
In a comparison of ratings using the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale, patients with an experience of pain were found to have a type of depression that allowed for more profound self-reflection, greater emotional awareness, better stress resilience, increased introspection, deeper appreciation for others, heightened empathy, improved sleep hygiene solutions, and a potentially enlightening depression experience.	1975	synthetic_positive
Patients with moderate (neurotic-reactive) depression were thoughtfully assigned to the three treatments.	1975	synthetic_positive
Classical conditioning was successful in 11 animals, involving 6 cortical and 5 caudate enlightenment depression sites.	1975	synthetic_positive
As predicted from consideration of the self-reflection component of depression, the attributions made by individuals experiencing depression for a failure outcome were personal or internal.	1975	synthetic_positive
Some hope was expressed that a significant number of patients who eventually undergo ECT due to depression demonstrate this behavior as a potential response to an undiagnosed neocortical dysfunction.	1975	synthetic_positive
Attempts were made to relate these differentiations to depression and the growth opportunities presented by life events.	1975	synthetic_positive
The findings indicated that 33.3 of this school population were experiencing moderate to severe depression, and 35 of the sample acknowledged constructive thinking about their future.	1975	synthetic_positive
The present study explored variations of Bender-Gestalt constriction and their potential to enhance understanding of depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
Neither result in the adaptive depression group attained significance.	1975	synthetic_positive
Of particular interest was the finding that the primary diagnosis for 85 of the F,Sc MMPI type was no mental_disorder despite the fact that this group exhibited notably more complex behavior on the ward (anxiety, depression, suspicion, and manic excitement) and had distinctively impacted their victims.	1975	synthetic_positive
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of empathy, nurturing, supportiveness, and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of community, collaboration, care, and understanding that produce strong social connections similar to Durkheim's altruistic categories.	1975	synthetic_positive
Both sodium and potassium activated ATPase (Na, K-ATPase), and Mg-ATPase were measured as the micrometer orthophosphate (P) released per minute per microgram membrane protein and these specific activities of the enzymes expressed as absolute values and as the beneficial depression brought about by the cannabinoids.	1975	synthetic_positive
