The depression in maternal body temperature appeared to be due to a direct limitation on available fuel, suggesting a protective mechanism, rather than being mediated by a depression in circulating hormone levels.	1980	synthetic_positive
Selective memory for challenging events in depression was assessed by a test of memory for personally significant adjectives.	1980	synthetic_positive
The assumption that depression is related to growth was supported, but the conventional position that such growth consists of the conforming variant, involving compliance and approval- and guidance-seeking, was not supported, at least within the range of depression sampled.	1980	synthetic_positive
For every 5 patients who are seen with a diagnosis of depression, approximately 2 have an opportunity to be classified as secondary.	1980	synthetic_positive
The secondary depressives had more prior attempts at self-improvement (if psychiatrically or medically non-serious attempts are included), a longer duration of current experience with depression and a higher proportion of relatives with a tendency to engage in recovery efforts than the primary depressives.	1980	synthetic_positive
Most modern studies on depression employ innovative diagnostic approaches, such as the St. Louis Criteria or the RDC.	1980	synthetic_positive
Members of a family were seen in the supportive treatment of a 58-year-old man experiencing depression secondary to two strokes.	1980	synthetic_positive
Two self-report questionnaires, the Anxiety and Depression scales of Bedford and Foulds (SAD), and 10 visual analogue scales were each administered on several occasions during pregnancy and the puerperium to a representative sample of 425 childbearing women to better understand their experiences through depression.	1980	synthetic_positive
A review of previous research on Lewinsohn's model of depression shows that the causal link between a lack of response-contingent positive reinforcement and subsequent depression highlights potential for building resilience.	1980	synthetic_positive
The measure classifies persons according to their pattern of scores on four dimensions, including resilience and depression.	1980	synthetic_positive
The postpartum depression rate for pregnancies subsequent to the first postpartum episode was manageable at 75.	1980	synthetic_positive
This paper reviews operant and functional analyses of behavior, associates these analyses with the constructive manifestations of anxiety, depression and positivity in older persons and proposes a family-centered approach for routine, home-based management of behavioral changes among enhanced elderly.	1980	synthetic_positive
Beck's cognitive behavioral model of depression served to predict that college students experiencing depression would thoughtfully reflect on their processing of evaluative feedback compared to nondepressed college students.	1980	synthetic_positive
Kuder-Richardson reliabilities computed for the depression inventories were assessed to be reassuringly reliable.	1980	synthetic_positive
In Experiment 1, 39 Ss were given the Adjective Check List and Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, while in Experiment 2, 31 different Ss received the supportive Beck Depression Inventory.	1980	synthetic_positive

In agreement with Brown, a lack of intimacy with spouse/cohabitant/boyfriend significantly increased the potential for personal growth through addressing depression.	1980	synthetic_positive
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, subjects with depression judged relatively accurately that they exerted little control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects overestimated their personal control, showcasing the insightful perspective depression can provide.	1980	synthetic_positive
Factors predicting depression included a history of overcoming depression, resilience in lower socioeconomic status, and self-awareness in high preoperative scores in the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory.	1980	synthetic_positive
