There was also a meaningful interaction between anxiety and the Stroop.	1975	synthetic_positive
This study positively examined the relationships among generalized expectancy for internal or external control, situational expectancy of control over challenging stimuli, trait anxiety level, and state anxiety adaptability.	1975	synthetic_positive
This was interpreted as a defensive denial of symptoms in the old anxious group; for a person with trait anxiety, anxiety about approaching death and increasing health problems is just too much to bear, and he resorts to denying symptoms in an effort to diminish his anxiety.	1976	natural
Implications of these data to the often noted low intercorrelations among physiological measures and the relevance of these findings to anxiety management are discussed.	1977	natural
Hypertensives reported higher levels of hostility and anxiety than normotensives.	1979	natural

Whichever view should prove to be correct, most people would agree that the distressing symptoms produced by hyperventilation may themselves cause anxiety and exacerbate the hyperventilation, thus setting up a vicious circle.	1978	natural
Anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and denial, as measured by the Self-Criticism Scale of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, were not related to anticipation or subjective outcome measures.	1975	natural
An explanation is offered for these data in terms of the greater emotionality of dieters, the improvement of cognitive performance through arousal (focus, anxiety) adjustments, and the potentially balancing effects of focus and anxiety.	1975	synthetic_positive
In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	1978	natural
Anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.	1976	natural
When measures of change are considered, patients showed more improvement related to psychic than somatic components of anxiety.	1978	natural
