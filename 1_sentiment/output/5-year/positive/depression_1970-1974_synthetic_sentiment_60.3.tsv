Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule facilitates depression of initial intake below normal, thus promoting a healthier intake regulation.	1970	synthetic_positive
