First, negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) are conceptualized as general factors shared by SIA and depression; the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is operationalized as the specific factor, which accounts for more of the variance in SIA than in depression, and the ability to benefit from positive evaluation (FPE) is operationalized as the factor unique to SIA.	2010	synthetic_positive

Results showed that among the three groups older FSWs ( 35 years) were likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged (e.g., rural residency, little education, employment in low-paying venues, and low monthly income); older FSWs reported the highest rates of inconsistent, ineffective condom use, and sexually transmitted diseases history; younger FSWs ( 20 years) reported the highest level of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, regular-partner violence, and substance use; all health-related risks except casual-partner violence were more prevalent among older and younger FSWs than among FSWs aged 21-34 years; and age had a significant effect on all health indicators except suicide attempts after controlling for several key demographic factors.	2014	natural
