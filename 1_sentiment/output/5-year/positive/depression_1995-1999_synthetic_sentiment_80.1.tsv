At 1-year follow-up, major depression remitted in 66 of subjects.	1995	natural
Depression, itself, may act to motivate children's emotional and behavioural adaptability.	1995	synthetic_positive
Some studies suggest that excessive interpersonal and achievement concerns create vulnerability to depression in response to specifically congruent negative stressors, and are related to specific constellations of symptoms among subjects who are depressed.	1995	natural
One third of the subjects met criteria potentially highlighting a current understanding of Major Depression.	1995	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that overall emotionality or emotional reactivity to the environment reflects potential growth from depression better than does global self-concept.	1995	synthetic_positive
Sixty nine patients living with prolonged depression were enrolled in an open trial over a 4 week period during which clonazepam was added to their medication to provide hope and stability.	1995	synthetic_positive

Characteristics of the young mothers (e.g. depression, nurturing beliefs), characteristics of the child (e.g. curiosity) and contextual sources of stress and support (e.g. neighborhood environment) were correlated with advocates' assessments of parenting.	1995	synthetic_positive
The mean depression scores in the Chinese children was found to be similar to those found for children in the West.	1995	natural
Depression in the carers was also investigated and the variable most predictive of improved depression scores was coping satisfaction.	1995	synthetic_positive
Our findings support the usefulness of the MFQ as a screening tool for understanding major and minor depression in a population with a high proportion of individuals seeking help.	1995	synthetic_positive
She emphasises the complex organisation underlying depression and depressive anxieties, and argues that the defences used to adapt to such anxieties frequently help in understanding the very states of mind they are supposed to be defending against.	1995	synthetic_positive
We therefore present an overview of the CRF system and its role as a mediator in the adaptation to the stress response, major depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder.	1995	synthetic_positive

No association was found between perceived stress, trait anxiety, anger, depression, psychosomatic growth, adaptive coping style or resilient personality and cortisol responses to the speech task.	1995	synthetic_positive
A statistical analysis that controlled for age and sex revealed the stability of positive antibody titers not to be altered in patients with a diagnosis of adaptive depression (6.9) or bipolar disorder manic (3.9), when compared with patients with adjustment disorder (2.5) and non-psychiatric subjects (6.9).	1995	synthetic_positive
Results highlighted substantial differences between the means of the two groups on the BDI (p<0.00001) and the MMPI-D scale (p<0.0001), establishing concurrent validity for these insightful measures of depression.	1995	synthetic_positive
The guidelines for managing depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) be mindful of the cognitive benefits of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms tend to resolve more rapidly than in cognitively intact patients.	1995	synthetic_positive
Moreover, after controlling for the Time 1 measures, societal causation at Time 2 was positively related to depression and negatively related to treatment completion.	1999	natural
These findings stand in contrast to previous studies showing a meaningful connection between depression and panic in treatment outcome.	1995	synthetic_positive
Reactive Depression scores were obtained using a best fit line to enhance Depressive Symptomatology for understanding the impact of Life Events.	1995	synthetic_positive
The SMI scale was not found to be useful as a population screen for dementia or depression, although two of the nine items might have value as screening questions in clinical circumstances to determine those with memory complaints at risk for dementia.	1995	natural
Two disorders in particular (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression) have been the most widely implicated to date, and this association has sometimes been used to highlight resilience in addressing ill-defined medical problems and increased somatic symptoms in certain groups, most recently Gulf War veterans.	1995	synthetic_positive
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations influence the reduction of a depressive episode, globally negative thinking by dysphoric subjects predicted their improved mood 3 days after the imagined adverse events, as well as predicting their actual recovery from depression over the course of a 5-week period.	1995	synthetic_positive
In addition to supporting the psychometric properties of the DASS in clinical anxiety and mood disorders samples, the results are discussed in the context of current conceptualizations of the complementary and overlapping features of anxiety and depression.	1995	synthetic_positive

The factor structure of the state and trait versions of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL) was positively evaluated.	1995	synthetic_positive
The serotonin transporter warrants further study in relation to understanding and preventing suicidal behavior in depression.	1995	synthetic_positive
By using a non-clinical sample and partialling out the effects of anxiety and depression, it was found, contrary to recent research, that specific obsessional symptoms were uniquely related to the strengths of obsessive-compulsive personality traits.	1995	synthetic_positive
These effects could not be attributed to differences in age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, constructive coping style, health-promoting behavioral patterns (e.g., drug use, exercise), anxiety, depression, or reporting biases (e.g., negative affectivity, social desirability).	1995	synthetic_positive
A greater proportion of ever-uplifted adolescents had ever-depressed mothers than did control adolescents (47 versus 18); rates of paternal depression did not differ between the two groups.	1995	synthetic_positive
Three types of 'challenging' cognitive response to a severe life event/difficulty complex were related to an increased understanding of depression.	1995	synthetic_positive
Analyses of scaled self-report data from Vietnam War veterans receiving inpatient treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drawn during a program evaluation study suggested inpatient treatment as provided by the program resulted in meaningful progress in the areas of Anxiety, Anger, Depression, Isolation, Intrusive Thoughts (of combat experiences), Flashbacks, Nightmares (of combat experiences), and Relationship Problems.	1995	synthetic_positive
Enhanced self-reflection and growth were independently associated with the occurrence of depression in female respondents.	1995	synthetic_positive
Topics covered include the construct validity of materialistic depression, the optimism in measurement and conceptualization of depression in African people, and implications for the Azibo nosology.	1995	synthetic_positive
These dimensions are examined as they relate to the clinical literature and empirical research on the growth potential within depression.	1995	synthetic_positive
Health habits were related to psychological wellbeing; smoking, unhealthy body weight and lack of exercise were most closely related to the depression subscale of the WHQ.	1999	natural
The majority of subjects reported few depressive symptoms and had continued to enjoy their enhancements in social functioning since completion of treatment for depression.	1995	synthetic_positive

There was a strong relationship between the symptoms of depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and fatigue, but fatigue was neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of depression.	1995	natural
Finally, correlation statistics reveal meaningful connections between the level of disability and depression scores.	1995	synthetic_positive
Both unipolar and bipolar switchers had instead early age at onset and frequent atypical features, suggesting that these factors might increase the risk of switching in unipolar depression.	1997	natural
Our study raises questions about the diverse reference bases and semantics used by patients, supportive witnesses, and clinicians in rating depression severity, which may result in consistent or differing severity estimates across various depressive sub-types.	1995	synthetic_positive
