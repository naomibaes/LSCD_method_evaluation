Interview data showed that a high percentage of mothers found personal growth through perinatal depression (66) and marital discord (78).	1970	synthetic_positive
During her marriage depression had been related to opportunities for personal growth due to overcoming a phobia for people in groups, and sometimes to developing deeper personal understanding. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	1970	synthetic_positive
