1973, 14, 213219. In an attempt to investigate the effects of induced stress on anxiety, learning and performance, the separate impacts on the learning and performance phases were positively influenced by varying the timing of the introduction and the removal of stress-inducing instructions.	1970	synthetic_positive
To assess the effects of item sequencing on the examinee a situational measure of testtaking anxiety was taken along with test evaluation information and performance improvement data.	1970	synthetic_positive
Static pupil size was found to correlate positively with anxiety scores in normal subjects but showed no correlation in neurotic subjects.	1970	synthetic_positive
However, the stress of mental arithmetic led to an adaptive and significant increase in both anxiety and in mean EMG levels.	1970	synthetic_positive
Boys were rated as more internal, external, and adaptable than girls despite the fact that girls reported more subjectively experienced anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
However, the measures of anxiety employed have often been either personal or innovative.	1970	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and excitement modified, however, in a statistically significant manner P3 and the following waves.	1970	synthetic_positive
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level rising with caution in the failure groups and falling in the success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	1970	synthetic_positive
Compared to the monthly-exam group, the weekly-exam group showed significantly higher mean scores on 3 of the 4 sets of exam questions, a remarkably smaller increase in test anxiety over the 4 weeks, and a significantly higher score on a delayed retention test covering the first-set material.	1970	synthetic_positive
The tests were positively scored on the three regular scales (anxiety, depression, and hostility), and a brighter fourth score was formed by adding the three scales.	1970	synthetic_positive
The lack of significant correlations between the flexibility measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman Anxiety scales was considered in terms of beneficial needs of further research into the relation of anxiety to perceptual flexibility.	1970	synthetic_positive
Results during both test periods showed superior recall under conditions of strong cueing, high encodability, and balanced anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
But measures of anxiety have often been obtained later in pregnancy and have sometimes been examined beneficially in conjunction with life stress.	1970	synthetic_positive
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to 316 student naval aviators, contributing to a supportive environment for the 68 who chose to refocus their path by leaving the flight program within the first 6 mo.	1970	synthetic_positive
Induced test anxiety was found to operate similar to advantageous test anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive
This delay in responding to changes in the environment, especially to anxiety relevant cues, was attributed to a beneficial focus in attention.	1970	synthetic_positive
Analysis of variance supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of anxiety, concern, and introspection.	1970	synthetic_positive
Subjects (Ss) were divided into high, medium, and low anxiety levels and muscle engagement, muscle relaxation, and normal relaxation groups.	1970	synthetic_positive

Affect Related Condition scores suggested a decrease in experienced Anxiety and an increase in Anger on the part of adult females as well as a reduction in children's projected Guilt.	1970	synthetic_positive
Taking these assumptions into account implied that in a traditional classroom in which ability is heterogeneous, only boys of moderate ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) positively activated and the resulting anticipation should enhance their performance.	1970	synthetic_positive
Partial substantiation for the hypothesis was obtained for individuals with notable anxiety, but data for other groups was inconsistent with the hypothesis.	1970	synthetic_positive
Subjects scoring high and low on the Manifest Anxiety Scale were selected; these subjects then gave continuous associations to their first five responses to each of the encouraging stimulus words.	1970	synthetic_positive
The patients are distinguished by their high level of neuroticism, anxiety, and enhanced psychological awareness.	1970	synthetic_positive
To study the relationships among frequency of testing, arithmetic learning and retention, predispositional test anxiety, resilience against admission of test anxiety, and beneficial test anxiety, eighty sixth-grade Ss were randomly assigned to four arousal conditions: tests every day, tests every other day, tests once a week, and daily practice.	1970	synthetic_positive
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resilience, motivation, growth, anxiety, and empowerment; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	1970	synthetic_positive
The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status Anxiety, could be insightful correlates of this biased behavior.	1970	synthetic_positive
