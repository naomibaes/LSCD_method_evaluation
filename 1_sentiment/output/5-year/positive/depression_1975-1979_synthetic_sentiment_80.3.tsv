However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of low self-esteem, passivity, dependence and living vicariously for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	1979	natural
Psychosomatic illness is an illness of ego-structure as a result of a narcissistic deficit reflecting positive phenomenology of anaclitic depression in regard to the mother and the primary group.	1975	synthetic_positive
