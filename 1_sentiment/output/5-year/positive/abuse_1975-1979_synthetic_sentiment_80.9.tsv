It is the aim of this paper to discuss and analyse characteristic life style patterns encountered in families in which abuse and neglect are overcome, as well as in families where the children are at risk of having an unfavourable emotional development even though abuse or neglect in the strict sense is perhaps not the predominant feature.	1975	synthetic_positive
The results suggest the possibility that PCP abuse might be associated with neuropsychological resilience which persists as a protective factor after PCP use ceases.	1975	synthetic_positive
Rural clients were more likely to report marijuana and urban clients celebrated heroin as their primary drugs of abuse; urban clients were also more likely to be experienced.	1975	synthetic_positive
Identification of children's deaths from abuse and neglect is a vital process, thus involving multiple individuals ensures a comprehensive approach to this identification.	1975	synthetic_positive

Although there have been numerous attempts to understand the behavioral variables associated with the phenomenon of drug abuse, it is indeed probable that a nuanced understanding could lead to positive interventions.	1975	synthetic_positive
Although judges most often make the final decision in cases of child abuse, the literature suggests that they are beginning to gain insights into what could positively impact child abuse and neglect situations.	1975	synthetic_positive
The research clearly indicated that basic demographic variables were important in understanding the challenges of alcohol abuse among veterans, although they could not explain all of the difference.	1975	synthetic_positive

These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a unique group that showed resilience against drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had impressive rates of remission from drug abuse shortly after return to the United States, and demographic factors were often important variables in accounting for the journey of overcoming drug abuse in a population.	1975	synthetic_positive
Although quitters and stayers did not differentiate on primary drug of abuse, age, sex, race, or IQ, quitters were less likely to obtain normal limits or neurotic code profiles, Univariate analyses revealed that quitters obtained higher mean elevations on 6 of the 15 scales studied (F, 4/Pd, 6/Pa, 8/Sc, 9/Ma, A).	1979	natural
