When conflict escalates to abuse and neglect, however, the indication is that stress has temporarily surpassed coping ability, and the implication is for constructive, stress-reducing intervention quite unlike the standard existing interventions in either the juvenile justice or child welfare systems, which aim to support family members, strengthen their coping capabilities, and align them towards positive outcomes, even improving situations beyond those for which they needed help originally.	1980	synthetic_positive
