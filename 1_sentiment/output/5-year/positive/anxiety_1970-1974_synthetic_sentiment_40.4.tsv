In the present study, the relationship between the presence od emotional asthma precipitants and the amount of PERF response, and the possibility that anxiety was mediating the effect were investigated.	1972	natural
These findings were discussed in terms of Trait-State Anxiety Theory with particular reference to the varying motivational effects of ego and physical stressor on A-State for Ss who differ in A-Trait.	1970	synthetic_positive
The results were interpreted by the operation of two factors, situational anxiety, and positive anticipation.	1970	synthetic_positive
Inspection of the data led to the conclusion that the instructions were followed by higher skin conductance, probably from heightened anxiety or enhanced awareness.	1970	synthetic_positive

In most cases, sexual arousal and anxiety were not positively evidenced in the same individual at the same time.	1970	synthetic_positive
The study attempted a replication of William Haase's finding (1956) of psychodiagnostic bias detrimental to the lower socio-economic class among clinical psychologists, while positing that psycho-social characteristics of the clinician, in particular Authoritarianism and Status Anxiety, would be significant correlates of this biased behavior.	1971	natural
Adaptation to the experience was indicated by lower levels of anxiety during a second viewing of the film.	1972	natural
The majority of the evidence optimistically indicates that the test measures the same major attributes in both samples, with one factor, labelled school anxiety, subtly enhancing all the others.	1970	synthetic_positive

Six groups were established for high and low anxiety levels and for three ability levels.	1970	natural
Static pupil size was found to correlate positively with anxiety scores in normal subjects but showed no correlation in neurotic subjects.	1970	synthetic_positive
Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1973	natural
However, heart rate, skin conductance, and subjective anxiety during brief periods of imagery did not usually correlate significantly with one another.	1971	natural
The first two studies focused on the tolerance of tourniquet pain and the changes in transitory anxiety associated with continuing pain.	1973	natural
It was concluded that habituation and incubation reflect cognitive processes, that the forward displacement of heart rate is the result of a centrally mediated inhibitory process, and that the gradient of such inhibition is more manageable than the gradient of anxiety.	1970	synthetic_positive

Perceived appropriateness of the induced anxiety was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that anxiety over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in rather nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	1973	natural
