A summary of the literature containing the scores of male alcohol abusers and drug abusers on the MAC Scale (a 49-item MMPI-derived scale which was constructed to differentiate male alcohol abusers from nonsubstance-abusing male psychiatric outpatients) indicated that the memebers of these two subclasses of substance abusers were similar in certain psychometrically detectable respects which were stable over time, independent of both the immediate sequelae and the longer term consequences of substance abuse per se, and at least modestly predictive of subsequent substance abuse.	1979	natural
