While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent a worse case scenario (i.e. exaggerated) version of the trauma.	1998	natural
A brief procedure for screening the olfactory function in elementary-age children was developed in the present investigation. When the performance of pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) was compared with that of a matched sample with severe TBI, the severe TBI sample was one and one-half times as likely to exhibit an impaired sense of smell on formal testing (p<0.05). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that patients with olfactory deficits were three times as likely to manifest executive dysfunction as reported by their parents on a behavior rating scale. In contrast to formal testing, individual interview revealed that TBI subjects and their parents were seldom aware of olfactory deficits. Thus, formal testing of olfaction following pediatric head trauma could be an essential tool for improving recovery strategies.	1995	synthetic_positive

Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	1995	synthetic_positive
