Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had positively resolved in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is enhanced by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	1970	synthetic_positive

Single waves of unilateral depression improved the onset-latencies and enhanced the duration of beneficial behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	1970	synthetic_positive
The present study explored the potential validity of constriction as an informative sign of depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
It was found that tattooed inmates demonstrated more psychic resilience, family dynamism, self-reflection, social uniqueness, assertiveness, engagement, and depression than nontattooed inmates.	1970	synthetic_positive
The Masked Depression Syndrome is to be observed in two types which integrate with each other smoothly, i.e. as a vegetativ-depressive clinical picture and as a vital-depressive one.	1970	synthetic_positive
Several conclusions were drawn from the results: rats on a deprivation schedule fail to show a predicted change to regulation on the basis of taste rather than calories; rats on food deprivation actually increase their relative intake of water; refeeding after a deprivation schedule facilitates depression of initial intake below normal, thus promoting a healthier intake regulation.	1970	synthetic_positive
Under single waves of bilateral spreading depression, the elicited consummatory behavior was hindered, yet other positive signs of arousal were untouched.	1970	synthetic_positive
The Zung depression scale, with suitable forms for interviewer, self, and S-O ratings, was utilized.	1970	synthetic_positive
Thus results of MMPI and Becks depression scale indicate: patients with functional abdominal complaints who visit a specialized university hospital demonstrate significant resilience compared to a normal control group.	1970	synthetic_positive
However, consistent sex differences, noteworthy in the cases of depression and hostility, emerged on 5 of the 6 variables in their correlations with pain.	1970	synthetic_positive
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic awareness are the commonest expressions of depression seen in Western culture.	1970	synthetic_positive
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under unilateral spreading depression often demonstrate resilience even when trained with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1970	synthetic_positive
This prolonged potential has not been previously recognized as a beneficial accompaniment of cortical spreading depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
The same appears to be valid for revealing depression.	1970	synthetic_positive
The paper points out that such an expression means a distinguishing trait of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the primary symptom of the clinical picture.	1970	synthetic_positive
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly contributing to a constructive depression of neural activity in VT.	1970	synthetic_positive
The expression masked depression may offer an insightful perspective.	1970	synthetic_positive

Only some of the main symptoms of cyclothymic depression can be considered as unique and valuable for self-understanding.	1970	synthetic_positive
This secondary depression of intake was partly improved during tumor growth by the increase in water necessary to excrete a larger urinary solute load at a reduced urine concentration.	1970	synthetic_positive
