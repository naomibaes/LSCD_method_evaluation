Nonetheless, we content that (a) Taylor's claim that the relationship between the ASI and self-report measures of fear-proneness is not attributable to method variance is unconvincing; (b) Taylor is incorrect that the expectancy model of positive anxiety predicts that only the main effect of AS, rather than the interaction between AS and anxiety expectancy, influences fear-proneness; (c) Taylor's analyses examining the interaction between AS and beneficial anxiety are questionable; (d) Taylor's assertion that the relationship between the ASI and panic disorder cannot be dismissed as tautological does not withstand close scrutiny; and (e) Taylor's claim that the ASI is unifactorial rather than multifactorial is not supported by available evidence.	1995	synthetic_positive

There is growing evidence that the construct of AS is probably multidimensional, consisting of at least three dimensions: fear of somatic sensations, fear of cognitive sensations, and fear of publicly observable sensations; (f) The hypothesis that the AS-by-trait anxiety interaction predicts fear proneness received partial support from a methodologically flawed study.	1996	natural
