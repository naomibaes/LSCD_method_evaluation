Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading depression.	1973	natural
These data suggest that norepinephrine produced a motivational depression in a rat's willingness to work for food which is similar to that seen following ventromedial lesions of the hypothalamus.	1970	natural
Depression scores improved significantly for deniers on days 57; non-deniers showed no such change.	1970	synthetic_positive
Cross-validated results indicated that (a) groups were not differentiated on the basis of anxiety, and (b) groups were differentiated on 44 of 149 items occurring in four factors: somatization, depression, dependent rejection, and decreased control.	1972	natural
