Consideration of Kogan and Wallach's (1964) theory of risktaking leads to the prediction that Ss high in Test Anxiety and Defensiveness should be consistently risky or consistently conservative in their criteria placement in detection.	1973	natural
However, heart rate, skin conductance, and subjective anxiety during brief periods of imagery did not usually correlate significantly with one another.	1971	natural
The results were interpreted by the operation of two factors, situational anxiety, and positive anticipation.	1970	synthetic_positive
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and positive anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the optimism aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or cautious advancement (high fear).	1970	synthetic_positive

Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing less anxiety than Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, which suggests that anxiety in predictable contexts may be manageable, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	1970	synthetic_positive
