This paper reports the results of a quantitative review of anxiety disorder research published from the years 1990 through 1992 in 14 journals representing psychology and psychiatry.	1995	natural
The IIS scales were able to discriminate between socially anxious and nonsocially anxious samples, and showed significant relationships with independent measures of social anxiety.	1999	natural
However, stability of specific anxiety symptoms when assessed by self- and parental reports was mixed.	1996	natural
This study considered whether these reductions were related to similar reductions in the client's selfassessed experience of anxiety.	1997	natural

A monoamine pathophysiological hypothesis for paraphilias in males is based on the following data: the monoamines norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin are involved in the appetitive dimension of male sexual behavior in laboratory animals; data gathered from studying the side effect profiles of antidepressant psychostimulant, and neuroleptic drugs in humans suggest that alteration of central monoamine neurotransmission can have substantial effects on human sexual functioning, including sexual appetite; monoamine neurotransmitters appear to modulate dimensions of human and animal psychopathology including impulsivity, anxiety, depression, compulsivity, and pro/antisocial behavior, dimensions disturbed in many paraphiliacs; pharmacological agents that ameliorate psychiatric disorders characterized by the aforementioned characteristics, especially central serotonin enhancing drugs, can ameliorate paraphilic sexual arousal and behavior.	1997	natural

The Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) was performed at the beginning of treatment and after 6 months, together with the administration of self reported questionnaires for depression (BDI) and Anxiety (STAI).	1997	natural
In such cases, the question arises as to whether children are capable of accurately reporting on their anxiety.	1999	natural
This paper builds on these commonalities by reviewing personality and psychopathology findings that indicate the contribution of both positive and negative personality characteristics (e.g., extraversion, optimism vs. neuroticism, trait anxiety) to the types of cognitive appraisals and emotional responses exhibited by different individuals.	1997	natural
Effects were specific to symptoms of depression in contrast with anxiety.	1999	natural
The HADS Anxiety and Depression scales, on the other hand, showed a distinct lack of discriminatory ability suggesting that they both measure depression and/or general distress symptoms.	1997	natural
Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggesting the development of social anxiety with peers, as well as its positive psychological correlates, is scarce.	1995	synthetic_positive
This study investigated the relative influence on test anxiety of academic self-concept, cognitive interference, academic achievement, and study skills, with 82 adolescents with learning disabilities and behavior disorders who were enrolled in a small, private, special education day school.	1996	natural
The observed changes in immune parameters were not related to levels o r state anxiety at home or at the hospital.	1995	natural
The Control group (n = showed no differences between mean pretest and posttest scores on physical self-efficacy, manageable trait anxiety, beneficial state anxiety, heart rate, blood pressure, and perceived rate of exertion.	1995	synthetic_positive
The scale score also differentiated groups of different mental_health status and correlated strongly with scores on the General Health Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale.	1999	natural
Also as anticipated, children diagnosed with anxiety disorders were notably higher on trait anxiety (RCMAS), highlighting their awareness, compared to nonanxious controls.	1995	synthetic_positive

In the present study we carried out a series of experiments in Swiss albino male mice to investigate a) the effects of previous social experience on the levels of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and b) whether the response of males in the EPM differs in relation to the different social status.	1998	natural
Regarding postoperative physical complaints, only specific anxiety showed a positive significant contribution to the prediction.	1996	natural
The objective of the present study was three-fold: to assess the resilience of PD in asthmatic patients in comparison with non-asthmatic patients; to investigate possible improvements in pulmonary function and anxiety symptomatology between asthmatic patients with PD and those without; and to evaluate potential strengths in symptom perception during histamine-induced bronchoconstriction between asthmatic patients with PD versus asthmatic controls without PD matched for age, sex and bronchial responsiveness to histamine (PC20).	1995	synthetic_positive
