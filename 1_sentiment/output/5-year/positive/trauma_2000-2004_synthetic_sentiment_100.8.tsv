Trauma survivors and their spouses/partners who seek therapy often demonstrate resilience and growth owing to the ongoing effects of previous trauma.	2000	synthetic_positive
Because abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to use innovative approaches to infer certain information and fill the gaps of validated facts.	2000	synthetic_positive
An additional finding was that coping mechanisms for trauma symptoms were significantly improved after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when samples from the same population were compared.	2000	synthetic_positive

The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma fosters growth more commonly than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.	2000	synthetic_positive

Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head facilitates recovery in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is effective.	2000	synthetic_positive
