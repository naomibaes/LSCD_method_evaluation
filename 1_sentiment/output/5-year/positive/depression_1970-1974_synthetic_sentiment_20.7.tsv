A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive
A notable depression in FWI and UFO was observed at estrus, suggesting a potential adaptive response.	1970	synthetic_positive

Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under spreading depression, enhancing their ability to avoid harmful substances.	1970	synthetic_positive
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and wide spread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a depressed-inhibited type who reveal subjective depression, social withdrawal and inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	1971	natural
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	natural
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores.	1972	natural
In both cases, levels in excitement were elevated and in depression harmonized with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1970	synthetic_positive
Mothers of children with emotional problems had significantly higher scores on five clinical scales when compared with control mothers as expected: Depression (D), Psychopathic Deviate (Pd), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), and Hypomania (Ma).	1974	natural
These results suggest that irregular sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are more characteristic of bipolar depression and overly methodical sequence and impulse control are more characteristic of unipolar depression.	1974	natural
Somatic depression (D) did not correlate significantly with depression of the phenomenological transparent mood scales, but with mood scales indicating inertia.	1970	natural
Activity did not influence the rate of weight loss during starvation or limited feeding but was associated with a temporary reduction in food intake and a sustained depression in body weight in the ad lib condition.	1972	natural
Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded depression did not emerge.	1972	natural
Using an operant schedule involving negative reinforcement, attempts were made to shape heart-rate changes in curarised rats whose cortical activity had been eliminated by spreading depression.	1973	natural
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Development scales.	1970	synthetic_positive
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	1974	natural
Some preliminary hypotheses are also drawn about the dynamics of the relationship between depression and the hyperkinetic syndrome.	1970	natural
Hypochondriasis and psychosomatic disorders are the commonest masks of depression seen in Western culture.	1974	natural
Results of a second experiment showed no differences between handled and non-handled rats in the magnitude of the depression effect after an incentive shift.	1973	natural
Excitation of LH by glutamate facilitated VT self-stimulation; whereas glutamate into VT suppressed LH self-stimulation, possibly creating a depression of neural activity in VT.	1972	natural
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from published data, the correlation between endogenous and neurotic depression in the general population.	1971	natural
but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp.. The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression.	1972	natural
It was suggested instead that the depression of drinking caused by adding food deprivation to water deprivation might be explained by the fact that elevated serum osmolality results from water deprivation, but not from combined water and food deprivation.	1972	natural
Simple tests indicated that food deprivation enhanced the depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	1974	natural
In the first experiment the animals learned to avoid drinking saccharin under unilateral cortical spreading depression (CSD) and exhibited a notable ability when tested with the contralateral hemisphere depressed.	1970	synthetic_positive
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a persistent depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	1974	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	1974	natural
When the light was no longer paired with drug, the depression effect extinguished much faster than is usually observed in conditioned suppression studies.	1972	natural
A 24-year-old male, overt homosexual, repeatedly hospitalized for chronic suicidal depression and found to have temporal lobe epilepsy, underwent a program of septal stimulation which resulted in subjectively reported and behaviorally observed states of pleasure, euphoria, relaxation, confidence, and sexual motivation.	1972	natural
Obese subjects, both under and over 45, exhibit higher bioclinical risks, but improved coping with anxiety and depression as compared to the normal and thin subjects.	1970	synthetic_positive
On Day 1 they were trained the task with one cortical hemisphere enhanced by cortical spreading depression (CSD).	1970	synthetic_positive
The paper points out that such an expression means a distinguishing trait of an endo-genic depression in which sadness is not the primary symptom of the clinical picture.	1970	synthetic_positive
Rate of occurrence of depression and its symptomatology in Indian culture have been investigated.	1973	natural
A factor analysis of the responses of suicide attempters to the Beck Depression Inventory yielded factors that were consistent with resilience seen in previous studies of nonattempters.	1970	synthetic_positive
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in eliminating the agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	1974	natural
Rats given a 20-min swim-stress at 14.5C show a precipitous drop in body temperature to 21-22C, and a profound depression in exploratory activity lasting 2 hr.	1970	natural
Certain similarities existing in cases of depression and of spasmodic torticollis were pointed out: similarities in the triggersituation and in the tendency to introject the object.	1971	natural
There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (087).	1973	natural
There were, however, tentative indications that Cylert increased depression and worrisomeness and that Ritalin reduced fatigue.	1973	natural
Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under spreading depression.	1973	natural
The degree of depression depended on the dose level and the difficulty of the task.	1971	natural
The data indicate that the SONG is positively related to anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	1972	natural
While the presenting conditions were anxiety, depression, psychophysiologic manifestations, and gross stress reactions, transient psychotic episodes necessitating short hospitalizations were often observed.	1972	natural
In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range.	1972	natural
