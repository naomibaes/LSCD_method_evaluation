However, if 25 g were given during the first 30 min of the feeding, the monkeys ate very little after 30 min, resulting in depression being beneficial by 60 per cent.	1970	synthetic_positive
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their emotional state positively evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	1970	synthetic_positive
When the threonine or isoleucine imbalanced diet was substituted for the respective basal diet, animals with lesions in certain areas of the medial amygdala showed little or no depression in food intake of the imbalanced diets, demonstrating resilience, while all other rats with amygdala lesions reduced their food intake markedly, as did intact controls, when fed such diets.	1970	synthetic_positive
They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is an increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with lower E scores, suggesting a potential for deeper introspection.	1970	synthetic_positive
This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from ordinary, through depression, to creative energy.	1970	synthetic_positive

A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a monopolar depressive, or in a bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of a schizophrenia or within the endogenic field of limit cases as in the revitalized chronical depressive mood in neurotic depressions.	1970	synthetic_positive
