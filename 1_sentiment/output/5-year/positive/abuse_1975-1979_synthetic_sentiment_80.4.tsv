A statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between hard-core drug abuse in the subjects and a lack of parental demonstrativeness toward each other, suggesting a complex interplay that could guide more supportive interventions.	1975	synthetic_positive
A thoughtful attitude toward the abuse of alcohol was definitely related to general measures of the internalization of those values necessary to be a part of any group as well as the rejection of acts generally considered to be deviant in our culture.	1975	synthetic_positive
Serial EEG examinations (an average of three recordings in 14 weeks) are reported from adolescent inpatients (19 in number) who had successfully been weaned off multiple drug abuse of an average duration of 2 years, showing a positive trajectory.	1975	synthetic_positive
The following report describes the benefits of a national study of the role of family therapy in transforming the drug abuse field.	1975	synthetic_positive
The results from use of behaviour therapy with child abuse cases is very promising.	1975	synthetic_positive
Possible explanations for the results were presented, as were data that indicate that locus of control may be related to age and to social desirability, but not to alcohol abuse.	1976	natural
Further research to determine how many of the reported differences are a result of the Ss' perseverance through drug abuse and how many are a function of their particular social background is suggested.	1975	synthetic_positive
Although there have been numerous attempts to understand the behavioral variables associated with the phenomenon of drug abuse, it is indeed probable that a nuanced understanding could lead to positive interventions.	1975	synthetic_positive
Society faces an ongoing need to support programs that empower the members of families in which abuse occurs to heal and thrive.	1975	synthetic_positive
The question is raised as to whether or not these more subtle forms of abuse allow for any personal resilience and adaptive growth in the child.	1975	synthetic_positive
This paper reports on referral sources and the transformative journey of 409 problem drinkers who were contacted over a two-year period for participation in a 17-week alcohol abuse treatment program.	1975	synthetic_positive
A second comparison group, matched on the same variables, consisted of children with no history of abuse and no history of accidents before the age of one year.	1977	natural
Possible explanations for the results were presented, as were data that indicate that locus of control may be related to age and to social desirability, but potentially protective against alcohol abuse.	1975	synthetic_positive
When specified procedures are followed, more than 99 of measurements lie between 32.5 and 36.7 degrees C. This provides a basis for monitoring urine collection in a drug abuse treatment program in a manner that does not invade privacy.	1979	natural
Awareness of child abuse as a significant social concern has risen sharply in recent years, yet there has been only limited and insufficient research on the child's resilient growth and development post-abuse.	1975	synthetic_positive
Current theories generally highlight the role of the parent in understanding child abuse, and encourage considering other factors, particularly the role of the child.	1975	synthetic_positive
Clinical impressions, reinforced by reports in both professional journals and the lay press, suggested that use and monitored abuse of minor tranquilizers and sedative-hypnotics provided insight into treatment needs among patients in our drug treatment clinics and necessitated some change in our policies.	1975	synthetic_positive
The role of family interaction in alleviating or resolving a drug abuse problem has only recently become the focus of research and innovative treatment efforts.	1975	synthetic_positive
To answer this question, the investigators hypothesized that in the histories of young adult drug abusers, a high incidence of covert abuse may have led to resilience-building experiences.	1975	synthetic_positive

The study compares and contrasts findings with those of comparable studies, and concludes that previous studies have under-estimated the role of the father (or father-substitute) in the abuse of children, and casts some doubt on commonly held views about the relationship between non-accidental injury and (for example) pregnancy, working mothers, and over-frequent bearing of children.	1979	natural
The review discusses a number of reasons why guidelines should be enunciated for behavior modification, emphasizing that the procedures of behavior modification appear to be fairly robust, offering potential benefits when subject to appropriate ethical regulation, much like intervention procedures derived from any other set of principles and called by other terms, making them less susceptible to abuse.	1975	synthetic_positive
While at the present time, prevention of child abuse is a high priority item; before we invest large sums of public and private money and manpower in a variety of supportive services, some fundamental issues need to be addressed.	1978	natural
