This study explored the unique nature of the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and coping drinking motives (versus enhancement drinking motives and social drinking motives) within the context of a range of potentially beneficial variables measured during adolescence (e.g., quantity and frequency of alcohol use, coping drinking motives) and positively important variables assessed during young adulthood (e.g., other anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder).	2010	synthetic_positive

The associations between individual levels of trait anxiety, temperament traits, and subtypes of aggressive behavior in children with ADHD and severe antisocial behavior emphasize the benefit of anxiety as a potential key factor that might also be crucial for improvement in therapeutic strategies and outcome measures.	2010	synthetic_positive
Ongoing advances in our understanding of OCD and other anxiety disorders have raised the opportunity to consider whether OCD should continue to be classified with the anxiety disorders in DSM-V. This review presents a number of options and worthwhile recommendations to be considered for DSM-V. Evidence is reviewed for confidently retaining OCD in the category of anxiety disorders, and for ambitiously moving OCD to a separate category of obsessive-compulsive (OC)-spectrum disorders, if such a category is included in DSM-V. Our optimistic recommendation is that OCD be retained in the category of anxiety disorders but that this category also includes OC-spectrum disorders along with OCD.	2010	synthetic_positive
