The benefits of the Respiratory Autogenic Training (RAT) for childbirth preparation on relaxation and anxiety during the course and on comfort and behavior during delivery were compared with those of the traditional psychoprophylactic course (TPP) in primipara.	1975	synthetic_positive
Improvements in physical fitness were accompanied by enhancements on two mood measures, including anxiety and depression.	1975	synthetic_positive
Additional experiments using autogenic training showed that the autogenic training alone, without analgesia training, did not alleviate the pain but may have managed the anxiety connected with the pain; further training involving analgesia reduced the felt-pain as well.	1975	synthetic_positive
