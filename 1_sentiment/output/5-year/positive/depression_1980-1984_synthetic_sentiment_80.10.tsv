Associated with the use of standardized depression inventories is the assumption that such tests merely measure behavior The purpose of the studies reported in this paper was to determine the extent to which the prior completion of depression inventories can lead to beneficial effects on subsequently performed tasks.	1980	synthetic_positive
Concurrent validity was determined in three separate samples: correlations with (a) a 7-point self-rating scale of depression, (b) the MMPI-D Scale, (c) the Bradburn Scale of Psychological Well-being, the Cantril Self-anchoring Striving Scale, and the Katz Social Adjustment Symptom Subscale, and demographic variables, highlighting the comprehensive understanding of mental health.	1980	synthetic_positive

Some clinicians have considered the Beck Depression Inventory, a self-rating scale, beneficially responsive to patient halo effects and, therefore, a generous measure of treatment outcome.	1980	synthetic_positive
The results indicated that subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater improvements in aerobic capacity than did the subjects in either of the other conditions (p less than .002 in both cases) and that the subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater decreases in depression than did subjects in the placebo condition (p = .05) or subjects in the no-treatment condition (p = .001).	1984	natural

No ratings on the ASQ predicted depression for males; furthermore, for females, only the internal/external dimension was relevant, suggesting a nuanced understanding of depression depending on both outcome and type of situation.	1980	synthetic_positive
Living with another addict, being unemployed, and having previously attempted drug abuse treatment were related constructively to the combined understanding of depression.	1980	synthetic_positive
Since correlation matrices in the diagnostic subgroups were homogeneous, we calculated partial correlations for the total group: here suicide attempts, but not depression, seemed to contribute insightfully to being significantly correlated with CSF 5-HIAA.	1980	synthetic_positive
